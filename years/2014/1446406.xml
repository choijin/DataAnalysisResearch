<AbstractNarration>This project addresses career-life-balance (CLB) barriers that confront tenured associated professors who have not been promoted. UMBC will develop and implement a pilot project designed to determine if an intensive post-family leave two-year acceleration plan embedded within an aggressive career-life balance institutional integration campaign (which encompasses graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty) will create the necessary conditions to impact progress toward professor status for an identified cohort of 16 women associate professors. In addition to the development of a post-family leave reintegration model, eight seminars and community building workshops will be held to create a campus culture that is deeply and demonstrably committed to work-life integration in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance: This project will employ an integrative pathway approach to work-like balance support that will be representative of a comprehensive CLB initiative of coordinated CLB principles, policies, resources, and practices. The model will help re-define the view of career so that it includes, rather than excludes, one's personal life.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Career-Life Balance initiative for the University of Maryland Baltimore County included three projects. PROJECT 1: &ldquo;<strong><em>Accelerating Post-Leave Associate Professor, Advancement through Intensive Support at Critical Junctures&rdquo;</em></strong> targeted women associate professors in science, engineering, and the social sciences who have been in rank for seven years or less and have previously utilized a family support plan or have current demonstrated family support need.&nbsp; Eight &ldquo;Acceleration Plans&rdquo; were funded, allowing the awarded faculty opportunities for course releases, research assistance, and the services of a writing coach. In 2016-2017, the faculty who received the targeted infusions collectively produced more than 40 journal papers, conference papers, and book chapters. For that year, there were $1.6 million in grants awarded to the faculty who were part of Project 1. The faculty also gave several invited presentations at national meetings. International presentations were made in London, Denmark, and British Columbia. These career advancements for 2016-2017 were accomplished by Dr. Maricel Kann (Biology), Dr. Jennie Leach (Chemical, Biochemical, and Environmental Engineering), Dr. Bambi Chapin (Sociology), Dr. Vandeana Janeja (Information Systems), Dr. Rachel Brewster (Biology), Dr. Anita Komlodi (Human-centered Computing), and Dr. Lina Zhou (Information Systems).</p> <p>Faculty also expressed pride in mentoring and graduating students (including having students as co-authors), having their students present at prestigious international conferences, and recruiting new graduate students to their research groups. In areas of leadership and advancement, Dr. Brewster accepted a leadership role as the Co-Director of the Meyerhoff Graduate Fellows Program, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Brewster is the first co-director in the new structure of the Meyerhoff Graduate Program which just received 5 years of additional funding. In 2017, Dr. Bambi Chapin became the inaugural speaker for the Robert H. Deluty series on Career-Life Balance for Graduate Students. Her role in this project facilitated the invitation. Dr. Sreedevi Sampath (Information Systems) had increased leadership and section chairperson roles in national conferences between 2015 and 2017, particularly in international conferences of the ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) in Spain (2016), and the IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation in Tokyo (ICST, 2017). She has also been named workshop chair for ICST 2019 in China. Dr. Lina Zhou had several publications, but co-authored a particular publication examining issues of career-life balance: Y. Liu and L. Zhou (2017), The Dynamics of Work-family Conflict: A Social Media Analytics Approach, Communications of the ACM, 60(6), June, 66-70. Dr. Zhou was promoted for full professor in 2017.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>PROJECT 2<em> </em>was designed to<strong><em> &ldquo;Establish a robust institutional CLB culture for graduate student, post-doctoral scholar, and faculty success.&rdquo; </em></strong>UMBC was able to share the term &ldquo;career-life balance&rdquo; widely across campus, through a series of workshops, seminars, online awareness campaigns, campus announcements, and print materials. A strong catalyst for the awareness campaign was building connections with the Vice President of Human Resources to optimize efforts. The Department of Human Resources (HR) had print materials and was simultaneously working on options for child-care, resources for staff, and a complete &ldquo;Wellness&rdquo; initiative. This project included collaboration between the Office of the Provost and the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs, The Graduate School, and the Department of Human Resources. Special efforts were made to be sure that the campus was aware of family leave policies for faculty such as: A minimum assured period of paid parental leave of eight (8) weeks; One year extension of the time for tenure review for new parents, leave and support options, e.g., Collegially Supported Leave: Faculty members&rsquo; academic responsibilities covered by colleagues, on a voluntary basis, for a period of time; Redistribution of Duties: Adjustment of faculty members&rsquo; responsibilities among teaching, service, and research, Family and Medical Leave: Leave guaranteed by the federal government for a life-changing event (birth, adoption, or serious health condition); Development of an individualized &ldquo;Family Support Plan;&rdquo; and Workload modifications, to the extent authorized by the institution and feasible within the faculty member&rsquo;s department. This Career-Life Balance project served as a catalyst for a major policy shift: family leave for graduate assistants.</p> <p>PROJECT 3 included <strong><em>designing seminars and community building workshops to promote CLB and create communities of practice.</em></strong> The project supported workshops on career-life balance portfolios, career-life balance &ldquo;corners&rdquo; &ndash; workshops where graduate students could come to work on career-life balance plans, and sessions that brought groups together to work on publications that included discussions of the importance of career-life balance. The project also supported online discussions and webinars via Twitter that brought in online coaches and discussants to keep the concept of &ldquo;Career-Life Balance&rdquo; in the minds of research community.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 12px;">Important outcomes of the project include CLB mentoring across ranks, regular reminders by the campus community to researchers to &ldquo;remember career-life balance,&rdquo; and encouragement take advantage of benefits such as vacation days, personal days, and family leave.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified:
