<AbstractNarration>This program will develop a better understanding of the way in which fuel for star formation settles into the galactic disk of the Milky Way from the intergalactic medium. This goal will be accomplished through the use of survey data from the Arecibo Observatory that helps trace the location of gas in and near our Milky Way galaxy. Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students.  The project will have a direct impact on society through a program that brings astronomers into diverse middle schools throughout New York City. The goal is to inspire students at a juncture where they often choose to turn towards or away from science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Putman and her students will construct a multiphase map of the interface between the disk and halo of the Milky Way through the combination of a catalog of clouds from the GALFA-HI Survey, examination of their dust content, and comparisons to models and multi-wavelength observational data. The process of cooling at the disk-halo interface will be explored, as well as the interplay between accretion and feedback in controlling the star formation rate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Galaxies need star formation fuel to continue forming stars.   We idenitified inflowing star formation fuel by examining the structure and kinematics of the gas close to the star forming disk of the galaxy, an area that is difficult to study.   For the small spiral galaxy M33, we have found a significant inflow of fuel, one of the first findings of significant inflow to a galaxy.  For the Milky Way, we have found the gas at low velocities is not confined to a extended disk layer, but surrounds the Milky Way.  The structure of a Galaxy's interstellar medium reveals important information about the dominant physical mechanisms.  The hydrogen fibers revealed by the Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI (GALFA-HI) survey depict the structure of the Galactic magnetic field at high latitude and can be used to remove the foreground Galactic polarization for cosmology experiments.  The smallest galaxies in existence are also predicted to be the most abundant.   They can be hard to detect due to their corresponding small luminosity.  We have detected new dwarf galaxies using the gas within them as the starting point.  The properties of these galaxies help to define the starting stage for all galaxies.  The data products of the GALFA-HI Survey provide the most detailed map of the high latitude Galactic sky to date. These data are available to the public and are a resource for scientists across the world.        Last Modified: 02/20/2019       Submitted by: Mary E Putman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
