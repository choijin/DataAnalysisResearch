<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award prepares Ph.D. students at the University of Southern Mississippi with the competencies to address grand materials challenges of 21st Century ranging from pharmaceuticals to energy.  This traineeship will provide students with interdisciplinary skills needed in industrial, academic, and national laboratories to drive American competitiveness in advanced materials innovation.  The program transcends the divide that currently exists across experimental, theoretical, and computational scientists to train a new cadre of scientists and engineers capable of leading the data-driven design of materials in biolubrication, biomaterials, and renewable energy.  Through internships and training opportunities, trainees will develop exceptional content knowledge and scientific skills, with honed professional skills, with readiness to communicate science with a wide audience, including K-12 students.  This traineeship also seeks to increase the participation and retention of women and underrepresented minorities in doctoral programs by strong linkages with effective programs and organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central research theme of this NRT program is complex interfaces of polymeric materials.   Faculty from polymer science and engineering, chemistry and biochemistry, and physics, as well as staff scientists from national labs and industrial partners, will co-advise trainees in a multidisciplinary team environment.  Trainees will engage in both computational and experimental research projects related to bioinspired interfaces, biomaterials interfaces, and charge transport at interfaces.  The education program is designed to provide trainees with hands-on access and training in computational and experimental research tools, to encourage critical analysis of the state of literature, and to identify unmet research challenges.  Trainees will also receive extensive training in professional skills such as project management, problem solving, conflict resolution, high performance teams, business etiquette, research ethics, and oral and written communication via a series of professional development workshops.  As a final element, trainees will participate in internship opportunities designed for exposure to multiple career paths in academia, industry, national labs, and government policy.</AbstractNarration>

As outcomes from bootcamp, trainees were provided with tools to 1) define their individual strengths, 2) define their individual personality and communication styles, 3) build goal-definition, project planning, and time management skills, 4) understand team dynamics, conflict resolution, and negotiation strategies, 5) communicate effectively to different audiences, and 6) promote their ideas and research.
