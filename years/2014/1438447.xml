<AbstractNarration>1438477&lt;br/&gt;Cunningham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAGER: Fungal Bioleaching for Recovery of Lithium and Cobalt from Spent Lithium-Ion &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most personal electronic devices (telephones, computers, cameras, MP3 players, etc.) now employ rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, as do electric and hybrid-electric vehicles. The demand for lithium and cobalt to supply these batteries has grown markedly in recent years, to the point where demand may soon exceed available supply. Simultaneously, because rechargeable Li-ion batteries have a finite lifetime, the rate at which these batteries enter the solid waste stream is growing, and will continue to grow in the coming decades. From the standpoint of environmental sustainability, a method for recovering Li and Co from spent Li-ion batteries is therefore required. This project will serve multiple purposes for meeting growing demand for Li and Co, creating a market for the "waste" product of spent batteries (thereby keeping them out of landfills), and reducing environmental harm incurred by mining of virgin Li and Co. Traditional or pyrometallurgical methods for recovering metals from wastes (spent catalysts, spent batteries, ash, etc.) typically emit toxic gases as by-products. Hydrometallurgical methods require extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, and chemical environment. Therefore, biological methods may be preferable for recovery of metals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bacterial leaching of Li and Co from spent batteries has been demonstrated at lab scale, but fungal leaching has not yet been evaluated. The PIs propose fungal leaching for these project because fungi are typically more tolerant than bacteria to low-pH environments, fungal leaching often exhibits faster kinetics and/or more complete extraction than bacteria, and organic acids excreted by fungi can form complexes with leached metals, thereby reducing their toxicity. The principal intellectual merit of this work resides in the assessment of the ability of three candidate fungal species to extract valuable metals from an important "waste" product, and to do so in an environmentally acceptable manner. The overall objective of this project is to conduct preliminarily studies to assess the potential of three fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum, and Penicillium chrysogenum) to extract Li and Co ions from spent rechargeable batteries. The central hypothesis of this project is that fungal strains that have been cultured in the presence of battery materials (and thereby acclimated to otherwise unfavorable conditions) can, under realistic operating conditions, produce organic acids capable of extracting at least 80 % of both Li and Co. The overall objective of the project will be achieved in two stages: (1) Quantify the acclimation/adaptation and growth pattern of fungi in the presence of single and multiple metallic ions; (2) Quantify the production of organic acids and the recovery of Li and Co during bioleaching of spent batteries under "baseline" conditions. For both stages, strains of the three identified fungal species will be assessed. This research will (1)  characterize the metal content of spent Li-ion batteries, including the toxicity characteristic leaching potential of those metals. This information will be beneficial in estimating the economic potential of metals recovery from spent batteries, and/or in estimating the potential environmental consequences of landfill disposal of spent batteries. (2) quantify how three strains of fungi acclimate/adapt over time to different concentrations of the toxic metals present in spent Li-ion batteries. This information is likely to be beneficial to fungal bioleaching of many different types of solid wastes, not just spent batteries. (3) contribute to the development of an economic market for a "waste" product, which offers both economic and environmental advantages. (4) disseminate the results (via journal papers, conference presentations, web pages, etc.) to researchers in environmental engineering and to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nearly all handheld electronic devices make use of rechargeable batteries, with lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries dominating the market.  Li-ion batteries are also replacing nickel-metal-hydride batteries in electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, meaning that demand may grow further.  There are two important problems with this rapid growth in the use of Li-ion batteries.  First, it is uncertain that the demand for lithium (Li) and cobalt (Co), required in the form of LiCoO2 for the cathode of Li-ion batteries, can be met by the available supply.  Second, the lifetime of rechargeable batteries is only 10&ndash;15 years; hence, as the demand for rechargeable Li-ion batteries increases, so too will the disposal of spent batteries in the solid waste stream.  If spent Li-ion batteries are sent to landfills or incinerators, it may represent a route for toxic metals to enter the environment.  Thus, from the standpoint of environmental sustainability, a method for recovering Li and Co from spent Li-ion batteries is required.  This will serve the multiple purposes of meeting growing demand for Li and Co, creating a market for the "waste" product of spent batteries (thereby keeping them out of landfills and incinerators), and reducing environmental harm incurred by mining of virgin Li and Co.  Some methods already exist for the recovery of valuable metals from solid wastes.  However, pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes may emit toxic gases or may require extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, and chemical environment.  An alternative is bioleaching, i.e., using organisms (typically bacteria or fungi) to extract target metals.  Therefore, the objective of this EAGER project is to preliminarily assess the potential of three fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum, and Penicillium chrysogenum) for extracting Li and Co ions from spent rechargeable batteries.  This EAGER project has provide preliminary answers to the following key knowledge gaps: (1) Which organic acids produced by fungi are most effective at extracting Li and Co from spent batteries? (2) Which species or strains of fungi produce these acids, and at what concentrations?  (3) What levels of acid and metal concentrations will the fungi tolerate?  Significant findings and results include the following.  All three fungal strains tested grow rapidly in either of two growth media (Sabouraud dextrose broth or Czapek Dox broth), yielding biomass concentrations of several g/L after only days of growth.  Biomass production was still increasing after 10 days of growth, at which time we stopped monitoring. The fungi naturally produce five organic acids -- oxalic, tartaric, malic, gluconic, and citric acids.  Concentrations of acids produced are on the order of 10-100 mM after 10 days of growth. Organic acids at these concentrations are capable of leaching about 40-80% of Li and Co from crushed battery cathodes (at ambient temperature). Oxalic acid is the most effective at leaching Li from spent batteries.  All the acids except gluconic acid perform about the same for leaching of Co.  Gluconic acid is the least effective for extraction of both Li and Co. When grown in broth, A niger and P chrysogenum show no inhibition in the presence of up to 100 mg/L Li.  Mild inhibition is observed in the presence of 100 mg/L Co.  P simplicissimum shows significant inhibition in the presence of 100 mg/L Li, but shows no inhibition in the presence of 100 mg/L Co.  Experiments to test the tolerance to 1000 mg/L Li and Co are currently underway.   The work performed here serves as "proof of concept" by demonstrating that fungi are sufficiently tolerant to metals present in Li-ion batteries, by demonstrating that fungi produce appropriate organic acids in sufficient concentrations to facilitate the extraction of Li and Co, by demonstrating that Li and Co can be extracted at efficiencies that are potentially viable from a commercial standpoint, and by comparing the tolerance and  performance of the candidate fungal strains.  The rationale for the project is that identification of the most appropriate candidate(s) for bioleaching, along with a preliminary assessment of their performance, must be established before studies can be scaled up to explore the potential for application of the methods to Li and Co on a realistic scale.   The intellectual merit of this project resides in the quantification of the growth and acid production of the fungi, and the assessment of the ability of the acids to extract target metals from spent batteries.  The broader impacts are the development of an environmentally friendly method to recycle spent rechargeable batteries, and the application of the project's results to fungal bioleaching studies in other disciplines.
