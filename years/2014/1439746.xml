<AbstractNarration>The Howard University Science Teacher Certification Program (HU-STCP) in collaboration with Prince George's Community College will address the national need for more underrepresented STEM talent who pursue careers in teaching.  This capacity building project specifically strives to improve science teaching and learning among minority students in both college and K-12 settings.  The intended outcomes of the HU-STCP capacity building program design include: (1) the implementation of a teacher certification program that prepares highly qualified biology and chemistry teachers (2) coursework that emphasizes creative pedagogical practices that emphasize authentic science instructions and (3) early field work opportunities. The impact of the HU-STCP capacity building project will grow the number of minority STEM educators in urban school systems as well as the collaborations between universities, school districts, and STEM professionals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of capacity building project include (1) development of new courses and teacher certification requirements for a one-year intensive teacher certification program, and (2) development of recruitment and retention plans that prepare post-baccalaureate candidates for teacher licensure in the fields of biology and/or chemistry.  The HU-STCP project will use inquiry and problem-based learning approaches to engage teacher candidates in promoting critical thinking, problem solving, and collaborative skills needed to conduct authentic, scientific learning experiences in urban classrooms.  Inquiry and problem-based learning approaches will provide a framework to convert traditional classroom activities into unique science related experiences for minority students in an urban K-12 educational setting.  In addition, this project will further explore the relationship and affects between teacher knowledge, quality instruction, and student achievement in science.  The HU-STCP project combines a mix of quantitative and qualitative data in formative and summative assessments to measure outcomes, lessons learned and effective strategies that emerge during the capacity building period.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of the HU-STCP capacity building program design included development of: (1) a teacher certification program that prepares highly qualified biology and chemistry teachers, (2) coursework that emphasizes creative pedagogical practices that include authentic science instructions and real-life, science related experiences, and (3) an early field work program that gives teacher candidates opportunities to participate in internships that include science education seminars and co-operative science research labs and to work as Learning Assistants to impart their content and pedagogical knowledge as it relates to K-12 learners in urban schools.  The impact of the outcomes of HU-STCP is expected to grow the number and quality of minority STEM educators in urban school systems as well as the network and collaborations between universities, school districts, and STEM professionals who strive to improve science teaching and learning among minority students in both college and K-12 settings.  In addition, the HU-STCP will further address the national needs and goals of quality education and research in STEM, rapid gains in STEM achievement success and STEM degree and/or certified teaching production for talented, underrepresented minorities, which will ultimately broaden the participation in the nation?s STEM workforce. The capacity building grant laid the necessary foundation in order to place Howard and its School of Education and departments within the College of Arts and Sciences in position to reach these goals.
