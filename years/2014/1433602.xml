<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award investigates how to obtain better predictions of the effectiveness of population-level health interventions. The research strategy is to create consumer choice models that incorporate patient heterogeneity into predictive models of health and economic outcomes.  The patient plays a key role in conditions that are chronic and not immediately life threatening, but that in the long term can be harmful through associated co-morbidities.  This research builds on collaborations with health sciences experts to take an interdisciplinary approach.  Consumer choice models will be transformed into models for patient choice.  This allows for individual patient preferences to be considered (e.g., time-preferences, willingness-to-pay for treatment) which may depend on socio-demographic patient attributes.  These new patient choice models will be embedded into predictive models of health outcomes (smoking cessation and maternal drinking) and long term treatment effectiveness studies will be conducted at the population level. The educational plan includes advising and mentoring activities that work with discovery-oriented "creative inquiry" projects involving multi-level student teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will allow health science experts to move from efficacy to effectiveness characterization by explicitly considering individual patient preferences.   These new models may also be used in predictive health models of other policy-relevant issues.  Ultimately, the inclusion of patient choice will result in more accurate estimates of treatment effectiveness and more accurate predictions of health and economic outcomes.  This allows policy makers to choose the most efficient intervention strategies, with a richer information set than can be provided by clinical trials alone. Middle school students studying in technology programs will be introduced to the field of industrial engineering and engage with undergraduate research teams. Graduate students will mentor participating undergraduates, resulting in a pipeline of students who will be prepared to undertake technical careers in the healthcare service industry and in academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award investigated how to improve predictions of the effectiveness of population-level health interventions.  To achieve this, patient level "choice" or "behavior" models were created that incorporate patient heterogeneity into predictive models of health and economic outcomes.  The patient plays a key role in conditions that are chronic and not immediately life threatening, but that in the long term can be harmful through associated co-morbidities.  This research built upon collaborations with health sciences experts to take an interdisciplinary approach.  Consumer choice models were transformed into models for patient choice.  This allowed for individual patient preferences to be considered which depend on socio-demographic patient attributes.  These new patient choice models were then embedded into predictive models of health outcomes and long term treatment effectiveness studies were be conducted at the population level.  The PI successfully incorporated patient behavior and heterogeneity in models for a diverse group of diseases.  These include: Colorectal cancer screening (CRC), liver transplantation, smoking cessation and Diabetes by using statistical modelling, simulation modelling and optimization techniques.  Large data sets were used to inform these models, thus students were also trained in analytics, which is essential for individuals entering the workforce today.  For CRC we were able to model individual level compliance with cancer screening and choice of screening test (colonoscopy versus fecal test).  With this we were able to model the impact (in terms of cost, cancer cases, life-years, etc.) of several interventions, including targeted programs (e.g. mass media campaigns) and population level programs (e.g. changes to insurance policies). For liver transplantation we were able to model both the population of patients entering the list as well as cadaveric donors.  A natural history model of disease progression of patients on the list was also developed.  In this way we were able to forecast the impact of expected demographic shifts (e.g. aging population) as well as policy changes (e.g. change to reperfusion technology).  The models allow us to quantify the waitlist size, time on waitlist, number of transplants and number of deaths over time. For the smoking cessation model we were able to model the choice that individuals would make between different kinds of smoking cessation aids, as well as the change in smoking status between individuals.  This allowed us to test targeted interventions (e.g. vouchers for pharmacologically assisted aids) to population level interventions (e.g. increased tax on cigarettes).  In addition to predicting smoking prevalence over time, we were also able to estimate costs (intervention and disease related), as well as deaths due to complications.  The results of this research allow policy makers to choose the most efficient intervention strategies, with a richer information set and less cost, than can be provided by clinical trials alone.  The educational plan was composed of advising and mentoring activities that work with discovery-oriented projects involving multi-level student teams. Middle school students studying in technology programs in South Carolina (SC) were introduced to the field of industrial engineering and engaged with undergraduate research teams. In North Carolina (NC), high school students were introduced to the field of IE and participated in a camp.  In addition to the traditional role of assistant researchers, graduate students provided mentorship to participating undergraduates.  Undergraduates were involved in undergraduate research in SC and NC through existing mechanisms at the PI?s institutions.  All student researchers were exposed to working with multidisciplinary teams and learned to communicate findings to a broader community (medical experts, policy makers).  The result is a pipeline of students who will be prepared to undertake technical careers in the healthcare service industry and in academia.
