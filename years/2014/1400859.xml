<AbstractNarration>This research project focuses on the study of discrete surfaces, that is, surfaces obtained by gluing together polygons along edges. Discrete surfaces (also known as maps) are fundamental mathematical structures which play an important role in several branches of  mathematics, and theoretical physics and are also of practical importance in computer science (for computer graphics and circuit layout).  The goal of the project is to solve several open problems about discrete surfaces by finding encodings of maps by simpler mathematical structures such as trees and lattice paths. In particular, these encodings shall be used to study the properties of large random discrete surfaces,  and to design algorithms for discrete surfaces. Some broader impacts of the project are the  mentoring of undergraduate research projects, the organization of weekly seminars and conferences, and the dissemination of scientific discoveries through survey articles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to solve several problems related to maps using a bijective approach. In recent years many bijections were found between classes of maps and simpler mathematical structures such as trees. This represented a breakthrough in the understanding of maps, which helped solve previously unreachable problems such as describing the metric properties of random maps and random surfaces. In a collaboration with Eric Fusy, the PI has found a "master bijection" generalizing and unifying most known bijections for maps. The PI plans to pursue his research in the following directions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Extend the master bijection approach to new classes of maps, namely, hypermaps and irreducible maps. This will complete the unification of the bijective theory of maps, and encompass bijections for maps endowed with a statistical mechanics model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Study the metric properties of random maps by using a recent bijective result about  ``charged maps''. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Write a survey article about the bijective approach to maps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Design drawing algorithms for graphs using  canonical orientations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other goals of the PI which are not directly related to maps are a combinatorial proof of Okounkov determinantal formula for Schur measures, and the parametrization of the space of branched polymers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This research project is in the field of combinatorics with motivations coming from probability, statistical mechanics, and theoretical physics. The PI has completed most of the goals set by the award, but has also solved several other problems, and set the foundation for several new research directions.  Many of the problems tackled by the PI are related to the notion of discrete surfaces known as maps. These are surfaces obtained by gluing together polygons along edges. Maps are fundamental mathematical structures which play an important role in several branches of mathematics, and theoretical physics (abstract algebra, probability, statistical mechanics, string theory) and are also of practical importance in computer science (for computer graphics, and circuit layout).  Several results obtained are bijections, that is, exact encoding of a class of mathematical structures by another seemingly unrelated classes of objects. Bijections are desirable in mathematics as they offer alternative descriptions of a class of object of interest and this new perspective offers new ways to solve problems about these objects.    The results of this project have been disseminated to the communities of interest by several means: conferences and seminars, papers made available on the ArXiv server, and paper slides and computation worksheets made available on the PI?s website.  The project resulted in the PI?s mentoring of two graduate students Jordan Awan and Duncan Levear, in what was their first experience at mathematical research. The project also resulted in the mentoring of a high-school student Richard Zhou, through a MIT-Prime program supervised by the PI (one year research experience), and with Yan Zhuang (Brandeis graduate student) as the primary mentor.       Here is a selection of 5 key results obtained during this award:  - The PI has obtained very general bijective results for maps.

More precisely, we prove an explicit correspondence between the ``random surfaces'' obtained from random planar maps, and the ``random surfaces'' obtained from Liouville Quantum gravity (LQG) which is based on the Gaussian free field. Moreover we show that under this embedding the percolation loops converge to the Conformal loop ensemble CLE6.  The relation we provide between random maps, LQG and SLE builds on a very prestigious set of mathematical works and solves a very deep conjecture.
