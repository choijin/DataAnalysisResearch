<AbstractNarration>This project uses computer simulation methods within the AMBER suite of programs to simulate the atomic motions of proteins and nucleic acids in their native environment to better understand the structure, dynamics and interactions among various bio-molecules. Through analysis of the resulting data, the simulations provide insight into biomolecular function and how to modulate function. Critical to success is adequate sampling of the complex conformational distributions of the biomolecules and also use of an accurate representation of the underlying atomic interactions or "force field". To facilitate sampling, the project couples together ensembles of independent simulations, optimized in parallel on CPU and GPU resources, that exchange information to increase sampling efficiency. Preliminary work on the Blue Waters Supercomputer has demonstrated reproducible and complete sampling of the conformational distributions of RNA tetranucleotides, tetraloop RNA structures, and also the internal portion of a B-DNA helix. With complete sampling, it is now possible to reliably assess, validate, and improve the applied force fields. Broader impacts center on the improvements in both the simulation methods and force fields, in wide use by a broad community of researchers in applications ranging from drug design to deciphering structure-function relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increases in the efficiency of conformational sampling are realized by developing, optimizing and applying multi-dimensional replica exchange methods in temperature and Hamiltonian space. The AMBER molecular dynamics simulation codes are extremely well optimized and suited to the GPU resources on Blue Waters. Preliminary simulations on Blue Waters, reducing times to solution from months-years to days-weeks, show that although it is possible to converge the conformational distributions of nucleic acids like RNA tetranucleotides and tetraloops, one does not find conformational distributions that completely agree with experiments. In other words, there are still serious deficiencies in the force fields for nucleic acids that are being uncovered and overcome to improve the models. To further the exploration of nucleic acid and protein structures beyond solution conditions, simulations are additionally being performed on room temperature crystals which provide an additional means to assess and validate the simulation approaches. Larger and more representative protein and nucleic acid structures are also being investigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project outcomes report is for a PRAC travel award and a 7M node hour allocation on the University of Illinois Blue Waters Petascale Resource for the period of September 2014 through August 2015.  The travel funds were largely used for the PIs at various domain science meetings to report on the work enabled by simulations on Blue Waters and for travel to the annual Blue Waters symposia.  The simulation work performed primarily makes use of hierarchical and either loosely or tightly coupled ensembles of highly GPU optimized molecular dynamics engines to fully map out the conformational, energetic and chemical landscape of biomolecules.  This allows us to assess, validate and improve currently available biomolecular force fields and to provide novel structural and dynamic insight into DNA, RNA, and protein-nucleic acid interactions.  The overall impact on the field will be a substantial improvement in force field fidelity coupled with detailed information regarding the simulation time scales required for true convergence of MD simulations. This work will define the benchmark for the field from which other simulations are measured and will for the first time truly establish the utility of MD simulation for elucidating key chemical information involving RNA and proteins on a previously unprecedented scale and at a level of coverage that simply is not feasible experimentally or with conventional computational resources.  A significant goal with strong intellectual merit that was achieved was that we demonstrated on multiple systems that the Blue Waters resource enabled us to "converge" the structural/conformational and dynamic distributions of biomolecules. We have also have demonstrated reproducibility in the results from independent initial conditions. Sixteen new publications appeared and the collaborative team has made important strides in force field optimization, methods development and dissemination, and continued very active development of the MD trajectory analysis software CPPTRAJ that have significant broader impact. AmberTools15 (which includes the open source sander MD engine) was released in April 2015 (http://ambermd.org) and active development in CPPTRAJ is on-going both within the AMBER master Git development tree and also on a open-source and generally available GitHub for CPPTRAJ. Also notable is continued development of "parmed" which facilitates incorporation of force fields from alternative programs (NAMD, CHARMM, Gromacs) and this is widening our force field exposure.
