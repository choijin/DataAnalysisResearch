<AbstractNarration>Terrestrial vertebrates (Tetrapoda) include our own species and represent one of the great and diverse evolutionary radiations that intersect with humans' everyday lives. The four tetrapod classes - birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles - together comprise ca. 33,000 species, include life histories ranging from aquatic, subterranean, and arboreal to aerial, cover a variety of trophic strategies, and harbor some of the most stunning ecological adaptations. Tetrapods play a significant role in providing diverse ecological functions, and they are vital to biodiversity monitoring efforts. However, significant knowledge gaps remain in the evolutionary relationships, distributions of ecologically important traits, and distributions of species. The project will undertake concerted assembling efforts that will yield near species-level completeness of key evolutionary and ecological attributes thereby establishing a global model system for macroevolution, macroecology, comparative biology and global change research. The compiled trait and spatial data will provide a vital backbone for rigorous conservation monitoring and prioritization. The online analysis and visualization tools will extend successful, existing projects and will be built to be directly usable for other taxa and other Genealogy of Life (GoLife) projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Massive parallel sequencing methods will be used to collect new multi-locus genetic information for ca. 4,000 species currently lacking such data. These data will be used to derive a dated posterior tree set that includes all tetrapod species and captures remaining uncertainty. The posterior tree set will be used to calculate evolutionary distinctness and a variety of tree metrics. Together with key collaborators the researchers will compile morphological, ecological and life history trait data for dozens of variables and additionally benefit from phylogenetic imputation to predict missing values. A new tool incorporated into the existing Map of Life infrastructure will link existing species distributional datasets to global environmental data layers and provide broad-scale niche characteristics for all vertebrates together with estimates of uncertainty. Further integration will link these products to online phylogeny visualization tools to allow map- and tree-based discovery and download. Finally, the project will demonstrate the utility of the integrated layers through example biogeographic, conservation and comparative analyses that will highlight the advance in inference and in predictive conservation use arising from near-complete and unbiased global data. The research will also provide online visualizations and tutorials, a museum exhibit developed around the products, a workshop based on VertLife infrastructure, and undergraduate and graduate summer internships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary outcomes of this project, related to both the intellectual merit and broader impacts criteria of the NSF, can be summarized in three distinct categories:     1)    We have produced taxonomically complete evolutionary trees of all known, extant species of amphibian, squamate &amp; tuatara, turtle, and crocodilian. These phylogenies, based on extensive DNA-sequence datasets, allowed for significant taxonomic revisions in these groups, and resolved many lingering questions regarding the evolutionary history of species within them. They have subsequently been used as a basis by numerous researchers worldwide for the further description of new species and taxa.     2)    These phylogenies have been time-calibrated, such that they give a direct estimate of the evolutionary history of each group, and a window into the deep-time processes of speciation and extinction of each major lineage. For instance, we found new evidence of a mass extinction in salamanders around the same time as the dinosaurs, a pattern that had never been observed in the fossil record or hypothesized previously. In contrast, many turtle and crocodilian lineages showed little change in diversity during this time. These phylogenies have subsequently allowed many other teams to test hypotheses regarding the diversification and trait evolution of these species.     3)    We have provided geographic and evolutionary analyses of threat status and extinction risk in each group, showing the biological factors that lead to evolutionary imperilment, the specific regions where dangers are concentrated, and the particular groups of species with the highest levels of precarity. Most importantly, these results have broad impact for conservation management decisions, policy setting, and non-academic application (e.g., NGOs) related to wildlife and imperiled species worldwide. We have provided a blueprint for identifying high-priority lineages and areas where intervention is needed, and assessment is most crucial.     Finally, numerous personnel have been trained under this grant in the techniques of systematics, evolutionary biology, and conservation phylogenetics, from the K12 to postdoctoral level.
