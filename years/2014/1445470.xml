<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project, funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology program, will lead to the development of tools that will allow researchers to change the behavior or state of bacteria without the introduction of new genes.  Analogous to the development of programming languages for computers, the investigator will develop the rules and theory that will enable the programming (or change of state) of bacteria.   This should enable other researchers in the field to more rapidly alter bacteria to perform useful functions such as the manufacture of chemicals, or to prevent harmful functions such as biofouling of surfaces.  The investigator will engage in interdisciplinary training at all levels from K-12 to graduate and postdoctoral students, with a focus on enhancing diversity. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical:  The PI will use a systems biology approach to describe different phenotypic states during P. aeroginosa biofilm formation under different nutrient conditions. Her hypothesis is that temporal transcriptomic profiles of bacteria can be described using a state space formalism.  The PI will then use this state space systems biology framework to develop a 'soft' programming language, that doesn't require insertion of external DNA circuits, to modulate the phenotypic states of the cells.  The development of soft programming for bacteria will have a significant impact on the fields of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The overarching goal of the project is to enable the realization of software programmable microbes through the development of a systems biology based mathematical abstraction.  Given that the theoretical underpinnings of software-programmable microbes were under-developed, the proposed EAGER project was used to explore the feasibility of the principle investigator?s (E. May) hypothesis regarding programmability and gather preliminary data to demonstrate fundamental steps needed to develop a software programmable microbe.  The intellectual merits focused on:  exploring the viability of using gene expression profiles to characterize distinct phenotype states and trajectories of microbial communities, and development of a systems biology framework for simulating the response of microbial communities to environmental inputs.  Progress on these objectives would demonstrate the feasibility of developing a theoretical framework for environment-driven programmable microbes.  The educational broader impacts focused on broadening participation of underrepresented students through inclusion in research, and on development of interdisciplinary hands-on modules for K-5 students to learn about scientific questions at the intersection of the biological and mathematical sciences.      Four key project outcomes were relevant to the intellectual merits of the proposed work.  Using Escherichia coli K-12 as the model organism, the May lab developed static biofilm models to investigate the feasibility of characterizing the phenotypic response of the community and associating the response with changes in the microbial response.  Project Outcome-1 included the demonstration of quantifiable differences in E. coli K12 growth phenotypes in the presence of defined exogenous inputs during batch culture growth.  The May lab was able to quantify and correlate changes in the environment to measurable changes in growth.  Project Outcome-2 resulted in the development of an in vitro model of E. coli K12 static culture biofilm formation that enabled temporal quantification of biofilm phenotypes such as biomass, roughness, thickness, and surface coverage.  Biofilm phenotypes were quantified using confocal images of fluorescently labeled E. coli K12, which were collected over 24 and 48-hr periods and analyzed using Comstat-based algorithms.  Using the defined inputs from Outcome-1, the PI and her team demonstrated the ability to produce quantifiable differences in biofilm formation phenotypes and gene expression given variations in exogenous inputs.  The third project outcome was the development of preliminary metrics that enabled the quantification of changes in a subset of genes that associate with changes in an observable series of environment-associated phenotypes.   The final outcome related to the intellectual merit of the project, Outcome-4, focused on the development of a multiscale 3D agent based model (ABM) for E. coli K12 static biofilm formation.  The ABM model explicitly incorporated a mechanistic model of metabolic kinetics for each bacterium in the biofilm.  The in silico biofilm modeling platform was developed as a tool for hypothesis exploration.  The methods and platforms developed in these four outcomes provide insight and tools for future studies.       Key outcomes of the broader impact centered on training student and postdoctoral researchers, development of outreach modules for K-5 students, and dissemination of the project findings.  Broader impact Outcome-1 results included the mentoring of four graduate students (two female), three high school students (one female), one female postdoctoral scientist, and four undergraduates (two under represented minority students).  A second broader impact outcome was the development and implementation of single and dual-lesson hands on education modules that integrated math and microbiology.  The lessons, dubbed "The Bacteria Operation", were prepared and delivered by the PI to 3rd through 5th grade students at a local elementary school.  The hands on lessons required students to integrate the usual observation-based methods used in biology and grade-appropriate math skills, such as recording and graphing quantifiable observations.   The third broader impact outcome involved dissemination of project results through conference presentations, referred conference proceedings, and referred journal publications.  Results supported solely or in part by this award were presented at international conferences (IEEE EMBC 2014, IMAG Multiscale Modeling 2015 and, ECI Biochem &amp; Molec Eng 2015, EMBC 2016), and resulted in one Ph.D. thesis (2017), and in peer-reviewed journals including two published, and one under review.
