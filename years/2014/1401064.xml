<AbstractNarration>SES-1401064&lt;br/&gt;Jeffrey Goldfarb&lt;br/&gt;Tim Rosenkranz&lt;br/&gt;New School University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores how destination marketing functions as a key mechanism through which the nation-state adapts to conditions of globalization and, in turn, co-constitutes global socio-economic processes. Tourism is one of the world?s largest industries, moving one billion people and 1.3 trillion US dollars in 2012.  Nation-states compete for these global movements of consumers. Destination marketing, as tool to attract tourists, has become a central activity of the nation-state as tourist destination. The problem for the nation-state's actors, the National Tourist Offices, is that they have to rely on the cooperation of the local travel media and industry at the source, the places from which tourist come. This interpretative-comparative research analyzes the destination marketing efforts of several nation-states in two different field-sites (USA and India) to address the question of how do National Tourist Offices manage their production as tourist destination in local travel media and industry? This research breaks down the large scale of the global tourism economy into two distinct local sites, hypothesizing that these local, socio-economic arenas (fields) of interaction between destination marketing, travel media and industry significantly limit the nation-states? efforts to control the production of its commodity image. Situated in the literatures of Economic Sociology, the Sociology of Globalization and the Sociology of Culture, this study contributes to the debate about the relation between globalization processes and the nation-state. While engaging with the research on branding/marketing institutions that translate culture into an economic resource, transforming the nation-state into an actor and subject of global competition, this study moves from the ideology of branding to the empirical research of its practices. It therefore applies qualitative methods, including participant observation, interviewing as well as content and discourse analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research contributes to a better understanding of the production of the global environment that forces nation-states to reorder their societies under economic competition. Image constitutes value within this global competition, exemplified by the desire to "brand the nation," an imperative that treats people as stakeholders and assets. This study challenges tradition explanations by analyzing the local organizational fields' contestations of the nation-state's control over image production. Research findings contribute to scholarship in social sciences and also to tourism destination studies that are directly implicated in the ideological production of state policies. The collected data will be de-identified and made available for further study of the processes of informal practices in the spheres of marketing, media and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2013 the sexual assault of a Swiss tourist in rural India triggered a series of public apologies, incarcerations, and investigations of the Indian policeÆs treatment of violence against women. While addressing the growing human rights crisis, the strong governmental reaction to these accelerated, globally mediated concerns about the security of tourists in India also tried to salvage its investment in a multi-million US$ tourist-destination-branding effort as "Incredible India." Yet it could not prevent a drastic 25% decrease in international tourist arrivals. The crisis of IndiaÆs global image and its consequences reveals the crucial connection between national economies and their cultural image production in the global tourism field. The nation-state here is in a paradoxical position as both subject to globally mediated perception and as actor managing this perception. In fact, nation-states invest billions of US$ to not only avoid crisis, but to actively manage and produce positive images to attract tourists. Destination marketing and branding have become central activities of the globally competing nation-state, producing the nation-state as a commoditized tourist destination.     This research explored the efforts of various marketing organizations of the nation-state, the so-called National Tourist Offices (NTOs), in two main sources of the global tourism economy: the USA and India. "Sources" (or "source-markets") in this study, and in the professional vocabulary of destination marketing, are the places where tourists come from, where marketing turns potential travelers into actual tourists, who later visit a specific destination. This ethnographic research shows how destination marketing functions as a key mechanism through which the nation-state adapts to conditions of globalization and, in turn, co-constitutes global socio-economic processes. Situated at the intersection between the fields of the Sociology of Globalization, Economic Sociology and the Sociology of Culture, this study engages directly with the growing literature on branding/marketing as the appropriation and translation of culture into economic resources.     This research draws on interviewing, participant observation and discourse analysis. The data has been collected from August 2013 to December 2014 in both the USA and India with the generous support of the National Science Foundation. At the core of this inquiry are: 1.) the specific organizational form of the nation-state as actor of global destination marketing; 2.) the organizational fields that emerge in the process of commodification and evaluation which transforms the nation into a marketable tourist destination.     This research presents the current globalization process as organizational transformation that out-sources the nation-state itself. This challenges conventional notions of "outsourcing" in regards to the nation-state, which is mostly understood as a process of organizational change and movement of capital, production and expertise that removes these from national control and which therefore diminishes the statesÆ traditional capacity to control boundaries of autonomy and coercion. In contrast, the out-sourcing process this dissertation explores expands the nation-state beyond its boundaries into the source-markets of global tourism, embedding it as actor into professional fields, connecting it to networks of production and consumption which process it as resource of symbolic and economic circulation. The main challenge to the nation-state remains one of control, but of control in a more complicated sense of competing claims of expertise over what is æof valueÆ in the nation itself.     This research therefore provides significant analysis of the production of the global environment that forces nation-states to reorder their societies under the aspects of economic competition and the effects of this competition on the nation-state as organizational form.
