<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is  that smaller and less expensive medical endoscopes will be made possible, which will allow physicians to see better inside the human body. These devices will shorten recovery times, improve diagnosis and treatment, move procedures from operating rooms to exam rooms, and lower health care costs. In addition, physicians will be able to visualize in parts of the body that were previously inaccessible.  Health care will be improved throughout the world, particularly in developing countries. This project advances the state of the art in the design of micro-optics as well as their manufacture.  Large arrays of tiny but precise lens components will be assembled in one operation, drastically reducing costs. The micro-optics and advanced manufacturing techniques developed in this project will also be applicable to other imaging systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop new designs for micro-optics with a particular emphasis on medical endoscopes and new manufacturing techniques.  High performance free-form optics that use multiple fields will be designed to produce images within acceptable limits for biomedical optics and be manufacturable. A high volume, precision manufacturing process will be developed for these optics.  Wafer level assembly technology will be used to combine multiple arrays of micro-optic elements. Lens systems thus produced will be tested to determine whether they are within the design specification for mechanical and optical performance.  Optical camera calibration and an image processing pipeline will be developed to combine the multiple fields and correct aberrations and produce accurate image reconstruction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project, which was a collaboration between Ohio Surgical Optics LLC and the Ohio State University, was to enable low cost endoscopy for developing countries with the production of cheaper and better medical endoscopes.  Endoscopes are used in minimally invasive procedures to look into the body.  Traditionally, the optics in these devices have been expensive and difficult to produce, particularly when the endoscope is reduced in size.  This STTR effort set out to develop new techniques in the design and manufacture of these lenses so that very small endoscopes could be made that gave clinicians excellent visualization while decreasing the manufacturing time and cost.  Ultimately, high quality, low cost endoscopes could become single use devices that would be able to be used in a variety of clinical settings, particularly in developing countries.  The primary technical approach was to use micro-molding for the optical elements instead of traditional machining of lenses.  Molding has several advantages, including the ability to make surfaces that have any arbitrary shape (freeforms) and produce entire arrays of elements at once, instead of one lens at a time.  Micro-molding is difficult, however, and requires significant technical development to reach commercial scale.   During this project, we first designed and built a successful simple endoscope lens system which included a freeform prism. Then, we built lens molds which had an array of lens elements on them.  We were able to show at small scale that these arrays could be aligned and glued together.  With further work, this approach would allow for the rapid and accurate production of large numbers of lens systems.  Currently, individual precision lenses are produced and painstakingly assembled into a complete optical assembly.  This process is expensive and is often inaccurate.  Our approach with lens arrays would largely automate this process.  We also developed a novel endoscope design that allows for a wide angle, high resolution view.  This would allow clinicians to see clearly, both directly ahead of the endoscope as well as to the side.  Our new design uses a split view, meaning that there are two different optical paths &ndash; one straight ahead and one to the side.  The two views can be recombined in a real time image processing system (a computer) so the clinician sees one seamless image.  We built a prototype based on this design and tested it.  The optical performance of the prototype was significantly worse than predicted in theory, and we analyzed the causes of this difference.  The results showed, however, that the design is feasible with further optimization of the lens production and assembly processes.  This project provided support for the training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows at the Ohio State University.  These students had the opportunity of working on advanced optical designs and learning about the development process for a commercial product.
