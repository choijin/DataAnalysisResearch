<AbstractNarration>General&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is not always the case, surveys are generally used to make inferences about a larger population using a relatively small sample.  In order to do that, each respondent in a survey is given a weight to describe the relationship between the proportion of individuals like them in the survey relative to those in the population.  The construction of these weights is critically important as they ensure the survey sample can accurately reflect the population.  This project develops a tool for users to estimate weights for several of the most commonly used panel surveys in political science.  By enabling researchers to estimate weights that are appropriate for their individual research questions, we increase the reliability of studies that use these panel surveys.    &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the issues that panel weighting involves, we develop an R package that delivers a single weight variable based on the sub-samples obtained after attrition and item non-response.  The motivation behind the creation of such a statistical package is the need for a tool that can deliver a set of weights suitable for the analyses desired by researchers dependent on the outcome variables, covariates and waves specified. Moreover, we develop program to run a diagnosis of the socio-demographic characteristics of the remaining sample after accounting for attrition and item non-response in order to flag potential complications such as over-weight of respondents that belong to groups with high levels of attrition. Finally, we generate an accessible and user-friendly program that facilitates the analysis of panel survey data.  Countless scholars rely upon nationally-representative and publicly-available panel surveys as a data resource to draw inferences about national opinion.  This project improves those inferences by providing researchers with the tools they need to weight their data appropriately.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two important software packages were developed as the outcome of this NSF project.  Both allow researchers to improve upon their substantive inferences and better leverage existing panel resources.  Thus, this project: (1) Extends the usefulness of existing software, such as the R packages designed to rake survey data, by partnering this software with known population parameters relevant to the most frequently accessed panel survey data in the social sciences, (2) Increases the accessibility of the appropriate weighting techniques by making the package particularly user-friendly and (3) Applies this package to data to improve on our knowledge of changes in public opinion and attitudes in politics.      Allowing researchers to appropriately weight publicly available panel survey data is key as researchers rely upon these canonical surveys.  This tool helps both researchers and practitioners who are interested in public policy and national security better understand and draw reliable conclusions from the opinions and actions of not only the survey participants but segments of the general population. Thus, with a better understanding of how people's attitudes and behaviors are, one can have a better idea of their beliefs and views on public policy and how they are formed.  Likewise it will impact the training of both undergraduate and graduate students. This project has and will continue to teach faculty at other institutions, via conference presentations, how best to use this technology. Finally, this research will be used in classrooms across the nation to teach PhD students how to best use this kind of survey data.  The first package was an R package called weightTAPSPACK. This software assists researchers, particularly in the fields of sociology, economics, statistics, and political science, by enabling them to generate their own weights when using publicly available social science panel survey data such as American National Election Study (ANES), the General Social Survey (GSS), and The American Panel Survey (TAPS). The package subsets the data by outcome and covariates of interest, models the attrition rates of the respondents, imputes missing data for attried individuals, and calculates weights to be used for analysis.  The package provides all of the necessary tools to analyze TAPS data.  Much of this functionality is outside the scope of tools average researchers possess.  The second, a more general package, weightPANELPACK, was developed to analyze the American National Election Studies (ANES) in addition to TAPS.  This package provides the full suite of tools available in weightTAPSPACK but the user can provide ANES data.  The necessary demographic formation for both surveys is integrated into the package.  An additional feature of this package is to allow researchers to analyze any panel data if the researcher can provide the necessary data (the survey itself, and the relevant demographic information).  This makes the package much more useful to a general audience, in other subdisciplines within political science and other disciplines interested in panel data, not only survey panel data.  The final version of weightPANELPACK will be submitted to CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network which is a collection of sites which carry identical material, consisting of the R distribution(s), the contributed extensions, documentation for R, and binaries);  however, the main code and details are currently available on GitHub.  The ANES data will also be hosted on a SQL server.        Last Modified: 10/11/2016       Submitted by: Betsy Sinclair]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
