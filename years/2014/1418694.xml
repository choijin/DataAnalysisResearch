<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is for the National Research Council (NRC) to organize a public workshop to engage the atmospheric sciences community and others as appropriate to provide feedback on the draft by asking participants to share their views in the context of the following questions: Are the goals and objectives clear and appropriate? Are there any content areas missing from the draft that should be present if Division on Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) is to achieve its overall vision and mission? Are there adequate mechanisms for coordinating and integrating issues that involve multiple disciplines and multiple divisions within National Science Foundation? The workshop will take place on March 31-April 1, 2014 at the National Academy of Sciences, Washington DC. It will also include a brief, forward-looking session where participants will discuss research frontiers. AGS might consider pursuing in light of the goals and objectives that have been identified as well as those that have been acknowledged as missing. The committee will write a letter report reviewing the AGS draft goals and objectives by addressing the questions above from its own standpoint.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation's Division on Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) supports research to achieve the nation's scientific and education goals in the atmospheric sciences. At AGS' request, this letter report reviews an AGS draft goals and objectives document that sets forth missions, long-term goals, and the means to achieve those goals, for the years 2014&ndash;2018. The letter report's authoring committee commends AGS on taking initial steps toward strategic planning, and for participating in a public workshop organized by the National Academies that engaged the atmospheric and geospace sciences community to provide feedback on the draft goals and objectives document. However, the letter report?s authoring committee found that there are two key missing pieces from the Document that should be present to help AGS achieve its overall vision and mission : (1) clarification of the context and purpose of the Document and; (2) the role of AGS in the context of the national research portfolio. The committee also made observations and recommendations regarding the organization of the document, and the definition and articulation of the individual goals. Finally, the report makes recommendations on how the Document can more clearly articulate collaboration within AGS and the National Science Foundation, as well as nationally and internationally. Key Messages  This committee commends AGS for taking initial steps toward strategic planning, as recommended in the NRC 2007 report, Strategic Guidance for the National Science Foundation's Support of the Atmospheric Science, by drafting a goals and objectives document and engaging in a community workshop to discuss it. The multiple purposes of the Document should be distinguished in order of priority, as text suitable for one purpose might not be suitable for another. Are the goals intended to reflect the current research portfolio, to predict the future research portfolio, or to guide the future research portfolio? Is the Document's purpose descriptive or evaluative? The Document fails to clearly articulate the diverse approaches AGS supports to successfully conduct research in the context of national and international research priorities. Rather than a simple enumeration of the many contributions made by NCAR, the Document should discuss the strength, breadth, and scalability that AGS gains by virtue of its FFRDC's support of the university and private sector research communities. The organizational structure of the Document is weak and the presentation of the material is not balanced. It would be improved if the discussion of each goal contained the scope, importance, and rationale for the goal; examples of past activities and progress; key current and near-future investments; anticipated future areas of emphasis; and a discussion of partners and coordinating mechanisms. Expanding the four science goals to reflect their cross cutting integration of major efforts within AGS would reflect a more forward-looking, integrative approach that unifies research activities across the Division. The Document would be strengthened if it explicitly identified the mechanisms by which AGS cooperates, collaborates, and integrates among the individual sections at AGS, with other parts of NSF, and with other agencies of the Federal government. Interagency and interdivisional collaboration is crucial to future AGS success and clear examples of collaboration modes should be cited for each goal in the Document.
