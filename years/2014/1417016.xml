<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the characteristics, variability and environmental impacts of a little-studied arctic seasonal atmospheric feature called the Summer Arctic Frontal Zone (AFZ), and how it may change over the next century. Little is known about variability in the AFZ or how it will change in the future. The feature is overlain by a high level jet-like feature, and areas where the AFZ are most pronounced are regions of frequent storm genesis, so understanding it is important to understand and predict weather events. In linking the arctic atmosphere, ocean, land surface and the hydrologic cycle, this study of the AFZ adopts a systems perspective, and steeping the next generation of researchers in systems studies is important for maintaining U.S. preeminence in environmental science, so the project is strongly geared towards support of a graduate student. Results from this study will be integrated into university classes and results will be featured in the National Snow and Ice Data Center?s Monthly Highlights. To communicate climate research to the general public, datasets created for this research will be formatted for Science on a Sphere technology. A research team member and the graduate student will present these data and their significance to the public as a part of science outreach shows at the University of Colorado?s Fiske Planetarium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an effort to take advantage of data from a suite of advanced atmospheric reanalyses, satellite remote sensing and model experiments to address the characteristics, variability and environmental impacts of the Summer Arctic Frontal Zone (AFZ), and how this seasonal feature may change over the next century. Most prior research concludes that the AFZ develops primarily in response to summer heating contrasts between the Arctic Ocean and snow-free land. The AFZ is best developed along the Eurasian and Alaskan coasts, especially in Eastern Siberia and north of Alaska's Brooks Range, where it appears that temperature gradients are sharpened by topographic trapping of cold Arctic Ocean air. The AFZ at the surface is overlain by a jet-like feature at the tropopause. Areas where the AFZ are best expressed are regions of frequent cyclogenesis, and these cyclones have significant impacts on the summer precipitation regime not only along the Arctic coast, but also over the central Arctic Ocean, which is where many of the lows migrate into and decay. Migration of cyclones into the central Arctic Ocean also likely influences the sea ice state. This study will focus on: how seasonal development of the AFZ relates to variations in the seasonal timing of snow-free conditions over land, the location of the sea ice margin, surface temperatures, and topography; whether there is support for persisting views of ecological controls on the AFZ; how different patterns of atmospheric circulation influence the expression of AFZ; how variability in the AFZ is expressed in terms of patterns of cyclogenesis and summer precipitation; and how the AFZ will change through the 21st century in response to changes in seasonal snow cover, sea ice conditions and potential changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. The study will employ data from three atmospheric reanalyses, sea ice extent from the satellite passive microwave record, Reynolds sea surface temperature, satellite-derived terrestrial snow cover extent, experiments with the Weather Research and Forecasting regional model and output from coupled global models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Extratropical cyclones (not to be confused with tropical cyclones, called hurricanes or typhoons) and their warm and cold fronts are key features of the weather in middle and high latitudes.  They bring us much of our precipitation and play an important role in transporting  atmospheric heat from place to place.  They form along the boundaries (fronts) between warm and cold air. While they have been widely studied, much remains to be learned about the sources and behavior of cyclones in the Arctic region.  Along with their role in bringing precipitation, Arctic cyclones are important in that they can affect travel in the region. For example, high winds, poor visibility and icing associated with cyclones can pose dangers to marine shipping and aircraft operations.  This study focused on a phenomenon called the summer Arctic Frontal Zone (AFZ) and its links to cyclone activity in the Arctic.   AFZ is expressed along much of the Arctic Ocean coastline, from the Kola Peninsula and the Barents Sea on the Russian side of the Arctic, eastward along the shores of Siberia and Alaska, and ending around Banks Island in Canada. Landward of the Arctic coastline, the surface heats up quickly after the snow melts in May and June and then readily transfers this heat to the atmosphere.  Meanwhile, most coastal parts of Arctic Ocean maintain a sea ice cover into July and August and store more energy in the subsurface column, leading to lower air temperatures over the ocean.  It is this heating contrast between the land and the ocean that gives rise to the AFZ.   It had been thought that the formation of Arctic cyclones (termed cyclogenesis) during summer would be especially frequent along the AFZ.  Surprisingly, this turned out to be largely untrue &ndash; yes, some form among the AFZ but cyclogenesis seems to be more frequent further inland.     Although the AFZ itself is not a preferred area of cyclogenesis, the AFZ nevertheless impacts cyclone development &ndash; what happens is that the AFZ tends to intensify cyclones that pass through it.  How will the AFZ and Arctic cyclone activity change in the future?  To address this issue, use was made of a series of simulations from a global climate model that incorporates increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Results from these model simulations argue that  the AFZ will remain a significant cyclone intensifier through the 21st century. Changes to the AFZ will be largely restricted to June, when earlier melt of the snow cover over land leads to strengthening of land&ndash;ocean temperature contrasts. This strengthening of the AFZ is also accompanied by enhanced cyclogenesis along the east Siberian coast, but no change is indicated for overall cyclone frequency over the Arctic Ocean.
