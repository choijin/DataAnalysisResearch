<AbstractNarration>In today's world of distributed collaborations of scientists, there are many challenges to providing effective infrastructures to couple these groups of scientists with their shared computing and storage resources. The Pythia Network Diagnostic InfrasTructure (PuNDIT) project will integrate and scale research tools and create robust code suitable for operational needs to address the difficult challenge of automating the detection and location of network problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PuNDIT will build upon the de-facto standard perfSONAR network measurement infrastructure to gather and analyze complex real-world network topologies coupled with their corresponding network metrics to identify possible signatures of network problems from a set of symptoms. For example if the symptoms suggest a router along the path has buffers configured too small for high performance, Pythia will return a diagnosis of "Small Buffer". If symptoms indicate non-congestive packet-loss for a particular network segment, the user can be notified of a possible "Bad Network Segment". A primary goal for PuNDIT is to convert complex network metrics into easily understood diagnoses in an automated way.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reliable, high-performance networks are critical for many scientific fields, especially where scientists and resources are geographically distributed.  When there are problems in the network, scientists work can slow or even halt until the location of the problem is found and the issue fixed.   Unfortunately, finding the problem and its location can be extremely difficult because different parts of the network are owned and operated by different organizations.  Problems can (and have) persisted for months or even years before being identified and fixed.     The PuNDIT project was undertaken to help significantly reduce the time and effort it takes to locate and fix problems in the network.  The project was built upon the de-facto standard perfSONAR network measurement infrastructure, which is deployed in Open Science Grid(OSG) and the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid(WLCG).  The project's major goal has been to develop a system that can gather and analyze complex real-world network topologies coupled with their corresponding network metrics (delay, loss rate, etc) so that it can identify possible signatures of network problems from a set of symptoms and better localize where those problems are in the network.  This type of information is critical to achieving quick problem resolution.     The PuNDIT project, started in September 2014, has produced a code-base for both pundit-agents, which run on perfSONAR toolkit instances and a central PuNDIT server, which gathers, analyzes and correlates data from the agents to find and localize network problems.
