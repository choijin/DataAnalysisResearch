<AbstractNarration>Data intensive science discovery at a global scale has imposed new requirements on the speed and management of international research and education networks. At the connection points of these international networks, it is critical to measure the network data flows to understand network traffic patterns, identify network anomalies and provide insights to network control and planning. However, the ever-increasing network speed, the massive amount of network flows and the changing measurement objectives have made the flow-level measurement on very high-speed networks extremely challenging. The Advanced Measurement Instrument and Services (AMIS) project leverages many-core, programmable network processors to prototype and deploy an advanced measurement instrument to enable services for accurate network monitoring and in-depth traffic analysis. The instrument supports flow-granularity measurement at line rate up to 100Gbps and software application programming interfaces to examine selected flows, with no impact to the performance of user traffic. With scalable hardware and an open source software stack, the measurement services equip network operators with effective tools to quantify flow-level network performance and study network flows through privacy-preserving computational analytics. This project is built on a consortium of academia, industrial partners, network operators and international alliances, who bring unique expertise and resources to achieve the objectives of high performance, programmable flow-granularity network measurement. The outcomes from this project will significantly benefit data driven science discovery, such as astronomy and space weather studies, and will promote broadened participation of underrepresented groups (such as Hispanic and female students) through the involvement of multiple universities, including an EPSCoR university and a Hispanic Serving Institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has advanced three areas related to network measurement/analytics, and network management automation:  1. This project has furthered understanding of effective definitions of software-defined network measurement and analytics. This understanding arose through the successive definitions of the layers and constituent functionalities of a software-defined network measurement stack: infrastructure, control, and application layers.  2. This project has furthered our understanding of effective methods to visualize network communication among parties using geo-spatial and interactive drill-down techniques.  3. This project has furthered our understanding of the application of machine learning to automate network management tasks such as network usage accounting and fault detection.     The application of software-defined control and measurement of a communication network along with the application of machine learning facilitates the automation of network management. For this reason, the advancements achieved by this project have furthered our understanding of how to develop the software that brings networks closer to autonomous operation.  Our software-defined network measurement stack is available to the public via GitHub; our account name is utepnetlab. OpenTap/OpenMeasure are our visions of the infrastructure layer, Sia is our vision of the control layer, and Ra/FiberPI are example network measurement applications.  Our data visualizations of network flow data and traffic matrices (i.e., the communication among parties) are also available to the public on our GitHub account. Our traffic matrix visualizations support various granularities of communicating parties (e.g., continent, country, organization).  Results of our application of machine learning to network usage accounting (we used supervised learning and feature engineering in this case) and fault detection (we used unsupervised learning, including outlier detection in this case) can be found in the research literature; see the publication list for this project.
