<AbstractNarration>There is a growing recognition of the need to engage youth in meaningful experiences with computing. This ITEST Strategies project will create a partnership of the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML), the Tri-City Technology Education Collaborative Inc. (TRITEC), and the urban school districts of Medford and Everett, MA to bring project-based, socially-relevant computing experiences to district middle school students.  The project will have immediate impact on the Medford and Everett districts' students and teachers.  The project will result in a sustainable program with ongoing benefits for the districts.  The project will contribute to the growing literature on computational thinking and appropriate ways to assess that learning in middle school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a 15- to 20-hour computing curriculum that is integrated with existing district technology and engineering courses. By the second project year, the curriculum will be in all seven district middle schools, and will be delivered to 450 students per year.  In addition, the team will conduct intensive 30-hour summer camps attended by 140 students per project year. Over the project's 3-year period, 1,100 students will participate during the school day, with 360 students also receiving a summer-intensive experience. Project curriculum will include creative project work and career awareness activities. Using MIT App Inventor, a blocks-based design environment for building mobile apps, students will develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. University computer science students and industry professionals will visit project classrooms and work with middle school students.  The team will investigate (1) student learning outcomes: how the project's school-day and summer-intensive project work and career awareness activities influence students' attitudes toward computing and ability to engage in computing practices; (2) teacher outcomes: how the project's collaborative professional development model leads to teacher content learning and curricular adoptions; and (3) broadening participation outcomes: how the school-day intervention leads to students' choice of continued involvement in computing, including the summer camps and future opportunities beyond middle school.</AbstractNarration>

In the project design, all students in the two districts received the teacher-developed computer science curriculum during at least once during their middle school years.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project contributed to the growing literature on approaches to computer science which broaden participation in computing. Based on the use of MIT App Inventor, a software system for making apps for mobile devices, students were engaged in making apps for social good. Teachers and students interpreted this charge in ways that were local and close to home. Students made apps that shared their interests with each other, including their diverse cultural heritages and typical American hobbies (like fashion preferences and musical affinities). They also made apps relevant to their school communities, and addressed societal needs of their own urban areas.</p> <p>Research revealed that students participating in the academic year curriculum reported increased confidence creating apps and creating apps to solve a community problem. An analysis of the student outcomes data indicated that the intervention appears to have a similar influence on all students, thereby meeting the project's aim of providing equitable opportunities to all and engaging those traditionally not engaged in computer science.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts.</strong> In addition to the students directly reached by the project's activities, the project has resulted in a new computer science curriculum which has become institutionalized at the two participating school districts. This will result in ongoing benefits to the students of these two districts.&nbsp;</p> <p>Beyond the immediate impacts to the partner districts, the project has shared its 20-hour middle school computer science curriculum with the computer science education community. The curriculum has served as a model for other similar initiatives. The project's research findings and other work products have been shared in publications and presentations at national and regional meetings, including those aimed at researchers and teachers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/23/2019<br>      Modified by: Fred&nbsp;G&nbsp;Martin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558132830777_girl-explaining-blocks-screen--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558132830777_girl-explaining-blocks-screen--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student explaining app programming to another"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558132830777_girl-explaining-blocks-screen--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student explaining app programming to another"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student explaining app programming to another</div> <div class="imageCredit">Akira Kamiya</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Fred&nbsp;G&nbsp;Martin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student explaining app programming to another</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558133112913_paper-design-of-app--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558133112913_paper-design-of-app--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student creating wireframe design of app"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558133112913_paper-design-of-app--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student creating wireframe design of app"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student creating wireframe design of app (drawing of how the app's screens will link together)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Akira Kamiya</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Fred&nbsp;G&nbsp;Martin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student creating wireframe design of app</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558133281958_healthy-snacks-app-screens--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558133281958_healthy-snacks-app-screens--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Three screens from &quot;Healthy Snacks&quot; app game"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558133281958_healthy-snacks-app-screens--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Three screens from &quot;Healthy Snacks&quot; app game"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Three screens from a student's "Healthy Snacks" app game</div> <div class="imageCredit">Akira Kamiya</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Fred&nbsp;G&nbsp;Martin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Three screens from "Healthy Snacks" app game</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558133343560_AndroidAppsbyMiddleSchoolPathwaysinComputerScienceonGooglePlay-GoogleChrome_053--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558133343560_AndroidAppsbyMiddleSchoolPathwaysinComputerScienceonGooglePlay-GoogleChrome_053--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student apps available in Google Play Store"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433592/1433592_10328766_1558133343560_AndroidAppsbyMiddleSchoolPathwaysinComputerScienceonGooglePlay-GoogleChrome_053--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student apps available in Google Play Store"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student apps available in Google Play Store</div> <div class="imageCredit">Fred Martin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Fred&nbsp;G&nbsp;Martin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student apps available in Google Play Store</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
