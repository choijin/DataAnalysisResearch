<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences program in the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, Professor Murray Johnston of the University of Delaware is studying the chemical mechanisms by which nanoparticles grow in the atmosphere. This project will support the work of three graduate students. These students will be broadly trained and capable of pursuing a career in areas such as environmental chemistry, industrial analytical chemistry, instrumentation, nanoscience, or academia. Society will benefit by training students who are able to predict how changes in human activity affects climate. Professor Johnston and graduate students will also work to increase awareness of environmental science among University of Delaware undergraduates and the general public, by incorporating the concepts and results of this work into formal coursework and public outreach events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles that grow fast enough, can reach a size where they serve as the seeds to form cloud droplets.  Understanding how these particles grow will assist the development of improved models to predict cloud formation and its impact on climate. Current regional and global atmospheric models are limited in their ability to predict the contribution of carbonaceous matter to nanoparticle growth rates during new particle formation (NPF). This knowledge gap represents the greatest remaining uncertainty for determining the impact of NPF on today's climate and climate forcing (the difference between pre-industrial times and now). The specific objective of the proposed work is to elucidate chemical mechanisms of nanoparticle growth by carbonaceous matter during NPF. The results obtained from this research will provide a fundamental basis for developing and improving models that rely on the prediction of nanoparticle growth by carbonaceous matter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit     This project used a combination of advanced analytical measurements and computational modeling to understand the mechanisms of particle growth by carbonaceous matter.  Three molecular systems for secondary aerosol formation were investigated, all of which were suspected to be important contributors to ambient nanoparticle formation and growth based on prior measurements of ambient nanoparticle chemical composition: 1) formation of imine/imidazole and related compounds from dicarbonyls in concentrated ammonium sulfate droplets, 2) accretion chemistry associated with secondary organic aerosol formation from monoterpenes, and 3) primary products and subsequent accretion chemistry involved in secondary aerosol formation from cyclic dimethyl siloxanes.  The results showed that multiphase chemistry, that is reactions in the particle phase that are driven by partitioning of semivolatile compounds from the gas phase to the particle phase, can greatly enhance formation of secondary aerosol.  Furthermore, this enhancement is particle size dependent, essentially "turning on" as the particles increase in size above a few tens of nanometers in diameter.  The results provide an improved chemical understanding of how nanoparticles grow in ambient air.  The molecular understanding gained from this research will assist the development of improved models of atmospheric aerosol formation on both regional and global scales, which will aid in the prediction of future environmental impacts.     Broader Impact     This project supported in part the dissertation research of eight Ph.D. students.  These students are broadly trained and capable of pursuing a career in areas such as environmental chemistry, industrial analytical chemistry, instrumentation, nanoscience, homeland security, or academia.  Three of the eight students graduated during the project period.  All three moved directly into full time positions with U.S. companies upon graduation.  One position involves the development of portable mass spectrometers for detection of chemicals important to homeland security.  The other two positions involve chemical characterization of complex industrial samples through the use of targeted and non-targeted screening by advanced mass spectrometry techniques.  The other five students are still working on their dissertations, and those close to graduation are already being recruited by potential employers.
