<AbstractNarration>The Tribal Colleges and Universities Program includes a focus on increasing the instructional capacity of tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) in the sciences, mathematics, engineering, and technology.  Desired impacts include attracting more indigenous students and minority male students into programs of study in these fields, thereby addressing underrepresentation on two fronts.  The goal of this project is to enhance the understanding of computational linguistics while also increasing the number of declared computer science majors among American Indian males at the participating institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will investigate the effects of collaborative computational linguistics research projects on the recruitment and retention of American Indian males into computer science. Under the proposed activity, QEM will recruit five-person teams (one computer science faculty member and four male computer science students) from six tribal colleges with existing computer science or information technology programs. QEM will host a two-day training and leadership development workshop, during which participating teams will learn basic theory and applications of computational linguistics to indigenous languages. At the workshop, students will collaborate and decide on projects to undertake upon return to their respective campuses. To increase collaboration during the academic year, the cohort of schools will include pairs of tribal colleges whose founding tribes speak each of three languages (Algonquian language family, Navajo language, Sioux language). Participating teams will share their research results, project benefits, and lessons learned at a follow-up workshop, where they also will discuss dissemination, recruitment, and sustainability strategies to expand interest among American Indian males in computational linguistics and computer science overall.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project addresses the underrepresentation of American Indian males in STEM. The goal of the project was to enhance the understanding of computational linguistics while also increasing the number of declared computer science majors among American Indian males at a sub section of Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs).   Key Outcomes  Computational Linguistics Information Sharing/Gathering Workshop: QEM hosted a two-day workshop in February 2017 where participants shared/learned about each other’s tribal history and about applications of computational linguistics and computing tools used in preservation and revitalization of indigenous languages. Twenty-three (23) participants comprising of faculty-student teams from the following five (5) TCUP grantee institutions attended the workshop:  Aaniiih Nakoda College                                           Fort Peck Community College                               Sitting Bull College                          Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute&ndash;SIPI       University of Alaska, Fairbanks                                 Qualitative Research Study: In 2018, through a no-cost extension request, the project shifted focus to exploratory research that involved obtaining perspectives of Computer Science/IT faculty via interviews. The goal was to investigate factors that facilitate Native American Student retention and persistence in Computer-related fields at Tribal Colleges and Universities. QEM interviewed five CS/IT faculty from the following Tribal Colleges and Universities:  Little Priest Tribal College; Oglala Lakota College;  Navajo Technical University; and  United Tribes Technical College.    Qualitative data revealed factors that influence Native American students’ pursuance and persistence in computer/IT-related programs. The four themes that emerged were: job opportunities, targeted institutional retention efforts, self-motivation, and course content and cultural influences. The themes allow for a better understanding of the economic, social and cultural components of Native American student experiences in pursuit of computer-related degrees and reveal innovative ways to engage TCUP students in their pursuit of CS/IT degrees. Moreover, they provide insight into factors that influence recruitment and retention of Native Americans in the computer-tech related fields.  QEM disseminated general information on the project via a website, emails, and written materials in meeting packets at QEM events and through teleconferences and meetings attended by TCUP project partners.      Project Website: http://www.qem.org/eager   QEM Network was established in July 1990, as a non-profit organization in Washington, DC, dedicated to improving education from underrepresented students throughout the nation.  QEM provides technical assistance to MSIs, internship opportunities for underrepresented students, and is an advocate for increasing college and career readiness in STEM.
