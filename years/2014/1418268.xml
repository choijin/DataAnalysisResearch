<AbstractNarration>This award supports the dissertation research project of Alix Johnson, PhD candidate at the University of California Santa Cruz.  Ms. Johnson's research investigates how the increase in private and public investment in global information infrastructure in Iceland affects social-cultural, economic, and governance systems, as well as national identity.  Information technology and trade is often proposed as a solution to the economic challenges of many rural Artic communities.  This research has the potential to inform other Arctic communities about the societal impacts of information technology as an approach to economic self-sufficiency in the north. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research project examines a range of ongoing efforts by private and public entities to make Iceland an "information haven" - an attractive location for storing data from around the world. By building data centers, founding start-ups, and passing "information-friendly" legislation, Icelanders hope to carve out a national niche and attract global data to Icelandic infrastructure. The project will explore how the development of this new infrastructure is changing local Icelandic livelihoods and senses of national identity.  Juxtaposing the globalization of information with nationalism and sovereignty, identity and place-making is a new look at these processes in the Arctic, processes that Arctic communities will see more of in the coming decades.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this project was to map the impacts of information infrastructures (for example, data centers, internet exchanges, and fiber-optic cables).  Though such networks are often described as immediate and immaterial, this research proposed that data transfer and storage actually have significant social, political, and ecological effects.  Such impacts were investigated through fourteen months of ethnographic research (interviews and participant observation) in Reykjav&iacute;k and Reykjanes, Iceland.  A current hot spot for data center siting, doing research in Iceland offered an opportunity to study infrastructural development in motion, and investigate how it was promoted and perceived.  The research found, first, that today?s information infrastructures are often tied to those that came before.  For example, in Iceland, data centers are being developed in the footprint of a former U.S. military base.  These infrastructural inheritances influence the shape that present networks can take: that is, some our most techno-utopian futures are entangled with the architecture of past hopes and dreams.  Second, the research found that Iceland occupies a special position as an intermediary in networks between the U.S. and Europe (a role it also reprises from its time as a military base).  This position has been profitable for data center developers, but often excludes Icelanders themselves, most of whom do not benefit from being on the way.  In fact, the research found that Iceland is often exploited in its middle position: as a cultural imaginary, as an industry outpost, and as a hinge between "green" industry and anthropogenic global warming.  As such, this project questions the concept of "connectivity," often imagined (at least since the European Enlightenment) as an inherent good.  Instead, the project illustrates some ambiguous effects of technological connection.  In doing so, it invites industry actors as well as individuals to reflect on our own habits of data consumption, showing how they play a pivotal role in the making and changing of place.    Findings from this project are compiled in the dissertation: "Compromising Connections: Icelandic Information Infrastructure and the Making of Marginality."  This research has also been presented at international conferences, published online, and will be submitted as journal articles for peer review.
