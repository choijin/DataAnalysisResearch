<AbstractNarration>1402736&lt;br/&gt;Pennathur/Gillespie&lt;br/&gt;UCSB/Rush Pres St Luke Med Ctr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to investigate novel separation mechanisms that exist in nanofluidic devices. In such nanochannels, a sample of solution is moved down a slit with two walls that are 10 to 100 nanometers apart. In nanoscale electrokinetic channels, molecules not only interact with each other, but also with the charged walls of the device, to the point that these solid/liquid interface interactions dominate the performance of the device. This project tests whether specially-fabricated nanochannels and novel buffer electrolyte solutions can greatly enhance separation of two similar analyte ions. Specifically, this project aims to embed electrodes in the walls to directly manipulate the wall charge and therefore the relative speed of the analytes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fabrication technique embeds electrodes into the walls and can produce slit heights of &lt;10 nm. The novel buffer ions will vary in size from small to large and charge from +1 to +3. This project aims to investigate new separation techniques based on nanofluidic ion transport at high surface charge, high ion valence, and confining channels using a synergistic collaboration between theory and experiment. Specifically, experiments will be used to validate a model based on classical (not quantum) density functional theory of fluids. Then, the model will be used to predict new separation mechanisms because exploring the large parameter set by numerical modeling is orders of magnitude faster than using hardware in the lab. Potential mechanisms discovered will be then be validated in the lab and the theory used to understand the physics of separation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to show the full range of what is possible for nanochannel-based separations. Specifically, the fundamental properties of the nanofluidic channels will be explored to define how the electrical double layer can be harnessed for ion transport and analyte separation. If successful, this project will, for the first time, systematically measure how changing surface charge and ion properties like size and valence define the double layer and transport/separation properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new basic knowledge will not only be applicable to separation science and engineering, but to any area of physics, chemistry, and biology where electrical double layers play a role. For example, the new physical insights can be applied to heavy metal processing, environmental monitoring, energy conversion, desalination, batteries, and electrochemical supercapacitors to increase their efficiency and possibly lead to new designs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed outreach activities include development of course materials, international activities and high school student outreach. All are well described and appear achievable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was part of a Collaborative Research project that combined theory (this component) and experiments to understand the electrical double layer in nanofluidic devices under conditions far from what had previously been studied.  The electrical double layer is the accumulation of positive ions (dissolved in water) near a negatively charged surface.  A nanofluidic device has two such negatively charged walls that are 10-100 nm apart, small enough so that the double layer takes up a significant component of the slit and therefore determines the current that is measured in the device when ions are driven down the slit with voltage or with pressure.  The overarching goal of the project was to understand how ion correlations effects like charge inversion can be used in the separation of molecules in solutions.  In the theory component of this project, we both analyzed the experiments and did fundamental calculations of the electrical double layer structure.  In the experimental component, we developed a new technique to concentrate analyte molecules that are present at very low concentrations so that they be analyzed and separated more easily (Analytical Chemistry 88, 6145-6150 (2016)); the theoretical analysis for this showed how charge inversion produced this concentration phenomenon by driving the liquid in one half of the device in the other direction to produce a stable front in the middle of the device where ions accumulated.  In another experimental technique, we developed a way to measure charge inversion (Nano Letters 18, 1191-1195 (2018)), and the theoretical analysis explained how the technique works; it showed that ions take some time to absorb to the surface before producing charge inversion and by computing a metric (the zeta potential) that quantified how much charge inversion had occurred.  For the fundamental calculations of the electrical double layer structure, we focused on parameter regimes that had not previously been studied before and we focused on systematic analyses to understand how the structure changes when parameters are changed over a large range.  This gave fundamental insights into how ions in the electrical double layer behave at a junction of two surface charges (Langmuir 33, 5642-5651 (2017)), what kinds of ions are best suited for certain kinds of sensors (Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical 230, 281-288 (2016)), and why simplified models of ions can correctly produce experimental results (Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics 19, 17816-17826 (2017)).  Lastly, a major focus was also on developing more efficient theories to compute the structure of the electric double layer (Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter 28, 244006 (2016)) and to assess how accurate these theories are (Physical Review E 98, 012116 (2018)).  Through the theoretical component of this project, we have learned how nanometer-scale ion correlations effects like charge inversion can be harnessed to produce macroscopic (measurable) phenomenon for new applications, especially related to separation science.  We also have a better understanding of how to model extreme conditions of the electrical double layer (e.g., very high surface charges and highly charged ions) by developing new theories and assessing their accuracy, as well as developing new data sets of the correct structure against which we can compare our more approximate (but faster) theories, AIP Advances 8, 025320 (2018).
