<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial funding for the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR), the locus for earth science activities at the National Research Council (NRC). BESR guides a range of projects and initiatives that provide independent, unbiased, scientific and engineering advice to the Nation on a broad spectrum of earth science issues in response to needs expressed by Congress, federal and state agencies, the science community, the private sector, and others. The proposed activities at the broadest level will encompass questions about the environment, natural hazards, energy, and natural resources and include analysis of fundamental and applied research at various scales; technology development and impacts; data provision and management (including monitoring, and geospatial data and infrastructure); and education, training, and workforce development. The proposed activities will be conducted by ad hoc committees under the Board and its five standing committees and will result in published consensus reports, short briefs, press releases, newsletters, congressional and federal agency briefings, webinars, and other products intended for public dissemination.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Board on Earth Sciences and Resources is the locus for all Earth science and resource activities at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.  During the award period, the board, with its volunteer membership of scientists and engineers and the National Academies staff, addressed a range of projects and initiatives that provided independent, unbiased, scientific advice and information on a broad set of Earth science issues to decision and policy makers in Congress, federal and state government agencies, the research community, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and the public.  The activities of the board also contributed toward understanding the interactions of fundamental processes within the terrestrial system and added to the knowledge base needed for society to steward and manage its critical resources to sustain the human and natural environment. While the work of the board is not generally primary scholarship, the board and its standing committees help to raise the profile of the Earth sciences to broad audiences and identify key issues for future work across diverse sectors, actors, and fields of study, thus having impact on the development of the science itself.  Together with its committees, the board convened and facilitated meetings, workshops, roundtables, and webinars, and employed a variety of communication tools to provide scientific information and forums for discussion with these stakeholders on topics such as: landslides and landslide risk; Earth data science and big data; the Cascadia subduction zone and integrative subduction zone science; space observations of the interior, surface, and dynamics of the Earth; subsurface contaminants and fluid-rock interaction; seismic hazards and nuclear waste storage; and machine learning and data-intensive computing for solid-Earth geophysics.  Through consensus studies, the committees of the board provided actionable recommendations to decision makers in government, academia, industry, and the non-profit sector on issues including the research challenges for Earth science in the coming decade; the needs for the future geodetic infrastructure; water research priorities for the nation; monitoring underground coal mine dust exposures; the nature of volcanic eruptions and new research; modeling and monitoring of fractured rock; and the long-term evolution of the human-natural system of the U.S. Gulf Coast.  The board increased the number of registrants to its various listservs by several thousand people; increased the registration and attendance metrics for several webinars each year to a minimum of several hundred people per webinar; increased the racial, gender, and geographic diversity of the Board membership; continued outreach of the board and its committees to audiences at national and international conferences and meetings; and supported the dissemination and broad reach of its consensus reports, measured by more than 30,000 downloads of free PDFs of these reports. This type of outreach aids in promoting new research avenues in the Earth sciences and in advancing the intellectual basis for decision- and policy-making.
