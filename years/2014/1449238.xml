<AbstractNarration>An important component for producing successful outcomes in engineering design and innovation is individuals' analytical problem solving abilities. These can be greatly enhanced by means of modeling and simulation processes. Yet, educational strategies for incorporating modeling and simulation skills into undergraduate disciplinary courses have not kept pace with equipping undergraduate engineering students with computational skills needed to solve problems in existing or new application fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project seeks to understand and enhance modeling and simulation practices in undergraduate engineering education. Specifically, this project will identify and validate pathways that students may follow as they progress toward mastery of modeling and simulation skills now needed for workplace engineering readiness. Outcomes will also include factors that contribute to, or prevent, effective teaching and learning with modeling and simulation. As part of the effort, the project will explore the following research questions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) How do students experience model-based reasoning in the context of modeling and simulation practices? &lt;br/&gt;(2) How do students experience problem solving in the context of modeling and simulation practices? &lt;br/&gt;(3) How the observed patterns of students? use of computational tools support or hinder student model-based reasoning when problem solving (derived from Q1 &amp; Q2)?&lt;br/&gt;4) What are different trajectories and levels of sophistication of modeling and simulation practices in engineering as evidenced by student performances and understandings?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is in the way it can increase the chances for engineering discovery and innovation success, helping the nation take advantage of the role of modeling and simulation sooner, better, and with greater confidence. The project engages engineering faculty, undergraduate and graduate students in classroom design-based research and also provides outreach and dissemination through professional development of K-12 teachers and instructors at community colleges. The project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally, NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning theories and systems.</AbstractNarration>
