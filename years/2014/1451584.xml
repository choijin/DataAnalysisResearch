<AbstractNarration>Language acquisition stands as the signature intellectual achievement of the human species. The scientific study of language acquisition relates patterns of first and second language acquisition to detailed hypotheses about developing grammatical representations, the mechanisms by which these representations are acquired, and the information processing mechanisms through which these representations are engaged in real time language use by first and second language learners. The 6th Generative Approaches to Language Acquisition -- North America conference, to be held February 19-21, 2015, will bring together researchers examining all aspects of first and second language acquisition. The conference will host a special session focusing on the computational mechanisms through which learners use the language they are exposed to to build a particular grammar. This special session will both introduce cutting edge computational methods to the broader developmental linguistics community and spur new links between empirical research on children's language development with explicit computational models of language learning. The special theme of the conference will encourage collaboration and further research in this area, extending the range of data that computational linguists see as relevant to modeling acquisition and highlighting the importance for developmental linguists of thinking about the role of input and the mechanisms that use it in shaping language acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the conference is a series of invited talks by six prominent researchers with relevant expertise. Together, the speakers address key issues in language learning spanning syntax, phonology, morphology, bilingualism and heritage language acquisition, and bring together a diverse range of theoretical and methodological approaches. In addition, the conference encourages broad participation. Four of the six invited speakers are women and the conference provides travel awards to graduate student presenters. The papers of the invited speakers will be published in Language Acquisition: A Journal of Developmental Linguistics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The 2015 Generative Approaches to Language Acquisition-North America (GALANA) conference, with a special theme on Learning in Generative Grammar, was held at the University of Maryland in College Park, MD, on February 19-21, 2015. GALANA provides an outlet for linguistically informed work on language acquisition, relating results in first and second language acquisition to detailed hypotheses about developing grammatical representations, the mechanisms by which these representations are acquired, and the information processing mechanisms through which these representations are engaged in real time language use by first and second language learners. The special session of the conference focused on computational mechanisms through which learners might traverse the space of possible grammars in acquiring a specific language.   The conference featured 6 invited talks, 4 in the special session and 2 in the main session, all by leading experts in the field. In addition to invited talks, there were 20 refereed talks and 20 refereed poster presentations. One-hundred sixty people attended the conference.      The special session highlighted computational approaches to language acquisition serving both to introduce these methods to the broader developmental linguistics community and to spur new links between empirical research on children's language development with explicit computational models of grammar and learning. The special theme of the conference encouraged colalboration and further research in this area, extending the range of data that computational linguists see as relevant to modeling acquisition and highlighting the importance for developmental linguists of thinking about the role of input and the mechanisms that use it in shaping language acquisition.   The findings of the conference were disseminated in two outlets: a proceedings volume published by Cascadilla Press and a special issue of the journal Language Acquisition, to appear in 2017.   The conference included broad participation from junior scholars and from women in all aspects of the meeting. Four of the six invited speakers were women, and the project funded ten travel awards for graduate student authors.   Finally, by including graduate and undergraduate students in the organization and logistical aspects of the conference, we provided access to parts of the professional lives of linguists that many students might not otherwise have been exposd to, giving them a more realistic understanding of the field from an intellectual and professional vantage point.
