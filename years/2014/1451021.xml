<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Researchers funded by the National Science Foundation's XPS program attended a workshop, which encompassed discussions about the past, present, and future of exploiting parallelism and scalability. Specifically, the workshop reviewed current projects and looked forward in shaping the future of XPS. To this end, the workshop engaged in "big picture" discussions to identify priorities for future research.   The findings from the XPS workshop are summarized in a report---"Exploiting Parallelism and Scalability: Report on an NSF-Sponsored Workshop". XPS researchers comprise a vibrant community that finds compelling reasons to coordinate innovation across hardware and software. Indeed, the case for coordination is stronger today than it was a few years ago. Many of the newest advances in computing have integrated previously disparate pursuits --- programming models for approximate architectures; architectures for emerging non-volatile memories; architectures for specific application domains; machine learning and economic game theory for systems management --- and opportunities abound for further research that re-thinks abstraction layers for performance, efficiency, and scalability. In future, XPS research is needed to coordinate advances in five fundamental areas.  1) Applications and Algorithms. XPS research is needed to address grand societal problems with new algorithms that provide the desired answers with less work and with programming systems that provide clean abstractions between elegant programming models and sophisticated run-time systems.  2) Architecture and Systems. Design for manageability anticipates management challenges during design. In architecture, research is needed in design and optimization to produce efficient and heterogeneous hardware components. In systems, research is needed in allocation and scheduling to ensure service quality for competitive users.  3) Technologies. Research is needed to exploit emerging technologies. Research is needed in parameterized models to accommodate the inherent uncertainty in new technologies, especially those that might qualitatively change the way systems hold data (e.g., non-volatile memories and storage) and communicate data (e.g., packaging and interconnection networks).  4) Methodologies. XPS research has been and must continue to be interdisciplinary, cutting across multiple abstraction layers in the hardware-software stack. Technology research should influence the design of balanced architectures, and architecture research should influence the design of balanced systems for next-generation applications.  5) Risks. As the landscape of computing changes, XPS research must maintain a broad perspective while avoiding pitfalls. Diminishing marginal returns and variants of Amdahl?s Law requires holistic research strategies. Communicating and building a community with other researchers, in academia  and industry, are prerequisites for success.  These findings highlight the breadth of research required to lay a foundation for computing in a post-Dennard, post-Moore era. Over the past few years, XPS researchers have collaborated to advance these priorities for innovation. Further sustained research in electrical engineering and computer science builds a strong foundation for future, yet-to-be-imagined applications of computing.
