<AbstractNarration>An increasing amount of computation is moving into the Cloud and large-scale data centers.  Hosted web-applications, such as social networks, hosted email, and photo sharing, are all examples of applications, which have moved into the Cloud.  In order to control costs and save energy, maximizing the computational efficiency of datacenter computers is of paramount importance.  This research project investigates computational efficiency in datacenter processors by looking for commonality between all of the applications that are executing in the Cloud.  This project explores how to change a microprocessor core to save energy by exploiting the commonality available between applications in the Cloud.  In addition, this project utilizes an integrated education plan that will disseminate information about computer architecture inside of the University, across the New York region, and across the world through the use of a Massively Open Online Course (MOOC).  Accelerating data center and big data applications can have large societal impact by helping humans understand data that has been collected, thus enabling the understanding of social trends and public health challenges. The success of the research project will create more efficient data centers that will enable humanity to answer societal big data questions and have richer Internet experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how to create computer architectures that can exploit similarity between programs executing on different cores across the data center.  A software system identifies likely candidates that exhibit commonality.  Once likely commonality has been identified, micro-architectural information is sent between different cores or within a single core to enable the execution of one program to reduce the energy needed to execute a second similar program.  This project investigates what is the best micro-architectural information to share between cores executing common programs and how it is best to send that information between cores.  In particular, this project investigates customizing on-chip networks specialized for sending commonality information and how to modify a manycore processor to harvest common micro-architectural information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work has investigated how to create novel computer architectures that can take advantage of commonality in the programs and workloads that are executed.  In particular, this work has investigated how to change the architecture and micro-architecture of computing systems and microprocessors such that the energy used and time taken to execute an application or workload could be reduced.  As an increasing amount of computation has moved to the Cloud and large data centers, the opportunity for exploiting commonality at the architecture and micro-architecture level has increased.  In some use cases, the move to Cloud computing has physically co-located in the same data center or computer the execution of the same or similar application which in the past was distributed across many desktop computers.  For instance, applications such as email clients or word processing have moved from desktops running applications to hosted web-applications with portions of them executing in the Cloud.  This centralization of applications in the Cloud has opened up opportunities for computer systems and even computer architectures and micro-architectures to exploit the commonality of the computer code and data.  One technique studied by this work is the use of memoization (remembering previous results with the same inputs) at the micro-architectural level to accelerate hardware accelerators.  By remembering prior results and wrapping a hardware accelerator in a custom memory system, if the same result had been previously computed, the result can simply be loaded from the memory instead of re-computing the result.  This can hence lead to both faster execution and energy savings for a computation.  This work has also studied how to design microprocessor hardware that could aid in memoization across the data center (beyond one computer) and this work has investigated how to share micro-architectural patterns such as branch predictor patterns and prefetch information across cores in a multi-core processor.  In addition to the intellectual merits of this work, it has also contributed to the professional development and training of multiple graduate students supported by this work.  In particular, it has helped fund students traveling to top conferences in the field.  Also, the research done in this work has positively influenced the teaching of Computer Architecture at Princeton at both the undergraduate and graduate level.
