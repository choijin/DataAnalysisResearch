<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds to partially support the 17th annual Conference Experience for Undergraduates (CEU), which is held as part of the Fall Meeting of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics. This year's meeting will be held October 7 - 11, 2014, in Waikloloa, Hawaii and will be held jointly with the Japanese Physical Society. The CEU is a natural venue for students who have had an undergraduate research experience to present the results of their work and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers. The CEU has been immensely successful in fostering this interaction, which helps students to have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know some of the junior future leaders. Partial support will be provided for approximately 20 undergraduate students, out of a planned total of 125.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this grant was to provide travel and lodging assistance to approximately 20 undergraduate students from around the nation to participate in the 2014 Conference Experience for Undergraduates.  CEU14 was held in October 2014 in conjunction with the joint fall meeting of the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society and of the Japanese Physical Society in Waikoloa, HI.  A total of 133 undergraduate students from the US and Japan participated in CEU14, and events specifically arranged for them included a research poster session, two nuclear physics seminars, a graduate school fair, and a social gathering.  Travel award decisions were made on the basis of project merit, and students submitted a research abstract and a personal contribution statement in order to be considered.  A team of 10 DNP members served on the review committee, and their recommendations were used to determine the awards distribution.  A survey was administered to participants after the conference was over.  Students benefit from interacting with professionals in the field of nuclear physics, and several report on being favorably motivated to consider pursuing an advanced degree in nuclear physics, more so than before they attended the conference.   Members of the DNP were very supportive of the undergraduates' presence at the meeting, and several spent time engaging students in conversation and recruiting them for their graduate physics programs.
