<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Susan K Jacobson, at University of Florida, Ph.D. student Nia Haynes will analyze the influence of two national internship programs on racial and ethnic minority youth perceptions about natural resource careers, using a framework based on social cognitive career theory. She will also conduct a quantitative survey of current students in natural resource fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will help promote diversity in the natural resource career fields and will result in the co-PI  completing theoretically driven research using social research designs, methods and analysis. The researchers will build partnerships with natural resource institutions and agencies that will encourage future collaborations. Research results will be disseminated through presentations at stakeholder meetings, an international conference, through manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed journals, and a report to natural resource agencies, non-government organizations and academic programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research has addressed the underrepresentation of minorities in traditional science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, but few studies have focused on conservation and natural resource (CNR) careers. This study expands our understanding of the salient factors that affect minority recruitment and retention into CNR careers. This research helps academia and organizations identify barriers and opportunities to offer improved support to individuals to enhance the representation of minorities in this field. Greater diversity in the natural resource field will not only increase the numbers of minorities in these careers but will also help to enhance the breadth and scope of knowledge and create broader impacts with communities of color.  We conducted this study in two phases 1) an assessment of the impacts of three national diversity internship programs on minority studentsÆ self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and career goals, and 2) an online survey of undergraduate CNR and non-CNR studentsÆ perceptions of CNR careers, their career-related self-efficacy and outcome expectations. We used social cognitive career theory (SCCT) to guide our exploration of these factors. This theory suggests that self-efficacy (beliefs in the capacity to succeed in specific tasks) and outcome expectations (what individuals expect will happen as a result of a given action) help shape career interests, goals, and actions.

These findings should help agencies and organizations improve programs aimed at supporting underrepresented groups in CNR fields.
