<AbstractNarration>The rapid urbanization being experienced today around the world is both lauded and feared by policy and development experts. Yet there are no standardized definitions of what constitutes the "urban" or how it should be measured, even in United Nations data bases. Consequently, urbanization projects are informed by variable and shifting definitions and goals. Because these projects include not only the expansion of cities and rural development but also large-scale demolition of urban spaces and relocation of city residents, urbanization can no longer be thought of as simply population shift or city growth. We need to better understand the effects of the shifting aims and ideologies that direct current urbanization policies and programs in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Chicago doctoral student Victoria Nguyen, who is supervised by Dr. Judith Farquhar, will undertake 12 months of ethnographic field research on the contemporary meaning and significance of urbanization. She will focus in particular on how diverse state, institutional, and everyday urban actors articulate and mediate changing ideologies and expectations of "correct urbanity." The research will be conducted in Beijing, China, a particularly apt research site because China is presently executing one of the most ambitious urbanization programs in modern history. The country's New National Urbanization Plan seeks to move 250 million rural residents into cities and towns within the next 12 years and also to remedy what it diagnoses as pervasive "urban disease" in China's largest and oldest cities. Beijing's antiquity should make the conflicts around urbanization particularly visible and therefore amenable to social scientific research.  Nguyen's research will take place at four sites: a state-owned development firm, a cultural preservation NGO, international urban think-tanks, and within the neighborhoods of Old Beijing. Using such research methods as interviews and participant observation, the researcher will collect information on how shifting ideals of urban life affect built and social environments, the delineation of urban and non-urban spaces, historical preservation and demolition, and social inclusion and exclusion. Findings from the research will have applicability to theorizing the significance of urbanization in the world today, wherever it takes place, including in the United States. Her findings should also be helpful to planners, policy makers, and citizens who confront and must respond to urbanization in their daily lives.</AbstractNarration>

During her funding period, she travelled to Beijing, China to investigate firsthand the social effects of the country?s current mass urbanization plan on the life of cities and their inhabitants. As a social anthropologist, Nguyen was interested in understanding the rising salience of the city and urbanity as the purported keys to social and economic prosperity in contemporary China&mdash;a historically agricultural civilization and culture. She was particularly focused on how and to what effect culturally and historically specific ideas of the ?urban? are being translated, measured, and authorized as quantitative and objective national goals in late socialist China. Her research abroad combined working closely with local communities and residents, in addition to urban think tanks, state development agencies, and urban planning institutes.  As a participant observer, during this time Nguyen lived and worked in Beijing?s historic old city, a site now considered "improperly urban" under China?s new urbanization policy and undergoing rapid redevelopment as a result. This provided valuable insight into daily life in an urban-rural grey zone that was both a popular settlement for new migrants from the countryside as well as several generations of some of Beijing?s oldest families.
