<AbstractNarration>1438324 (Gonzalez). This research has three objectives: a) investigate the environmental and energy sustainability of urbanized tropical coastal systems; b) engage and educate a broad audience on the sustainability of tropical coastal areas; and c) create new data sets, modeling tools and best practice guides for local stakeholders. The project will be led by the CUNY Remote Sensing Earth System Institute, based at the City College of New York (CCNY), in partnership with a long-term academic partner in Puerto Rico (University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez), joining efforts with NOAA, and local and regional stakeholders in the Caribbean and in Puerto Rico. It will be a trans-regional educational and training resource through developing data, products, and educational strategies to engage students and the general public on the subject of sustainability of sensitive tropical coastal regions. The program will be applied directly in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico and specifically in San Juan City, a coastal location that offers excellent opportunities for knowledge creation on energy and environmental sustainability. Tropical coastal areas contain almost one-third of the total world population and are highly vulnerable to Earth's changing climate. The rapid growth of these locations to accommodate growing populations and economic development is manifested in significant land use changes for urbanization. These two combined processes - climate change &amp; urbanization- present a compounded risk to the well-being of the coupled human-natural system in these sensitive regions. This is the origin for this research effort guided by the fundamental science question: How is the energy sustainability of urbanized tropical coastal systems being modified by human interventions and climate change? Energy demands in tropical coastal regions are directly linked to warming environments due to the large demands from the built environment for human comfort.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the research setting of the Caribbean, and in San Juan, Puerto Rico, there is clear evidence of a warming regional environment and local impacts of rapid urbanization. A multi-disciplinary observation and modeling framework will be organized in which regional climate records and global climate predictions are dynamically downscaled to the region of interest using high resolution regional climate models taking into consideration the surrounding ocean areas, and their interplay with the regional and local climate and landscape. The large scale coupling is extremely important to capture signals of the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans that result in Caribbean sea surface temperature modulation. The energy variable will be investigated with climate and energy records and using state-of-the-art building energy models at the city scale, coupled to the climate models. The modeling will be complemented by a regional and local data integration effort that will draw from existing environmental networks from multiple sources and from new data to be gathered from remote sensing capabilities to quantify environmental variables relevant to the energy activity. The detailed modeling approaches and integrated observations will be coupled with methodologies to involve key stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

Extreme weather events such as heat wave events could affect the human health and energy demands. Mitigating these impacts will become crucial for regions to protect the population.  This US National Science Foundation project was a collaboration of Hispanic Serving Institutions; The City College of Nw York, and The University of Puerto Rico-Mayag?ez.  The project had the main goal of improving our understanding of the relationship between these environmental changes and energy activity for the Caribbean region.  The Intra-Americas and Caribbean region (IAC) was used as test region. Recent reports for the region show a rapidly increasing in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) at rates of 0.027oF per year.   Technical Merits:   During the early part of the effort a human discomfort index (HDI) was defined as indicator of the departure of the environmental conditions from human comfort based on heat index; an environmental variable that combines temperature and humidity and it is used as human comfort indicator.  The HDI for the Caribbean clearly reflects a region that will require higher energy consumption for air conditioning systems in order to maintain the population at comfortable levels.  These environmental trends were observed to correlate well with reported actual energy demands for most countries across the region, and for Puerto Rico in particular where most data were available.     Projections of energy demand per capita in the 21st Century were accomplished using the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 &amp; 8.5) scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

It was also found that roof integrated solar PV exceeds current energy demands for the city of San Juan, and have a small mitigation impact in the urban heat island of San Juan.     The team also developed a real-time algorithm to estimate relative humidity based on GOES-13 and was validated with GOES-16.  The estimation algorithm is based GOES data and regression models, which were developed in homogeneous climatic regions that were identified in the Mesoamerica and Caribbean countries.  The proposed retrieve algorithm was validated with GOES-16 data during the first week of February 2018.  The validation data includes 13,383 measurements from stations that exhibited more than 80% of data.  It was concluded that the average of mean absolute error was 7.39 % and root mean squared error was 9.32 %.  Estimates of RH are especially important for applications in weather and climate forecasting, health, agricultural development, and energy.
