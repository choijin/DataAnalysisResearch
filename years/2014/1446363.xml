<AbstractNarration>Engineers are valued for the way they solve problems where a strategy is followed that uses simplified, idealized, diagrammatic and mathematical models, and quantitative analyses. Students find this strategy very difficult to learn. This project will investigate an innovative learning environment, called the problem solving studio (PSS), that previous pilot studies have suggested help students learn engineering ways of thinking. This project will build on these pilot studies to answer the following questions: 1) How does PSS affect the approaches students take to learning, as compared to more traditional lecture-based courses? 2) How does PSS affect students' sense of empowerment? and 3) What are the relationships among students' approaches to learning, their sense of empowerment, and their learning? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will identify the key principles and design criteria that are needed to create an effective flipped classroom, which is a new student-centered approach to instruction that is rapidly gaining popularity in engineering departments. Outcomes from this project will improve understanding of how to effectively teach entry-level engineering courses, and will shed light on why most, but not all, students thrive in flipped classroom learning environments. The project has the potential to transform how engineering faculty configure their gateway courses for greater student motivation, more effective approaches to learning, and most importantly, greater gains in how well students learn to think like engineers. The project holds promise for providing instructors a road map to success for flipping their classrooms, thus increasing the number of STEM faculty who are engaged in this effective pedagogy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Engineering education has a challenge: too many students struggle in entry-level courses, with the result that some leave the field entirely.  One reason for this is that many engineering courses use outdated pedagogical methods, such as lecturing, that do not engage students in working with each other, or the instructor, to do real engineering work. To contribute to solving this problem, we have created a highly interactive learning environment called the problem-solving studio (PSS) that is well suited for use in courses that are heavy in highly technical and abstract engineering content. As such, this project directly addressed an immediate challenge facing undergraduate STEM education: how to best make use of the time that instructors have with their students once they have made the decision to no longer use that time to lecture.  This project focused on the use of PSS in biomedical engineering but it has broader impacts.  By having investigated why and how the PSS approach works for biomedical engineering students, it has expanded our knowledge base of best practice principles for designing highly technical engineering courses in a way that will be effective for a broader range of students in all science and engineering majors.  Another impact is that as more faculty members consider experimenting with and instituting flipped or blended classrooms that leverage technology in novel ways, PSS is a ready-made, relatively low cost model for what to do when the lecture moves out of the classroom.  This is something that most faculty struggle to figure out how to do even when they are motivated to create a more interactive classroom. This work provides instructors a roadmap to success as they seek to adopt more effective pedagogical approaches for teaching engineering.
