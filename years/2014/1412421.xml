<AbstractNarration>The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a major new international observatory to study the low-frequency radio sky. Kaplan and Croft will develop new capabilities to observe and identify transient and variable radio sources.  This will provide insight about explosive and flaring sources, from nearby stars to distant galaxies. These techniques will be necessary to maximize the scientific return from the next generation of radio telescopes. Kaplan and Croft will also introduce undergraduate students to the excitement of this growing field, both through focused, in-depth research projects with individual students, and through regular discussions with a larger group of students covering research methods, advances in the field, and large-scale participatory projects. They will continue working to increase representation of underrepresented minorities through public talks, school visits, workshops, star parties, and web materials, exploring creative ways to attract them to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers through campus-based activities and researcher visits to local schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Co-PIs are members of the MWA transient collaboration.  They will develop tools to recover transients from deep, low-frequency radio images out of the galactic plane obtained for Epoch of Reionization (EoR) studies.  They will also conduct pointed observations in the galactic plane to search for transient and variable radio counterparts to X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei, stellar coronal sources, and previously unknown sources.  Radio light curves will be released to the astronomical community.  Characterizing variable sources in the background is also an important step towards extracting the redshifted 21 cm emission from the EoR images, a key project of MWA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: For this project we used the Murchison WidefieldArray (MWA) and related radio telescopes to study transient and variable phenomena.  This included: -) dedicated campaigns on targets of interest like the first detection of a flare star (UV Ceti) with a modern radio interferometer -) identification of a new ionospheric phenomenon found while quantifying the effects of ionospheric variability on transient detection -) a deep, prompt, automated search for coherent emission from a short gamma-ray burst -) multi-messenger searches for emission from binary black hole mergers and high-energy neutrinos -) searches for low-frequency fast radio bursts, both done blindly and simultaneously with detections at higher frequencies -) blind searches for radio transients and variable sources -) searches for radio emission from exoplanet systems To accomplish these tasks we contributed significantly to the development of techniques and tools for the analysis of low-frequency radio data and helped motivate the upgrade of the MWA that took place in 2016-2017.  Many of these areas have since expanded into larger research topics, using multiple telescopes for large-scale surveys.  For instance we have moved beyond studies of individual flare stars with the MWA to studies of the population using radio, optical, and X-ray telescopes.  We have also assisted in the development of a new, more flexible framework for automated followup of multi-messenger alerts, and are working toward a much larger-scale fast radio burst search using more appropriate algorithms.   Following the first binary neutron star merger discovered in gravitational waves, we used MWA along with higher-frequency radio telescopes to understand the radio emission from that event.  This included detailed, long-term modeling of the lightcurve that helped us understand the energetics and geometry of the explosion.   Broader Impacts: we delivered a number of public outreach talks, such as lectures in the Science@Cal public lecture series,  at the Malone Heads of School conference, and at local astronomy clubs.  We led an undergraduate astronomy club at UW-Milwaukee where ~15 students met weekly for discussion of astronomy, astronomical techniques, research methodology, and radio astronomy.  There were special trips to sites of interest like Adler Planetarium and Fermilab.  We developed exhibits for a MakerFaire booth focused on time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, including 3D printed examples of radio data which were made publicly available through the thingiverse website.
