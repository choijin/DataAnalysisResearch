<AbstractNarration>Many communities across the country are developing "maker spaces," environments that combine physical fabrication equipment, social communities of people working together, and educational activities for learning how to design and create objects. Increasingly, maker spaces and maker technologies are being designed to provide extended learning opportunities for school-aged young people. Unfortunately, few youth from under-represented populations have had the opportunity to participate in these maker spaces, and many communities do not have the resources to establish facilities dedicated to making activities.  This project, a collaboration of faculty at California State University, San Marcos and San Diego County Office of Education, the Vista Unified School District, and the San Diego Fab Lab, is a feasibility study that will work to address these needs by implementing and evaluating a pilot Mobile Making program in an underserved youth population.  It will bring Making to four after-school programs in underserved communities in San Diego by using a van to take both equipment and undergraduate student mentors to program sites.  At these sites, between 50% and 90% of the students are Hispanic or Latino and between 40% and 90% are eligible for free or reduced price lunch.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project employs a research-based approach to the design and implementation of the Mobile Making program, coupled with an evidenced-based plan for developing a model for future dissemination.  Project objectives are:  increasing the participants' interest, self-efficacy, and perception of the relevance of Making/STEM in everyday life; identifying and overcoming challenges associated with a Mobile Making program; developing a model for implementing and assessing Mobile Making in underserved communities; and disseminating materials and guides for practitioners.  Development will be guided by five research-based principles for design of out-of-school time programs in underserved communities: access to resources; ethnically diverse near-peer leaders; authentic activities; legitimacy within the community; and ongoing input from participants.  To inform program development and implementation, including continuous monitoring and adjustment throughout the two-year initiative, the evaluation component will use a mixed methods approach to study outcomes with respect to the students, their parents and the undergraduate mentors.   Future work will apply the lessons learned in the project to guide implementations and study the model's applicability in other informal education settings.  The dissemination plan will include publication of project findings, activities, practitioner's guides, and the model for implementing making programs in underserved communities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>&ldquo;Making&rdquo; STEM Relevant in Underserved Communities </em>was an AISL Pathways project to develop a research-based model for engaging underserved audiences in making. Making is a design-based, participant-driven endeavor based on a philosophy of &ldquo;learning by doing.&rdquo; Propelled by their own curiosity, Makers look for new ways to solve problems and then share their ideas with others. Many educators view making as an opportunity for substantive STEM engagement and inspiring the next generation of STEM innovators. However, inequalities in access to resources, such as Maker spaces with fee-based membership models, raise questions about how to broaden participation in Making. This project filled a need for informal science education to engage under-represented audiences in Making, and to guide these efforts with evidence-based models.</p> <p>&ldquo;Making&rdquo; STEM Relevant established an after-school program, called Mobile Making, at ethnically and socioeconomically diverse middle schools. Evaluation documented positive impacts on participants, and identified six essential program elements. Experience with the program guided development of a general model for designing making programs for different social, cultural, and socioeconomic contexts.</p> <p>Mobile Making operated in after-school programs at four middle schools in the Vista Unified School District, near California State University San Marcos, in north San Diego County. The middle schools range from 46% to 90% Hispanic/Latino students, and between 45% and 90% of students qualifying for free or reduced lunch. Teams of highly qualified and ethnically diverse undergraduate science and math majors, called STEM Ambassadors, led weekly sessions that introduced participants to a variety of authentic making activities. The STEM Ambassadors brought materials, equipment, and tools directly to the school sites. Family Maker activities for parents and families were held during the school sites&rsquo; parent nights. The project exceeded its goals for participation, with over 275 students regularly engaging in the afterschool activities. The project developed facilitator guides for many of the making activities, handouts, instructional videos, and other&nbsp;practitioner guides.</p> <p>Five research-based design principles for effective out-of-school time programs guided the development of the Mobile Making program (table 1). These were: (1) access to resources, (2) ethnically diverse near-peer leaders, (3) authentic activities, (4) legitimacy within community, and (5) ongoing input guidance from participants. Following the initial implementation year, a sixth design principle was added: university-site partnerships and community engagement to facilitate program success.&nbsp;</p> <p>Based on iterative design, the project used successive approximation to shape, test, and refine the project work over the two-year pilot period. &nbsp;Evaluation - in the form of pre/post surveys, focus groups, and observations - was integrated into each aspect of this work and accomplished in parallel with the program&rsquo;s implementation across both project years.</p> <p>Evaluation findings provide promising evidence of the program&rsquo;s impact. As presented in figure 1, participating students spent nearly 90% of their time on-task. Participants indicated heightened interest in a science-related career, stronger belief that their community finds science important, greater acknowledgement and/or awareness that they use science every day in their lives, and higher recognition that (a) they like to explain how things work and (b) they are good at working with other people (figure 2). In the preceding areas, the differences from pre- to post-survey were statistically significant and post-survey ratings were relatively high (clustering around 4.0 on a 5-point scale). In almost all cases, participants recorded higher ratings on the post-survey relative to the pre-survey.</p> <p>In an analysis that sought to understand the impact of the design principles on the program, findings suggest that each design principle contributed to the program outcomes. Most important were design principles focused on (a) providing near-peer leadership and support to participating students and (b) the value of authentic, real-world-connected activities that established relevance for participating students. Evaluation suggests that providing the support necessary for students to successfully engage in and complete activities - ones with obvious links to the real world to make them relevant for student makers - leads to a powerful system through which meaningful making occurs in the afterschool program. After-school making was particularly suited to the middle (versus high) school level.</p> <p>Project evaluation also documented positive impacts on the undergraduate STEM Ambassadors (figure 3). These include (1) increased technical, leadership, and communication skills, (2) a sense of personal accomplishment and positive contribution to others, and (3) expanded knowledge of science-related careers and greater agreement that their community has an interest in science and technology.</p> <p>In a forward-looking mid-project addition, the project team validated the integration of a community service learning component that leveraged undergraduate science majors to assist in program implementation and reduce reliance on compensated personnel.</p> <p>Overall, this two-year Pathways project successfully implemented an afterschool making program that positively impacted more than 290 participating students. The promising proof of concept, impact evidence, and community service learning pilot indicate the Mobile Making model is well positioned to increase in scale and with continued efficacy.</p><br> <p>
