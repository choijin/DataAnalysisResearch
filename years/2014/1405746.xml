<AbstractNarration>Modern technologies allow researchers to measure an unprecedentedly large number of attributes regarding the subjects of their study.  An important question in many applications is how one can infer from such data the underlying relationships between these attributes.  Such an objective can be expressed through a fundamental construct in the field of statistics known as the covariance matrix.  Using classical statistical techniques would require one to collect data on a prohibitively large number of subjects to reliably estimate this matrix.  In this work, novel statistical methods will be developed that allow researchers to make sound inferences by making better use of their data given the limited number of subjects they have available.  The methods developed will be applicable in a wide range of fields.  For example, in biology, one can infer the structures of massive networks of genes based on a small number of samples.  Beyond being an end in itself, the covariance matrix is a key ingredient in many common statistical procedures.  Thus, by developing the ability to reliably estimate it from small numbers of subjects, this work will enable the use of many other methods that would otherwise be unavailable to researchers.  Application areas include disease diagnosis, basic biology, sensor networks, and social networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program will focus on high-dimensional covariance estimation and capitalize on the strengths of the convex framework to develop novel statistical methodology.  This work will involve developing efficient algorithms, thoroughly investigating the properties of estimators and algorithms through a combination of theory and simulation, and applying methods to real datasets.  The research focus is in two main areas:  (A) In certain applications, the variables have a known ordering.  Such structure suggests the use of a convex penalty not previously applied to covariance estimation.  This work will carefully study using such a penalty to estimate both the covariance matrix and the inverse covariance matrix.  (B) Estimating a covariance matrix as a simultaneously sparse and positive definite matrix is a natural goal, and yet the standard penalized likelihood approach is not convex.  This research will develop convex-optimization-based estimators that still make use of the likelihood.  For all projects, software will be produced, made freely available online, and maintained so that other researchers can benefit from its use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The last few years has continued to see an increase in the size of data sets collected by scientists.  Whereas in a previous era, scientists would record a small number of attributes about the subjects under investigation, it is now commonplace for scientists to record hundreds, thousands, or even millions of attributes per subject.  For example, a biomedical scientist may measure tens of thousands of attributes describing the genetic makeup of an individual.  Key scientific insights can come from understanding the relationships between these attributes.  However, inferring such relationships in a statistically rigorous way is a challenging problem, especially when the number of attributes (e.g., genes) is large relative to the number of subjects (e.g., individuals).  "High-dimensional covariance estimation" is focused on this fundamental challenge.  This project developed a series of novel statistical methods for tackling this problem.  For each new method, the theoretical underpinnings of these methods were carefully studied.  Such theoretical results are useful for helping scientists understand the situations in which the new methods would outperform preexisting methods.  In addition, easy-to-use efficient software was developed and made publicly and freely available online so that researchers can apply these methods in other areas of science.  The methods were applied to datasets in diverse areas, including genetics, sound classification, the analysis of images, and economics.  This work has led to exciting new research directions which are currently being investigated, such as how one can understand the relationships between attributes that lie on a known network and how one can forecast the values of attributes into the future based on past information.  Technical products of this project include five publications (with two additional preprints posted online that are in review at journals), six software packages, and twenty-eight talks for technical research audiences.  From an education standpoint, five students/postdocs benefited from working on projects related to this grant, and the PI engaged in two university-wide talks geared toward educating non-statistician researchers in statistical methods related to this grant.  Finally, two outreach-focused talks were given about statistics in science museums for children and their parents.       Last Modified: 11/28/2017       Submitted by: Jacob Bien]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
