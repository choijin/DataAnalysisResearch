<AbstractNarration>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) proposes to support student attendance at and development of the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing. The Tapia Conference series highlights the technical achievements of diverse researchers in computing. It provides a unique forum to support diverse students (undergraduates and graduate students) and professionals. The conference programs include invited speakers, workshops, birds-of-a-feather sessions, panels, a student poster competition and a doctoral consortium. The programs allow leadership development activities for the students as well as young professionals. Moreover, they include significant time for networking about research collaborations and professional development.  This proposal will support student scholarships for the conference and the doctoral consortium in 2015.</AbstractNarration>
