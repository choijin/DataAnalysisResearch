<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Professor Peter Vikesland of Virginia Tech is examining the role of particle properties on the dissolution kinetics of metallic nanoparticles. Metal nanoparticles are being developed for incorporation in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, yet many questions remain about their longevity in diverse environments.  Results from this integrated research and education effort will be disseminated in scientific publications and via presentations at relevant conferences. In addition, the results will inform outreach activities organized by Professor Vikesland, the Virginia Tech Sustainable Nanotechnology (VTSuN) Program, and the NSF-EPA Center for the Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEINT).  Professor Vikesland, VTSuN, and CEINT will engage K-12 and other members of the general population using hands-on activities and inform these audiences about the societal implications (both positive and negative) of nanotechnology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Vikesland will utilize a highly sensitive atomic force microscope to examine how surface coatings, nanoparticle size, and metal identity affect metal nanoparticle dissolution rates.  Arrays of surface adhered nanoparticles of variable consistency will be produced via nanosphere lithography and their dissolution will be probed over time. This approach enables investigation of dissolution kinetics in the absence of aggregation using realistic nanoparticle concentrations - severe limitations of many alternative methodologies. Findings from this study will aid efforts to engineer environmentally benign nanomaterials and to predict their environmental impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanotechnology and nanomaterials have become integral components of our daily lives and are now found not only in computers and electronic devices, but also in food packaging, medical supplies, and many other consumer goods. While the unique properties of nanomaterials are being harnessed to improve these products there remain concerns that some nanomaterials may have negative health and ecological risks associated with them. To quantify such risks, it is imperative that the fate and transformation of nanomaterials be determined across a range of different media. Transformation processes such as dissolution, aggregation, sedimentation, deposition, and sulphidation are of critical interest, but are challenging to study systematically due to their co-occurrence in many systems.   Intellectual Merit  In this effort, we set out to systematically characterize the dissolution of silver (AgNP) and copper (CuNP) nanoparticles under tightly controlled conditions that minimized potential artifacts associated with nanoparticle aggregation. This aim was achieved by utilizing an atomic force microscope (AFM) to quantify changes in the morphology of arrays of hundreds-to-thousands of nanoparticles adhered to solid substrates. These nanoparticle arrays were exposed to solutions containing various reactants expected to either enhance (sodium chloride) or hinder (sulfides, proteins, polymers) dissolution (see Figure).  The key findings from this work are as follows: 1) exposure to NaCl enhances the dissolution of both AgNP and CuNP with this effect magnified at higher NaCl concentrations; 2) covalently attached polymers inhibit the dissolution of AgNP, while non-covalently bound proteins enhance dissolution initially, and then stabilize the nanoparticles once a protein coat has fully formed; 3) nanoparticle size dictates the rate of dissolution ? smaller nanoparticles dissolve more rapidly.  Broader Impact  This project has supported the training of two PhD students and one Research scientist.

In addition, the project has provided support for numerous outreach activities at local schools and at science festivals.
