<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Committee on Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Science (CAMOS) of the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Academies. CAMOS is a standing committee with membership drawn from universities, industry, and government laboratories. Its members have expertise that is intended to cover the full breadth of the atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) sciences. The activities of CAMOS engage a group of leading scientists from across the subfields of AMO science in joint deliberations and provide a learning environment for that body regarding the public-policy process for science and the position of AMO in the broader context of the physical sciences. In addition, CAMOS activities lead to an improved understanding of AMO science by the broader scientific and policy-making communities. By holding multi-disciplinary workshops, preparing short, nontechnical documents, and initiating studies, CAMOS will continue to educate researchers, policy makers, and the general public about advances in AMO science that have impact in other fields of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAMOS has the following objectives: to provide active stewardship of the agenda laid out by the most recent decadal study prepared for AMO sciences, "Controlling the Quantum World"; to provide a means by which federal agencies can request technical information and assistance from the NRC about AMO science and related fields, and by which other units in the NRC can obtain expertise on AMO science;  to initiate ad hoc studies and workshops on important timely topics in AMO science and/or its multidisciplinary connections with other fields of science and technology; to develop brief informational summaries of emerging topics and/or questions of current interest; to provide an interface for communication among the subfields of the AMO community as well as with the staff of federal agencies that support research in the field;  and to begin preparations for the next decadal survey of AMO science.</AbstractNarration>

To carry out its objectives, CAMOS meets face-to-face on an annual basis and between those meetings, conducts its business through telephone conferences.  At the annual meeting conducted during the 1-year covered by this grant, CAMOS met with representatives of agencies that support the AMO sciences, including NSF, DOE, DARPA, IARPA, AFOSR, and ARO, and discussed outstanding issues facing the AMO science community.  It then conducted a half-day focus session that concentrated on preparations for the next decadal survey on AMO sciences.  Discussions during that session centered around issues that the AMO communities are facing that can be addressed through the decadal survey.
