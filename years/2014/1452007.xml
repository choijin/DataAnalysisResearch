<AbstractNarration>Redefining Surface Area: Understanding Reactive Interfaces in Heterogeneous Porous Media&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biogeochemical reaction rates in the natural subsurface are typically controlled by those at the "hot" reactive interfaces where fluids and solids of different properties and conditions meet. These interfaces are often restricted to relatively small, sharp zones with rates orders of magnitude higher than those at the rest of the domain. The research outcomes from this project will be important for a broad spectrum of applications at the nexus of energy, water, and environment. In particular, they will advance understanding and predicting of physical, chemical, and biological processes important for shale gas development, acid mine drainage, nuclear waste disposal, geological CO2 sequestration, geothermal energy, and contaminant transport. Fundamental understanding of the earth systems, including the Critical Zone where humans live, is also essential for soil fertility and productivity, water sustainability, and energy security, all of which are subject to climate change and intense human activities in the Anthropocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study the investigator hypothesizes that the emergence and nature of reactive interfaces are dictated by spatial heterogeneities, the spatial variations in porous medium properties and conditions. These reactive interfaces ultimately govern large scale processes and system functioning. Whereas hydrologists have documented significant impacts of physical heterogeneities on fluid flow and solute transport in the past decades, present understanding on the role of physical and geochemical heterogeneities in determining (bio)geochemical processes has not kept pace. The investigator proposes to understand fundamental principles that govern the occurrence and functioning of reactive interfaces. The ultimate goal is to develop conceptual and predictive framework for geochemical processes in natural, heterogeneous subsurface. The proposed work will integrate two-dimensional flow-through experiments and multi-scale reactive transport modeling. The 2D flow cells will be packed using calcite, chlorite, and quartz-minerals that differ drastically in reactivity and are ubiquitous in natural systems. Understanding reactive interfaces will enable a significant step toward unifying observations across scales. The goal of the education and outreach plan is to empower the science community and general public with tools and education in ways that transcend limits of time, space, and individual disciplines. The investigator proposes to (1) develop an online module with a "heterogeneity" focus as part of a much-needed online reactive transport modeling (RTM) course for delivery through Penn State's World Campus; (2) develop a repository website that organizes the online teaching materials for free access to the public; (3) promote diversity and environmental awareness by offering underrepresented high school students a summer research opportunity on "Water flow through rocks". The plan will equip the community with knowledge and predictive tools for environmental stewardship, water management, as well as protection and sustainable use of natural resources.</AbstractNarration>

This project addresses the largely unexplored role of mineral spatial distribution patterns in influencing dissolution rates in natural, heterogeneous porous media. Our hypothesis was that mineral spatial patterns govern the occurrence and nature of reactive interfaces and therefore rates in heterogeneous media. We used two-dimensional flow-through experiments and reactive transport modeling (RTM) to test the hypothesis. Major outcome of the project include: 1) data from 2D experiments showing the effects of spatial heterogeneity on solute concentrations from media with different carbonate distribution patterns under a variety of flow regimes; 2) understanding on the role of physical property contrast (permeability contrasts) versus mineral property contrast in regulating dissolution rates; 3) an upscaled rate law for mineral dissolution that integrates the effects of flow regimes and heterogeneity characteristics. The key variable in the upscaled rate law is the effective surface area, which can be &gt; 2 orders of magnitude lower than the total surface area. The rate law accentuates the central role of the actual reacting mineral-water contact time in determining rates. In essence, the rate law indicates in natural heterogeneous systems, only a very small portion of mineral surfaces (&lt; 0.001 &ndash; 0.1) are in contact with water and are effectively dissolving.
