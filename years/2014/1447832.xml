<AbstractNarration>Measurements of the atmospheric concentrations of many important air pollutants have been ongoing for over 10 years at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (MBO) located at the summit of Mt. Bachelor in the Deschutes National Forest in central Oregon.  MBO is the only high elevation (2.8 km) atmospheric research station on the west coast of the U.S.  To date, measurements taken at this site have been able to identify a significant trend in baseline ozone entering the U.S. due to long-distant transport from Asia during spring, explain some of the causes for variability in ozone production in wildfire plumes, and demonstrate the first evidence for a significant pool of oxidized mercury in the free troposphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues to support the collection of these data at MBO and also supports the collection of several new types of data. The new data will provide information on aerosol optical properties and on the concentration of a chemical that is predominantly produced by wildfires. The new measurements are designed to help distinguish between the sources of ozone and particulate matter related to biomass burning from those associated with urban and industrial activity and from those transported from Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals for the project are: (1) Examine the concentrations, interannual variability and controlling factors for ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM) and other key pollutants in the spring at MBO and throughout the Western US.  The purpose is to better understand the cause for the recent positive trends in ozone at MBO and the contribution from long-range transport and from upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) events; and (2) Examine the concentrations, interannual variability and controlling factors for O3, PM and other key pollutants in summer at MBO and throughout the Western US. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the relationship between carbon monoxide (CO), O3, PM, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and acetonitrile (CH3CN) to improve the understanding of the processes that control O3 and PM in wildfire plumes. Several specific hypotheses about the sources and transformation of various atmospheric compounds measured at MBO will be evaluated in this study.  New measurements at the site will facilitate this investigation.  The new measurements include: aerosol absorption using a Tricolor Absorption Photometer; particle sizing using a scanning mobility particle size spectrometer; and measurements of the concentrations of acetonitrile.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supports the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (MBO; 43.981&deg;N 121.691&deg;W), the only free tropospheric atmospheric research site on the west coast of the U.S. Located on an isolated mountain peak in central Oregon (elevation: 9065 feet, 2.8&nbsp;km above sea level), MBO receives mostly free tropospheric air and sometimes stratospheric air, enabling us to sample air that has been relatively undisturbed during transport from Asia. Due to its elevation and distance from local pollution sources, MBO is an ideal laboratory to study air pollution transported from Asia and other air issues like stratospheric intrusions and wildfire smoke. MBO&rsquo;s mission is to study and understand the local, regional and global sources of pollution in the western U.S. (WUS), with an emphasis on understanding the sources and atmospheric chemistry of ozone, aerosols and mercury.</p> <p class="ColorfulList-Accent11CxSpFirst">&nbsp;Our primary goals are to understand the sources, trends, variations and controlling factors for ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), particulate matter (PM) and other key pollutants in spring and summer at MBO including Asian transported pollutants, stratospheric intrusions, wildfires and other natural sources. Over the past 15 years, we have measured O<sub>3</sub>, PM, mercury, carbon monoxide and dioxide (CO and CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, metals, volatile organic compounds and meteorological parameters. In the past 3 years, we updated and improved our instrumentation for O<sub>3</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub> and black carbon (soot). The chemicals measured at MBO are important air pollutants or precursors to pollutants that harm human health and the environment.</p> <p class="ColorfulList-Accent11CxSpLast">&nbsp;During the course of this grant, we generated 14 new scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals.&nbsp; We have presented our findings at conferences of scientific organizations including the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society, the UN-HTAP forum and meetings of the Western Regional Air Partnership. We have also established important collaborations with scientists at over 20 universities and governmental organizations, including UC Davis, University of Utah and Harvard University.</p> <p>&nbsp;Some of our scientific findings from this research project are:</p> <ol> <li>We have identified a significant increase in summertime PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the WUS associated with increasing wildfire activity (McClure and Jaffe, 2018). Figure 2 shows the region with increasing PM<sub>2.5 </sub>at the 98<sup>th</sup> percentile.</li> <li>We have evaluated new methods to measure peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) using a non-radioactive gas chromatograph and O<sub>3</sub> (Zhang et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2017).</li> <li>We have examined the available data and models to understand &ldquo;background O<sub>3</sub>&rdquo; for the continental U.S. and its role in regional air quality. We reviewed over 100 O<sub>3</sub> studies to identify common patterns and key uncertainties in this key pollutant (Jaffe et al., 2018).</li> <li>We have identified and quantified the role of meteorological variations and high temperatures in controlling high O<sub>3</sub> seen in 2015 across large parts of the WUS (Jaffe and Zhang, 2017). This work is important as it will help us better understand O<sub>3</sub> changes associated with a warming world.</li> <li>We have identified a significant positive trend in summertime O<sub>3</sub> and aerosol scattering and a positive trend in springtime O<sub>3</sub> based on MBO data from 2004&ndash;2015. The summer trends are due to recent increases in regional wildfire emissions and the spring trend is associated with increasing Asian pollution (Zhang and Jaffe, 2017).</li> <li>Baylon et al. (2016) has demonstrated the importance of interannual variations in background O<sub>3</sub> on air quality at sites in the WUS (Baylon et al., 2016).</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;Our research on air quality contributes a direct benefit to the public. Identifying the sources of and understanding the chemistry of air pollutants is necessary to reducing air pollution and improving air quality. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reduced the allowable O<sub>3</sub> concentrations repeatedly over the last few decades. It is important to understand the interannual variability and the contributions to surface O<sub>3</sub> from all sources and so that policymakers and government officials have the information necessary to make policy decisions. The significant influence on O<sub>3</sub> levels in urban areas of the WUS from wildfires and long-range transport may make it difficult for some urban areas to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for O<sub>3</sub>. One of our goals is to provide accurate scientific assessments on the degree of controllable versus uncontrollable pollution sources.</p> <p>&nbsp;Several Ph.D. and undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows and visiting scholars were trained in conducting scientific research through this project.
