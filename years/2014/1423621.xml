<AbstractNarration>Recent technological advances have led to an explosive growth of social, biological, and information network data.  This has led to a wide range of metrics, e.g., degree distributions, clustering coefficients, homophily measures, and so on, to describe and extract insight from real networks.  The hope is that these metrics will help domain scientists to extract information and actionable insight from these networks.  This enthusiasm, however, has not yet been fully realized; and an ongoing challenge is to develop finer actionable metrics to understand the properties of real networks.  This project will facilitate the development of tools for the extraction of knowledge from large genetic, medical, internet, financial, astronomical, and other scientific network data sets, and it will enhance interdisciplinary education more generally. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project will investigate methods to characterize and exploit tree-like structure in real information networks.  It will focus on two related but complementary notions of tree-like-ness for graphs; it will use these notions to develop tools to characterize the manner in which real complex networks are tree-like; and it will use this characterization to develop tools for improved analytics on real networks.  Particular attention will be paid to how this can shed light on intermediate-scale, i.e., not very small-scale or local and not very large-scale or global, structure in real networks; and the results of this project will provide implementations of algorithms to determine how and where this new understanding can be exploited for domain-specific insight more generally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work developed methods to characterize and exploit "tree-like" structure in realistic social, information, and scientific networks. This included delta hyperbolicity and tree decompositions as well as heuristic variants.  In addition, it permitted an improved understanding on how realistic complex networks are coarsely tree-like.  Motivated by this, improved tools were developed for improved analytics on realistic networks, where many of these tools have a novel optimization/variational interpretation.  Thus, many of these tools focus on complementary algorithmic versus statistical methodologies.  These tools were designed to identify so-called intermediate-scale structure.  This structure is not very small-scale (or local), and it is not very large-scale (or global), but it is important for how small-scale signal appears and has consequences in large networks.  Examples of how this could be applicable are small-scale clusters in large medical imaging data, small-scale motifs in large-scale genetics data, and small-scale galaxy types in large-scale astronomical data.  The work developed new mathematical and theoretical ideas in order to understand the properties, and in particular the intermediate-scale properties, of realistic social, information, and scientific networks; and it also provided implementations of those algorithms on realistic networks to determine how and where this new understanding can be exploited for domain-specific insight more generally.  Particular attention was paid to two points.  First, there is often a theory-practice gap to providing implementable algorithms, and bridging this gap often requires the development of novel tools that are more-broadly applicable.  Second, there are often commonalities between problems in diverse scientific domains, and developing tools that address these commonalities, while at the same time respecting the important domain-specific differences, often leads to insight that is useful more generally across application areas.  For example, capacity-releasing diffusions use ideas from both spectral methods and flow methods to yield improved local algorithms for finding small clusters in large noisy networks.  More generally, the work enhanced interdisciplinary education in the area of large-scale network data analysis; and it facilitated the development of tools for the extraction of knowledge from large genetic, medical, internet, financial, astronomical, and other scientific network data sets.  Graduate and undergraduate training were also a by product of the novel methodological developments.       Last Modified: 09/04/2017       Submitted by: Michael Mahoney]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
