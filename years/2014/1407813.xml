<AbstractNarration>In the big data era, observations are collected on ever larger numbers of variables and cases.  Even after preliminary reductions of the data, subsets of interest may have high dimensionality and appreciable sample size.  The interesting structure in such data is often low dimensional, indeed such models occur in many scientific domains from econometrics to genomics and signal processing and well beyond.  This project will investigate the estimation and testing of a particular class of low dimensional structures, namely low rank perturbations of scaled identity or diagonal matrices.  It will consider high dimensional versions of multivariate statistical methods that have found wide use for traditional data: principal components, multiple response regression, canonical correlations etc., as well as newer applications such as matrix denoising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study the proportional limit setting in which the number of variables and the sample size are of the same order of magnitude.  It will explore the phase transition phenomenon for a wide class of multivariate methods, using in part the systematic framework developed by A. T. James.  Contiguity properties below the phase transition will be investigated as will Gaussian behavior above the critical point.  A separate low noise approximation will be used to derive long sought power approximations for largest root tests.  In estimation, the project will study optimal shrinkage procedures for the empirical eigenvalues that correspond to the low rank structure, making explicit how the results depend strongly on the particular loss function chosen.  Both scalar non-linearities as well as thresholding techniques will be considered.  The project will build upon preliminary work for covariance estimation and matrix denoising, and also develop results for other multivariate settings such as low rank factor models, canonical correlations and discriminant analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project made a number of significant contributions to estimation and testing challenges associated with large data settings with many observations on many variables. Among these we highlight the following four:      Testing in high-dimensional spiked models.   We gave a unified treatment of the five classes of multivariate statistical problems famously identified by A.T. James, which together cover much of classical multivariate analysis, plus a simpler limiting case, symmetric matrix denoising.  Each of James' problems involves the eigenvalues of a matrix F-ratio, where the two matrices are proportional to high dimensional Wisharts. Under the null hypothesis, both Wisharts are central with identity covariance. Under the alternative, the non-centrality or the covariance parameter has a single eigenvalue, a spike, that stands alone. When the spike is smaller than a case-specific phase transition threshold, none of the sample eigenvalues separate from the bulk, making the testing problem challenging.  Using a unified strategy for the six cases, we show that the log likelihood ratio processes parameterized by the value of the sub-critical spike converge to Gaussian processes with logarithmic correlation. We then derive asymptotic power envelopes for tests for the presence of a spike.     Roy's Largest Root Test Under Rank-One Alternatives.  Roy's largest root is a common test statistic in multivariate analysis, statistical signal processing and allied fields.  Despite its ubiquity, provision of accurate and tractable approximations to its distribution under the alternative has been a longstanding open problem.  Assuming Gaussian observations and a rank one alternative, or "concentrated non-centrality", we derive simple yet accurate approximations for the most common low-dimensional settings.  These include signal detection in noise, multiple response regression, multivariate analysis of variance and canonical correlation analysis. A small noise perturbation approach, perhaps underused in statistics, leads to simple combinations of standard univariate distributions, such as central and non-central chi-square and F.  Our results allow approximate power and sample size calculations for Roy's test for rank one effects, which is precisely where it is most powerful.     Optimal Shrinkage of Eigenvalues in the Spiked Covariance Model.  We show that in a common high-dimensional covariance model, the choice of loss function has a profound effect on optimal estimation.  In an asymptotic framework based on the Spiked Covariance model and use of orthogonally invariant estimators, we show that optimal estimation of the population covariance matrix boils down to design of an optimal shrinker that acts elementwise on the sample eigenvalues.  Indeed, to each loss function there corresponds a unique admissible eigenvalue shrinker dominating all others. The shape of the optimal shrinker is determined by the choice of loss function and, crucially, by inconsistency of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. Details of these phenomena are worked out for many of the loss functions for covariance estimation widely used in the literature.     Eigenvalue distributions of variance components estimators in high-dimensional random effects models.   We study the spectra of MANOVA estimators for variance component covariance matrices in multivariate random effects models.  When the dimensionality of the observations is large and comparable to the number of realizations of each random effect, we show that the empirical spectra of such estimators are well-approximated by deterministic laws. The Stieltjes transforms of these laws are characterized by systems of fixed-point equations, which are numerically solvable by a simple iterative procedure. Our proof uses operator-valued free probability theory, and we establish a general asymptotic freeness result for families of rectangular orthogonally-invariant random matrices, which is of independent interest. Our work is motivated in part by the estimation of components of covariance between multiple phenotypic traits in quantitative genetics, and we specialize our results to common experimental designs that arise in this application.
