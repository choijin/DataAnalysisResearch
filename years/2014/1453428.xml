<AbstractNarration>Images are rapidly becoming the most abundant, widely available, and cheapest source of information about the natural world. Images taken by field scientists, tourists, and incidental photographers, and gathered from camera traps and autonomous vehicles provide rich data with the promise of addressing big ecological questions at high resolution and at fine-grained scale. Realizing this potential requires building a large autonomous computational system that starts from image collections and progresses all the way to answering ecological queries, such as population sizes, species distributions and interactions, and movement patterns. The system must have methods of extracting the relevant ecological information from the images and of integrating with other ecological data sources, with minimal human interaction, using state-of-the art information management, computer vision, and data analytics technologies. Such a system will advance computer systems and simultaneously enable ecology to develop as a science of connections across spatial, temporal, and biological scales, as well as provide data- and scientifically-grounded support for ecological decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work aims to build a prototype of an Image-Based Ecological Information Software System (IBEIS) that relies on a proliferation of images collected daily on a single facility from many different sources, both human and automatic, to determine both the species as well as recognition of distinct individuals. The system will allow for tracking location and movement while providing a data management system that will allow scientists to better understand, and at finer granularity, behaviors and motivations. The system will include: (1) an infrastructure and a mechanism for collecting images from tourists and other sources; (2) a (cloud) infrastructure and a data management system for storing, accessing, and manipulating the images and the derived data; (3) computer vision techniques for extracting information from the images about the identity of individual units, as well as techniques for combining that information with other relevant data to derive information about meaningful ecological units; and (4) statistical techniques and query structures to support ecological queries of the data, such as population sizes and dynamics, movement history and home ranges, and species interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will advance computer systems including information management, computer vision, and data analytics technologies, all the while increasing public engagement in science and ecology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project entitled 'Prototype of an Image-Based Ecological Information System (IBEIS)' broke new ground in developing algorithms for detecting individual animals in photographs, by first identifying them to species and then to individuals by using their distinguishing markings.  The computer scientists on the team developed the machine learning algorithms while the ecologists and animal behaviorists worked with them to help turk the images and train the machines.  As the lead biologist and conservationist of the group, I put the IBEIS system to work, testing its accuracy, efficacy and impact in the field on a range of fundamental ecological, behavioral and conservation problems.    Throughout the period of the grant, a number of citizen science bioblitzes and rallies took place to estimate the population sizes of endangered species such as the Grevy's zebras and reticulated giraffe as well as many other populations or these and other species whose basic ecology was poorly understood.  These massive rallies often involved managing hundreds of volunteers who covered tens of thousands of square kilometers, teaching them how to take useful photos with GPS enabled cameras supplied by NSF, curating their images and running them through the IBEIS system.  By developing protocols for visual comparisons, we were also able to develop a streamlined processes for aging and sexing individuals, again recruiting online help from the public.  In the end our population size estimates were the most robust ever collected on zebras and giraffes and thus became the gold standard population sizes used by the Kenyan Wildlife Service in developing the 5-year management plan for the Grevy's zebra. Engaging citizens in this way not only put science into citizen science, but it made them ambassadors for science and conservation.  By involving a cross section of the public, the Cabinet Secretary of the Environment and Tourism accepted the numbers as the official numbers for the nation.  He and other local politicians now use them in developing policy action plans for reducing human-wildlife conflict.  School children from a wide range of schools varying in ethnicity and income levels were often brought into the process.  They took photographs and processed them to see how technology is aiding in fundamental and applied science.  While doing so they also by using curriculum enhancements we developed to teach them about a range of methodologies for: estimating population sizes; learning about concepts of home ranges and territoriality and using the data to determine them as well as for understanding sex specific roles in mating and interacting socially.  Enabling them to see and better understand the natural world around them ideally will make them better environmental decision-makers in the future.  Overall, this project has become a benchmark, demonstrating how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for environmental good.  Many presentations to computer scientists have shown them that what they do can reach farther than they thought and this has helped make them aware that while what they do can be used for 'good', they need to be on guard to help prevent AI from being used for 'bad'.  Images scraped from the web can be used to aid cartels engaged in profitable poaching schemes unless they are encrypted, an idea that they flocked to.  In terms of advances in science, our project has become a flagship demonstrating through our publications and presentations that technology can change the scale and scope of environmental science and conservation.  Whereas in the past the fates of only a few individuals could be monitored in detail from data derived from GPS tracking tags or image matching by eye or inefficient algorithms, IBEIS has enabled scientists working on species with distinctive marks to follow the fates of hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals in populations on a repeated basis.  Images from drones, camera traps and handheld single shot or video cameras have been analyzed with IBEIS and have successfully shown that now the majority of individuals in a population can be studied over time and across large areas.  In doing so, the true dynamics of populations are emerging, especially those rare tactics or even strategies employed by small subsets the populations.  Thus, IBEIS has helped make the invisible, visible and by doing so is generating richer data and better understandings of movement and social ecology as well as population demographic and life history patterns, the nature of niche differentiation and community dynamics and when coupled with DNA derived non-invasively from dung of recognized and repeatedly sampled individuals, the genomic structure and genetical dynamics of populations.
