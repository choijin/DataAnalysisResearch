<AbstractNarration>Malika Jeffries-EL of Iowa State University is funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program for collaborative research involving a team of scientists from both Iowa State and North Georgia College. The team is developing new electronics materials that are organic, meaning they are made from carbon-based molecules rather than the more commonly used inorganic materials, such as those based on silicon or germanium. In addition to their relative abundance, these organic materials have much lower fabrication costs and provide a range of properties not found in the inorganic substances. In this project, a combination of synthesis, theoretical calculations and physical measurement studies are being combined to design and fabricate working electronic devices. This work is having a broad impact not only on the electronics industry, but also by providing an interdisciplinary research experience for both undergraduate and graduate students, which fosters an interest in chemistry through a creative outreach effort targeting female and underrepresented minority students at all educational levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing new cross-conjugated organic semiconductors for use in organic light emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells. In particular, novel cross-conjugated oligomers comprised of the robust benzobisoxazole (BBO) moiety are being studied. BBO is used as the electron-deficient building block since it is a unique cross-conjugated ring system that can be coupled either through the oxazole rings or through the central benzene ring, producing substances with different properties. The group is synthesizing materials with perpendicular conjugation axes because they have spatially segregated frontier molecular orbitals. This provides a means for semi-independent tuning of either the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). The benefits of the approach are that the cross-conjugated platform allows for the opportunity to optimize the material?s optical and electronic properties for specific applications. Various materials are being prepared and the most promising ones studied further by incorporation into working devices.</AbstractNarration>

Using a combination of organic synthesis, theoretical calculations and physical measurements we carried out a systematic investigation of novel cross-conjugated oligomers based on the benzo[1,2-d;4,5-d?]bisoxazole (BBO) moiety.

This is a promising approach for developing new organic semiconductors as such selective modification is generally difficult. We have used our system to generate materials for use in both organic light emitting diode materials (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaic systems (OPVs).      We have generated a model which strongly correlates to the data produced by our experimental collaborators.  Our work has led to a number of structure-property relationships for both small (OPV-type) and large (OLED-type) band gap materials.  For wide band systemls, we have identified several blue emitters based on our cruciform motif.  In a recent manuscript we have examined the role pentafluorobenene aryl groups might play in making more efficient OLED devices.  From this study, we have found that these aryl groups reduced the band as a consequence of their acceptor behavior making them less ideal for OLED materials but potentially useful for OPVs. Apart from this rule, we found increasing donor groups on the 4,8-axis will reduce the band gap while increasing the number of these groups on the 2,6-axis did not lead to a significant reduction.  This finding is in keeping with another rule which was increasing the acceptor strength of the 2,6-axis produced a band gap reduction.  Overall, these and other findings will be utilized in the future when incorporating our BBO cruciforms.     In terms of broader impacts, this project has advanced the general understanding of designing materials for use in both OLEDs and OPVs.
