<AbstractNarration>The 72nd Device Research Conference will be held at held at the University of California, Santa Barbara from held June 22 to 25, 2014, and  will address research areas in the field of semiconductor electronic and optical devices including novel device concepts. It is one of the few conferences where the latest results are presented and discussed in a relatively open format. This conference will foster advances in the leading research on various types of semiconductors, by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. DRC gathers the brightest members of the research community under an interactive, intellectually stimulating meeting. The program provides the opportunity for scientific exchanges and discussions. There are approximately 10 invited talks and 110 contributed (oral and poster) presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 73rd Device Research Conference (DRC) was held at UC Santa Barbara with strong student attendance to its short courses, poster session and oral presentations.  The DRC is the preeminent forum for new and emerging device technologies.  The technical program provided student participants with the opportunity to gain exposure to new materials and devices, their basic physics, and their engineering applications.     Electronic and photonic devices underpin a number of important commercial markets, including computing and telecommunications, accounting for millions of jobs worldwide.  Exposing the next generation of researchers to their important disciplines is critical to maintain the supply of STEM workers with the skillsets necessary to address emerging commercial trends.  As an additional benefit, the DRC was coordinated with the Electronic Materials Conference. This recognizes the strong interaction between device and electronic materials research, and provides the fruitful exchange of information between attendees of both conferences.     The 2014 DRC was a great success with over 200 attendees with approximately 50% being students. The technical program was composed of three plenary speakers, 13 invited talks, 54 contributed oral papers, and 56 contributed posters (73% of contributed papers were by students).  To capture late-breaking device developments, the program included four late-news oral papers and four late-news posers.     The DRC organizers are grateful for the funds provided by NSF that supported student registration fees.          Last Modified: 03/31/2015       Submitted by: J. Ardie Butch Dillen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
