<AbstractNarration>This research studies data recorded in time that is count-valued, e.g., the annual number of Californian wildfires, yearly Alaskan polar bear sightings, monthly flu deaths, annual North Atlantic severe hurricanes, etc.  The data may be correlated in time, implying that counts observed today may be influenced by (correlated with) counts occurring in the immediate past.  This work develops time series methods that take into account the particular type of distribution appropriate for the counts, e.g., Poisson, geometric, binomial, etc.. Using the correct distribution facilitates accurate forecasts and inferences. The models developed here allow both positive and negative correlations, a feature absent from current statistical count time series models.  For example, annual Pacific and Atlantic hurricane counts are well described by a Poisson-type distribution, but are negatively correlated: when Atlantic hurricane counts are high, Pacific counts tend to be low (and vice versa).  It is important to account for such correlations to make accurate climate change conclusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On technical levels, a discrete-time renewal process is used as a general model for a binary (zero-one) series.  The renewal process is rendered stationary by selecting a special initial renewal life length. Copies of the stationary binary sequence are then superimposed in various ways to build the marginal distribution sought.  It is easy to construct stationary series with Poisson, geometric, and binomial marginal distributions.  The methods easily generate stationary count series with negative correlations and/or long-memory --- aspects not achievable from classical integer autoregressive moving-average count techniques.  Inference issues, covariates, and multivariate series are also considered.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined count time series --- sequences of data that take on values in the set {0,1,2,.....}.   Here, consecutive values of the series may exhibit correlation.  Previous state of the art modeling procedures did not allow for a general marginal distribution of the count series, or for a general correlation structure (positive or negative).   The work in this award shows how to construct models with any desired marginal distribution and as general as possible autocorrelations that are achievable (exist).   The work in the award develops methods that allow the accommodation of covariates into the modeling procedure, and shows how to estimate model parameters with likelihood methods, the gold standard method of estimation in statistics.    This essentially moves time series analysis from a science of the first (mean) and second (covariance) moments, to one of the first two moments and the marginal distribution.   One book and several research papers were published on the theory and methods of the techniques.   Additional publications are currently being prepared.  The award supported two PhD students and three researchers in academics, industry, and government.   The results of the award were applied to the analysis of recent Atlantic and Pacific hurricane and tropical storms counts.  Here, it is found that when the Atlantic Basin is busy with hurricanes, the Pacific Basin typically sees little action, and vice versa.
