<AbstractNarration>Animal behavior plays a central role in the transmission of parasites and pathogens. Likewise, parasites are crucial drivers of animal behavior. Over the past few decades, disease ecology has been one of the fastest growing sub-disciplines of ecology. Importantly, animal behaviorists have played a crucial role in developing some fundamental ideas that impinge on this field. Building on a number of theoretical and technical advances throughout the last decade, we will host a symposium on Animal Behavior and Disease Ecology: Past, Present, and Future at the 2014 Animal Behavior Society meeting to bring together traditional animal behaviorists and disease ecologists interested in behavior to explore emerging topics and points of synthesis between the two fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will identify important new research directions at the interface of animal behavior and disease ecology including the ways in which behavior affects host exposure and susceptibility to infection and parasite transmission dynamics, as well as means by which parasites shape patterns of animal behavior in both ecological and evolutionary time. It will provide a platform for professional development outreach to graduate and undergraduate students attending the meeting. Outreach activities will provide students with information on how to get started in research that combines behavior with disease ecology, and provide a venue for students to make connections with experts whose work firmly integrates the two fields.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Animal behavior is an important driver of the transmission of parasites and pathogens, likewise parasites and pathogens have profound effects on animal behavior. In recognition of this inescapable link between animal behavior and parasitism, this project brought together researchers in the fields of disease ecology, ecological immunology and animal behavior for a symposium at the 2014 annual meeting of the Animal Behavior Society (ABS). The main goal of the symposium was to explore emerging topics and points of synthesis between the fields of animal behavior and disease ecology. This goal was achieved in two ways. First, the 210 minute symposium session featured seven speakers who presented research talks on topics such as social network analysis and infectious disease dynamics, behavior-mediated heterogeneities in infection patterns, super-spreading and social behavior, and behavior and the microbiome. Second, a 75 minute post-symposium meet-and-greet event provided time and opportunity for informal discussion between session speakers and student and postdoctoral attendees of the meeting. By bringing young animal behaviorists together with senior researchers in the areas of disease ecology and ecological immunology (including five female and two male scientisrs spanning career stages from assistant professor to full professor), the meet-and-greet helped foster the professional development of a number of junior scientists. Beyond the original symposium session, the intellectual impact and reach of the project was extended through a collaborative review article published by the session speakers which discusses key areas of intersection between animal behavior and disease ecology. In terms of broader impacts, in addition to the student outreach event hosted at the 2014 ABS meeting, the project also contributed to the professional development of five junior scientists (four PhD students and one postdoctoral researcher) from the symposium speakers' labs by sponsoring their attendance at the 2016 ABS meeting. Importantly, all of the students presented a research talk at the meeting furthering one of the original symposium's core goals of enhancing communication between animal behaviorists and disease ecologists.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/07/2016<br>      Modified by: Vanessa&nbsp;O&nbsp;Ezenwa</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
