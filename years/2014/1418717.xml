<AbstractNarration>This RAPID will compare the environmental impacts of the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.  Sedimentary deposits of Typhoon Haiyan will be collected and compared with previously collected sedimentary deposits of the Indian Ocean Tsunami in order to measure land elevation, storm surge flow, and sediment deposit.  Post-depositional change within overwash deposits will also be determined.  In turn, the differences from these two datasets will be linked to the physics of sediment erosion, transport, and deposition.   Field research will focus on the Leyte Gulf coastline, which was the region that suffered the largest storm surge during Typhoon Haiyan.  Perishable data and vital characteristics of the storm surge and its deposits will be collected immediately following Typhoon Haiyan.  The same site will be revisited and resampled a year later to assess the degree of post-depositional change in a tropical environment.  The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami deposits were sampled at similar intervals.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will collect a unique dataset that will illustrate the nature, magnitude and spatial variability of coastal changes from beach erosion, overwash deposition and island breaching.  The project complements the research of existing international research groups and will further refine predictive models of coastal impacts from severe storms.  Additionally, the research includes a strong international collaboration between researchers from the US, Singapore, and the Philippines as well as training of graduate students and postdocs from all three countries.   This RAPID award is co-funded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program and the Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Philippines are located in the most active tropical cyclone region in the world and numerous tropical cyclones have made landfall, including Typhoon Haiyan, which made landfall in Leyte Gulf, Philippines on 7 November 2013 as a category 5 super typhoon. Landfalling tropical cyclones pose a hazard to the concentrations of population, economic production, and static infrastructure along the coastlines of the Philippines.     There is a lack of understanding of the role of recent warming on tropical cyclone activity because of the length of the instrumental record.  Fortunately, records of tropical cyclones, developed from the sediments they leave behind, improve our understanding of processes and frequency by expanding the age range of events available for study. These overwash deposits are transforming our ability to detect and analyze the underlying climatic forcing for tropical cyclone activity over the last several millennia. But an obstacle in identifying past tropical cyclones in the geologic record is the lack of a modern analogue. In this NSF RAPID grant we measured Typhoon HaiyanÆs, storm surge flow depth and direction, and the overwash sedimentÆs inland extent and thickness. We documented the grain size, microfossil assemblages and geochemical signature of the Typhoon Haiyan overwash sediments. We held conversations and interviews with local residents on the impacts of Typhoon Haiyan.    Typhoon Haiyan caused extensive damage and high death toll around Leyte Gulf, Philippines. Overwash associated with the 5 to 8 m storm surge, left sediments up to 1.5 km inland. The thickness of overwash sediments varies greatly with topography and ranges from 5 to 20 cm. The thickest accumulations were found in mangrove stands and shallow ponds between 200 to 400 m from the shore. The microfossil signature of the Haiyan deposit is characterized by the predominance of nearshore and subtidal benthic, and planktic foraminifera suggesting mixed provenance, including a contribution of sediment sourced from deeper water environments.  In addition, freshwater testate amoebae and brackish agglutinated foraminifera are also present in the Haiyan deposit, indicating some scouring of terrestrial environments. A complex pattern in the organic geochemical signature is revealed that varies among depositional environment, site, and distance from shoreline. Total amounts of carbon and nitrogen, carbon isotopes and n-alkane composition indicates a mixed marine and terrestrial provenance of organic matter in storm deposits.         Our study of the overwash sediments of Typhoon Haiyan serves as the only modern analogue of a landfalling typhoon in the Philippines. Our results are important to the recognition and interpretation of older storm deposits preserved in coastal sequences at this location, as well as other tropical settings.
