<AbstractNarration>This project, designing and developing 'ScaleMed', an open-source instrument, aims to accelerate the progression of mHealth technologies from lab prototypes to at-scale clinical trials. The instrument impacts the area of healthcare, currently one of the biggest societal challenges. By providing a streamlined method to include diverse devices, the instrument will make significant contributions to the field. Using open-standards-compliant protocols, ScaleMed will help open doors to new at-scale clinical trials and lower the technology barrier. Since the infrastructure will be open-source and will serve as a community resource, its impact will scale with its user populations. Finally, the educational and outreach plan will certainly have a high impact, in the critical area of mHealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument consists of three components: Hardware Adaptor; Medical Application Modules, Libraries and Templates; and Cloud Control and Management. The instrument will be available as open-source to the entire community. Its immediate deployment is foreseen in three mHealth projects currently led by the PIs: SOLVD: a smartphone based tracking systems for conditions of depression; mobileVision, a smartphone based retinal imager; and mobileSpiro, a portable personalized spirometer.</AbstractNarration>
