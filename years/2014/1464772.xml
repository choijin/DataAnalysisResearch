<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Andrei N. Vedernikov of the University of Maryland to develop new catalysts for converting compounds typically abundant in natural gas, i.e unreactive hydrocarbons into functionalized compounds with added value.  Importantly, this 'green' project proposes to use oxygen from the air as the only consumable reagent for the desired oxidative transformations. To accomplish the goal, computational design is combined with experimental study of the reactions involved. To enhance the chances for success the project includes collaboration with the theoretical computational group of Professor William A. Goddard, III from Caltech. The broader impacts include the training of students via the ACS Project SEED Program from area high schools through participation in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at a detailed mechanistic understanding of how facially chelating ligands control reactivity of a Pt center in alkane C-H bond activation. These studies follow on earlier work in Professor Vedernikov's group on Pt(II)species that mediate aerobic functionalization of C-H bonds. Several series of novel Pt(II) complexes are being developed, including sulfonated CNN pincer complexes and macrocyclic pyridinophane complexes. This work includes DFT (Density Functional Theory)-driven catalyst discovery and detailed mechanistic characterization of new systems by means of kinetics, isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. If successful, some of the new systems may serve as efficient catalysts for partial aerobic oxidation of methane and higher alkanes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, the research team led by Professor Andrei Vedernikov of the University of Maryland has discovered and explored some new fundamental reactions that can be used when converting hydrocarbons of oil and natural gas into value-added products. According to the US Department of Energy, this problem is one of the 'Greatest Challenges' and one of great significance. The reactions developed are 'green' since they utilize either oxygen or hydrogen peroxide as environmentally friendly oxidants with water as the only possible byproduct.</p> <p>The project goals have been attained based on a detailed mechanistic understanding, achieved in Professor Vedernikov group, of how his novel facially chelating ligands can control reactivity of a Pt and Pd center in hydrocarbon C&#8209;H bond activation and/or M(II)&#8209;C bond functionalization with O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The important features of this work are the use of theoretical calculations &#8209; driven reaction discovery and a detailed mechanistic characterization of reactions discovered. The key results are listed below.</p> <p>1. Novel Pt<sup>II</sup> aqua complexes have been developed, sulfonated CNN pincer complexes, such as <strong>1</strong> (Scheme 1) that allow for fast and efficient H/D exchange between 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol-<em>d</em><sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>O and arenes at 80 <sup>o</sup>C with high selectivity (aromatic vs. benzylic CH bond, ~100:1).&nbsp;</p> <p>Importantly, the CNN pincer ligands support a novel chemical transformation, C-H activation of various aromatic hydrocarbons ArH followed by O<sub>2</sub> activation with the resulting Pt<sup>II</sup>Ar species <strong>4</strong>, leading to Pt(IV) aryl complexes <strong>3</strong> and a byproduct <strong>2</strong>. Formation of the reaction byproduct <strong>2</strong> can be suppressed using <em>p</em>-hydroquinone additives. This new reaction has a broad substrate scope and includes both electron-rich and electron-poor compounds. The results are of key importance for the development of similar systems for aerobic catalytic functionalization of methane and other hydrocarbons.</p> <p>2. Another discovered reaction is a C(sp<sup>2</sup>)&#8209;N reductive elimination from a Pd<sup>IV</sup> center of Pd<sup>IV</sup> amido aryl complexes such as <strong>7</strong> (Scheme 2). The latter can are prepared by oxidizing Pd<sup>II</sup> precursors <strong>5</strong> with inexpensive dilute aqueous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> via the intermediacy of <strong>6</strong>. The reaction products, the carbazoles <strong>8</strong>, are valuable organic compounds that find applications in pharmaceutical and dyes industries, as photocatalysts, etc., to name a few. A structure-reactivity relationship has been found for this new reaction suggesting that electron-richer amido ligands allow for faster formation of the new C-N bonds, e.g., R: SO<sub>2</sub>Me &gt; SO<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>.</p> <p>3. The proof-of-concept selective catalytic oxidation of methane using O<sub>2</sub> as the sole oxidant is another achievement of this work. The use of a bimetallic catalyst, Na<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub> - CuCl<sub>2</sub>, in aqueous CF<sub>3</sub>COOD at 120 <sup>o</sup>C, leads to selective formation of CH<sub>3</sub>X - type products (X = CF<sub>3</sub>COO, Cl, OH) with the overall TON up to 5 after 90 h and the selectivity of 95%, eq 1:</p> <p style="text-align: right;">2CH<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; +&nbsp; 2HX&nbsp; +&nbsp; O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; 2CH<sub>3</sub>X&nbsp; +&nbsp; 2H<sub>2</sub>O&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( 1 )</p> <p>4.

These results are expected to lead to the development of a new method for methylation of various amines using cheap CH<sub>4</sub> - O<sub>2</sub> as a methylating agent and Pt<sup>II</sup> compounds as catalysts. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reaction (1) above produces short-lived electrophilic [Pt<sup>IV</sup>MeCl<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2&#8209;</sup> transients.</p> <p style="text-align: right;">[Pt<sup>IV</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2&#8209;</sup>&nbsp; +&nbsp; Nu&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; [Pt<sup>II</sup>Cl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#8209;</sup>&nbsp; +&nbsp; CH<sub>3</sub>-Nu<sup>+</sup>&nbsp; +&nbsp; Cl<sup>&#8209;</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( 2 )</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Since 2010, Professor Andrei Vedernikov and his graduate students have been the active supporters of the Project SEED administered by the American Chemical Society for economically disadvantaged high school students.

Novel PtII aqua complexes have been developed, sulfonated CNN pincer complexes, such as 1 (Scheme 1) that allow for fast and efficient H/D exchange between 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol-d1 and D2O and arenes at 80 oC with high selectivity (aromatic vs. benzylic CH bond, ~100:1).
