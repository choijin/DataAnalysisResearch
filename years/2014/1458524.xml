<AbstractNarration>Acquisition of system-wide molecular information on genomes, proteomes and metabolomes (multi-omics data) is now possible for biological researchers.  Approaches that jointly analyze and interpret multi-omic data provide new understanding of the molecular interplay between genes, proteins and metabolites.  For example, proteogenomics integrates DNA or RNA sequence data with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data to identify novel protein variants expressed under different conditions; metaproteomics integrates metagenomic data with MS-based proteomic data to identify proteins expressed by microbial communities; metabologenomics integrates genomic and proteomic data with metabolomic profiling data, connecting genotypes to function. To enable new discoveries mined from multi-omic data, the raw data must first be analyzed with specialized, domain specific software.  Unfortunately, the requirement to master and integrate different software for large-scale data analysis discourages many researchers who may otherwise use and benefit from multi-omic approaches in their work.  The goal of this project is to provide a solution to this problem by developing a unified, web-based analytical hub for multi-omic data accessible to bench scientists.  Broader Impact activities will include promotion and dissemination of these software tools to the greater research community and training of undergraduates in bioinformatics via internship projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will leverage the web-based, user-friendly and research enabling Galaxy bioinformatics workbench.  In addition to proteogenomics and metaproteomics, novel Galaxy extensions will be built to enable data analysis for metabolomics, a field in desperate need of a unified resource to consolidate its many useful but scattered software tools.  Combined with new interactive visualization tools, data exchange features, and deployment in scalable and accessible cloud-based resources, Galaxy's functionality will be significantly enhanced to empower more researchers in multi-omic data analysis.  The project has these Specific Aims: 1) Enhance the Galaxy environment with new interactive visualization tools and data exchange functionalities necessary for effective multi-omic data analysis; 2) Extend the Galaxy environment to analyze and process diverse metabolomics data and support workflows for metabolic activity profiling; 3) Extend the Galaxy environment for integrative genomic-proteomic data analysis supporting proteogenomic and metaproteomic applications; 4) Ensure Broader Impact by promoting usage of Galaxy for multi-omics by the research community and providing undergraduate training opportunities in computational systems biology via a local area institutional network.  Results from this project can be found at usegalaxyp.org.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We describe the outcomes from our work addressing the criteria for 1) Intellectual Merit and 2) Broader Impacts, central to the mission of the National Science Foundation.  Intellectual Merits Outcomes.  This project focused on developing software tools for the integration of large-scale information obtained on gene sequences, the molecular products coded for and expressed by these genes (RNA and proteins), and the molecular indicators of the biochemical reactions catalyzed by these gene products (metabolites).  When analyzed in an integrated fashion, the large-scale data collected on all of these different molecules using genomics (genes), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins) and metabolomics (metabolites) provides a more complete picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological systems.  Our work addressed the many challenges involved in the integrated analysis of these "multi-omic" datasets -- particularly the need to link together many different software tools developed to analyze single 'omic datasets, ideally within a unified computing environment which can be used even by non-expert scientists who generate multi-omic data in their research.  In addition to software for processing raw data generated by 'omic technologies, tools are also needed to empower researchers to view results in a manner which allows for interpretation of the biological meaning.  To this end, we developed a number of novel software tools and workflows, within a platform which can be learned and accessed by a wide-community of researchers.  This platform extends the popular Galaxy bioinformatics workbench, which was designed over a decade ago to enable integrative analysis using software from diverse fields of study.  Our past work developed Galaxy for proteomics (Galaxy-P) enabling analysis of protein data generated using mass spectrometry within the Galaxy environment.  The work in this project further extended Galaxy-P, focusing on new data types acquired by mass spectrometry analysis of metabolites (metabolomics) as well as developing new tools for integrative analysis of multi-omic data.  A main deliverable of our work was the development of a multi-omics visualization platform (MVP), which enables the visualization of proteogenomics data.  Proteogenomics integrates information on gene sequences, and their expressed RNA and protein products to identify proteins of novel sequences that may arise from gene mutations or other unexpected events.   MVP provides an automated tool to view these novel protein sequences, and assess quality of data as well as the nature of the sequence variants.  Along with MVP, new software tools were also put in place to assess the biochemical impacts of proteins identified in multi-omic workflows.  A second focus of our work was to develop automated workflows for analyzing mass spectrometry-based data detecting metabolites from complex biological samples.  This metabolomics data provides insights into the biochemical reactions underlying biological systems and helps in elucidating mechanisms of cellular function.  Our workflows provide statistical tools for assessing differences in metabolite signatures between biological samples obtained under different conditions, as well as a means to identify the chemical structures of the detected metabolite compounds, critical for understanding the biochemistry of the cell.  We have focused on a Galaxy-based implementation of these tools which can be widely-distributed to the larger community of researchers who could make use of this software.  A third focus of our work has been to further develop software and automated workflows for integrative analysis of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data.  These workflows focus on proteogenomic analysis within single organisms, where novel protein sequences derived from mutations and unexpected gene expression events are identified.  We have also focused on the area of metaproteomics, which seeks to characterize protein products expressed by communities of microbes, also known as microbiomes.  Metaproteomics also requires the integration of genomic data on these communities, which defines the composition of the bacterial species present, with proteomic data which identifies proteins expressed by these bacteria.  We have developed novel workflows for these metaproteomic applications, as well as tools to understand the biochemical functions affected by these bacteria within complex biological samples.  Broader Impact Outcomes.  A major emphasis of our work has been in training and promoting our software to the broader research community.  We have conducted numerous hands-on workshops at national and international scientific conferences, aimed at exposing communities of researchers to our software and providing a means to learn our software for adoption in their research.

We have also leveraged the active Galaxy bioinformatics community, publishing online tutorials on the growing Galaxy Training Network.  In addition to training the community, we have focused on offering training opportunities for undergraduates from area 4-year, small colleges.  We have trained 5 undergraduates in contemporary research related to bioinformatics development and application in multi-omics, providing unique experiences aimed at propelling these students towards careers in bioinformatics and quantitative biological research.
