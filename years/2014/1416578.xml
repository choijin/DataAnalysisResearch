<AbstractNarration>The main challenge for building a quantum computer is that quantum components are prone to error. Error correction can be used to overcome this challenge but it places stringent requirements on future quantum computer hardware. One promising method of quantum error correction is the so-called Quantum Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. If successful, using these codes a large quantum computer could in principle be built. Compared to other existing schemes, it would be much more efficient, requiring fewer redundant quantum bits, called qubits. Studying these codes will improve our understanding of the quantum theoretical problems related to quantum computation. This project will provide excellent opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The award supports theoretical research on physics of non-local discrete and continuous statistical-mechanical models associated with quantum error correcting codes. An important feature of such codes is the existence of the decoding threshold, where a sufficiently large code can deal effectively with any noise level below the threshold, but not above it. Disordered spin models associated with decoding transition (these models have exact Wegner's self-duality), related models with large gauge groups associated with fault-tolerant decoding, as well as models with extensive ground state entropy, including U(1) gauge theories which generalize Wen's mutual Chern-Simons theory describing the ground state of Kitaev's toric code will be constructed and studied. Models associated with quantum LDPC codes are expected to be particularly interesting since their interaction terms involve a limited number of participating particles. The low-energy sectors of these models are expected to be dominated by non-trivial extended defects that generalize the notion of topological defects like domain walls, vortices, etc. New physics includes a phase transition driven by an extensive entropy of defect classes, coming from the exponentially large number of dimensions describing the original quantum code. Results will be relevant to several established fields of physics traditionally dealing with similar models: statistical mechanics of spin glasses, phase transition theory, etc., with potential applications extending to many other fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scalable quantum computation requires quantum error correction (QEC) or other method of coherence protection.  The requirements to implement QEC are stringent.  Currently, our best hopes are associated with the surface codes invented by Kitaev.  These codes have the weakest set of requirements (highest threshold), and a number of other nice properties which make them easier to implement.  One drawback of the surface codes is their asymptotically zero rate: to work, they require a large overhead in the number of qubits.  The focus of the conducted research was on quantum LDPC codes, so far the only family of codes known to combine finite rates and non-zero fault-tolerant thresholds to scalable quantum computation, and on related statistical-mechanical models which characterize the error-correcting properties of the codes.  While in the case of surface codes the related model is the well-studied square-lattice random-bond Ising model, finite-rate codes lead to models that are necessarily non-local.  For example, hyperbolic codes produce models on hyperbolic graphs; while these are locally planar, they cannot be embedded in any finite-dimensional space without large distortions. Compared to physical models local in D dimensions, we know relatively little about non-local models.  One exception is percolation transition, which corresponds to the erasure channel (some known set of qubits fail).  Percolation theory (percolation on graphs) has experienced a revival in recent years, as an important tool for various network theory and big data applications.  The most important results include (i) a number of lower (existence) and upper bounds for the decodable region of parameters and for the phase transitions in associated models, (ii) detailed numerical simulations of two families of quantum LDPC codes and related models, (iii) a numerical algorithm for computing the distance of quantum and classical LDPC codes, and (iv) a new algebraic construction for finite-rate quantum LDPC codes with explicitly known distances.
