<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will have immediate value for the pharmaceutical industry by accelerating research and discovery of new drugs, and also increasing production efficiency and safety. The technology also is applicable in many other sectors; e.g., monitoring natural polymers, such as dissolution of gelatin used in food or pharmaceutical applications, flocculation of impurities by water purification polymers, entrapment of oil by surfactants and other agents used in combating oil spills, and more.  The quantitative kinetics of molecular weight changes during all these processes will allow deeper understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical forces that drive them. Therefore, many commercial and scientific opportunities exist for the proposed technology, yielding the potential for significant impact across multiple industries. With demonstrated feasibility on applications in protein therapeutics and early adoption by several key users, the initial market for this technology and instrumentation could expand quickly, and sales could reach $10M within several years of delivering a commercial product.  The overall market for the technology will increase in time as other application sectors are developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a new technology for monitoring aggregation in therapeutic protein solutions, which will have wide-ranging impact in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Protein aggregation is a major problem across these sectors engaged in developing new protein pharmaceuticals. Protein aggregation can elicit immune responses against the protein itself, severely reduce bioavailability, and is a significant hurdle in the drug development pipeline. This new technology can simultaneously and quantitatively monitor the stability of many independent protein formulations for hours, days, months, or longer, all under the control of a single instrument and without any significant human intervention.  Because the technology is based on laser light scattering, it provides a rigorous means of monitoring the protein aggregation process.  It is based on fundamental laws of physics, and not on empirical or inferential means. The implementation and use of this technology could revolutionize drug discovery, formulation, and quality control dimensions and accelerate development of new drugs while making existing ones safer and more efficiently produced.  The technology can be used wherever proteins are under development for fighting diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and various forms of cardiovascular disease.</AbstractNarration>

Project Outcomes Report for Award Number 1430434   NSF SBIR Phase II Project: High Throughput Static Light Scattering Platform for Monitoring of Aggregation and Stability of Protein Solutions   APMT?s (dba Fluence Analytics) project was centered on improved commercialization of its Simultaneous Multiple Sample Light Scattering (SMSLS) technology which is expected to become an important research tool for pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers in both industry and academia. SMSLS technology in the ARGEN instrument offers scientists a novel, high throughput way to analyze several key characteristics and identify problems found in the discovery and development of new protein therapeutics, especially as regards aggregation of proteins, a widespread problem in the field and a great hindrance towards achieving clinically effective biologic drugs.   The project was very successful and also pushed the technology into new, unexpected directions, and identified additional market opportunities beyond biotechnology applications. For now, APMT will continue to maintain focus on biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications, but expects to approach characterization of nanoparticles, synthetic and natural.   A high level bulleted list of results from the SBIR Phase II project is found below.      Eight software releases including new features for data retrieval, exception handling, driver updates, data stitching and analyses, and improved UI/UX.   Improved manufacturing and design including US safety certifications and CE markings.ARGEN is also now available in 120V and 240V.   2 journal publications were made using results from the project   3 webinars, 2 technical notes, and 2 application notes resulted from this project   3 product exhibits were held at conferences with updated marketing material including new brochures, FAQs, and infographics.   ARGEN using SMSLS technology was featured in the press 12 times.   Extensive data were gathered, validating the technology on multiple different types of protein samples from industrial partners and academic collaborators              Last Modified: 02/15/2019       Submitted by: Michael F Drenski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
