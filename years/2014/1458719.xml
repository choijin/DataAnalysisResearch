<AbstractNarration>The Supporting Inclusive Excellence (SIE) project at Ursinus College will support 30 academically talented students demonstrating financial need. Scholarships and support programs will assist these students in completing their majors in biology, biochemistry, or neuroscience and in entering the STEM workforce or STEM graduate school following completion of a baccalaureate degree. This project will address a national need for trained individuals to enter a growing number of STEM career opportunities. Over the five-year grant period, 30 students will receive scholarships to help close the gap between existing aid and family contributions for tuition. Not only will academic support systems be provided to scholarship recipients to remain in the pipeline toward future STEM careers, other students on campus will also benefit from some of these supports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical merit of the project lies in its coordinated approach to support recruitment and retention of STEM students through academic advising, curricular and co-curricular activities, mentoring and research opportunities. Activities for scholarship recipients include: 1) intensive co-curricular advising to support STEM coursework, 2) a bridge program to facilitate the transition between the first and second semesters of introductory biology, 3) inclusive pedagogy in introductory biology and chemistry courses, 4) a series of workshops offered by the Career and Professional Development office towards achieving STEM careers, and 5) research opportunities that will strengthen students' connection to the STEM community. The SIE project will be assessed and findings will be shared so that other institutions can incorporate successful approaches for supporting high-achieving and low-income students. The results of the assessment will contribute to the larger knowledge-base regarding the circumstances under which scholarship projects of this type are successful.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ursinus College developed the "Supporting Inclusive Excellence" scholarship program for high achieving, low-income students to support them as they pursued majors and careers in STEM fields.  NSF Award #1458719 supported this project.  The scholarships and associated programs supported three cohorts of ten students who were pursuing bachelor's degrees in Biology, Neuroscience, or Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BCMB) at Ursinus College. Some of the students were part of one or more groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM careers: 47% were first generation college students, 53% were students of color, 13% were members of underrepresented minorities, 63% were Pell grant students, and 77% were women.  In addition to scholarships, the students received intensive one-on-one advising from faculty in Biology, BCMB, and Neuroscience throughout their undergraduate careers.  They had the opportunity to compete for funding for summer research, transportation to internships, externships, and to professional meetings to present their research.  Many took part in a winter break program to prepare them for the second semester first year biology course.   The program included training in experimental design, practice in laboratory skills, practice in speaking skills, visits with Ursinus alumni scientists at other institutions, and community building activities.  The scholars also had the opportunity to take part in recitation programs to review biology course material, study skills, time management skills, and more.   Intellectual Merit:  The intellectual merit of the Supporting Inclusive Excellence Program lies in the fact that students were aided in reaching their full potential through the scholarships and the associated programs.   Further, we accumulated information on how to help students succeed through the development of new programs followed by assessment.  Overall assessment showed a significantly higher rate of retention of the scholars than their peers through the first three mandatory biology courses and all the way to graduation.   We attribute this success to their abilities and hard work, but also to the scholarship and the programs developed to aid them.  For example, the students reported feeling more confident in their majors and at home in the department after the winter break program.  Confidence in themselves is important to all students, particularly students in the groups of which our scholars are members.  Further, we learned that continuing programming beyond the first year is necessary for some students to remain in STEM majors.  In addition, Biology faculty increased their awareness of pedagogy for diverse populations through a monthly reading and discussion group.   Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the Supporting Inclusive Excellence Program lies in the fact that a diverse group of students were prepared for careers in science.  Of the original 30 scholars, 83% have graduated or are on track to graduate on time in 2022 in Biology, BCMB, or Neuroscience.  Post-Ursinus, our graduates have gone on to graduate school, medical school, nursing school, work as laboratory technicians at NIH, universities or biotech firms or are teachers.  Of the graduates thus far, five graduated Phi Beta Kappa. Guiding these students to success benefits the students, but it also benefits the nation, in that it helps to use the talent pool that our citizens comprise.  We have widely shared information on the programs developed through this award with other institutions that may wish to adopt through presentations and publications.   The NSF supported "Supporting Inclusive Excellence" project addressed a national need to prepare students for the STEM workforce.
