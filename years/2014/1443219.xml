<AbstractNarration>This award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp; Mechanism B Program will support a Graduate Research Fellowship Program Round Table to be held at the Reaction Mechanisms Conference at UC-Davis.  In addition to the round table, the award also enables the participants to attend the highly successful Reaction Mechanisms Conference.  The primary objective of this round table is to provide trainings to students in preparing competitive professional proposals.  The round table also provides faculty members with information with which they can guide their students in drafting competitive proposals.   Being able to write competitive proposals is crucial to the success of young chemists in their future careers, especially academic ones.  Success in securing a research fellowship could steer their career choices to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.   Early exposure to high quality research and interactions with world-renowned chemists could all change the life of the aspiring chemists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project consisted of a "Roundtable Discussion" of strategies for success in applying for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP).  The event was held at the Reaction Mechanism Conference, a national scientific conference with approximately 200 participants.  The Roundtable Discussion was led by a panel of experts with experience in the GRFP program, either as reviewers or winners.  The goal of the project was to motivate students to apply for the GRFP, motivate faculty to recruit students to apply for the GRFP, and to provide advice on creating successful applications.  A followup survey finds that students were motivated to submit applications after the activity, and faculty were especially motivated to recruit students to participate.  20% of the eligible students attending the event submitted applications, and nearly 50% of the faculty assisted students in preparing them.  In the end, at least 19 GRFP applications were submitted, either as a direct or indirect result of the project, and of them, threeGraduate Research Fellowships were awarded.    The program advances the mission of the NSF by encouraging top students to become involved in the GRFP, which has very high standards for contributions in Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts.  One of the most important messages of the Panel that students should not wait to think about doing activities that create impact in areas outside their main area of study at the time of the application, and need to start working on them throughout their careers.
