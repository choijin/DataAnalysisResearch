<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to incorporate a vorticity decomposition technique into a numerical model to determine how the sources of vertical vorticity and mechanisms for its intensification, particularly focused on understanding the link between environmental parameters and the outflow/updraft positioning, relate to the development and intensification of near-ground rotation.  This study will also produce a climatological summary of radar data.  Supporting observations will be developed to corroborate findings from the modeling study.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This study provides a conduit for significantly advancing our understanding in vorticity dynamics and mass balances in supercell thunderstorm environments.  This study will provide detailed knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of vorticity sources, sinks and fluxes within severe storms.  The application of prior transformative research by Rotunno (1988) to determine a "balance" between inflow and outflow in the vicinity of the mesocyclone is potentially groundbreaking, by providing a framework for determining an ideal balance relationship for radial mass flux (inflow vs. outflow), especially at low levels.  This work could also provide a significant contribution to tropical cyclone, boundary layer, and general turbulence dynamics.  The evolution of upscale energy cascade into dominant coherent structure could be explained in better detail by the proposed vorticity tracking methods.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to further improve tornado forecasts and warning procedures, through improved lead-times for warnings and reduced false alarm rates.  Moving beyond simple correlations between various environmental parameters to more a process-oriented conceptual model of supercell thunderstorm dynamics has broader impact across a full range of scientific fields of study.  The investigators will use conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications as their primary means of disseminating results to the weather forecasting community.  This study includes a plan to engage undergraduate students through an ongoing Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at Texas A&amp;M University.  The study also includes plans to disseminate educational materials through the UCAR Spark program. The Spark Program is the education and outreach program for the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and its managing organization, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). Spark is a service organization that assists NCAR and UCAR translate their research and operations activities into scientifically accurate, pedagogically effective, and broadly disseminated educational experiences and resources. In addition, Spark works to broaden the diversity within the STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project combined idealized numerical model simulations and analysis of radar observations of supercell thunderstorms in order to test a set of unique hypotheses related to how aspects of the near-storm environment affect production of near-ground rotation in such storms, with implications for tornado forecasting.  More specifically, low-level humidity (as often expressed through a parameter called "lifting condensation level") and the low-level vertical wind profile were varied in a set of numerical modeling studies to examine how these factors combine to influence the characteristics and position of cold, rain-cooled air (often called "outflow") produced by thunderstorms.  We successfully demonstrated that the position of pre-tornadic rotation that forms in this outflow is sensitive to both parameters, and that an ideal position relative to the rest of the storm is essential in intensifying near-ground rotation to potentially tornadic strength.  This relationship, demonstrated in models, was also examined in radar observations of real storms.  The project also laid the foundation to improve advanced diagnostic techniques of the processes that generate strong rotation in supercell thunderstorms.   Intellectual Merit: This project resulted in significant advances in our understanding of the link between aspects of the near-storm environment and properties of supercell thunderstorms that ultimately may dictate whether or not they produce tornadoes.  We also explored the use of novel machine learning techniques in severe weather forecasting applications. Overall, these findings resulted in four peer-reviewed journal articles and 16 presentations at scientific conferences.   Broader Impacts: This project contributed to training four graduate students, and resulted in three Masters degrees, as well as progress towards one other Masters degree and a Ph.D.  Three undergraduate students were directly involved in the project, with related participation by two other undergraduate students.  The lead PI of this project was also a first-time PI, so this project also contributed to his development as an early career scientist.   Apart from scientific training, the results of this project were also used to develop new three dimensional visualizations used to enhance undergraduate education in the PI's severe weather forecasting classes.    Finally, and most importantly, this project will have benefits to society at large.  By advancing our understanding as to how aspects of the near-storm environment affect low-level rotation in thunderstorms, we have identified new ways in which forecasters may use this information to improve severe weather and tornado forecasts and warnings.
