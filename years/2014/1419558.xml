<AbstractNarration>The need for climate impact predictions on regional and decadal scales is widely recognized. Industry, government and society increasingly require predictive information in decision-relevant terms to enable appropriate planning and adaptation to future hazards arising from climate variability and change, both to mitigate future costs and maximize potential benefits. Climate scientists are engaged in significant effort to understand the decadal predictability of the climate system and to develop models to predict the climate on 5-30 year timescales. However, parallel efforts to understand predictive capacity of climate impacts and realize the full societal value of decadal prediction science has received little attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will utilize existing and developing dynamical models combined with observed data using advanced statistical methods to understand our predictive capacity for climate impacts on decadal timescales, and integrate predictive methods so that they more directly meet the societal needs for predictive information. The overarching goal is to transform how scientists from multiple disciplines and practitioners conceptualize decadal climate prediction, by enabling decadal predictions in decision relevant terms to improve planning and adaptive capacity for climate variability and change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach follows in two concurrent parts. Understanding of current predictive information needs and usage will be developed in Part I across multiple high-impact weather and climate phenomena and across multiple stakeholder groups. The core research will take place in Part II and will identify our predictive capacity for the needed information through development of new combined statistical-dynamical modeling approaches that incorporate and are robust to uncertainty. An iterative process between information needs and information provision will promote effective integration of skillful predictive information with decision-making. A key project contribution is the development of a prototype generalized interdisciplinary research framework to integrate predictive capacity with decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

The framework (Figure 1) consisted of a stakeholder-oriented research stream and a climate research stream that became increasingly combined as the project progressed. Later in the project, integration elements combined the research streams, towards the creation of usable climate information.  The work at Colorado State University (CSU) on UDECIDE was in collaboration with researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (project 1419563; PI James Done).  The main focus of the work lead by the CSU group was to develop new statistical models and methods to enhance understanding of predictive capacity on decadal scales. The methods were applied to address problems related to rainfall and temperature, but they can be used more widely and advance the field of statistics as well as the field of atmospheric science.   Spatial correlation refers to the idea that observations that are nearby in space will be more similar than observations that are further away.  Spatial correlation creates many challenges for modeling data and making accurate predictions.   The CSU UDECIDE team advanced statistical modeling and improved predictive capacity on decadal scales in several ways.   Understanding of rare, extreme events like the intensity of large rainfall events is a key to improving predictive capacity on decadal scales.   To effectively plan mitigation strategies for natural hazards caused by extreme precipitation, it is important to build maps that estimate occurrence probabilities and amounts for extreme precipitation events at individual locations. Large rainfall events are well modeled using a method called spatial extremes models. As part of our work on the UDECIDE project we developed a method for spatial extremes models that yields better estimates for extreme data.  We showed the method improves estimates of 100-year return levels for daily precipitation in Colorado.

Our new spatial isotropy spectral test overcomes several deficiencies of other similar tests of isotropy. In our work on UDECIDE, we used the new methodology to ensure that we adopted the appropriate statistical model for sea surface temperatures and precipitation data.   Our research team included the training of four CSU graduate students in the UDECIDE's highly interdisciplinary research environment.  During the project two of the students successfully completed their PhD degrees and two completed their MS degrees from the Department of Statistics.  All four are now employed as statisticians.  The training that they received on the UDECIDE project helped them obtain successful employment.      The UDECIDE project illustrates the effectiveness of a multi-method, integrated research framework for creating usable predictive climate information at decadal timescales. Further, the framework is general and could be applied to other climate regions and contexts, representing a significant broader impact of the project.
