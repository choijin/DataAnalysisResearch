<AbstractNarration>PI: Narayan, Roger J.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1445727&lt;br/&gt;Title: NSF/FDA Scholar in Residence Program on In Vitro Biological Characterization of 3D Printed Small-Scale Medical Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance&lt;br/&gt;The data obtained in this project will serve as the basis for a material property-biological performance database, in which the relationship between in vitro cell-material interactions, protein adsorption, and material processing parameters will be considered. The regulatory science approach will provide a repertoire of methods and tools to understand the fundamental tissue-material interactions for complex and innovative device technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed Scholar-in-Residence (SIR) program, a 3D printing technique known as multi-focus two photon polymerization will be used to create solid tissue barb adhesives with microscale features for tissue penetration and sub-microscale features for cell ingrowth out of a zirconium oxide hybrid material. Tissue barbs are innovative small-scale devices with potential use in wound closure and healing. They will examine use of biocompatible photoinitiators (e.g., riboflavin-triethanolamine mixtures and riboflavin-arginine mixtures) for two photon polymerization-based 3D printing. They will also evaluate incorporation of an electrochemical sensor for monitoring of creatinine within the tissue barb adhesive. In the proposed program, they will collaborate with FDA colleagues to evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility of tissue barb materials that contain sub-micrometer scale pores and creatinine sensor materials using appropriate cells (e.g., dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes).</AbstractNarration>
