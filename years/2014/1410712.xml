<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of their high transition temperatures and exotic new correlated electronic states, high temperature superconductors show a great potential for transformative applications, such as quantum information processing.  The objective of this project is to discover new classes of unconventional superconducting materials and to examine them for evidence of unconventional superconductivity using a new experimental technique that the principal investigator discovered.  The project trains graduate students with backgrounds in physics and engineering to discover new materials and phenomena at the forefront of condensed matter physics research.  The students also participate in international research, carrying out part of their Ph.D. research at the Center for Functional Nanostructures at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.  The US and German laboratories complement each other, thus enhancing the educational experience for the graduate students involved.  The principal Investigator has a history of broadening the participation of underrepresented groups and is involved in outreach activities to recruit more underrepresented students.  This project is establishing a new experimental technique of interest to condensed matter researchers, creating new partnerships, collaborations, and facilities that impact the landscape of the superconducting materials and applications fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Condensed Matter Physics Program in the Division of Materials Research supports the University of Maryland with a project focused on the quest to discover new superconducting materials with new properties, and to further refine the anisotropic nonlinear Meissner effect spectroscopy method into a broadly useful technique that contributes significant results to the ongoing debates about the pairing mechanism in unconventional superconductors.  The principal investigator's discovery of the anisotropic nonlinear Meissner effect photoresponse helps to speed up the discovery of superconducting materials with nontrivial and exotic properties.  The method relies on the anisotropic nonlinear Meissner effect, and the presence of Andreev bound states, to create images of the nonlinear electrodynamic response of the superconductor that illustrate the superconducting gap nodal directions.   The method is sensitive to both bulk properties (through the superfluid anisotropic nonlinear response) and surface properties (through measurement of Andreev bound states associated with the unconventional order parameter).  A superconducting thin film is patterned into a compact self-resonant spiral structure, excited near resonance in the radio-frequency range, and scanned with a focused laser beam perturbation.  At low temperatures, direction-dependent nonlinearities in the reactive and resistive properties of the resonator create photoresponse that maps out the directions of nodes, or of bound states associated with these nodes, on the Fermi surface of the superconductor.  The method was demonstrated on a known nodal superconductor, so the next step is to discover new nodal superconductors by extending the method to work on single crystals and un-patterned thin films.  The co-PI grows the new superconducting materials and the PI performs the experiments both in-house and in collaboration with a group in Karlsruhe, Germany, to discover new nodal superconductors.  The new materials discovered should have potential for transformative applications, including new forms of superconducting electronics, or sensitive single-photon detectors.  The results are disseminated through publications, talks and posters at international conferences, a research web site, a tutorial web site explaining how to set up a nonlinear Meissner effect experiment with minimal equipment, and continuation of the outreach activities by the PI, co-PI and students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             Our project has explored new ways to measure the electromagnetic properties of superconducting materials.  We have developed a microscope that images the nonlinear properties of superconducting thin films and single crystals, giving us direct information about the microscopic physical properties of the material.  The first figure shows such an image of the Y-Ba-Cu-O high-Tc superconductor taken with our microscope.  The second image shows microscope images of a Y-Ba-Cu-O thin film spiral resonator in two different values of perpendicular magnetic field.  We used the magnetic field to suppress the Andreev bound states on the surface of the superconductor, and to then reveal the underlying anisotropic properties of the superconductor.    Understanding the superconducting mechanism for unconventional superconductors from pairing symmetry information will help us to utilize these new types of superconductors for various electromagnetic applications.  Superconductors which have a high transition temperature and high critical field that make them more realistic to utilize in real life, are mostly unconventional superconductors.              We have also used our microscope to perform quantitative imaging of the electrodynamic properties of superconductors.  Of particular note is our work on the proximity effect between the superconductor YB_6 and the topological insulator SmB_6.  The third figure schematically shows the results of our experiments.  The data reveals for the first time that SmB_6 is a true three-dimensional topological insulator and that it develops superconducting correlations in the topological surface state.  This is an important step in understanding topological insulators and moving them towards applications such as quantum computing.   Our method may be applicable to other problems in condensed matter physics. For example, the search for Majorana Fermions, of which Andreev bound states are an example.   Our experiment has proven useful for developing new superconducting metamaterials, such as spirals [C. Kurter, et al.,  Phys. Rev. Applied 3, 054010 (2015)] and rf SQUIDs [Melissa Trepanier, et al., "Coherent Oscillations of Driven rf SQUID Metamaterials,"  Phys. Rev. E 95, 050201(R) (2017)].  It will be utilized for work on quantum metamaterials based on superconducting qubits.                Last Modified: 08/01/2018       Submitted by: Steven M Anlage]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
