The research focuses on improving the quality of thin films and understanding the role of lattice strains and external stimuli on the physical properties of multiferroic thin films. The project support 6 to 9 summer research students with a substantial fraction of students coming from underrepresented minorities (24%) and women (60%).

The project studies the role of the growth conditions, lattice strains, annealing, oxygen stoichiometry, and impurities on the physical and multiferroic properties of polycrystalline and epitaxial RFe2O4 thin films deposited by a reactive electron-beam deposition method. The principal investigator and undergraduate students at Buffalo State College investigate the optical and dielectric properties, spin-charge-lattice couplings, and structure-property relationship in the RFe2O4 thin films using optical and dielectric spectroscopy. The objective is to offer new insight into the magnetoelectric coupling of RFe2O4. In particular, the research focuses on improving the quality of thin films and understanding the role of lattice strains and external stimuli on the physical properties of multiferroic thin films. The results will be important to advancing the multiferroic thin film research. The project supports 6 to 9 summer research students with a substantial fraction of students coming from underrepresented minorities and women. The research provides the students with a valuable research experience and will also prepare them for jobs and the graduate studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this NSF RUI (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) project, we investigated the RFe2O4 (R = Y, Yb, Ho, and Lu) and RFeO3 (R = Yb, Ho, and Lu) oxide families, which belongs to a new class of materials having both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties. The principal investigator and undergraduate students synthesized the compounds and deposited thin films onto single crystal substrates using Electron-Beam Deposition and Magnetron Sputtering techniques. We have developed the appropriate growth conditions to deposit good quality RFe2O4 and RFeO3 thin films. To get insight into the ferroelectric and magnetic properties of the system, we investigated RFe2O4 and RFeO3 thin films by various experimental methods, such as x-ray diffraction, optical spectroscopy, dielectric spectroscopy, electrical transport measurements, and vibrating sample magnetometry.   Our research reveals that these oxides display a wide range of interesting physical properties. The optical spectra of these compounds display an insulating character with the electronic structures dominated by Fe2+ d to d on-site excitations below 2.5 eV and oxygen to iron and rare-earth ions charge-transfer excitations above 3.5 eV. The temperature dependence of the electronic excitations of YbFe2O4 and LuFe2O4 thin films show an anomaly at ~190 K, possibly due to a structural distortion. In addition, we have discovered the electric-field-induced changes in the optical properties, also known as electro-optical effects, of the RFe2O4 thin films in the photon energy range of 1-3 eV, with YbFe2O4 showing the strongest effects up to 14 %. In addition to thin films, we also investigated polycrystals of LuFe2O4 and YbFe2O4. We measured the negative magnetoresistance effects up to 6% in 8 Tesla fields in the ferrimagnetic state of the compounds and such magnetoresistance effects in the RFe2O4 family have not been reported in the literature. Our studies reveal that the electrical transport properties of this family are predominantly coming from the electron hopping between two iron ion sites. Further, the magnetic properties of these compounds show a spin-glass behavior at very low temperatures, attributed to the emergence of the rare-earth ion spins and their interactions with iron spins. We found that the dielectric and ferroelectric properties of these compounds are strongly influenced by the external effects, such as the contact effects, grain boundaries, and impurities. While we observed the polarization-electric field loops in YbFe2O4 below 50 K, the shapes of the P-E loops do not exactly resemble with that of a ferroelectric sample. The dielectric and polarization data do not provide evidence of the intrinsic ferroelectricity in this family.   The RUI project allowed us to explore new and interesting physical properties of the RFe2O4 and RFeO3 oxides. The findings have been disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at the conferences. The project also provided the opportunities to collaborate with a colleague in the physics department and two physicists, each at University at Buffalo and Brooklyn College.
