<AbstractNarration>This is a short-term (one-year) effort to coordinate the testing, delivery, and integration of a new miniature magnetic field instrument for a cubesat being built and launched by Kyung Hee University (KHU) in S. Korea.   The new science magnetometer for cubesats is being developed at University of New Hampshire through a separate effort, funded by NASA, and will be contributed free of charge to this project.  The cubesat named SIGMA (Scientific cubesat with&lt;br/&gt;Instruments for Global Magnetic field and rAdiation) is currently being developed by KHU with funding from the Korean government and is scheduled for launch into a low-Earth orbit in 2015.   The main purpose of the SIGMA mission is cubesat technology demonstration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the addition of a science grade magnetometer, the mission will provide interesting and important data pertaining to waves in the magnetosphere and their role in energization and decay of the Earth radiation belts.  Furthermore, the project will provide in-flight qualification and in-space demonstration of the new magnetometer, making it a valuable asset for future cubesat missions both in the US and internationally.   Finally, the effort will foster and expand an ongoing collaboration on cubesat projects between universities in the US and the KHU in South Korea and will establish an early career scientist in a key coordinating role.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project is to provide a science-grade magnetic sensor ("magnetometer") for a small satellite called "CubeSat". A CubeSat is a type of miniaturized satellite for space research that usually has a volume of exactly one liter (10 cm cube), has a mass of no more than 1.33 kilograms, and typically uses commercial off-the-shelf components for its electronics. The satellite project is being carried out by Kyung Hee University (KHU) in South Korea and named Scientific cubesat with Instruments for Global Magnetic field and rAdiation (SIGMA). The satellite is designed to measure magnetic fields and radiation at low Earth orbit for a projected life time of 3 months.  The major recent trends in magnetometry are decreasing of the sensor size, power consumption, noise level and price with increased long-term stability and resolution in the large range of the measured magnetic fields. In space applications, in particular, miniaturization is becoming one of the most important factors for more cost-effective, low-power operation and thus longer mission life time.  The magnetometer for the CubeSat mission is a "fluxgate" type, one of the most commonly used magnetometers for space-borne missions. Although it is often thought that technologies for fluxgate magnetometers are now matured, there is still a possibility of improvement in the sensor performance, especially in noise level and thus resolution, by using better sensor materials.  To achieve better performances in a smaller package, a science-grade, miniaturized fluxgate magnetometer was under development at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) with NASA EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) funding. The magnetometer is significantly miniaturized and yet its performance is comparable to the bigger-sized counterparts, appropriate for small satellite missions such as CubeSats. UNH was seeking an opportunity to space-qualify the instrument while KHU was looking for a partner who would provide a magnetometer for its CubeSat mission.  The Principal Investigator of this project, Dr. Hyomin Kim, requested one-year funding to carry out international collaborations for the provision of the UNH magnetometer for the SIGMA mission.
