<AbstractNarration>Education researchers, practitioners, industry representatives, and policymakers are increasingly committed to making engineering education accessible to all K-12 students and teachers.  This RAPID project is designed to learn what type of collaborative infrastructure would best support NSF awardees in engaging in the innovative, synergistic research, development, and dissemination activities that will enable engineering to fulfill this important role in K-12 teaching and learning. Focusing on Massachusetts (and the greater Boston area in particular), researchers from Tufts University and EDC will conduct a landscape analysis of K-12 engineering education, highlighting opportunities, gaps, and resources, and identifying areas of overlapping interests among NSF awardees and other stakeholders that may translate into a focus for purposeful activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Massachusetts (and the greater Boston area in particular) serves as a major center for NSF-funded K-12 engineering education research and development activities, NSF awardees engaged in engineering education and housed in institutions around the area do not routinely meet and collaborate as a group in an effort to improve engineering education, and there is currently no infrastructure in place to support NSF awardees and cross-sector collaboration in K-12 engineering education on an ongoing basis.  Thus this is an appropriate testbed for a project concerned to learn more about infrastructures to support funded researchers in efforts to enhance K-12 engineering education.  The researchers will concurrently conduct a robust literature review and interview key stakeholders across sectors (starting with NSF awardees).  A report of findings from this landscape analysis will be disseminated broadly with the goal of informing K-12 engineering education efforts both in the area and nationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit: By galvanizing stakeholders across sectors (e.g. education researchers, practitioners, industry representatives, and policymakers), there is tremendous potential to realize the promise that engineering can play a key role within current and future K-12 teaching and learning. NSF-funded research and development contributions are an important component in this effort. To accomplish this, the project team engaged in 1) a literature review and web search to identify stakeholders, as well as past and current efforts, alliances, and resources; 2) interviews and survey distribution to gather data about levels of awareness among stakeholders, the levels of collaboration, the state of connectedness of the people and agenda related to K-12 engineering education, and issues of interest; 3) a synthesis of findings; and 4) a final report with recommendations for future actions that can leverage the assets of NSF awardees focused on engineering education, support improvements in K-12 engineering education in the Greater Boston region, and have implications for other regions and states seeking to improve engineering education in their schools and communities.  Broader Impacts: The landscape analysis documents the contributions and engagement of K-12 engineering education stakeholders across sectors and demographics. The research process and report have laid the foundation for improving K-12 engineering education in Massachusetts, and specifically, for the development of an K-12 engineering education community focused on engineering for all students. The project team will disseminate the report widely to inform landscape analysis efforts in other locations, to inform those interested in systems of support for education change, and to support collaborations between stakeholders inside and outside of Massachusetts.  Findings and Recommendations:  Key Findings:  Engineering education is included in the standards for all students in Massachusetts; therefore, all students should have equal access to high-quality engineering education. Individuals and organizations want some way of matching the resources that are available to those resources that meet their needs so that funders, program providers, and others can more strategically address the gaps that exist and so users can better find services to meet their needs. Assessments need to measure engineering-related outcomes. NSF awardees may be an underutilized asset in the local landscape.   Recommendations:  Focus on the goal of "Engineering for All" - while this study focused on K-12 engineering education, there is an opportunity to leverage learning experiences across in-school and out-of-school time contexts to expand engineering education for all students. Stakeholders recognize that there needs to be more coordination across these contexts. Increase strategic awareness building through matchmaking - not everyone is currently aware of all of the available resources and opportunities in Greater Boston, and there is no matching service to support the flow of resources to those in need.  In addition, more concerted efforts and synergy is needed between industry, K-12 counselors, and K-12 educators to work together to help frame the conversations about relevancy of engineering as a form of learning, as well as potential career pathways. Support collaborations to develop and effectively implement formative and interim assessments - these can be leveraged to support teaching practices while also providing professional development to effectively implement the type of assessments that can measure engineering outcomes.  Leverage NSF awardees - NSF awardees bring lines of inquiry about engineering education through their research into the local conversation. They contribute expertise and develop/test curricula, professional development, and/or tools at school sites and informal settings. The target audience is often underrepresented populations.           Last Modified: 05/03/201...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
