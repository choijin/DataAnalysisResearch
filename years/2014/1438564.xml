<AbstractNarration>1438564 (Felson). Green walls provide benefits that have fostered the growth of a new industry as they can passively moderate exterior wall surface temperatures and thereby reduce building heating and cooling loads, attenuate surface temperature variations and solar exposure that degrade exterior wall finishes, and provide ecosystem service benefits including air pollution and particulate removal, mitigation of urban heat island effects, and urban wildlife habitats.  To date, these benefits do not offset the costs of green walls, and therefore, the market for green walls remains limited.  This research will address problems that must be resolved to transform existing green wall technology into an active technology for process heat rejection (i.e., principally, here, for chilled water generation), and thereby expand the market to a wide range of applications from households to institutions and industry.  The objective is to provide a sustainable alternative to wet cooling tower technology that maintains the benefits of existing green walls, employing their methods of construction and operation, while avoiding the shortcomings of wet cooling tower technologies (i.e., single use and contamination of cooling water). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are targeting the creation of a green wall heat rejection technology with integrated water biofiltration capabilities and a mathematical transport model to simulate the thermal and biofiltration performance of the technology for experimental and design purposes.  The performance of these "thermoGreenWallTM" (tGW) systems will be investigated through coordinated experimental and modeling methods using lab-scale tGW panels and full-scale prototypes and a tanks-in-series model developed by the PIs.  The lab-scale tGW panels will be constructed as mesocosm experiments to systematically investigate plant/substrate compatibility/productivity (e.g., using a root area meter and destructive sampling for root biomass determination), plant health (e.g., using chlorophyll fluorescence), water biofiltration methods, performance, and interaction with plant/substrate systems, and heat rejection transport mechanisms and performance.</AbstractNarration>

We face daunting challenges with countering the effects of infrastructure development and reduced vegetation that lead to urban heat island effects, increased stormwater runoff, and high levels of building energy consumption. With climate change paired with population growth and urbanization both human and natural systems are threatened. Yet urban landscapes are rarely planned to promote ecosystem functions.

The tGW is a vertically constructed wetland that combines the benefits of wetland in reducing heat in the outdoor environment with the functionality of cooling towers in reducing heat in indoor building infrastructure. This is achieved through convective and evaporative heat and mass transfer from hot water circulating through integrated plant-porous media. Building upon existing green wall systems, tGWs are integrated with a building&rsquo;s cooling system to receive warm water produced as a cooling byproduct. As opposed to wet cooling towers which rely upon evaporation to directly release the warm water as steam, tGWs offer an opportunity to reuse the cooling system water through the green wall system. tGWs increase the amount and temperature of water recirculating through the green wall system and modifies existing green wall configurations, substrates and water distribution systems, in order to promote heat rejection. tGWs utilize plants that can tolerate wet roots and elevated temperature conditions and provide strategically useful co-benefits alongside the heat rejection service. Shifting the heat rejection to green wall systems allows the pre-use of the water for other purposes prior to its use for heat rejection.</p> <p>Utilizing modeling, greenhouse, and outdoor experimentation, we constructed a series of functional tGW systems that actively rejected heat to offset indoor cooling loads. Through experimentation we determined that green walls can reject as much as 500 Watts/meter2 depending on conditions and flow rate. With the outdoor green wall experiment we achieved a peak cooling capacity of 400 W/m2 at a flow rate of 0.5 gpm. &nbsp;With this heat rejection capacity and the maintenance of plant health, we were able to construct a highly functional system and determine the heat rejection capabilities in various climatic and construction scenarios, identify plant types for the system, and determine water temperature thresholds for green wall plant vitality and heat rejection. Through our research we also explored microclimate conditions and boundary layers and integrated a bioreactor filtration system to further maximize water reuse and conservation. We selected native wetland plants that can tolerate heavy inundation (given the increased flow rates over traditional green wall systems) and tested plant health across a temperature gradient and subjected to the green wall conditions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The outcomes of our study demonstrate the feasibility and success of tGW technology as a sustainable alternative to wet cooling towers. Field studies were performed first in an optimized greenhouse environment and subsequently integrated into the Urban Ecology and Design Lab as a sustainable outdoor cooling system for rejecting heat and cooling the lab, and eventually as a prototype for a whole building system to supplement a 65 (228 kW) HVAC cooling system in an outdoor location in New Haven, CT. Our next steps will be to continue to evaluate the tGW and focus particularly on public health considerations as well as operational concerns. Building on relationships with the industry, we are planning to construct a full scale prototype and test the system in situ. We determined through modeling analysis that &nbsp;tGWs may be most effective in Marine and Hot/Dry Mixed climates (i.e.: Las Vegas, NV and Portland, OR), indicating areas for future study in the development and optimization of tGW technology. We plan to target these locations. We are also exploring international projects for implementation. Direct comparisons between tGW functioning in climates across the U.S. and worldwide would improve our overall understanding of tGW capabilities and potential for partially or fully replacing wet cooling towers. Building on our existing relationships with industry partners, we will seek to further progress through larger-scale development, production, and implementation potential.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Alexander&nbsp;Felson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525233914301_OutdoorGreenwallIMG_5372--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525233914301_OutdoorGreenwallIMG_5372--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Outdoor Thermo Greenwal"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525233914301_OutdoorGreenwallIMG_5372--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Outdoor Thermo Greenwal"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image illustrates the outdoor Thermo greenwall panels used to reject heat from the UEDLAB and to test heat rejection capacity and plant health</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alex Felson</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;Felson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Outdoor Thermo Greenwal</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525233645736_tgwCrosssectionexample--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525233645736_tgwCrosssectionexample--rgov-800width.jpg" title="TGW system"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525233645736_tgwCrosssectionexample--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="TGW system"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Building systems can be coupled with adjacent public space to actively reject heat.</div> <div class="imageCredit">UEDLAB</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;Felson</div> <div class="imageTitle">TGW system</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525266601349_ComparisonDiagram_AFtGWNSF--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525266601349_ComparisonDiagram_AFtGWNSF--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Comparison Diagram"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525266601349_ComparisonDiagram_AFtGWNSF--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Comparison Diagram"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This compares thermo Greenwalls to Cooling Towers.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alex Felson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;Felson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Comparison Diagram</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525266764806_YIBS2025_tGW_Image--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525266764806_YIBS2025_tGW_Image--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Building System thermo Greenwall"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525266764806_YIBS2025_tGW_Image--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Building System thermo Greenwall"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We propose a series of thermo Greenwalls or vertically constructed wetlands functioning like a cooling tower to reject heat from a large building system HVAC</div> <div class="imageCredit">Liyang Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;Felson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Building System thermo Greenwall</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525267211920_ThermoDynamictGW--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525267211920_ThermoDynamictGW--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Thermodynamic Processes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438564/1438564_10319478_1525267211920_ThermoDynamictGW--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Thermodynamic Processes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image compares cooling towers to wetland systems in terms of heat rejection.
