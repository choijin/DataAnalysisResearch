<AbstractNarration>Video data is ubiquitous in STEM education research and development. Yet the potential for these data to be used outside the initial project in which they are developed has been limited by the labor intensive methodology to index and categorize video segments in ways that support use by external researchers. This project will build the community to determine the taxonomy by which videos might be characterized. The researchers and a strong advisory board will work with the programmers of inVideo, a tool and software for indexing language and non-language objects in video data sets. Working with video of students and teachers in mathematics classrooms from the Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning, the project will determine which categories of videos from the collection are amenable for indexing by introducing successively more complex video samples. The project will push the boundaries of computer science algorithms for video search, benefiting both the computer science community and the mathematics education research and development communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is currently no automated method for accessing the content data locked within a video format that is cost effective and available for education purposes. The researchers in this project will determine whether application of automated indexing to generate high precision and high recall retrievals is possible; what human-augmented annotation generates towards more effective searching; and, advisable practices for obtaining IRB approval to share video resources among a wider community of researchers to facilitate a fine-grained analysis on other data sets. The project will train the audio-to-text translation function of inVideo to recognize speech patterns of people recorded in the videos using translations that currently exist. The second stage of the project will address the process of testing new samples of videos for which human-generated transcripts do not exist.  The project will also develop a web interface for inVideo to facilitate transcript editing, time-stamped commenting and tagging by remote users. The results of this study will enhance the utility of educational video to a wide community of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Learning mathematics is a complex process that requires a multiplicity of conceptual lenses to properly understand and model this process. Relevant conceptual perspectives include those generated by mathematics education researchers, mathematicians, discourse analysts, child developmental psychologists, learning scientists, among others. Too often, however, the benefits of mathematics education research are limited to the community of mathematics education researchers, and their local students. The reasons for this limitation are many, including difficulty of establishing funding support for interdisciplinary studies, and the transient nature of children&rsquo;s learning behaviors in mathematics. In order to make records of children&rsquo;s learning behaviors more accessible and permanent, education researchers have, for decades, used videotaping of learning within classroom contexts. Careful study of video recordings allows not only the study of how ideas are built by learners, but also how to learn about the subtleties of student thought processes, to trace student cognitive growth in various social settings, and to gain insight into how social processes influence personal cognitive development. Videos have served as a powerful tool for tracing a student&rsquo;s development of mathematical ideas and ways of reasoning over time. One major database of children&rsquo;s learning mathematics (over 4500 hours) has been developed over decades by Rutgers University with financial support from the NSF. The VideoMosaic Collaborative [VMC] (www.videomosaic.org) is a Repository currently housing more than 400 hours of these video data and metadata, available worldwide as open source. In addition, the VMC stores selected analyses of elements of the database, and with the RUanalytic tool, enable users to create a video narrative. These video narratives have been used for research, instruction and linked to associated scholarly work.The goals of the BCC project were to:&nbsp;(a) significantly build capacity to search the video database collection housed at Rutgers for future ingesting into the VMC, through developing the prototype technology tool, inVideo, for automated processing of video data using audio-to-text translation, embedding metadata tags within video files, and iteratively refining search algorithms with guidance from a multidisciplinary team, thereby enabling data mining techniques suitable for big data analytics;(b) efficiently and extensively build community by assembling and leveraging a multidisciplinary team of experts to develop technologies and taxonomies that open up access to relevant video data resources, thereby enabling novel research with extant video data and informing capture and use of future video data to be ingested into the VMC; and (c) finally, to support the research team as they accumulate knowledge about how to collect and store video data in the future, so that the resulting database can be optimally searchable.In the three years of the project, the collaborative partners, Rutgers University and Metonymy have: (a) conducted research; (b) offered training workshops and tutorials on searchable databases; (c) presented research findings and shared new knowledge with colleagues worldwide; (d) published research findings in research journals and peer-reviewed volumes; (e) supported dissertation-level research; (f) published over 50 VMCAnalytics on the VMC; and (g) expanded the efficacy of the collection.Overall, the project provided substantive educational opportunities for more than 100 graduate and undergraduate students from a range of learning and education disciplines at a half a dozen universities (Rutgers; Maryland; New York University; Texas A &amp; M; UCLA; UC-Santa Cruz; George Mason; Indiana). Evaluation results indicate the project has been successful in engaging colleagues and students in various formats. Additionally, the project has illuminated a number of fundamental ideas about the interrelationships among mathematics, learning sciences, language, literacy, and computer science. The general project findings indicate that using inVideo as an assessment tool with videos has important implications for teaching and learning with video, especially for teacher preparation and development. Further development of this tool will open this extensive and unique major database to researchers and scholars, worldwide, and support further collaboration in research in the mathematics education, learning sciences, and language/literacy learning in the STEM disciplines.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Carolyn&nbsp;A&nbsp;Maher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
