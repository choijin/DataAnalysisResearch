<AbstractNarration>As digital evidence becomes increasingly important in criminal and civil litigation, and as concerns about personal privacy and the sharing of digital information by both public and private sector entities increase, a clear need is emerging to create a code of professional ethics that would govern the activities of digital forensics practitioners.  To this end, the PI will organize a conference that will provide an opportunity for attendees to familiarize themselves with ethical issues relating to the practice of digital forensics and to begin the process of developing an overarching, consensus-based, code of professional ethics for digital forensics practitioners similar to what the legal, research and medical organizations have created. Subjects to be addressed include Digital Forensic Investigations, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Jurisprudence, and Education and Awareness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to resulting in a plan for designing, implementing, and enforcing a code of ethics, the proceedings of the conference would be published and thus made available to scholars and practitioners in the field, while media coverage of the event will provide information to informed citizens concerned about ethical issues in digital forensics and its practice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On May 13-14, 2015 a workshop on professional ethics and digital forensics - the practice using tools and procedures to identify, recover, analyze, and present in court information stored on digital devices - was convened at National Science Foundation (NSF) headquarters in Arlington, VA. .  The workshop's purpose was to explore ethical issues involving the practice of digital forensics and whether a need exists to develop a code of professional ethics for practitioners  While some two dozen professional associations exist to serve the digital forensics field (and many of them have codes for members), there is wide variability in the sophistication of these codes. No overarching code of professional ethics currently exists for the field.  Originally funded as a three-day conference, due to minimal pre-registration and after extensive discussions with NSF Program Managers the PI decided the event would be changed to a two-day workshop whose sessions would remain as originally envisioned: 1) the need for a code of ethics; 2) models for a code of ethics; 3) challenges to developing a code of ethics; 4) core areas in a code of ethics; and 5) next steps. A total of 12 academics (n=8) and practitioners (n=4) attended at least one session. Attendees' overall assessment of the event was positive with 88% rating it "excellent" or "good."  The following consensus opinions emerged: 1) an overarching code of professional ethics is needed for digital forensics practitioners; 2) as more academic programs in digital forensics are created, curricula should include at least one course in professional ethics; 3) models for what the code might look like currently exist with professional associations like the American Bar Association (ABA); 4) due to fragmenation in the practice of digital forensics, a top-down and bottom-up strategy must be undertaken that affords relevant stakeholders a role in creating the code; 5) alignment with a major professional association (e.g., American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS)) is warranted for help in creating the code and possibly administering it; 6) creating the code will likely take a decade of effort by dedicated academics and practitioners.  Next steps for the project included: 1) creating a mailing list or other mechanism (e.g., a Dropbox site) to allow attendees to share communications about professional ethics and access resources on the topic; 2) working with relevant professional associations to create a plan to develop a code of ethics for digital forensics professionals; 3) connecting with relevant sections of the professional associations to create a working group on professional ethics and digital forensics; 4) replicating the workshop (or a thematic panel) at 3-5 professional conferences during the 2015-2016 academic year; 5) developing at least one manuscript for publication in a scholarly journal based on results of the workshop; 6) disseminating results of the workshop in trade/popular press outlets; and 7) developing one or more papers to present at professional conferences during 2015-2016.  A Dropbox site was created in late May for workshop attendees (http://www.dropbox.com/home/NSF_ethics_workshop) that allows them to upload and download material on professional ethics. Professor Marcus Rogers of Purdue University agreed to serve as the group's liaison with the American Bar Association's (ABA) Science and Technology section and the American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) Digital and Multimedia Sciences section (for which he is the incoming Chair). Professor Rogers has  shared results of the workshop with members of both sections and will create a working group on ethics in the AAFS section. The workshop was replicated as a "thematic panel" at the Annual Meetings of the Southern Criminal Justice Association (September 10, 2015 in Charleston, SC) to five attendees. Additionally, approval has been granted by AAFS to replicate the workshop in its entirety at the Academy's 2016 Ann...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
