<AbstractNarration>This research award will use the unique event of the 2013 hyper-typhoon Haiya in the Philippines to learn about the impacts of massive, natural catastrophes on the survival and potential recovery of vertebrate animal populations and species. This is premised on the fact that the research team had been conducting comprehensive vertebrate species surveys for about five years in the Philippine archipelago immediately prior to the recent typhoon. This work is important because such studies have not been conducted before, and they can tell us a great deal about the processes of local extirpation, colonization, adaptation and recovery or extinction of both populations and species. In a time of global environmental change, such studies provide society and resource managers with valuable empirical examples of what can be expected regarding the responses of biological diversity to particular catastrophic environmental changes, and how planning for the future might best proceed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first research objective is to provide an immediate "after the typhoon" species and abundance survey dataset to complement the prior, fortuitous 5 year effort. The research team has over 10 well-studied sites for which comprehensive inventories are already developed, and where they will assess species community changes caused by the typhoon. All survey methods are based on a proven field research program in the Philippines. The research team scouts sites, establishes camps, blazes transects, constructs trapping arrays (snap traps and live traps for mammals; pit fall traps, funnel traps, and adhesive traps for mammals, amphibians, and reptiles; and mist nets and harp traps for birds and bats), collects and handles live animals, collects all relevant data, photographs specimens, screens vertebrates for parasites, preserves genetic samples, and prepares modern museum specimens including associated ecological and microhabitat data. Resurveys will be linked to analyses of vegetation change developed from satellite imagery at two spatial resolutions, permitting broad extension of the point-based survey results to infer effects of the typhoon across the entire Philippine archipelago. The second main goal is to train a cohort of collaborating scientists in standardized survey methodology and data analysis frameworks to set the stage for a sustainable series of follow-up studies 3, 5, and 10 years after the 2014 surveys. This will be accomplished using (1) an established collaborative network in the Philippines of participating researchers, students, local government units, and conservation NGOs; (2) currently valid research permissions that allow for collection and export of biological specimens; (3) established logistical infrastructure and host sponsorship at several major universities and the national museum of the Philippines; (4) equipment, supplies, and a 4-wheel drive field vehicle ready for immediate use; and (5) research-active in-country counterparts with a proven track record of working with the NSF PI awardees. By involving students from both the U.S. and the Philippines (and their advisors) the research ensures a multi-academic-generational collaboration that maximizes training and capacity building to achieve research objectives.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In the Philippine global conservation hotspot, land vertebrate megadiversity is not evenly distributed over the archipelago, but, rather, has become concentrated in geographic centers of species diversity as a result of ecological processes and evolutionary history. On November 8<sup>th</sup>, 2013, one of these pockets of extraordinary species diversity took a direct hit when Super Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda), the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded at landfall, slammed into Leyte and Samar islands and then continued through the central Philippines. The major metropolitan area of Tacloban City was devastated, as were many towns to its north, south, and west as the storm tracked a swath of destruction through the central portion of the archipelago (Figure 1). The loss of human life was catastrophic (an estimated 6,400 casualties), devastating property damage was widespread, and basic services were interrupted for months and, in some cases, years.</p> <p>The highly threatened remaining forested areas (patches of green in Figure 1) on many islands were also badly damaged or, in many cases, completely leveled. Although typhoons are common occurrences in the Philippines (on average, more than 20 hit the country annually; Figure 2) few have caused both such widespread (the width of the storm), and intensely concentrated (the force sustained at the storm&rsquo;s center) damage in recent decades.</p> <p>Much like the eruption of Mt. St. Helens in the United States (May 18<sup>th</sup>, 1980), the widespread disturbance to Philippine forests caused by Typhoon Haiyan presented an unprecedented opportunity for biologists to study how tropical forests recover following catastrophic disturbance. Following on a five-year NSF Biotic Surveys and Inventories project (DEB 0743491, initiated in 2008), U.S. and Philippine researchers mobilized in the aftermath of Haiyan to establish a network of scientists interested in following the recovery of Philippine forests at several key sites (Figure 1) where previous biodiversity inventory surveys had already been conducted.</p> <p>With this award, a first round of follow-up vertebrate biodiversity surveys has been conducted by visiting the same sites and sampling the same forests, using equivalent methods and sampling effort whenever possible (Figure 1). With this immediate &ldquo;post-Haiyan&rdquo; view of Philippine forest biodiversity for comparison to the &ldquo;pre-Haiyan&rdquo; estimates, biologists have taken the first steps for establishing a baseline for the long-term study of reorganization of animal communities after heavy forest disturbance (Figure 3).</p> <p>The research has the potential to inform scientists about important ecological processes related to the maintenance of biodiversity in a global biodiversity conservation hotspot. The Philippine archipelago is a dynamic, geologically complex, volcanically active group of more than 7,100 islands on the western edge of the Ring of Fire. Biologists have identified the dynamic nature of the archipelago as a possible causal agent that, along with frequent disturbance from the typhoon belt, may have contributed to the production and maintenance of the country&rsquo;s celebrated levels of vertebrate biodiversity. Observing short-term processes related to species turnover, ecological succession, shifts in community composition, and reestablishment of forest populations may all help biologists and the public understand&mdash;and conserve&mdash;the unique and highly endemic biodiversity of the Philippines.</p> <p>This work has enhanced an established international collaboration and provided new opportunities for intellectual exchange and student training from the U.S. and the Philippines. For the next generation of biodiversity researchers and conservationists, the importance of student training and field based learning experiences cannot be over emphasized.

Our work has enhanced intellectual exchange between our countries, trained numerous new students, enabled new conceptual studies of the evolutionary processes of diversification in a model island archipelago, provided fuel for conservation, and contributed to an enhanced societal appreciation for terrestrial biodiversity in the Philippines.&nbsp;Ultimately our work strengthens intellectual exchange among scientists, university students, government natural resource managers, and non-governmental conservation groups in both of our historically and culturally linked countries.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Rafe&nbsp;Brown</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418895/1418895_10307724_1472571313905_Fig.3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418895/1418895_10307724_1472571313905_Fig.3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418895/1418895_10307724_1472571313905_Fig.3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Heavily damaged forests near Balangiga, southern Samar Island.
