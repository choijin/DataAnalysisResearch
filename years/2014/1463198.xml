<AbstractNarration>Soil-bentonite slurry trench cutoff walls are widely used for seepage control, levee repair, and pollutant containment. Their widespread use in these critical applications requires a better understanding of their as-built condition and long-term behavior. Regarding the as-built condition, the in-place permeability of cutoff walls is heavily influenced by the presence of defects and by the stress within the wall. Conventional construction quality control programs are insufficient to verify backfill homogeneity throughout the installation, and commercial technologies are not yet available for non-destructively detecting defects or verifying the absence of defects. Regarding long-term behavior, several factors may cause changes in permeability of the wall over time including changes in stress and wet-dry cycling. This project seeks to address these questions regarding both the short-term (as-built) and long-term integrity of cutoff walls through the design, construction, in-situ testing, and monitoring of a fully instrumented cutoff wall to be installed near the Bucknell University campus. Society will benefit from better understanding and performance from our dams, levees and pollutant containment systems and from substantial teaching, training, and mentoring through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the research, outreach to secondary students as part of the annual engineering summer camp, and exposure of students and practitioners to the state of the art/practice for cutoff walls via formal seminar presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cutoff wall will be fully instrumented to monitor in-situ conditions in the backfill (e.g., 3D state of stress, vertical and lateral deformations, and pore water pressures) as a function of time and location. Electrical resistance imaging will be investigated for locating defects placed within the wall at known locations and of known size, with the goal of developing a viable geophysical methodology for defect detection in SB walls. The monitoring will be complemented with lab tests and in-situ tests (e.g., cone penetration, vane shear, dilatometer, and standard penetration tests), also performed over time to reveal time-dependent behavior. Finally, numerical model simulations to predict the stress distribution within an SB cutoff wall will be performed and the results compared with the measured field stresses.  All field and lab data will be managed within a geospatial information system framework that will be made accessible to the public via the web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to design and construct an experimental, large-scale soil-bentonite (SB) cutoff wall and conduct field research on the short- and long-term integrity of the constructed wall.   The goals of the project were (1) to investigate the in-situ state of stress in the wall at the end of construction and over time; (2) to investigate spatial and temporal variability in the in-situ properties of the backfill, and (3) to investigate the optimal and efficient parameters of electrical resistivity (ER) imaging to detect heterogeneities, including defects, within the wall.  The wall was constructed near the Bucknell University campus in July 2016 and is approximately 194 m long and 7 m deep.  The wall was instrumented with an array of monitoring equipment, including inclinometers, settlement plates, monitoring wells, and piezometers, and earth pressure sensors.  In addition, the northernmost 50 m of the wall was set aside as a defect detection research zone to investigate the use of ER imaging to detect defects installed in the wall during construction. The ER imaging provided insight into limitations of the method, where defects smaller than 0.06 m^3 were not detected, and indicated that the resistivity of the side-walls can significantly impact defect detection. The three-dimensional state of stress in the backfill has been monitored continuously since July 2016.  In addition, a comprehensive study was undertaken to assess the variability in hydraulic conductivity (k) of the backfill in the wall based on both field (in situ) and laboratory tests.  More than 150 measurements of k were made in this study.  The results of the stress monitoring showed that effective stresses were transient for several months after construction before stabilizing at levels far lower than expected based on an assumed geostatic distribution. The results of the k study indicate that the typical quality control approach of conducting laboratory  tests on backfill specimens molded from grab samples of loose, field-mixed backfill appears adequate, but only if the applied effective stresses in the tests are representative of the in-situ stresses in the wall.  Also, slug testing is shown be a viable method for postconstruction assessment of in situ backfill k in full-scale SB wall installations.These findings have important practical implications for design and construction of SB cutoff walls.     In terms of broader impacts, the improved understanding of the state of stress and the impact of stress on engineering properties and behavior of soil-bentonite slurry trench cufoff walls may potentially lead to design and construction of future containment systems that offer improved protection of the public health the the environment.  More than 10 peer-reviewed papers generated from the research have been published in a variety of conference and journal venues, and additional papers are expected in the months and years ahead.  In addition, this project has provided substantial training and professional development opportunities for students.  In total, 16 students contributed to the research on the project, including five female students (two of which were students of color) and three international students.  Several of these students are now purusing graduate degrees or have become pracitioners in the fields of geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering.  In addition, the PIs and our industrial partner (Geo-Solutions, Inc.) have leveraged the project for additional student training and education through courses taught at Bucknell University and outreach to middle-school and high-school students as part of the the Bucknell Engineering Summer Camp.  The education component has expanded the student training to dozens of students beyond those directly involved in the research.
