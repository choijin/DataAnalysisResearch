<AbstractNarration>Big data applications demand high speed, reliable, and energy  &lt;br/&gt;efficient data storage systems. Traditional storage architectures have  &lt;br/&gt;fundamental limitations because of legacy systems that have centered  &lt;br/&gt;on spinning hard disk drives. With rapid advances in nonvolatile  &lt;br/&gt;memory technologies such as NAND-gate flash, phase change memory, Memristor, and  &lt;br/&gt;magnetic RAM, a great opportunity arises for revolutionizing storage  &lt;br/&gt;architectures. The objective of this research is to start a paradigm  &lt;br/&gt;shift in storage architecture to meet the increasing demand of big  &lt;br/&gt;data applications. It is envisioned that future storage systems will  &lt;br/&gt;have machine intelligence that learns, analyzes, predicts, and  &lt;br/&gt;controls the system at runtime dynamically. A novel accelerator  &lt;br/&gt;architecture is introduced with machine intelligence to enable high  &lt;br/&gt;speed processing of storage data operations that are critical to high  &lt;br/&gt;performance computing in general and big data computing in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   The newly introduced I/O accelerator, residing either in a  &lt;br/&gt;many-core CPU chip or on a storage controller board, enables  &lt;br/&gt;sufficiently accurate predictions for effective optimization of  &lt;br/&gt;storage I/Os. With new architecture features, the proposed I/O  &lt;br/&gt;accelerator can carry out complicated I/O tasks in the speed  &lt;br/&gt;comparable to the emerging nonvolatile memories, which is critical to  &lt;br/&gt;I/O performance because it no longer operates in milliseconds as  &lt;br/&gt;spinning disks do. The project will explore and implement the I/O  &lt;br/&gt;accelerator that can effectively deal with the complexity and high  &lt;br/&gt;dimensionality of factors related to diverse storage technologies, a  &lt;br/&gt;large variation of application workloads, different  &lt;br/&gt;reliability/availability requirements, and power consumptions of  &lt;br/&gt;various storage components. The result is a new heterogeneous storage  &lt;br/&gt;architecture that is optimized for future computing infrastructure.  &lt;br/&gt;With the accelerator as an enabler, comprehensive methodology will be  &lt;br/&gt;investigated that proactively learns system behavior to anticipate  &lt;br/&gt;long-term trends and to respond quickly to fast changing I/O events.  &lt;br/&gt;The new architecture is believed to be the first of the kind providing  &lt;br/&gt;dynamic optimizations by means of 1) intelligent data placements and  &lt;br/&gt;replacements across heterogeneous devices, 2) optimal resource  &lt;br/&gt;allocation and provisioning to applications' workloads, 3) effective  &lt;br/&gt;data deduplication based on content locality, and 4) smart policy  &lt;br/&gt;decision on data protection and recovery adaptive to different data  &lt;br/&gt;types. Furthermore, the new accelerator enables fast in-situ data  &lt;br/&gt;analytics in active storage systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is expected  to have the following broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;1) In today's cloud computing and big data  &lt;br/&gt;applications, servers generate a large amount of I/Os that can take  &lt;br/&gt;full advantage of the new storage architecture. 2) The new accelerator  &lt;br/&gt;can be incorporated into many core CPUs as a specialized core for  &lt;br/&gt;future heterogeneous processors. 3) The new storage architecture will  &lt;br/&gt;speed up the adoption of emerging storage class memories. 4) The new  &lt;br/&gt;methodology will stimulate more research in applying machine learning  &lt;br/&gt;to storage systems. 5) The new CPU-and-data centric Computer Engineering curriculum will train  &lt;br/&gt;both graduate and undergraduate students for real world needs. 6) The  &lt;br/&gt;outreach program will continue the success stories of prior NSF  &lt;br/&gt;projects to help the economic development of the state of Rhode Island and the  &lt;br/&gt;nation.</AbstractNarration>
