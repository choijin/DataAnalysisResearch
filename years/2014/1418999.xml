<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative proposal, Drs. Sebastien Lépine and Eric Gaidos will complete the largest and most complete census of nearby, low-mass stars, which are called M dwarf stars.  They will identify the highest priority targets for planet searches, especially for Earth-mass planets in or near the habitable zones of their parent stars. Many previous surveys have been biased against these targets because they are faint or incompletely cataloged; furthermore, some M dwarf stars may have flares and spots that render them unsuitable for planet searches. The SUPERBLINK stellar motion survey, now being completed by Dr. Lépine, includes more than 95% of the estimated 50,000 low-mass systems within 50 parsecs of the Sun. The research team will carry out a large-scale spectroscopic survey of 10,000 stars to monitor atmospheric activity, estimate heavy element abundances, determine space motions, and infer ages, in order to select for targets with the highest potential for exoplanet discoveries.  They will also build and maintain a comprehensive database of exoplanet search targets that will include each star's fundamental parameters (luminosity, distance, composition, activity level, estimated mass and age) and will track the results of any effort to identify exoplanets in each of those systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The list of exoplanet targets will be made publicly available and updated on a regular basis to track down targets of current exoplanet survey programs, and those around which planets have already been discovered. This will allow for exoplanet researchers to coordinate their efforts, and for the public to be kept informed of the latest discoveries. Undergraduate interns (two per year) will be involved at all stages of the research project at AMNH. One graduate student at the University of Hawaii will participate in the spectroscopic and photometric investigations. Results of this research will be incorporated into the American Museum of Natural History / Hayden Planetarium database (the Digital Galaxy), which is presented to 1 million visitors each year as part of the Planetarium's immersive 3D Space Show. A short video for public outreach will be produced each year on some aspect of this research, extrasolar planets, or habitability.</AbstractNarration>

Because small planets are easier to discover if they orbit small stars, this research project focused on the identification of the type of stars known as "red dwarfs". While they are the most common type of stars in our galaxy, red dwarfs are also dim, and difficult to find on the sky. Our research program combined a number of techniques (looking at bot the motions and colors of stars) to identify over 1.5 million red dwarfs.&nbsp; We have collected detailed information describing the physical properties of the brightest 1,500 of these red dwarfs, after conducting a spectroscopic survey using telescopes in Arizona and Hawaii. These relatively bright stars are the easiest red dwarf that can be observed when searching for exoplanets, and are now high priority targets in the search for exoplanets. In addition, a search of our catalogue has identified hundreds of red dwarfs that appear to be relatively young. These stars are now of high interest for exoplanet planet research because they can reveal how planets look like as they are forming and growing, which has the potential to shed light on the formation of our own solar system. These lists of M dwarfs are now being used in several exoplanet research projects, for example the Mearth exoplanet search (US-based) and the CARMENES exoplanet survey (in Europe). Most notably, we have also provided lists of over 25,000 stars that have be observed with NASA's Kepler space telescope mission, which is specifically designed to search for exoplanets using the so-called transit method. Dozens of new exoplanets have already been discovered with Kepler orbiting many of those stars, and extensive research is still ongoing, promising that more planets will be discovered.&nbsp; In addition, a large list of over 200,000 stars is also now being assembled, to be observed with NASA's upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. The consensus now is that exoplanets are just as common around red dwarfs as they are around stars like our Sun, and it is expected that, in the near future, hundreds of even thousands of new exoplanets will be discovered orbiting stars identified in this research project, some of which will be comparable in size to our Earth. Over the course of this project, one post-doctoral fellow, two graduate students, sixteen undergraduate students, and twelve high-school students, have been involved directly or indirectly in various phases of the research, learning valuable research and computer skills and becoming knowledgable about stars and exoplanets.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Sebastien&nbsp;Lepine</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
