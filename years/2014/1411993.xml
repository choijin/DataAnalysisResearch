<AbstractNarration>With support of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, Professor Susan Lunte, in collaboration with Professors Christian Sch√∂neich (University of Kansas), Christopher Culbertson (Kansas State University) and Christian Amatore (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS), will develop new analytical methodologies that can be used to investigate chemical reactions in single biological cells.  A central focus of the research will be the development of microfluidic devices for manipulating single cells and conducting measurements of cell chemical reactions using electrical and optical techniques.  Microfluidic devices are ultrasmall plumbing networks of channels and valves which can precisely manage small volumes of liquids (one-millionth to a few billionths of a liter).  Microfluidics thus enable the study of small systems such as living cells, and also the rapid collection of data.  This project is a multidisciplinary/international collaboration between four research groups, each providing unique expertise and facilities. Graduate students will be part of an interdisciplinary team and will acquire training in the fields of chemistry, microfluidics, cell biology, and neurobiology. As part of this project, microfluidics will be integrated into the problem-based learning portion of the instrumental analysis course at the University of Kansas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed methods are based on microchip electrophoresis with electrochemical detection. Microchip electrophoresis permits the separation of multiple species, and electrochemical detection is particularly well-suited for interrogating the redox status of cells.  The focus of the proposed studies is on methods for the detection and identification of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species and endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione.  A high throughput single cell analysis system with combined electrochemical and fluorescence detection that is capable of monitoring cell redox status as a function of cell phenotype and activation state will also be developed.  These new tools will be used to investigate the processes involved in inflammation and neurodegeneration at both the chemical and biological levels.</AbstractNarration>
