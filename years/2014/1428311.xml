<AbstractNarration>Soil degradation is a major global environmental problem. Agroecological methods such as no-till farming and intensive grazing have potential to restore soil fertility, reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture, and restore soil function as a sink for carbon. Degraded pasture land, one of the most prevalent land covers on Earth and common in the South Carolina Piedmont, presents significant potential for increased agricultural productivity and carbon sequestration. This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award funds analytical equipment that will be used to collect soil carbon data which will increase understanding of current and future soil quality, and its relationship to land uses such as pasture and urban lawns, in the South Carolina Piedmont. Better understanding of the properties of Piedmont soils may lead to improved soil management, which in turn can influence watershed hydrology and water quality in the region. A major objective of instrumentation acquisition is to train undergraduates to use research grade instruments and to interpret the data, preparing them for both employment and graduate education. Students using this instrument will conduct research in soil biogeochemistry, and results will directly benefit local farmers working to mitigate soil degradation. Students will benefit from interaction with farmers, gaining understanding of the importance of agroecosystems to society. In addition to involving undergraduate students (who are predominantly female) from Furman University, the researchers will involve high school students through research and education programs already in place. Also, Furman's membership in two consortia of southeastern liberal arts colleges provides the opportunity to involve undergraduates from several Historically Black Colleges. This project is jointly funded by the MRI program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this award funds the acquisition of a LECO TruMac Series CN Macro Determinator to analyze the carbon and nitrogen content of soils and sediments. This instrument will expand the research activities associated with the River Basins Research Initiative at Furman University to include studies of terrestrial, as well as aquatic, biogeochemistry. Initially, the instrument will be used to analyze soil samples from soil cores collected from farms in the South Carolina Piedmont. The primary objective of this research is to understand how intensive grazing and no-till planting improve soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON). One of the farms began intensive grazing in 2012, and changes in SOC and SON at different depths will be tracked over the next 10 years or more. A secondary objective is to quantify the potential for pasture soils to serve as carbon sinks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Soil degradation is a major global environmental problem.  Agroecological methods such as no-till farming and intensive grazing have potential to restore soil fertility, reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture, and restore soil function as a sink for carbon.  Better understanding of soil properties may lead to improved soil management, which in turn can influence watershed hydrology and water quality. Furman University acquired a LECO TruMac Series CN Macro Determinator to analyze the carbon and nitrogen content of soils, plant materials, and river sediments in November 2014.  Acquisition of this instrument has expanded the research activities associated with the River Basins Research Initiative at Furman University with a focus on the biogeochemistry of aquatic and terrestrial environments.  The instrument currently is being used to analyze soil samples from 173 cores collected from two farms in the South Carolina Piedmont.  The primary objective of that study is to understand how intensive grazing and no-till planting improve soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON), both measures of soil fertility.  One of the farms began intensive cattle grazing in 2012, and changes in SOC and SON at different depths will be tracked over the next 10 years or more.  A secondary objective is to quantify the potential for degraded pasture soils to serve as carbon sinks that would reduce the impact of climate change.  Initial results suggest that intensive grazing results in increased SOC and SON, particularly in the upper 10 cm of soil.  This also suggests that intensive grazing increases soil fertility and degraded soils can become sinks for carbon. We have applied for a USDA SARE grant to expand this research to additional farms, with a focus on how agroforestry management affects soils. Additionally, we are analyzing soils collected from four vineyards in the Ravni Kotari region near Zadar, Croatia to better understand how soil management methods affect SOC and SON.  Traditional industrial (tilled soil, pesticides, and fertilizers), organic (tilled, no input), no till (no till, some fertilizers and pesticides), and crushed stone industrial (rock and soil machine pulverized, fertilizers, pesticides) methods are being investigated.  Initial results suggest that tilled soils will have less SOC and SON than the untilled soils.  The crushed stone method appears to have more SOC than other methods, at least in the upper 5 cm of soil.  However, these results are tentative.  This research will be expanded over the next several years to additional vineyards and vegetable farms. Soil analysis is coupled with extensive discussions with the farmers to understand management techniques and yields (weight gain in cattle and grape harvest).  The farmers we work with all understand that healthy soil is critical to their success.  Data will be shared with the farmers in order to develop SOC and SON targets for their soils.  In particular, the long-term study of Greenbrier Farm over the transition from standard free-grazing to intensive grazing will test the hypothesis that intensive grazing actually leads to increased SOC and SON.  A major objective of our research program is to train undergraduates to use research grade instruments and to interpret the data, preparing them for both employment and graduate education.  Currently, two students are using this instrument for senior thesis research associated with the farms in South Carolina and Croatia.  Next year, we anticipated four students to use the instrument for senior theses.  We have designed laboratories for two classes that have collected soils in the field and then analyzed them using the LECO instrument.  Laboratory use will expand in the next few years.
