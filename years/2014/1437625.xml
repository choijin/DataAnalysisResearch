<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks funds to partially cover travel expenses of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty members from institutions in the United States to participate in the International Conference for Mesoscopic Methods in Engineering and Science (ICMMES) that will be held July 14-18, 2014 at CUNY in New York City. The main intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in the area of mesoscopic of fluid dynamics. The conference organization is in direct response to the growing interest in multi-scale and multi-physics phenomena observed in nano- or micro-systems and biological systems, and the increasing importance of computational science to research in these disciplines. The conference will be attended by both prominent and young scientists in fluid dynamics from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;Topics for the ICMMES conference series include modeling and numerical schemes based on mesoscopic and kinetic methods and their analysis and applications to areas that include (i) Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), including direct numerical simulations (DNS), large-eddy simulations (LES), and turbulence modeling;(ii) Rheology for complex fluids and soft matter such as bio-fluids, suspensions, multi-phase and multi-component fluids, non-Newtonian fluids, and electro-rheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR) fluids (smart fluids);(iii) Nano-scale phenomena involving non-continuum, surface-dominated, low-Reynolds-number, (iv) non-Newtonian, multi-scale and multi-physics effects. Examples are complex flows through porous media, gaseous flows in micro-devices, electrokinetic-capillary phenomena and droplets and bubbles in micro-fluidics; (v) Computational methods for multi-scale and multi-physics such as (turbulent) flow-structure interactions and thermo-chemically nonequilibrium flows, reactive flows and combustion, and radiation heat transfer; (vi) Algorithms for parallel high performance computing (PHPC) with engineering applications;(vii) Special computer hardware (e.g., general purpose graphic processing units or GPGPUs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will foster cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers and will address challenges involved in advancing the field in the near future. The financial support will be used to increase participation of US students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. Special consideration will be given to under-represented minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and those in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIi).</AbstractNarration>
