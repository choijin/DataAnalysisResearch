<AbstractNarration>This project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of NSF Division of Chemistry, to Professor Vladimir Gevorgyan of the University of Illinois at Chicago examines the replacement of rare and expensive palladium, rhodium, and iridium catalysts with abundant and cheap iron and copper complexes (homogeneous catalysts).  The research team develops new methodologies involving nanoporous metal skeletons (heterogeneous catalysis) and develops highly valuable synthetic methodologies by taking advantage of low catalyst loadings, low catalyst leaching, and high catalyst recyclability. The research project includes the development of iron-catalyzed Heck-type coupling and Wacker oxidation methodologies, as replacements for classical methods employing expensive and toxic palladium catalysts.  The research also includes examination of oxidative iron-catalyzed carbon (C)-hydrogen (H)/C-H coupling reactions toward complex polycyclic molecules.  Copper catalysts are studied for diverse C-H functionalizations as well as the dehydrogenative carboxylations of fused lactones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is performed in collaboration with Professor Yoshinori Yamamoto of the Dalian University of Technology in Dalian, China and Professor Hans-Joachim Kn√∂lker of the Technical University of Dresden, in Dresden, Germany.  Together, these three groups combine their separate areas of expertise to provide novel and sustainable catalytic methods for more straightforward and environmentally-benign pathways toward valuable synthons for synthetic and medicinal chemistry and material science.  The broader impacts of this work also include leadership training for graduate students and an international exchange of ideas and expertise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Heterocyclic molecules are ubiquitous structural motifs found in biologically important molecules and in synthetic materials. Accordingly, development of highly selective, efficient, and robust methodologies toward assembly of these important cores is highly warranted. One of the main goals of this NSF-funded project was the development of highly efficient Cu-catalyzed heterocyclization reactions.     In the past, our group developed a Rh-catalyzed transannulation reaction as a new paradigm for synthesis of biologically valuable N-fused heterocyclic systems from easily available 1,2,3-triazoles. During period of this grant, we developed a highly efficient Cu-catalyzed version of this reaction. Not only employment of cheap and abundant Cu catalyst vs previously employed expensive and rare Rh-catalyst is beneficial from environmental standpoint, but it also provided a much broader reaction scope allowing for expeditious synthesis of a vide variety of valuable densely-substituted N-fused heterocycles.      Development of efficient C&ndash;H functionalization methods due higher atom-economy and abundance of C&ndash;H bonds in organic molecules is highly warranted.  During this grant period, we developed an efficient C&ndash;H alcoxycarbonylation method using removable/functionalizable directing group. This method allowed for synthesis of a range of active benzoate esters, building blocks, possessing two independent functionalizable handles, which allowed for a straightforward synthesis of diversely-substituted synthetically and medicinally important molecules.       It is believed that the developed methodologies would have a broader impact in the health-related areas and material science by providing effective routes to important densely-substituted acyclic, cyclic, and heterocyclic building blocks.     Furthermore, this work, which is at the interface of organometallic and organic chemistry and catalysis, provided multidisciplinary training at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Through direct interaction with laboratory research, undergraduates are directly encouraged to pursue post-bachelor education in scientific research. Furthermore, graduate students benefit from this exchange as it prepares them for future roles as supervisors and mentors.       Finally, this project was highly collaborative in nature. During this grant, our group has established a fruitful collaboration with the group of Prof. Yoshinori Yamamoto (China) on preparation of heterogeneous metal nanopore catalysts and their employment in various synthetic transformations previously developed by our group for homogeneous catalytic systems.  We plan on continuing this collaboration, particularly toward development of doped metal nanopore catalysts, which expected to have superior catalytic properties in various transformations.
