<AbstractNarration>The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was chartered in 1990 to test the effects of increased temperature on tundra plant phenology, growth, species composition and ecosystem function.  Since 2007, the ITEX-Arctic Observatory Network (ITEX-AON) has continued and expanded on the ITEX program across a latitudinal transect of five sites in Alaska and Greenland, collecting core ITEX data specifically designed to address the current needs outlined in the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) Implementation Report.  The goal of this effort is to maintain the continuity of the temporally-critical datasets of the ITEX-AON in Alaska and Greenland.  Core datasets include the long-term manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, ecosystem function, and surface properties on the long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of the vegetation plots on the 1km2 ARCSS grids, and a multifactor warming-moisture experiment in Greenland.  The simultaneous measurement of multiple surface properties at the small scale has allowed detection of relationships not previously recognized, e.g., in moss-dominated areas of the intensive transects, higher albedo is linked to higher temperatures.  Continuation of these measurements is imperative because increasing evidence points towards the critical importance of carry-over effects of the previous growing seasons on current and future responses and the inherent variability in the system precluded determination of the system response on the basis of a few years.  Data from this project are freely available on the ACADIS website.  The project will continue extensive outreach activities established in the initial phase, including strong relationships between the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (FTBG) and the GVSU Regional Math and Science Center and school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids, and El Paso.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been dedicated to observing and quantifying the response of Low and High Arctic tundra to: a) long-term increases and decreases in winter snow depth (higher, lower and ambient), b) increases in summer temperatures or summer rainfall, c) natural changes in climate in divergent tundra ecosystem types and d) collaborate with international colleagues in ITEX-like studies in Scandinavia.  These northern habitats are natural laboratories to quantify a suite of responses to these changes, some that have been underway over many years that have now become published and presented discoveries during this AON support and funding period and some in their early phases of measurements.      We have learned that: A) Long-term warming in the low Arctic results in tussock tundra becoming a stronger summer C sink for CO2, a means by which landscapes can ameliorate rising atmospheric CO2; B) Snowmelt water appears to be a source of water for all major tundra plants life forms (evergreen and deciduous shrubs) and that this source of water is greater where snowpack is deeper in prior years.  Snowmelt water may be a means by which tundra plants can overcome summer drought and facilitate late season C sequestration; C) Deeper winter snow leads to shifts in High Arctic Scandinavia plant mineral nutrition and leaf gas exchange and deep snow may protect plants from early season frosts that collectively may facilities growth and biomass production and increased ability of tundra to sequester C from the atmosphere; D) High Arctic watersheds are gradually loosing their lakes to drying and the low level of C emissions by lakes to the atmosphere will become vegetated surfaces that gradually become C sinks accumulating C into plant and soil biomass; and E) Shrub ring growth increases during years of warmer June temperatures and they how a positive response to deeper snow in the prior winter, which we believe is realted to more favorable water relations and higher leaf gas exchange rates late in the summer with this additional moisture supply.     Our observations and discoveries continue to solidify the understanding of the changes we can expect as the Arctic climate changes including both shifts in summer and in winter precipitation and temperature.  There are complexities in the system responses and there are clear linkages between winter traits and summer growth and physiology of plants and of ecosystem function.  This increasing understanding of the season-linkages in the Arctic provides a basis by which we can fully understand the Arctic in a holistic and interactive manner.
