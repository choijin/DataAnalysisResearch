<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Samford University, located in Birmingham, AL, will provide research training for 12 students, for 9 weeks during the summers of 2015-2017. The program focuses on multidisciplinary research to study biological and biochemical interactions ranging from the molecular to the landscape scale in a diverse Appalachian ridge and valley ecosystem at Oak Mountain State Park (OMSP) near Birmingham, AL. There are a wide range of potential student projects, involving both field and laboratory research, to address questions in ecology, population biology, botany, geography, plant chemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, cell biology and pathogenesis. Mentors are from the Departments of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Chemistry, Geography, and Pharmacy at Samford University and Birmingham Southern College. Students are selected based on academic record, professional goals, and potential for outstanding research. Outstanding undergraduate students who have limited opportunities to participate in research at their home institutions and students from underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged to apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 36 students will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. In addition to research, students will participate in weekly workshops on ethical conduct in research, data analysis, professional communication skills, professional development activities, and the graduate school application process. Discussions and seminars with mentors, experts, and fellow students will help participants integrate their knowledge about complex biological and biochemical interactions across research topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of their research experience. More information is available by visiting www.samford.edu/REU, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Malia Fincher at rmfinche@samford.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Betsy Dobbins at egdobbin@samford.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Alabama, situated where the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains meet the coastal plain, is one of the most biodiverse states in the United States. The geographic and biological diversity is showcased in 22 state parks that host 5 million visitors a year, providing opportunities for recreation, relaxation, and education..  There is, however, limited funding to explore the complex ecosystems that reside in these unique spaces. This knowledge gap reduces the effectiveness of park management and decreases the ability of parks to educate the public.     Intellectual Merit:   Oak Mountain State Park, the largest park in the Alabama state system, lies in the biologically rich ridge and valley region of Alabama.  The Samford REU "Interdisciplinary research in a diverse Appalachian ridge and valley ecosystem" was the basis for 40 presentations and publications about the biological, chemical, and ecological interactions within the park, including critical information on the positive impacts of prescribed burning on long leaf pine ecosystems. The Samford REU research also contributed to development of educational activities and displays at the Oak Mountain Interpretive Center, located in the State Park.     While providing this critical information to the park and the interpretive center, the 39 students who participated in the Samford REU from 2015 to 2017 developed research, analytical, and communication skills that will aid their growth as scientists.  The REU used existing curricula and developed in-house modules designed to foster conversations about the responsible conduct of research and increase ethical behavior in science.      Broader impacts:  The United States faces a shortage of workers in the areas of science and technology. The education to continue in these fields is rigorous and less than 50% of students who declare math and science majors will graduate with those degrees. The attrition rate for students who are underrepresented in science (first generation college, minorities, and women) is higher. The Samford REU had an amazing 100% successful retention rate with all students continuing in biology or chemistry.  This is particularly impressive as 36% of the students were from minority background and 49% were first generation college, including 3 students whose parents had not completes high school.  These students are now leaders and liaisons in their communities who can encourage others to aim for careers in science.     For advanced careers in science, it is necessary to obtain an advanced degree. According to recent work by Wilson and colleagues (https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biy052)  25% of talented students in science pursue PhDs within 7 years of graduation.
