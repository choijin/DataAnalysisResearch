<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to determine the role of two molecules, known as BDNF and pro-BDNF, that are produced by two distinct populations of cells called astrocytes and oligodendrocytes found in the vision processing area of the brain.  The researchers hypothesize that these molecules regulate the development of the circuits that make vision possible.  The expression patterns of the regulatory molecules will be determined at different stages of development in normal mice and in mice that show a progressive loss of vision during postnatal development.  The expectation is that there will be reduced expression of the molecules in the sightless mice which, in turn, will prevent functional vision circuits from developing.  The work has potential to provide a fresh perspective on how vision circuits are formed and organized during development.  Undergraduates at three primarily undergraduate liberal arts institutions will receive training in molecular and cellular techniques and modern methods of cell imaging.  High-resolution images of fluorescent labeled cells will be archived in an image data bank for use in teaching neuroscience classes for undergraduates and workshops for local high school science students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normal mice and mice exhibiting vision loss at developmental time points when vision exists, when it is deteriorating, or when it is lost will be used for the proposed studies.  The mice have been engineered to express fluorescent biomarkers under the control of cell-specific promoters to enable identification of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the brain.  Fluorescence activated cell sorting will be used to isolate astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.  Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its precursor (pro-BDNF) mRNA and protein will be measured and visualized using quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA assays, and immunohistochemistry.  Image analysis will provide information on changes in astrocyte and oligodendrocyte cell morphology that are predicted to be important in establishing and maintaining vision circuit microenvironments. Data will be made available to other researchers upon request.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neural circuity in the central nervous system is established as part of normal development.  Formation of circuitry associated with sensory perception is often dependent upon sensory input; disruption of sensory input can result in a failure to establish neural connections, abrogation of previously established connections, and ?remodeling? in which new neural circuity is configured.  All of these events are mediated by signaling molecules called neurotrophins (NTs), which include four critical members:  Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Neurotrophin 3 (NT3), and Neurotrophin 4 (NT4).  We used a mouse model in which defects in the gene encoding PDE6&beta; lead to retinal degeneration and onset of blindness during early postnatal development, with total blindness occurring by postnatal day (PND) 49; thus, these mice present a useful system in which to study effects of decreased sensory input on the development of key neural pathways and the NTs that help mediate this development.  We examined the impact of deficient sensory input on the expression of the NTs in the visual cortex.  We observed expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, using QRT-PCR to examine mRNA and western blotting to examine proteins.  We can report three key results.  First, we found that diminished sensory input caused by retinal degeneration altered levels of mRNA for BDNF, NT3, and NT4.  BDNF mRNA levels were significantly reduced at PND 49; in contrast, levels of mRNA for NT3 increased significantly by PND 49, while mRNA levels for NGF significantly increased earlier in postnatal development.  Second, we found that BDNF protein levels were decreased at PND 49, largely in synchrony with decreasing mRNA levels in response to retinal degeneration; this result could indicate that BDNF levels in the visual cortex are regulated largely at the level of transcription.  Third, we found that the levels of NT3 protein did not consistently correlate with levels of NT3 mRNA.  We observed a significant increase in the level of mature NT3 protein at PND 14, when mRNA levels were not increased, but no increase in either the pro- or mature forms of NT3 at PND 49, when mRNA levels were higher.  This could indicate that levels of NT3 in the visual cortex are regulated at least in part at a post-transcriptional level; the increase in only the mature form of NT3 could suggest a role for posttranslational processing of pro-NT3 by proprotein convertases in establishing NT3 levels in the visual cortex under these conditions.   Taken together, these results show that diminished sensory input caused by retinal degeneration can alter neurotrophin expression in the visual cortex, with potential implications for both the establishment of and reconfiguring of neural circuitry.  These results could ultimately provide insight into avenues for potential therapeutic intervention into pathologies associated with disruption in sensory input and perception.
