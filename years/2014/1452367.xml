<AbstractNarration>As participants in the University of California-Riverside (UCR) REU Site program, 'Research Experiences in Integrated Computational Entomology,' students engage in full-time research for ten weeks in an active interdisciplinary research community.  In addition to immersion into research, students begin the summer with an introduction to the research tools of computer science, engineering and entomology at UCR, where they learn basic skills in computer science, data statistics, and lab/field work in entomology and biology.  REU students are mentored by two faculty members, one from the Computer Science Department, and one from the departments of Entomology, Ecology or Biology.  The students work on projects that leverage the power of computers to solve problems in entomology.  Examples of projects include flying insect classification using images/videos, using sensors to quantify the foraging behavior of bees, and monitoring insect sounds as a measure of biodiversity and the health of the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UC Riverside is one of a handful of accredited R1 research-intensive universities in the US designated as Hispanic Serving Institutions, with a student population that includes almost 30% Hispanic and approximately 50% first-generation college students.  This REU Site program emphasizes recruitment and retention of underserved minorities, and provides skills in public dissemination of research findings.  The project will not only provide STEM research opportunities for ten students each year, but will also promote STEM education throughout communities with low numbers of college-educated scientists and engineers, by training students who will become actively engaged in outreach efforts and serve as role models in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Division within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the Directorate for Biosciences.
