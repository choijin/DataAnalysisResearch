<AbstractNarration>PI: Schieber, Jay D. &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1438700&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Illinois Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is on investigating entangled polymer rheology with a multiscale computationally approach. The proposed research will pin down the parameters needed to be calculated at the atomistic level, in order to provide macroscopic scale predictions about the rheology of a wide class of soft materials.  Entangled polymers have tremendous economic impact in industrial materials, and also influence the mechanics of biological tissue. Any significant advance in the understanding of these dynamics will have substantial impact on many branches of physics, materials science, biophysics, biology and engineering. The co-PIs will produce a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and make their GPU code available for public consumption. This code would allow any user with a simple desktop and graphics card (less than $1k) to predict the linear or nonlinear rheology of any blend of linear, branched or cross-linked entangled homopolymers in a homogeneous flow field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to achieve the first ab initio dynamic prediction for soft matter that exhibits relaxation times of seconds or minutes. A hierarchical structure of simulations is proposed, starting from ab initio type of calculations. The goal is to make predictions possible for any entangled homopolymer chain architecture, any molecular weight, any blend of architecture and molecular weight, and for any flow field. The homopolymer model to be used is thermodynamically based and in accordance to mean-field theory. While currently available models require parameter fitting and empiricisms, the intellectual achievement of this work, if successful, is to predict the rheology of entangled homopolymers from atomistic knowledge only, without any parameter fitting. This feat can be accomplished with the use of  techniques to speed-up calculations by about 12 orders of magnitude, allowing the bridging of the time scales between atomistic and macroscale times.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant proposed four specific objectives on the dynamics of entangled polymeric liquids: (1) make a strong connection to atomistic simulations so that the theory might make predictions from first principles; (2) demonstrate how the theory could be used to model flows important for industrial processing; (3) examine the ability of the theory to predict the dynamics of branched polymer chains, and blends of various distributions of molecular weights;  (4) develop a user-friendly code for rapid and robust application of the slip-link theory on inexpensive video cards, and make it available in the public domain; and (5) develop a slip-link theory applicable to entangled block copolymers.  We note that the budget was cut before award, requiring removal of point (5) in our efforts. Nonetheless, we made even some progress in this area through collaborations with other research groups. We tried two different connections to atomistic theory.  In the first, we took simulations performed by colleagues on shorter chains.  These shorter chains have too many chain ends to be used quantitatively for entangled chains, so a correction was required.  We used free-volume theory to extrapolate the parameters to long chains.  While this approach gave results that were consistent with observation, we found that the uncertainty that arises from extrapolation was too large for the results to be useful.  Those efforts did show, however, that there was a time domain where both fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, and the slip-link theory were both valid, and in agreement.  Namely, they both predicted the same subdiffusive time dependence of the mean-squared displacement of the center of mass of the chain, before diffusion is reached.  Based on that observation, post-grant, we collaborated with a group in Chile who performed fully atomistic simulations on polyethylene oxide chains that were more than sufficiently long to be entangled.  Unfortunately, the totality of our observations, suggest that the force field used, though partially derived from quantum mechanics, is not sufficiently accurate to make quantitative predictions.  Nonetheless, we are able to make predictions of nonlinear rheology for very long chains with an error of approximately a factor of 2.  Since this represents an extrapolation in time scales from MD to macroscopic of many orders of magnitude (microseconds to minutes), the comparison is still encouraging. For complex flows, we demonstrated that our theory, while more expensive than the less-accurate tube models, is able to predict stresses in complex flows without excessive cost.  We demonstrated that a very modest GPU cluster of approximately 20 nodes could simulate a two-dimensional flow of entangled linear chains in a couple of hours.  Using the already existing faster cards, and programming improvements, it is clear that these numbers can be improved dramatically.  Nonetheless, it is clear that time-dependent three dimensional flows are easily reached. We made significant comparisons of the theory with new data for branched chains from Ron Larson's lab (University of Michigan), and with existing tube models.  Ron showed that tube models were incapable of describing all existing  data on blends of linear and star-branched polymers.  On the other hand, the slip-link theory, using parameter obtained only from monodisperse linear chains, was able to predict all data.  We made further examinations into why there was the difference, and discovered that there are fundamental differences in the modeling of branched systems using tubes and slip-links.  We then tried to repair tube models using insight from slip-link theories, but without success.  We are coming to the conclusion that the problems with tube models are fundamental, and probably unfixable.  We also updated our publicly licensed software for making calculations of the theory, available on Github.  This includes a user-friendly graphical user interface for setting parameters of the theory, and the calculation.  We have advertised its availability at several conferences and in papers. Finally, we collaborated with Juan de Pablo at the University of Chicago, and Marcus Mueller in Germany on generalizing our slip-link theory to entangled block copolymers. The theory requires generalization from a single-chain mean-field theory, to a still-coarse-grained multichain theory in a mean-field. We first demonstrated that this generalization was able to reproduce the single-chain theory for homogeneous chains.  We then demonstrated that the computations could be generalized to block copolymers, and explain existing observations.  Since this work has been taken up by several competing groups (Florian Mueller-Plathe, Doros Theodorou, Uneyama and Masubuchi, Morse and Mueller, eg).  our efforts are now better directed elsewhere.
