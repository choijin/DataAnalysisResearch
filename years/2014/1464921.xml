<AbstractNarration>This travel grant supports participation, particularly of young mathematicians, in the special conference Connections in Discrete Mathematics, held June 15-19, 2015 at the Burnaby Campus of Simon Fraser University (located in British Columbia, Canada).  This conference will bring together many leaders in several areas of discrete mathematics to share their research, and also will present an opportunity for young researchers to interact with senior personnel and form new research collaborations.  As a result, the meeting will have a positive influence on the careers of young researchers in discrete mathematics.  More about the conference and its organization is at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/site/connectionsindiscretemath/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference topic of discrete mathematics includes many fields of mathematics, including number theory, graph theory, Ramsey theory, combinatorics, algorithmic analysis, discrete geometry, and more.  While each of these fields is important in its own right, they also share important ideas and techniques that unite them.  This conference brings together a diverse group of researchers in discrete mathematics to share their work, and to look for connections (both in terms of the research and in collaborations).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Connections in Discrete Mathematics conference was held on the campus of SImon Fraser University near Vancouver, BC on June15-19, 2015.  The aim of the conference was to bring together many prominent researchers in a wide variety of mathematical fields related to discrete mathematics.  These areas included graph theory, combinatorics, Ramsey theory, computer science, number theory, geometry, and so on.  To help bring attention and draw in a wider audience this conference was timed to also celebrate the 80th birthday of Ron Graham who has had a tremendous impact on mathematics.  The conference succeeded in bringing together prominent mathematicians from around the world who gave the plenary talks.  These included Erik Demaine (MIT), Persi Diaconis (Stanford), Jacob Fox (Stanford), Peter Frankl (Renyi Institute), Jarik Nesetril (Charles University), Carl Pomerance (Dartmouth College), Joel Spencer (Courant Institute), and Tom Trotter (Georgia Tech).  In addition to the main speakers there were an additional 16 invited speakers and over 100 contributed talks.  The conference attendance had just over 200 particpants, and thanks to the NSF funding a significant number of participants from the USA received support to attend and participate in the conference, primarily focused on students (including a few undergraduate students) and early career mathematicians.  A significant number of the slides for talks have been posted online at the conference website which has been maintained.  Further, a conference proceedings will be forthcoming.
