<AbstractNarration>Teams are increasingly used in a variety of organizational contexts, including education, health care, government and for-profit firms.  Information about how to increase their effectiveness promises to improve the performance and competitiveness of organizations in the U.S. and the well being of their members. Our proposed research has implications not only for teams in traditional work settings but also in new emerging settings such as distributed work teams and online communities. We identify the patterns of communication that lead to the strongest transactive memory and the highest team performance. Thus, the research will result in information that team members and leaders can use to improve their team's performance. In addition, the development of a behavioral measure of TMS would enable researchers to analyze TMS in large teams and geographically distributed contexts, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in organizations and online communities around the world. All together, the results have the potential to advance our understanding of team collaboration, team formation, communication networks and team performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research examines the effects of communication networks on transactive memory system development and team performance. A transactive memory system (TMS) is a collective system for encoding, storing and retrieving information. Teams with well-developed TMSs have been found to perform better across a variety of tasks compared to teams lacking TMSs.  Known as systems of "who knows what," a TMS emerges through communications and interactions among team members as they learn and rely on each other's skills and knowledge.  Although a TMS hinges on communication and interaction, very little research has been conducted on how communication networks affect a group's TMS. Communication networks constrain or enable communication within a team and thus potentially alter the development of TMS. Our research investigates the characteristics of communication networks that enhance the development of TMS in a series of studies incorporating complementary laboratory and archival methods. First, we manipulate the communication networks that exist within teams in an experiment to examine the effects of network characteristics on the team's TMS and performance. We investigate two dimensions of team performance: the number of errors and creativity. Second, because in many contexts individuals choose their own networks and/or their positions within the network, we compare the effects of networks and position assignments that are imposed by the experimenter to those that are chosen by participants.  This enables us to determine if effects observed are due to the communication network itself or due to participants' enactment of the network. By manipulating the networks and using random assignment to networks and to positions within the networks, we are able to make causal statements about the effects of network characteristics on TMS development and team performance.  Third, using data from our experiments, we will develop and refine a new unobtrusive, behavioral measure of TMS.  This measure will be applied to data from real teams who use online networks for large-scale technology-mediated projects. Following the validation of this new TMS measure, we will examine how it relates to performance for large online teams.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to manage knowledge effectively is critical to the success of organizations.  Organizations that are able to create new knowledge, to retain that knowledge and to transfer it across units are more effective than those that are less adept at knowledge management.  In research supported by the grant, Argote and Fahrenkopf (Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 2016) advance theory about the important role that social networks play in creating, retaining and transferring knowledge in groups and organizations.  The empirical component of the grant is a series of experiments that manipulate social networks in the controlled setting of the experimental laboratory.  Because participants are randomly assigned to networks and networks are randomly assigned to various conditions, we are able to determine the causal effects of networks on group processes and outcomes and also to investigate the mechanisms through which the effects occur.  Thus, our research is high in internal validity and complements field research that is high in external validity.  In Study 1, Argote, Aven and Kush (Organization Science, 2018) theorized that the effect of membership turnover on group processes and performance depends on a group?s communication network. We identified two mechanisms through which communication networks affect group performance: (1) the number of direct communication paths, which is a function of its density, and (2) the clarity of the coordination logic, which is affected by its centralization. We empirically analyzed the effects of turnover on the performance of fully connected all-channel networks and hub-and-spoke or wheel networks in an experiment of 109 four-person groups performing two collaborative problem-solving tasks. The greater number of direct communication paths enabled fully connected groups with stable membership to develop stronger transactive memory systems (TMSs) and perform better than fully connected groups that experienced turnover. By contrast, the clear coordination logic of perfectly centralized groups that experienced turnover facilitated more frequent dyadic communication, which enabled them to strengthen their TMSs, incorporate the contributions of new members, and improve their performance. Thus, our results indicate that the effectiveness of group communication networks depends on member turnover.   In Study 2, Kush, Aven and Argote (in process) demonstrated that centralization and density interact to influence the extent to which group members feel that they share a social identity. The interaction of centralization and density determines the number of role equivalent classes in a group. We propose that a greater number of role equivalent classes in a group undermines the extent to which members share a social identity. In a laboratory experiment of four-person groups, we manipulated the centralization and density of group communication networks. Increasing density by adding a tie to centralized groups increased the number of role equivalent classes, whereas adding a tie to decentralized groups decreased the number of role equivalent classes.  As predicted, increasing the number of role equivalent classes reduced the extent to which members shared a social identity, weakened their transactive memory systems and impaired group performance. Further, we demonstrated using simulated network data that the interaction of centralization and density on the number of role equivalent classes holds for larger networks with various levels of centralization and density.   In Studies 3 and 4, Guo, Argote, Kush, Fahrenkopf and Park (in process) theorized that when group members choose who occupies which network positions, individuals select themselves and others into positions that best suit member knowledge and skills, allowing the group to match individual member expertise to network position and thereby improve its performance. We tested this hypothesis in a laboratory study manipulating how members are assigned to positions in a centralized communication network.  We found that groups receiving their choices of which members occupied network positions performed better than either groups that did not receive their choices, or groups in which members were randomly assigned to positions.  The superior performance of groups receiving their choices was driven by being able to place individuals with the greatest communication ability in the central network position. These results suggest that it is important to account for member skills in assessing the effects of communication networks in the field.     In Study 5, Kush (Group Dynamics:  Theory, Research and Practice, in press) compared three measures of transactive memory systems (TMS): the behavioral indicators of Specialization, Credibility, and Coordination; the development of Knowledge; and the development Knowledge Differentiation (the extent to which members specialize in different areas).  In a series of 3 studies (a total of 223 groups), Kush investigated the interrelationships between these indicators of TMS and their influence on group performance. Coordination, Knowledge Stock, and Knowledge Differentiation each had a positive relationship to group performance. These findings ratify the importance of transactive memory systems to group performance. The findings also suggest that future work should consider the inclusion of measures of Knowledge Stock, Knowledge Differentiation and Coordination to assess TMS.
