<AbstractNarration>This research explores the structural and collective determinants of ethnic violence against indigenous peoples in California, from 1850 to 1865. In this context, violence encompasses killings resulting from both state operations and civilian lynch mobs, vigilante parties, and individual homicides. By employing a "mediated competition" approach, which argues that structural sources of potential grievance formation are a necessary but insufficient basis for violent ethnic mobilization, this research focuses on how actors mobilized in various ways, with varying degrees of lethality, to suppress the indigenous population of the state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analytically, this research employs a unique multi-methods approach. First, to explain variability in the timing and intensity of violent victimization, the investigators will construct an original historical dataset that documents roughly 780 incidents of anti-indigenous violence in the state, as well as relevant county-level political, economic, and demographic conditions. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) will be employed to specify the precise ways in which these structural determinants combined with meso-level mechanisms to produce varying levels of indigenous victimization in different counties and regions. Next, using formal techniques, the fsQCA results will be used to specify theoretically relevant regions that represent divergent "micro-climates" of violent mobilization. Detailed qualitative data on these regions will then be used to compliment structural insights with an exploration of meso-level mechanisms that either facilitated or inhibited mobilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the potential scholarly and evidentiary value of the project's original historical dataset, the investigators will make the quantitative dataset and relevant qualitative materials accessible to teachers, educators, and the public. It will also produce scholarly material augmenting a growing historical literature on American colonial violence in California, with a systematic and theoretically informed account of specific patterns of violent mobilization among different state and civic actors. Research findings and data will be disseminated in a manner to support research, education, policy and community organizing related to historical indigenous justice topics and contemporary remedial efforts. Results can inform the work of a wide range of social science scholars working on ethnic repression and violence in societies transitioning to democracy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report for NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, Award #1433629  "Competition Theory, Conflict, and Indigenous Peoples"     Intellectual Merit     Theoretically, this dissertation research has endeavored to extend and refine current theories of ethnic competition and conflict. It has done so in two ways: first, by specifying the collective and structural mechanisms likely to motivate instances of indigenous-settler competition and conflict; and second, by using these identified mechanisms to explain the variable mobilization and demobilization of collective settler violence against indigenous persons in California, ca. 1850-1865.     In my first chapter I argue that, in contrast to the competition over domestic economic and political resources and entitlements that traditional conflict theories address, indigenous-settler competition and conflict are centrally organized around 1) the resource dimensions of land and land-based extractive industries, and 2) perceived political challenges to settler territorial entitlements through the establishment of reservation territories. I link these distinct territorial and sovereign bases of conflict with the distinct position of indigenous peoples in AmericaÆs evolving racial caste system. Specifically, in contrast to the racial-categorical perpetuation and stigmatization that has historically accompanied the economic and political exploitation of African-Americans, such as the "one drop rule," indigenous peoplesÆ ethnic and political plurality was homogenized and redefined by dominant whites as inherently assimilable, in order to facilitate their collective ethnic disappearance and territorial supersession. I use this comparative perspective to argue that the strategies of social control used against minority groups by nominal power-holders tend to be strongly influenced by the specific ways in which a groupÆs racial formation occurs.     The two subsequent chapters use this theorization to explain the variable mobilization and demobilization of collective violence against indigenous peoples in nineteenth century California, ca. 1850-1865. The results of a county-level comparative analysis indicate that regional and temporal variation in settler violence in California was centrally organized around a "frame dispute" between two opposed understandings of indigenous out-group "threats" (or lack thereof): one in which indigenous peoples were seen as pitiable and tractable victims who deserved to be "civilized" and eventually incorporated into the American polity as subservient laborers; and another in which indigenous peoples were seen as inherently treacherous and violent, justifying violent and exclusionary social control strategies. Alongside widespread demographic and economic changes in many settler communities (i.e., improving communal cohesion, economic stabilization, and reduced perceived threats to settler sovereignty), these essentialist understandings of indigenous peoples mediated the collective dynamics of settler-indigenous conflicts when they found sustained material and discursive support from influential state-level actors. Specifically, in areas where extremist imputations of indigenous "threats" were durably sanctioned through state material and discursive support, collective ethnic violence tended to endure as a form of political claims making that sought to maintain "thick" interethnic boundaries between settlers and indigenous communities. In areas where these frames were not communicated by local actors to state allies, or did not find material and discursive support, violence generally declined.  The results of a second analysis, which seeks to explain annual variation in collective ethnic violence against indigenous peoples in the Humboldt Bay region (ca. 1853-1865) of California, an area of significant collective violence during the study period, indicates that effective framing and boundary work by local civic elites (i.e. business owners,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
