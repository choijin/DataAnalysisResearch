<AbstractNarration>Ice storms are powerful winter weather events common to temperate and boreal forest regions worldwide.  These storms are capable of catastrophic short-term ecological and socio-economic impacts on forest ecosystems due to branch breakage and toppling of trees under heavy ice loads.  Their legacy can also persist over the longer-term through changes in forest productivity and species composition; the virulence of forest pests and pathogens; and increased risk of fire due to greater fire fuel loads.  Despite their influential role in shaping forest ecosystems, knowledge of ice storms and their impacts remains limited.  The temporally and spatially unpredictable nature of ice storms has largely confined past investigations to case studies following major storms.  The severity of ice storms in the northeastern United States, Eastern Canada and elsewhere has heightened the need for greater clarity on the role of these storms in shaping future forests.  Scientists at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in NH will conduct a multi-faceted program of research that includes a novel ice storm manipulation experiment, long-term field data, and climate and ecosystem modeling.  This research will provide the scientific community, land managers and the concerned public greater insight on the impacts of these powerful, and extreme winter weather events on the ecosystem dynamics of northern hardwood forests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated program of research is built on a foundation of previous work at Hubbard Brook and the region, including a pilot ice storm experiment conducted in 2012; a significant body of research on the forest ecosystem response to the severe "Ice Storm of 1998"; and a new set of historical climate reconstructions which allow for the quantification of the meteorological conditions that lead to ice storms. Specifically, the investigators will: (i) develop high-resolution global climate model simulations to evaluate the severity, frequency and extent of ice storms under future changing climate; (ii) evaluate short-term (2-3 year) ecosystem response to four different intensities and two frequencies of experimental ice events; (iii) evaluate longer-term (17+ years) response of forest vegetation to the 1998 storm; (iv) use results from the experiment and the long term observations to refine an established forest ecosystem biogeochemical model to simulate ice-storm disturbance; and (v) use the results from the high-resolution climate simulations to drive the improved biogeochemical model to project future ice storm impacts on ecosystem fluxes and pools of carbon and nitrogen in a northern hardwood forest.  This research will be integrated with broader impacts involving: (i) the use of sensor technology to engage STEM students with disabilities in the study; (ii) a dialog on the impacts of ice storms with local stakeholders; (iii) the production of a video on the making of an ice storm and relevance to extreme events and climate change; and (iv) undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral training.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Ice storms are responsible for billions of dollars of damages across the United States and Canada. Despite their potential for costly impacts, our ability to accurately predict ice storms--and mitigate their impacts--is severely limited for several reasons. First, the physical processes that cause ice storms  are complex, making them difficult to model, or even identify where and when storms have occurred in the past. Second, ice storm occurrence and intensity is typically expressed in  terms of physical damage to life, property and natural resources - but this depends on where and when the storm occurs, so it isn't really a measure of storm intensity as much as it is a measure of exposure: how many people and how much valuable property were affected by the storm. If a storm occurs, but it doesn't cause much financial damage, it might not even be recorded. And third, ice storms aren't static: they are occurring in an atmosphere that is being affected by human activities, including human-induced climate change as well as local changes in land use, topography, and urbanization.</p> <p>The goal of this research was to determine whether it is possible to train and apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to objectively identify ice storm events from atmospheric conditions alone, so we could potentially identify ice storms without needing to know what damages they incurred. This would represent a significant advance from our current state of knowledge, which is incomplete at best. We would next apply these same techniques to historical simulations from global climate models, to determine whether they are able to simulate ice storm-like events as well: because no one knew the answer to that (yet!). And third, if global models were able to simulate ice storms, then we would look to the future to see how human-induced warming might affect the location, the frequency, the seasonality, and the severity of these storms.</p> <p>To tackle this challenge, we first transformed the detection and analysis of ice storms into a pattern recognition problem. We identified surface  and upper atmospheric data for relevant  atmospheric variables such as  temperature, geopotential height and  specific humidity, and framed ice storm  identification as a classification  problem to distinguish  between ice storm and non-ice storm conditions in  winter months  (October-April). We then tested various machine learning algorithms to see which was best suited to identify the complex multidimensional atmospheric patterns at  synoptic scales (scales that resolve weather patterns that are bigger than about 1000km or 600 miles) that characterize ice storms.<br /><br />We found that the complex patterns  that characterize ice storms could be detected by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier. Using this approach, we were able to achieve close to 80%  accuracy in identifying ice storm dates in the atmospheric data (orange bars, Fig. 1), which we then compared to observed ice storm damage estimates (blue bars, Fig. 1). As you'd expect, our errors tended to be "false positives" - in other words, we found more ice storms in the atmospheric data than were reported in the database.<br /><br />We then  applied our newly trained machine learning models to experimental high-resolution climate model simulations. We were able to identify ice storm  events in the model simulations (gray bars, Fig. 1), but found some differences in the number and timing of storms between the real world and model  simulations (the model producing about twice as many storms as the real world) that require bias correction in order to be realistic. We didn't just look at when and where these storms occurred: we also clustered the storm patterns to look at intensity. There, we found the model-simulated storms (gray bars, Fig. 2) looked very similar to the real-world storms (orange bars, Fig. 2).
