<AbstractNarration>This is a research project on the physics and astrophysics of gravitational wave sources, partially in support of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO); it will be carried out by the Caltech Relativity Theory (CaRT) group, led by Yanbei Chen (PI), Christian Ott and Mark Scheel (Co-PIs). Through numerical simulations and analytical studies, this project will not only provide more accurate models for LIGO sources, but will also lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior of space-time geometry and matter under extreme conditions - near black holes, neutron stars, especially when these extreme objects collide with each other. These more accurate models and deeper theoretical insight will also be applied to the analysis of LIGO gravitational-wave data. This project will serve as a training ground for young physicists and astrophysicists, by teaching them a wide variety of research techniques. Members of the CaRT will also pursue a wide range of activities that reach out to the broader scientific community and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the project will consists of three directions:&lt;br/&gt;  (A) By combining analytical techniques and numerical simulations (using the Spectral Einstein Code [SpEC]): (i) Increasingly accurate gravitational waveforms for binary black hole coalescence will be generated and used to produce numerical template banks for LIGO; (ii) The geometrodynamics of highly curved spacetimes will be visualized and explored.&lt;br/&gt;  (B) SpEC will be applied to the study of gravitational wave (GW) sources with matter (neutron-star binaries, neutron-star/black-hole binaries), contributing to a deeper understanding of: (i) their GW, neutrino, and electromagnetic emissions, as well as (ii) their use in constraining the nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Newly developed higher-order hydrodynamics methods will be incorporated into SpEC. With these, ultra-long inspiral simulations will be carried out and compared to post-Newtonian theory. Recently discovered EOS-dependence of NSNS post-merger oscillations will also be investigated in full general relativity.&lt;br/&gt;  (C) The CaRT group will contribute to the LIGO Scientific Collaboration's (LSC) efforts to detect GWs and extract information from detected signals.  They will (i) lead the effort to infer physics from future GW observations of core-collapse supernovae; (ii) participate in searches for GWs from distant core-collapse supernovae; (iii) improve methods for the detection of GWs from continuous sources such as pulsars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  This project on the physics and astrophysics of gravitational waves (GWs) was carried out by the Caltech Relativity Theory group, led by Yanbei Chen, Mark Scheel, Christian Ott, and Bela Szilagyi.  The goal of this project was to help maximize the science impact of LIGO observations.  A large aspect of this project was to further develop and improve the field of numerical relativity (NR), the foundation for LIGO to study binary black holes using GWs.  We have made a number of contributions to improvement of NR simulations and their use to support LIGO, including:  (1) We have continued to develop and improve the SpEC code, the most accurate NR software package.  We have pushed SpEC's abilities so that it can currently follow the largest number of binary orbits and treat the largest black-hole spins compared to other codes.   (2) We have carried out hundreds of simulations with SpEC, and have included them in both a public catalog, and a (currently larger) catalog that we make available to LIGO.  These simulations have been used to calibrate analytical formulas that are used by LIGO data analysts, have been used as "test signals" to see if the LIGO software will detect them, and have been used for other purposes including those unrelated to LIGO.  (3) We have done direct followup of GW150914 and other GW detections with NR simulations using SpEC; one of our simulations appears in comparison with LIGO data in the GW150914 discovery paper.  (4) We have developed the first NR "surrogate models": fast formulas for computing waveforms with almost the same accuracy as NR, but can run in milliseconds instead of weeks/months.  Building these fast formulas requires running hundreds of NR simulations ahead of time. We have incorporated these surrogate models into LIGO software.  (5) We have applied SpEC to simulations of binary neutron stars (NSNS) and collisions of a black hole and a neutron star (BHNS).  We have compared analytic waveform formulas with BHNS and NSNS simulations, have investigated neutrino emission from NSNS mergers, and have added more realistic physics (e.g. better handling of neutrinos) to our BHNS and NSNS simulations.  (6) We have done work aimed at understanding core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and connecting their observational signatures (from gravitational and electromagnetic radiation) to the underlying fundamental physics.  In particular, we have shown that full 3-dimensional simulations with turbulence are required to understand CCSNe and we have included and investigated neutrino effects and nuclear reactions in CCSN simulations.  We have also used analytical tools to motivate and formulate data analysis stragies that will: (i) improve LIGO's detection efficiency, (ii) reveal subtle general relativity effects using LIGO, (iii) better test general relativity with LIGO, and (iv) search for new physics.  Our contributions include:   (1) We formulated a strategy that tests the internal consistency between the inspiral-merger and the ringdown parts of binary black-hole GWs detected by LIGO, and can reveal missing energy and/or angular momentum during the merger phase. This strategy has been applied to LIGO detections.   (2) We showed that jointly analyzing data from an ensemble of known pulsars, accounting for their a priori signal amplitude, can enhance LIGO's ability to detect continuous GWs from them.  Search algorithms partly motivated by our work are being deployed.   (3) We studied the "memory effects" for gravitaitonal and scalar waves.  In particular, we showed that ~100 LIGO observations can be stacked together to reveal the so-called Christodoulou Memory. Searching for the Memories using LIGO data has become an active research topic.    (4) We explored theoretically the consequences of near-horizon geometrical structures, qualitatively deducing the features of the GW echoes they will be causing, after the inspiral-merger-ringdown wave of binary black hole mergers.  We showed that LIGO is sensitive to rather small reflectivities near the horizon.   (5) We showed that in the future, when space-based gravitational-wave detectors can provide forewarnings to LIGO for binary black hole mergers, modifying LIGO's configuration specifically for the upcoming source can significantly improve our ability to test general relativity.   Broader impacts:  Several of our simulations and videos were prepared and used for the public press release of the first LIGO detection on February 11, 2016.  This includes the iconic image and video from our paper DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/32/6/065002 that was featured on the cover of the New York Times and other publications worldwide on that date.  This research program served as a training ground for young scientists, by teaching them a wide variety of research techniques, ranging from astrophysical phenomenology of GW sources and the study of astrophysical systems by analytic techniques and 3+1-dimensional numerical simulations.  Roughly ~10 graduate students and ~ 10 postdocs were trained broadly because of this project. Research results were disseminated via the internet (the SXS website, http://www.black-holes.org, and youtube videos on https://youtube.com/SXSCollaboration), outreach lectures by group members, and interactions with community college students.
