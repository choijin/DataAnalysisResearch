<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program and the Chemical Structure and Dynamics-A Program in the Chemistry Division are funding Dr. Chong Fang from Oregon State University to study the fluorescence mechanisms of emerging fluorescent protein biosensors. These colorful biomolecules originally derived from jellyfish and later from reef corals have revolutionized cellular imaging and molecular biology for almost two decades. However, these biosensors still suffer from drawbacks such as limited photostability, brightness, penetration depth, and color contrast, which hinder their further applications in physical and life sciences. The bottleneck in improving their functionality is the very limited information available about the underlying structural dynamics of fluorescent proteins, which involve a highly dynamic chromophore in the center of the protein pocket. This pursuit will provide graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars the opportunity to acquire specialized training in ultrafast spectroscopy, particularly in the molecular vibrational domain, and in biophysical chemistry. The new femtosecond Raman spectroscopic method for fluorescent protein studies, followed by curriculum development and outreach workshops to impact young minds, will yield molecular "movies" showing how the embedded chromophore responds to light and choreographs the departure of a single proton or the swing of an aromatic ring. This project will also provide integrated educational programs to create an interactive and sustainable culture of engagement for STEM learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific focus of the research is to elucidate the chromophore motions that control the fluorescence characteristics of proteins related to Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFPs) and of biosensors using newly developed, high resolution, and broadly tunable femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopic techniques. The structural evolution of the photoexcited chromophore will be monitored by transient vibrational peaks starting from time zero, quantified by kinetic analysis yielding crucial time constants and accompanied by computational chemistry to map atomic trajectories. The functional relevance of low-frequency skeletal motions along the multidimensional reaction coordinate, especially on the subpicosecond timescale, will be studied. Currently a phenolic ring wagging motion in wild-type GFP has been found to gate excited state proton transfer; the new experiments will make possible the systematic evaluation of governing factors for the chromophore conformational dynamics and emission outcomes in emerging GFP-related biosensors. Insights from this study will enrich physical chemistry and biophysics, and have the potential to guide the rational design of next-generation FP-biosensors with improved properties.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Prof. Chong Fang at Oregon State University has completed research (2015-2021) for this NSF CAREER project in elucidating the fluorescence mechanisms of fluorescent proteins (FPs) and FP-derived biosensors that are widely used and continuously being developed across the world. Notably, the mechanistic understanding of their fluorescence properties, how they originate and evolve on molecular timescales, how long they last and with various quantum yields, and how we can tune them with targeted functions remains challenging to obtain and hence is largely unknown. This project effectively tackles this problem by developing a powerful and versatile toolset at the Oregon State University Chemistry laboratory housed in Linus Pauling Science Center since 2011, namely the wavelength-tunable femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS), which is capable of revealing the intrinsic chromophore atomic motions (around the active site) that control the fluorescence properties of FPs.</p> <p>On the&nbsp;<strong>experimental front</strong>, the Fang Lab has developed a tunable FSRS setup in the visible range (ca. 480-720 nm, plus ~800 nm in the near-infrared/NIR and ~267 nm in the ultraviolet/UV region) to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of transient species during photochemical reactions in condensed phases. A newly developed broadband up-converted multicolor array (BUMA) technology in the Fang Lab has been implemented to work with tunable Raman pump in the near-UV to NIR range to characterize biosensors as well as functional materials including bismuth, tungsten, zinc, iron, and magnesium.&nbsp;On the&nbsp;<strong>knowledge front</strong>, the Fang Lab has elucidated fluorescence mechanisms of the green-blue emission ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free and bound GEM-GECO1 biosensor, the green intensiometric G-GECO1.1 biosensor, and a single-site mutant of GEM-GECO1 termed P377R as well as a more optimized excitation ratiometric biosensor GEX-GECO1, which are augmented by the comparative studies of chromophore structural dynamics inside engineered GFP mutants (without the calcium sensing domain) from the S65T/S205V double mutant to the S205V single mutant. On the&nbsp;<strong>related photosensitive molecular system front</strong>, the Fang Lab has studied the GFP model chromophore, the Coumarin 102 chromophore, the photoacid pyranine and its methylated compound, and a series of newly synthesized GFP chromophore derivatives in solution for redder emission and higher brightness, an iron porphyrazine complex with photocatalytic potential, as well as a tree-fungi-derived organic chromophore called xylindein. Such new knowledge generated throughout the entire NSF CAREER funding period has not only helped to elucidate the chemistry in life processes for marine animals including jellyfish and coral reefs to exhibit their fascinating bioluminescence, but also aided protein engineers and chemical biologists alike to rationally design the next-generation FP-biosensors that can enable the breakthroughs in chemical, biomedical, and life sciences. In total, <strong>42</strong> peer-reviewed <a title="Fang_Lab_Pubs" href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1455353" target="_blank">journal articles</a> and <strong>3</strong> <a title="Fang_Lab_BookChapters" href="https://fanglab.oregonstate.edu/other-publications" target="_blank">book chapters</a> have been published with support of this NSF CAREER Award.</p> <p>Such exposure to science and technology, particularly for postdoctoral scholars (3 supported, and 1 became Assistant Professor in 2016), graduate students (5 Ph.D.s and 4 M.S. awarded during the funding period), undergraduates (including Honor's College, and other schools via the PI's seminar trips and invited talks), high school Latino students across the State of Oregon, and other members of the public (e.g., via online media reports, open campus events, and online podcast) will remain an integral part of the Fang Lab. The NSF CAREER support has laid a solid foundation and provided continuous and substantial opportunities for Fang Group's research, teaching, mentoring, and outreach mission. In particular, Prof. Fang and his Open Campus colleague Jose founded the annual Juntos Chemistry Overnight Camp (JCOC) in June 2017 which has hosted 22-30 Latino high school students per year across the State of Oregon in <a title="Juntos_JCOC2017" href="https://science.oregonstate.edu/IMPACT/2017/07/first-overnight-chemistry-camp-juntos-high-schoolers" target="_blank">2017</a>, <a title="Juntos_JCOC2018" href="https://science.oregonstate.edu/IMPACT/2018/07/high-school-students-envision-their-future-in-stem-at-juntos-chemistry-camp" target="_blank">2018</a>, and <a title="Juntos_JCOC2019" href="https://science.oregonstate.edu/IMPACT/2019/07/third-annual-juntos-chemistry-camp-sparks-stem-ambition-in-high-school-students" target="_blank">2019</a>.
