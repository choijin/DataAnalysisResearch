<AbstractNarration>Notable progress has been made in US girls' participation and achievement in science and math education, yet women still make up just 14% of the engineering workforce and 25% of the computing workforce--occupations which comprise more than 80% of the STEM workforce. The American Association of University Women (AAUW) will conduct a synthesis project to capture and disseminate what is currently known about the factors that contribute to the underrepresentation of women in the engineering and computing workforce, and develop a research agenda for the future. This project will synthesize and publicize what we know, what we have yet to understand, and what we can do to attract and retain more women in these fields. In the first phase of the project, AAUW will publish a report that synthesizes the research on the underrepresentation of women in the technical workforce from multiple disciplines and make evidence-based recommendations for change. In the second phase of the project, AAUW will publish an agenda for future research on the underrepresentation of women in engineering and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With assistance from an advisory committee of experts, AAUW will select 5 to 10 top research findings to feature in the report. Featured findings will be both widely regarded within academic circles as well as relevant to organizational practices and social policy. AAUW will work closely with researchers to translate key findings into simple, compelling prose that will spark the attention of journalists, decision makers, and the public. Building on its network of media contacts, policy makers, AAUW members, and technical employers, AAUW will broadly disseminate the report findings. To form the future research agenda, AAUW will convene a working meeting of prominent researchers in the field. The resulting research agenda will identify questions that are yet to be answered and promising directions for future inquiry. The agenda will be widely disseminated to interested stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With funding from the National Science Foundation, the American Association of University Women, (AAUW) undertook "Moving the Needle," a three-part project to accelerate gender equity in engineering and computing. In year one, AAUW synthesized existing academic and governmental research, culminating in the 2015 report, Solving the Equation: The Variables for Women?s Success in Engineering and Computing. Next, AAUW convened a group of fifty leading experts from a range of related academic disciplines to identify and prioritize research objectives. This two-day, discussion-based convening took place in the Fall of 2015.  Discussions at the event addressed what is known, what there is yet to understand, and what can be done to improve the underrepresentation of women in engineering and computing. The convening was designed to encourage researchers to think broadly and deeply about the future direction of research on the underrepresentation of women in engineering and computing.     Based on both the report (2015) and Convening (2016), AAUW created a Research Agenda designed to help researchers and funders determine priorities in their work. AAUW worked closely with a team of scholars with expertise in gender equity in engineering and computing, and the Agenda reflects the experience and expertise of the advisors and participants (see The AAUW Research Agenda for a list of participating scholars).  The recommendations that ultimately emerged clustered around the "context" in which girls and women learn and work including societal and cultural influences, biases and micro-aggressions, career choice, the workplace climate. Now at the conclusion of its project, AAUW identifies career choice and the workplace as the two areas of highest priority.   1. Career Choice   a) Understand the efficacy of interventions on girls? and women?s career choices and their persistence in obtaining engineering and computing education.  There is a lack of studies that examine the efficacy of intervention on girls and women. Longitudinal studies on career choice, especially ones that track students into the workforce, are needed.  Few empirical studies examine sex, race and ethnicity at the same time, and research on these different groups of women should be a priority.  b) Understanding the impact of career choice and educational persistence   Understanding gender differences in career choice is an under-examined topic, especially in terms of racial, socio-economic or other differences.  The efficacy of efforts to affect career choice are not well understood. Mentorship programs are widely used however the evaluations of these programs are often limited in scope and depth. Studies are recommended on the attributes of successful mentors, impact over time, and the relative importance of mentorship at different stages.  Finally, the engineering and computer science professions can be family-friendly fields, but this is rarely communicated to young people. Studies are recommended where professionals and role models discuss the integration of work and family with these influencers and with school aged children.  2. Workplace Recruitment, Retention and Advancement  a) Leverage NSF ADVANCE findings to corporations and government agencies  At all levels, future research should build on existing research and practice.  In particular, researchers recommend leveraging the findings from the ADVANCE program within the corporate and governmental sectors.  b) Provide interventions for women working in engineering and computing  Researchers recommend continued work to identify the skills and competencies that are required for women?s achievement in male-dominated workplaces. More understanding of those women who persist in the workplace and how they differentiate themselves from others and from their male colleagues is important to retain and advance women.  c) Provide interventions for Women?s Colleagues, Peers, Recruiters and Leaders  Moving forward, the researchers recommend that studies focus on how to make workplaces free from bias and micro-aggressions.  Many corporations have mandated implicit bias training for their employees. However the limited research available shows that these types of training sessions have no long term impact related to change within organizations. It is recommended that these corporations work with researchers to determine the impact of bias training on recruitment, retention and advancement of women.  AAUW hopes that researchers will turn to this document when developing new research on gender equity in engineering and computing. The Research Agenda is also a resource for leaders in government agencies, foundations and corporations as they determine how to prioritize funding and other resources.  The report Solving the Equation: the Variables for Women's Success in Engineering and Computer are available at www.aauw.org. The Reseach will be available on the website in March, 2017.                     Last Modified: 02/02/2017       Submitted by: Catherine Hill]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
