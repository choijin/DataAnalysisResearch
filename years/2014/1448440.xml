<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the improvement of trustworthy software execution.  The proposed system, composed of a hardware monitoring device and a cloud-based security analytics engine, will detect process anomalies and malware in equipment where traditional anti-virus products cannot be installed.  This solution externally observes system activity by analyzing side-channel phenomena such as power consumption.  Unlike traditional anti-virus products that may interfere with normal operations and require constant updates, these side-channel measurements are independent of the software running on commercial equipment such as medical devices or point-of-sale terminals.  The proposed method processes those measurements with a continuous cloud-based machine-learning engine and integrates multiple data sources to provide IT professionals with a reliable source of timely, actionable results.  If successful, this project will help technicians quickly catch anomalous behavior, including malware, before it spreads to other devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the independent, nonintrusive detection of anomalous behavior, including malware, on high-assurance computing devices.  Many commercial appliances, such as medical devices, run commodity operating systems but cannot support traditional anti-virus programs that consume precious resources and require frequent database updates.  This incompatibility has resulted in widespread malware infections on equipment at hospitals, retailers and critical facilities.  The proposed research will involve continuously monitoring the power consumption side-channel without disrupting normal operations.  The intellectual merit of the project lies in cloud-based, high-frequency measurements and correlation of equipment behavior in order to quickly and accurately identify anomalous operations at scale.  The goal of the proposed research is to correlate side-channel outputs with system activity across geographically diverse sets of equipment in order to improve anomaly, breach, and malware detection in real-world deployments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Modern healthcare relies heavily on computerized medical devices to improve healthcare delivery and improve patient outcome.  Unfortunately, this progress comes at the price of increased software complexity and security vulnerabilities.  In addition, the fundamental mismatch of software designed to last three to five years, running on equipment designed to last decades introduces unique maintenance challenges.  As operating systems fall out of support and systems go unpatched, many devices are left exposed with little to no visibility on the device and limited paths to software upgrades.  Even the most modern hospitals exhibit vulnerabilities of every vintage.  In 2015 and 2016, outbreaks of malware holding encrypted data hostage in exchange for a ransom &mdash; also called ransomware -&mdash; at healthcare providers worldwide hint at the extent of the problem of outdated software and detection only when it?s too late. In the US alone, there are 5,600 hospitals using over 12 million computerized medical devices in a fleet containing an additional 50 million general purpose computing equipment on clinical networks, with a large portion running outdated and unpatched software.  Infections by garden-variety malware (not specifically targeting healthcare) often fester for months on medical devices.  This situation puts patients at risk and can negatively impact patient outcomes.  The healthcare industry?s response has been to spend well over $1 billion in 2015 on security defense and response, with little improvement in time between malware infection and detection. This project brought together years of experience in medical device security by first recognizing the unique requirements of care delivery where continuity of operations and patient safety are by far the most important aspects of the system.  The outcome is our first product, PowerGuard, that precisely targets the problem of unwanted code execution on equipment delivering patient care.  Being a simple pass-through brick providing AC power to a medical device, PowerGuard observes signals from the medical device?s software and hardware operations, learning normal activity patterns and flagging unusual behavior.  PowerGuard can thus be used to detect unusual workloads caused by malware, without itself running code on the medical device and without requiring hardware modifications.  As a nonintrusive activity monitor, PowerGuard allows clinical workflow to proceed unimpeded.  Its continuous monitoring of medical devices over time provides visibility and awareness in the face of an evolving threat landscape.  To assess PowerGuard?s performance, we tested PowerGuard prototypes on a wide variety of medical devices in a 1000+ bed hospital.  The devices ranged from radiology equipment and patient monitors, to programmers for implantable cardiac devices.  The results of our R&amp;D effort showed promising results with an acute need for healthcare-aware security solutions.
