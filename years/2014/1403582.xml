<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 1403582&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Jenna L. Rickus&lt;br/&gt;Title: High density array biosensors for spatial mapping of cellular gradients and flux&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flux of small molecules and ions at the surface of cells carries important information that is communicated both internally to the cell and externally to neighboring cells. Examples of such important cellular flux in biology include neurotransmitter release and reuptake in neurons, glucose transport for adapted cell metabolism in cancer cells, and ion flux in plant gravity sensing during development.   No method currently exists that can quantify the spatial map and dynamics of true cellular flux and biomolecule gradients from many single cells in a chip format.  This project will apply recent advances and expertise in nano/microelectronics, mathematical modeling, and biosensors to create such a technology.  The outcome of the work will be an on chip platform technology that can be replicated for a wide range of cellular systems to answer basic biological questions regarding cellular flux that cannot be answered today.  For example, a freshly resected tumor could be rapidly analyzed to examine how a drug candidate affects glucose metabolism of the heterogeneous cell population or neurotransmitter dynamics could be integrated with electrical activity information to better understand information processing of neuronal networks during learning and memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flux and resulting concentration gradients of small molecules and ions at the surface of cells carry important information that is communicated both internally to the cell and externally to neighboring cells. Self-referencing biosensors are currently the best method for quantifying cellular flux dynamics, but this method is limited to measurements at one location in space on one cell at a time. In addition, this method is not portable and cannot be used for sensing in remote locations such as on space missions, in environmental monitoring, or in high throughput biomedical applications.  No method currently exists that can quantify the spatial map and dynamics of true cellular flux and biomolecule gradients from single cells in a chip format.  The overall objective of this work is to create a technology for the spatial and temporal mapping of biomolecule gradients and flux at the level of single cells by creating 1D and 2D arrays of individually addressable nano/microscale electrochemical sensors.  The proposal develops and integrates novel solutions to the technical challenges of creating such a device including synchronous detection to overcome noise limitations, a field-programmable approach to reduce the need for precision alignment between sensors and cells, electrode addressable biofunctionalization to achieve high spatial resolution of bio-recognition layers and multi-analyte sensing, and a mathematical framework to design and optimize electrode arrays considering both the biological signal and sensor function in space and time.  Importantly each of these technical advances has application beyond flux sensing and applies more broadly to the field of nano-biosensing. The end result of the work will be an on-chip platform technology that can be replicated for a wide range of cellular systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Nano-Biosensing, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (Engineering Directorate), and (2) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate).</AbstractNarration>

The MEA-based approach has also been used to measure biological gradients/flux.  The uptake kinetics of hydrogen peroxide by human astrocytes (normal) and glioblastoma multiforme (cancer) cells have been characterized.  In these experiments, the MEA chip was mounted perpendicular to a 2D cell culture within a well in a multi-well plate.   For each cell type, peroxide uptake was quantified for initial concentrations of 20 to 500 micromolar over time intervals of 4000 s. For both cell types, the overall uptake rate versus surface concentration relationships exhibited non-linear kinetics, well-described by a combination of linear and Michaelis?Menten mechanisms.

In comparison to results from typical volumetric measurements, the ability to extract both uptake rate and surface concentration in static media provides kinetic parameters that are better suited both for understanding mechanistic behavior and for developing reaction/diffusion models to adequately describe behavior in more complex culture/tissue geometries.     Toward the goal of realizing biorecognition confinement for multi-analyte arrays, the MEA-approach has been extended to the measurement of glucose uptake and lactate release.  These analytes are of interest in understanding metabolic activity of cells, in terms of comparing various cell types and quantifying changes due to local micro-environment or chemical exposure.   Using a spatially addressable method of biosensor functionalization of selective electrodes within an MEA,   analyte-specific sensing has been demonstrated for glucose and lactate, which can enable multiplexing and simultaneous sensing of overlapping gradients of multiple analytes.  Time-dependent spatial profiles of glucose have been measured near 2D cultures of various cell types, including glioblastoma multiforme and, along with collaborators, lung and pancreatic cells. The uptake kinetics for various initial glucose concentrations have been quantified, providing data relevant for understanding the mechanisms of glucose uptake or for developing models for analyte diffusion/uptake within 3D cell geometries.
