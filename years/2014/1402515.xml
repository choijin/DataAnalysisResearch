<AbstractNarration>SES-1402515&lt;br/&gt;Todd Shaw&lt;br/&gt;Barbara Combs&lt;br/&gt;Kirk Foster&lt;br/&gt;Michael Hodge&lt;br/&gt;Desiree Pedescleaux&lt;br/&gt;University of South Carolina at Columbia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests support for an Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) for a one year pilot study that tests a new model for understanding how group or neighborhood identify impacts civic engagement and collective action by residents.   The researchers propose a model that argues that geographic dispersion (an ongoing feature of minority neighborhoods) impacts the length of residence and how rooted residents are in their particular neighborhood.  These factors are positively related to the level of the concept of linked fate (we are all in this together whether or not we are residents of the same neighborhood), attachment to the neighborhood and whether residents assume their neighborhoods' identify.  These dynamics then contribute to trust and the level of cooperation among residents that in turn determines participation in collective action on behalf of the neighborhood.   To test these basic assumptions, the research team will conduct a pilot study of two primarily African American historic neighborhoods in Atlanta, Georgia--the Old Fourth Ward and the West End -- that have undergone gentrification, with significantly diverse outcomes.  The Old Fourth Ward over the last three decades has been transformed from a historically middle class black community to a neighborhood that is now 30 percent white, with a significant rise in median income.  On the other hand, the West End, a black working class/lower income community, witnessed a 39 percent decrease in white residents, now has a population that is only 2 percent white, and experienced a modest decline in median income.  These two communities offer the opportunity to study African American's perceptions of the changes that have occurred in two of their communities (that reflect trends in other such communities in the South) and responses (civic collective action) to these changes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has significant broader impacts.  Specifically, it (1) is an interdisciplinary collaboration between two Research-I, majority-white universities and two historically black liberals arts colleges; (2) mentors and substantively involves the participation of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups; (3) provides student and faculty researchers and the broader public with a robust dataset that has potential multi-disciplinary interest; (4) creates an opportunity to disseminate research findings directly relevant to the life of two vibrant urban neighborhoods; and (5) makes a unique theoretical and methodological contributions to the literature on the changing social and civic spaces of urban communities. While policymakers have long argued that devoting public and private resources to building local capacity can tackle urban poverty and spur economic redevelopment,  e.g., Community Action Programs, Enterprise Zones, and  Empowerment Zones.  The study?s results can help us better understand the role that heterogeneous relationships among neighborhood residents play in successful communities? problem-solving.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit   The purpose of this study is to understand if and how the neighborhood feelings or attachments of Black/African American individuals shape their willingness to cooperate with their neighbors and to collectively address vital, community issues and participate in civic affairs.  This project?s unique contribution to urban research is we theorize and test the geographic, social, and political distances in between Black urban neighbors.  We test whether Black neighbors' attachments are due to their:  (1) trust of and meaningful relationships with their neighbors or what we label "social capital"; (2) feelings of group attachment to their fellow Black neighbors and/or Blacks at-large or what we label "linked fate"; and travel of relatively small distances away from their neighborhoods to their churches, schools, places of work, or places to shop or what we label "geographic dispersion."   Between August 24, 2015 and September 30, 2015, we conducted 400 random, statistically representative telephone surveys of Black respondents and who were at least 18 years of age and lived in the city limits of Atlanta, Georgia.  We supplemented these surveys with about a dozen in-person follow up interviews.  We select Atlanta, Georgia because it is a metropolitan area whose neighborhoods have witnessed many of the same racial, economic, and political developments true of Black America and the American South.  Atlanta neighborhoods have been affected by urban sprawl or unchecked growth, Black middle class mobility, and increasing suburbanization in the face of ongoing racial disparities, residential segregation, and Black poverty.  We consider the neighborhoods of the West End and the "Old Fourth Ward" as interesting case studies because they contain vital social and civic institutions that are important to the political and economic history of Black Atlanta and Black America, more broadly.  Findings Our statistical analysis of survey responses revealed that working with neighbors on a community problem in the last 12 months was associated with increased neighborhood attachment, increased feelings that neighbors help each other, and decreased feelings of racial closeness to fellow Black neighbors.  The last finding is counter to what we expected we would find.  However, fifty-five percent of our respondents reported that they did not feel racially linked to their fellow Black neighbors.  Although trust of neighbors was positively associated with neighborhood participation, it was not statistically significant.  This is logical in that simply trusting one?s neighbors does not indicate the same strength of attachment, is not as concrete, as the view that neighbors help out each other.  While these local factors matter in determining neighborhood participation, all of them (except linked fate) interestingly do not explain political participation overall &ndash; e.g. voting, working on campaigns, or signing petitions. [Refer to Table 1.]  Also, we found there is a negative relationship between neighborhood participation and reported increased distances to travel to what respondents consider the most important local organization to which they belong. [Refer to Table 2.]  All of the follow up respondents (in the qualitative survey) express a high level of attachment to their neighborhoods. This, of course, may be because people had to opt into the follow up interview, and those who did so may be more likely to be engaged in their neighborhoods. The preliminary interviews suggest respondents have common primary reasons for their attachment to their neighborhoods. One of the most common responses is the convenience of living in an in-town neighborhood and this seemed to be unrelated to quality of the neighborhood. Respondents who self-described living in "bad neighborhoods" often still indicated high levels of attachment to the place based on factors like history or relationships with others in the area. Our qualitative interviews also strongly supported the idea that the respondents felt a sense of shared or linked fate with Blacks inside and outside of the neighborhood. Almost all respondents talked about feeling that their identity and well-being was connected to what was happening to other Blacks in the nation, and a few discussed it on an international/global level.   Overall, we believe this study begins to unpack in what ways urban neighborhoods still may or may not matter to Black group identity and civic engagement.   Broader Impact  The broader impact of this project is that has provided: (1) an important collaboration between majority-White, research institutions and historically Black liberals arts colleges; (2) a means to mentor undergraduate students from underrepresented groups; (3) researchers and the broader public with an unique dataset that examined neighborhood and Black civic life in the vital, Southern metropolis of Atlanta, Georgia; (4) a snapshot of predominantly or historically Black neighborhoods that are in transition; and (5) findings that permit us to speculate on how a range of public policies related to housing, transportation, economic and community development may impact individuals? attachments to their neighborhoods and thus their ability to collectively act on behalf of their neighborhoods.
