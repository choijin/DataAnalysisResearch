<AbstractNarration>Northwestern University proposes a strategy to introduce all students to computational thinking (CT) skills in a context that highlights the value and relevance of computational methods. The Computational Thinking for All (CT4ALL) approach embeds activities in existing high school science and mathematics classrooms as a way to (a) enhance students' CT skills, (b) infuse modern, computational practices of STEM professionals into existing STEM courses, and (c) broaden the appeal of computing by concretely demonstrating its applicability to diverse fields. The project staff have forged a strong partnership with Chicago Public Schools who are embarking on a district-wide effort to infuse computer science into all of their schools. CT4ALL complements this strategy. The project will work intensively with two schools, both serving predominantly low-income, minority populations. The intended outcome is to develop and share practical knowledge of these implementations working within the substantial constraints of large, resource-limited public high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern will analyze data gathered from student attitude questionnaires, student learning assessments, students' work on capstone projects and teacher attitude surveys to inform this study The project will use a Design Based Implementation Research study to develop and refine a whole-school model of this concept that is guided by the following research questions:&lt;br/&gt;(1) what are the CT learning gains for students in the schools;&lt;br/&gt;(2) how do students' attitudes toward CT change, particularly for girls and other traditionally underrepresented groups;&lt;br/&gt;(3) what are the CT learning gains for the STEM teachers; and&lt;br/&gt;(4) to what extent to teachers' confidence, interest, and attitudes towards CT change as a result of their participation?</AbstractNarration>

The CT4ALL and CT4G partnerships, for the two year BPEC award period, have focused on developing educational programming, enrichment opportunities and teacher capacity at schools with students that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The CT4ALL Project introduces students to integrated computational thinking experiences within their STEM classes that reflect 21st century practices and interdisciplinary perspectives. The CT4G Clubs provide an immersive and collaborative learning environment for exploratory and project-based learning for middle and high school girls focused on a diverse array of activities including robotics, game design, arduino programming, as well as computational creation of music and visual data manipulations. This research study examined the influence of a pilot whole-school model in which computational thinking curricular activities are embedded throughout required biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics coursework. This approach would ensure that every high school student is exposed to computational literacy activities in a context that demonstrates its relevance to real world career paths. We investigated how such curriculum, as presented in formal STEM classrooms and informal environments like CT4G, affects student and teachers&rsquo; attitudes, identity, and learning using surveys, learning assessments, and clinical interviews and observations.

Important influences on positive learning trajectories include engagement, repeated exposures and time-on-task.
