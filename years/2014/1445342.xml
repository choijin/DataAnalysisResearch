<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1445342&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mirov, Sergey&lt;br/&gt;University: University of Alabama at Birmingham&lt;br/&gt;Title: EAGER: Portable photoacoustic platform for glucose sensing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to develop and build a working prototype of a true noninvasive, portable hand held, low cost device for blood glucose level monitoring in home or clinic settings. If successful, this device will substantially improve the quality of life of millions of people with diabetes by eliminating discomfort and pain associated with the necessity to puncture fingers, and reduce the probability of developing chronic diabetes complications due to poor management of blood glucose levels. The device could be also used for continuous blood glucose level monitoring in clinic and hospital settings. The proposed platform can also be used for development of other applications such as detection and monitoring of chemicals of interest in aqueous solutions for environmental studies, and in industrial settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device will be based on a wavelength modulation (WM) photoacoustic (PA) spectroscopy in the near-infra-red (IR) spectral region. It will consist of a portable acoustic cell, a portable broadly tunable diode pumped Cr:ZnSe laser, pioneered by the PI group, and a smartphone for measurements control and data analysis. This novel wavelength modulation technique is essentially a zero background method, which will substantially improve sensitivity of current photoacoustic methods for glucose level monitoring. The absence of a strong background due to water absorption will not only improve sensitivity of the device, but also eliminate the necessity to perform arduous data treatment algorithms for extracting weak glucose absorption signals masked under a strong background. This will enable the use of devices with low computational power, such as smartphones.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We report on design and realization of the first continuous wave, acousto-optically tuned Cr:ZnS mid-IR laser operating over 1890 - 2785 nm spectral range with a slope efficiency in the maximum of tuning curve of ~40% with respect to the pump power. The tuning range over 1890 - 2785 nm was demonstrated by tuning the TeO2 based acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF) with the use of  RF drive frequency between 30.3 MHz to 20.12 MHz. A maximum output power of 2.8 W output power was achieved at 2.23 &micro;m and at 10.7 W of pump power. The linewidth of AOTF tuned Cr:ZnS laser measured at central wavelength was &lt;0.8 nm. This AOTF tunable middle-infrared laser is desirable for spectroscopic applications. One of the important advantages of AOTF tuning of Cr:ZnS laser comes with the ability of rapid switching of oscillation wavelength, enabling wavelength modulation spectroscopy providing significant improvement in signal to noise ratio. Considering the distinct absorption peaks of glucose in the 2 - 2.4 &mu;m spectral range, along with the absence of any characteristic features of water, we were able to utilize wavelength modulation of the Cr:ZnS laser for glucose detection in solution. Overall, the developed system holds promise for noninvasive and sensitive detection of glucose.               Last Modified: 01/06/2018       Submitted by: Sergey B Mirov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
