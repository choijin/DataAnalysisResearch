<AbstractNarration>A better understanding of past climatic variability and the extent to which different climate systems influence moisture availability is essential for future water resources planning and allocation.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate historical drivers of moisture variability near the intersection of two dominant climate systems in Central Asia.  The doctoral student will use tree-ring data to characterize spatial and temporal climatic changes and the reasons behind these changes across a region that is not well understood climatically.  She will provide new information regarding how multiple climate systems dictate the amount of moisture delivered to semi-arid regions that are susceptible to persistent and severe droughts.  The student will work closely with natural resource offices internationally and will mentor undergraduate students, many of whom will be from underrepresented groups.  The hydroclimatic nature of this study has important implications for water resource managers around the world as they develop regional plans for future water allocations.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the core question of whether shifting climate systems are responsible for changes in spatial hydroclimatic variability or whether such convergences are a response to human-related warming.  A new multi-parametric tree-ring approach at a fine temporal resolution (annual) will be used to understand the drivers of past climate variability.  Tree-ring parameters including ring width, latewood density, carbon and oxygen isotopes will be analyzed using standard dendrochronological procedures.  The analyses will provide a quantitative assessment of the factors driving large-scale drought dynamics.  The research in an arid region of the world will provide a better understanding of water resources use and allocation for agricultural, environmental, and human use in a broad range of locales around the world, including some in the U.S.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to better understand climatic variability and drivers across semi-arid Asia using a combination of different tree-ring parameters. We used a combination of tree-ring widths, stable carbon and oxygen isotope data, and blue intensity (a proxy for tree-ring density) to evaluate past climate across Mongolia. We assessed the climatic information contained within these parameters for a site in central Mongolia (Khorgo) and eastern Mongolia (Urgun Nars), to determine if they could help explain factors controlling climate in each region. This was a novel approach for tree-ring studies in Mongolia, as tree-ring stable isotopes had not yet been analyzed for this region of arid central Asia. While ring width was known to have a strong hydroclimate signal (i.e. variations in ring width represent variability in year-to-year moisture) in each site, we found that blue intensity had a similar summertime drought signal at the Khorgo site, and stable isotopes provide additional information about climate and tree physiology in both sites. Specifically, tree-ring stable carbon isotopes represent variation in summertime moisture, very similar to the signal contained in tree-ring widths. Stable oxygen isotopes in tree-ring cellulose partly reflect summertime moisture, and springtime temperatures. The springtime temperature signal in the tree-ring oxygen record appears to represent a source water signal (i.e. the stable isotopic signature from precipitation received by the trees). Similar climate signals were found in the stable isotope data from both sites, though more samples will be processed from Urgun Nars in the future to strengthen the datasets. The ring-width and stable carbon isotope records (representing summertime moisture) from both sites suggest that year-to-year variability in warm-season hydroclimate is similar during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, but dissimilar during the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This means that the factors influencing precipitation are similar in both regions during the modern/recent period, but were different historically. Interestingly, our stable oxygen results from both sites are very similar during the modern and historical period. Although more analysis is required, these results could indicate that the source of water might be similar for both sites during the entire length of the record (i.e. westerlies-derived moisture), but smaller-scale atmospheric processes might influence regional hydroclimate patterns. Overall, the results from this project strongly support the notion that multiple tree-ring parameters are more useful than ring width alone in deciphering past climate, and that it can be a useful tool for understanding the dynamics of climate systems.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Caroline&nbsp;W&nbsp;Leland</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
