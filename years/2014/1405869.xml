<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard collaborative award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at the University of Dayton (UD), Central State University (CSU), and Wright State University (WSU) entitled, "Collaborative Research: Collaborative RET Site-Inspiring Next Generation High-skilled Workforce in Advanced Manufacturing and Materials", under the direction of Dr. Margaret Pinnell, Dr. Leanne Petry, and Dr. Ahsan Mian. The University of Dayton will serve as the lead institution on this collaborative Site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Site will target teachers from Ohio Region 10 districts eligible for School Improvement Support, and from partner schools (Dayton Early College Academy (DECA) and Dayton Regional STEM School (DRSS). After participation in this RET, teachers will continue their professional development through ongoing engagement with the PIs at all three institutions and the DRSC and will be prepared for leadership roles in their K-12 setting.  Participants will achieve long-term collaborative partnerships with the university research community, engineering professionals, and the DRSC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a significant impact on the Dayton area and the engineering community nationwide by promoting engineering in K-12 STEM curriculum and recruiting teachers from high-needs and urban schools. It will also strengthen regional partnerships and collaborative relationships that support both STEM education at all levels and advanced manufacturing and materials development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new era of manufacturing will require highly skilled STEM professionals. As such, educators need to inspire youth to pursue STEM disciplines. This collaborative RET Site will leverage and sustain a prior UD RET Site and provide a total of 54 in-service and pre-service middle and high school STEM teachers, 18 per year over three years, with an intensive and transformative six week real world research experience that is thematically centered on materials and advanced manufacturing, a regional strength and economic cluster. The Site will facilitate this immersion by placing teachers  teachers with research mentors at one of the three participating universities to work on projects that connect with regional strengths in advanced manufacturing and materials. The RET experience will be enhanced through a materials boot camp, industry and laboratory tours and extensive interaction with a wide variety of STEM professionals through the Dayton Regional Stem Center (DRSC).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A collaborative team comprised of Central State University (CSU), the University of Dayton (UD), and Wright State University (WSU) strategically combined efforts and improved technical literacy in materials and manufacturing in the broader community by providing authentic, real-world research experiences for teachers (RET) during the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 academic years.  Approximately, thirty-six in-service teachers, eighteen pre-service teachers, and ten undergraduate STEM students participated in the three-year project.  The teacher participants came from local, regional, and even national school districts representing both the private and local sectors, rural, urban and suburban districts and primarily middle and high school grade bands.  The undergraduate participants represented six different universities.  In collaboration with faculty mentors, participants engaged in research as well as designed, piloted and published transformative engineering curriculum content to increase student engagement in STEM education and promote workforce development in the Greater Dayton, Ohio area.  Research projects focused on degradation of lithium ion batteries, polymer development from natural products, and dye production from natural and synthetic materials, among other works.  This collaborative effort included many community building and professional development activities, engaged a large stakeholder community, including numerous industrial and Department of Defense partners in the region.  The RET project leveraged and expanded existing partnerships and built new relationships that disseminated information and facilitated collaboration among teachers, researchers and area partners.
