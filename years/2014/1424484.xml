<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Prof. Harriet Ritvo, Ph.D. student  Shira Shmuely will examine the ways the legal regulation of animal experimentation has shaped science and, reciprocally, how scientific knowledge about animal sentience has shaped those legal regulations.  The coPI will examine how humanistic values have been translated into laws governing animal welfare and the mechanisms by which such laws have been administered.  Her focus is on how the ethical standpoint of utilitarianism utilizes science in the ethical calculus, as the primary mode of expertise about somatic function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to resulting in a dissertation, this research will contribute to ongoing debates about animal welfare, and illuminate ethical issues in the life sciences and  biotechnological research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The dissertation project unravels the historical and ethical foundations of the regulation of animal experimentation. The project traces the origins of contemporary animal experimentation laws, focusing on the implementation of the British Vivisection Act (1876).  It shows that in order to regulate animal experimentation, state administrators and physiologists offered various interpretations to the concepts of ?pain? and ?experiment,? while attempting to make pain a measureable and manageable object.  The project is based on extensive archival research. It includes an analysis of correspondences between the British Home Secretary and physiologists, Home Office memos, original scientists? applications for licenses, minuets of various scientific societies, court proceedings, newspaper reporting, Royal Commissions papers and reports and various other records created through the process of implementing the Vivisection Act. Seen together, the materials demonstrate the establishment of a complex law-and-science system created to manage the ethical aspects of animal experimentation.  The intellectual merits of the project are threefold. It provides an analysis of the origins of British apparatuses of state supervision on animal experimentation. It examines how civil servants and inspectors interpreted the law and communicated with scientists, and how they dealt with questions of administrative discretion.  Additionally, the project shows how law and science were engaged in co-production: scientific understanding of animals? bodies and pain guided bureaucratic decisions while, at the same time, being guided by such decisions. Legal constructs were thus inseparable from the creation of physiological knowledge.
