<AbstractNarration>Mathematically, this research project falls into the broad category of algebraic geometry, one of the most varied areas of today's mathematics. Fundamentally, algebraic geometry is the study and classification of geometric objects described by algebraic equations through manipulation of the input data using a wide array of mathematical tools. Because of its diversity, algebraic geometry permeates such different branches of science as robotics, cosmology, and computer encryption. The origins of algebraic geometry can be traced to the works of Euclid and Pythagoras. In its modern form, the focus of algebraic geometry is on singularities, which are points that are unusual when compared to their neighbors. Examples of singularities include cusps such as the tip of a funnel cloud, or self-intersections such as the center in a figure-of-eight; they indicate states in which a given physical system becomes anomalous.  This project also contributes to the training of the next generation of researchers by engaging graduate as well as undergraduate students in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of this project is the study of singularities through cohomological methods. To a singularity defined by a set of polynomial equations one may attach several invariants; these may be of discrete type (such as the number of branches of a curve meeting in a point) or of continuous nature (such as the space of all vector fields tangent to the singularity). If one considers a family of singularities, such invariants behave in interesting ways: on one side, at special members of the family they "jump" (that is, get larger in some sense), and such jumps are often accompanied by an appropriate nonzero local cohomology group.  The singularities where jumps occur typically exhibit worse behavior than their neighbors. On the other side, near typical members of the family, the invariants often deform according to so-called "hypergeometric" differential equations. One component of this project investigates, using local cohomology and combinatorial methods, jumps and solutions of the appearing hypergeometric differential equations. The other part of the project is concerned with the study of specific invariants in families of singularities derived through either calculus (the Gauss--Manin connection and Bernstein--Sato polynomial), counting techniques (the Igusa zeta function), or deformations (cohomology of the Milnor fiber), and their interplay.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award is in the general area of mathematics called "algebraic geometry". It is mainly concerned with varieties, which are the places where a given collection of polynomials evaluates to zero (in the same way that the equation x^2+y^2=1 describes a circle). More specifically, the research was aimed at understanding the singularities of these varieties; singularities are the places where a variety is anomalous---for example, like the point of intersection of two straight lines, or like the tip of an ice cream cone. Singularities are important in applications such as robotics and other parts of engineering (where they present "forbidden configurations"), in population models in biology (where they indicate conditions where the model becomes unstable, leading to collapse or explosion), and also appear in the context of popular science in terms of black holes.  The methods employed in the award range from purely algebraic techniques that involve the p-th power map (p is some prime number) to the approach via "D-modules", which is a technique that takes its roots in calculus and is very relevant in geometry.  The objects of the research are primarily of two types: a) certain systems of differential equations named "GKZ" after Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky (and whose origins go back to Euler and Gauss in the 1700's); b) the actual varieties attached to polynomials, for which it is a longstanding major open problem so classify them by singularity type.  The most significant outcomes of this award can be described as follows: * For GKZ-systems we have found and proved new structural properties. These will help to explain the behaviour of their solutions and this is relevant for example in the understanding of "mirror symmetry", a mathematical theory whose purpose is to explain unexpected similarities in the nature of certain elementary particles that form the fabric of space. * Parts of the "Monodromy Conjecture" were proved, which claims a very mysterious connection between i) certain aspects of the geometry of a variety, ii) some elementary counting problems, and iii) a long-standing problem in calculus.   An important part of the award was concerned with the furtherance of the academic endeavor of young, developing scientist. Part of the award was tied to research experiences for undergraduate college students, which were led by the principal investigator (PI). Over the summers of the award period, undergraduate students came to work with the PI at projects involving research for two months. The grant also supported in part research of graduate students working with the PI, resulting in new publications.  Within the framework of this award, the PI organized domestic and international conferences for aspiring academics, and brought graduate students to them. In several cases, this initiated new research projects of the students involved. In terms of impact, this connects future leaders in research and education to mentors and peers outside their home institution, which is a crucial component of success in a career in the pure or applied sciences, in academia or in industry.
