<AbstractNarration>Dr. Jeffrey Pigott has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct research at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and carry out activities to broaden participation in the Earth sciences. Earth's inner core has recently been revealed to be structurally complex, with significant seismic anisotropy, seismic waves traveling faster in the polar direction than in the equatorial plane. This seismic anisotropy varies in magnitude hemispherically and as a function of depth. This project aims to determine how this seismic anisotropy relates to crystal structure and solid-state deformation. To increase diversity in the geosciences, Dr. Pigott will mentor an undergraduate researcher and leverage existing partnerships with Cleveland area high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seismic anisotropy in Earth's inner core likely results from crystallographic preferred orientation of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) iron-nickel alloy that is thought to be stable under inner core conditions, but how this texturing developed remains a subject of debate. Constraining the diffusion anisotropy and solid-state viscosity of the inner core is critical to understanding the link between deformation and seismic anisotropy. Dr. Pigott will quantify the self-diffusion anisotropy in Earth's inner core through atomistic simulations and first principles calculations of the axial self-diffusion coefficients in hcp-Fe at inner core conditions coupled with diffusion experiments using the analog metal hcp-Zn. Internally-consistent first principles calculations of the elasticity of hcp-Fe will elucidate the relationship between diffusion, deformation, and elasticity and allow for robust modeling of the state and evolution of Earth's inner core.</AbstractNarration>

The seismic anisotropy in Earth&rsquo;s inner core likely results from lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) of the hexagonal close-packed (<em>hcp</em>) iron-nickel alloy that is thought to be the stable phase under inner core conditions, but how this texturing developed remains a subject of debate. To evaluate LPO production mechanisms, it is important to understand the rheology of the inner core, which depends on the self-diffusion coefficient in <em>hcp</em>-Fe under inner core conditions. Direct diffusion experiments using <em>hcp</em>-Fe are not feasible at present because, at temperatures high enough for diffusion to be significant, the phase is stable only at extreme pressures. Therefore, we conducted self-diffusion experiments on a structurally analogous material, <em>hcp</em>-Zn, using piston-cylinder and multi-anvil presses at <em>P</em> = 1.7 &ndash; 16 GPa and <em>T</em> = 576 &ndash; 1160 K (<em>T/Tm</em> = 0.75 &ndash; 0.89). By combining our high-pressure data with published self-diffusion data for a suite of hexagonal close-packed metals (Zn, Cd, Mg, Er, Tl, Hf, Ti, Zr), we predict that self-diffusion in an <em>hcp </em>metal at the <em>P-T</em> conditions of Earth&rsquo;s inner core (<em>D<sub>sd</sub></em> = ~10<sup>-13</sup> &ndash; ~10<sup>-10</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s) may be 2 &ndash; 3 orders of magnitude faster than previous estimates based on experiments using face-centered cubic Fe-Ni alloys. Furthermore, the <em>a</em>-axis, rather than the commonly assumed <em>c</em>-axis, should be the faster self-diffusion direction in <em>hcp</em>-Fe, even if Ni and/or Si are substantial alloying components. Due to the extremely low stresses and relatively large grain sizes likely present in the inner core, diffusion-controlled dislocation climb creep is the most likely deformation mechanism acting in the inner core. By modeling pure climb creep based on our self-diffusion coefficients, we predict inner core viscosities on the high end of previous estimates, ~10<sup>22</sup> Pa s. Pure climb creep does not result in lattice-preferred orientation, and hence it is likely that the seismic anisotropy observed in the inner core is a result of lattice preferred orientation of an <em>hcp</em> alloy acquired during solidification texturing, rather than active deformation.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>This fellowship resulted in further training of an early career scientist (the postdoctoral fellow) and involved two international collaborations (Australia and France).
