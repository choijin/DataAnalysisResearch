<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:  This grant from DMR-CMP provides partial support to the 2014 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on the Chemistry and Physics of Graphitic Carbon Materials. The conference will have a strong presence of theoretical and experimental condense matter physicists, with leading physicists playing various roles. More importantly, the GRC, with an informal workshop environment, aims to bring together researchers in multiple disciplines and to encourage cross-fertilization between the attending physicists and chemists, biologists or engineers. In addition, the conference will strongly emphasize participation of women and minority attendants at all levels, including as organizers of the conference, invited speakers, discussion leaders, and senior and junior participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This grant aims to provide partial support to the 2014 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on the Chemistry and Physics of Graphitic Carbon Materials. The GRC aims to bring together and promote interactions among researchers in multiple disciplines with shared interest in graphitic carbon materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphite, activated carbon, etc. The conference will have a strong presence of theoretical and experimental condense matter physicists. The diverse topics to be discussed in the GRC are highly relevant to the mission of the Division of Materials Research of the NSF. Accomplishing these goals will undoubtedly lead to many exciting discoveries on chemistry and physics of materials, and result in new enabling materials and technologies.</AbstractNarration>
