<AbstractNarration>The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was chartered in 1990 to test the effects of increased temperature on tundra plant phenology, growth, species composition and ecosystem function.  Since 2007, the ITEX-Arctic Observatory Network (ITEX-AON) has continued and expanded on the ITEX program across a latitudinal transect of five sites in Alaska and Greenland, collecting core ITEX data specifically designed to address the current needs outlined in the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) Implementation Report.  The goal of this effort is to maintain the continuity of the temporally-critical datasets of the ITEX-AON in Alaska and Greenland.  Core datasets include the long-term manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, ecosystem function, and surface properties on the long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of the vegetation plots on the 1km2 ARCSS grids, and a multifactor warming-moisture experiment in Greenland.  The simultaneous measurement of multiple surface properties at the small scale has allowed detection of relationships not previously recognized, e.g., in moss-dominated areas of the intensive transects, higher albedo is linked to higher temperatures.  Continuation of these measurements is imperative because increasing evidence points towards the critical importance of carry-over effects of the previous growing seasons on current and future responses and the inherent variability in the system precluded determination of the system response on the basis of a few years.  Data from this project are freely available on the ACADIS website.  The project will continue extensive outreach activities established in the initial phase, including strong relationships between the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (FTBG) and the GVSU Regional Math and Science Center and school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids, and El Paso.</AbstractNarration>

Plants that initiate their growth early tend to senesce early, implying that they generally have fixed growth-period lengths, or that resources other than carbon (metabolic energy) gained during photosynthesis are limiting their growth.  That is, the capture of carbon is not the primary determinant of seasonal growing period because if it was, they would continue to grow longer.  The project has also shown that vegetation along the latitudinal gradient is changing rapidly with plants becoming taller and shrubs increasing in stature and abundance.  This project continued development of an automated mobile instrumented sensor platform that assesses tundra ecosystem developmental and physiological status using high resolution, ground-based remote sensing, a "tricoder" for the ecosystem that repeatedly and precisely measures the same transect at daily intervals over the short arctic growing season (Fig 1).  The daily operation of these systems at each of our four sites has provided data that can be used to examine responses at the daily time step.  The growing season in the arctic is very short, 3 months or less, and visitors often comment that it seems like it is either getting greener or browner every day, depending on the season.  With our system we have documented those changes and how they differ for different tundra ecosystems (wet or dry) and for different climate regimes (cold coastal marine to continental interior). Our data clearly show that northern cold sites have lower peak greenness that occurs earlier during the growing season and changes less in response to warm temperatures compared to more southerly warmer sites.     The project has repeated confirmed a finding we originally found in 2010 that the standard albedo (% reflectance of solar radiation) temperature relationship does not hold at the small scale (plot level, ~ 1m2 in moist tundra. Instead of being cooler when it is highly reflective, tundra surfaces can be warmer, and when they are more absorptive, they can be cooler. The standard idea is that reflective surfaces (e.g., white) will be cooler than absorptive, darker surfaces. We believe the explanation lies in the role of moss in the understory.
