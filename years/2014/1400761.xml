<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Hiroaki Tanaka is "Lagrangian Cobordisms and Fukaya Categories, Factorization Homology and Link Invariants, Bridgeland Stability and K-Theory." The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jacob Lurie.</AbstractNarration>
