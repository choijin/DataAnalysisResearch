<AbstractNarration>The need for climate impact predictions on regional and decadal scales is widely recognized. Industry, government and society increasingly require predictive information in decision-relevant terms to enable appropriate planning and adaptation to future hazards arising from climate variability and change, both to mitigate future costs and maximize potential benefits. Climate scientists are engaged in significant effort to understand the decadal predictability of the climate system and to develop models to predict the climate on 5-30 year timescales. However, parallel efforts to understand predictive capacity of climate impacts and realize the full societal value of decadal prediction science has received little attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will utilize existing and developing dynamical models combined with observed data using advanced statistical methods to understand our predictive capacity for climate impacts on decadal timescales, and integrate predictive methods so that they more directly meet the societal needs for predictive information. The overarching goal is to transform how scientists from multiple disciplines and practitioners conceptualize decadal climate prediction, by enabling decadal predictions in decision relevant terms to improve planning and adaptive capacity for climate variability and change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach follows in two concurrent parts. Understanding of current predictive information needs and usage will be developed in Part I across multiple high-impact weather and climate phenomena and across multiple stakeholder groups. The core research will take place in Part II and will identify our predictive capacity for the needed information through development of new combined statistical-dynamical modeling approaches that incorporate and are robust to uncertainty. An iterative process between information needs and information provision will promote effective integration of skillful predictive information with decision-making. A key project contribution is the development of a prototype generalized interdisciplinary research framework to integrate predictive capacity with decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

The major goal of UDECIDE is being achieved in two overlapping parts: Part 1 is to understand current information needs and use, through in-depth understanding across multiple stakeholders, and Part 2 is to understand our predictive capacity for the needed information through the development of new statistical-dynamical modeling techniques, and iteration between the information needs and predictive capacity. Finally, prototype presentations of decadal climate information will be tested with stakeholders. The overarching project outcome is a generalized interdisciplinary research framework to integrate predictive capacity with decision-making.  Given that we are working towards effective ways to produce predictive information, it is essential to understand how scientists choices of how to communicate the information affects decisions.  We designed a series of experiments where we randomly assign people to different roles (expert advisor or decision-maker) and have them make predictions about similar events that span different time horizons (annual, decadal). For advisors, we ask them to provide a recommendation about each event and a) give them choices amongst different options for presenting probabilistic information about the events to decision-makers (deterministic forecasts, simple event probabilities, or simple event probabilities plus contextual information about the whether the event probability is above vs. below average) and b) ask them to make predictions about decision-makers likely accuracy using each type of option. To assess decision-makers decision accuracy, we have created an incentive-compatible study where decision-makers play the role of a city manager who receive information about the probability of flood damages from an aqueducts flooding and make a series of decisions about whether to incur protective expenses that prevent flood damages or forego these protective expenses at the risk of incurring much larger expenses should damages occur.   While research has demonstrated that expert advisors often provide recommendations that deviate from decision-makers personal preferences, very little research has empirically examined how experts provision of information may differ from the type of information that decision-makers prefer to receive.   Through our experimental research we find that when provided with a simple prediction that an event will not occur without accompanying uncertainty information, people still assume a fair amount of uncertainty; the amount of uncertainty they assume in these simple predictions increases with the time horizon of the forecast.  An interesting implication from the perspective of advisors is that for long-term forecasts, providing deterministic forecasts may undermine their ability to get people to follow their advice. However, because they often feel pressures to convey certainty in order to influence others (Van Zant, 2018), they might neglect to provide advisees with probabilistic information out of concerns that it will undermine their ability to persuade them to take a desired action as compared to a simple deterministic prediction.   Our experimental research provides contributions to the literature on how experts provision of information may differ from the type of information that decision-makers prefer to receive and could make a contribution to a growing literature on individuals source of uncertainty given a gap between experts information provision and what is optimal for decision-makers.  Assessment of decadal climate prediction skill and the development of presentations of useful decadal climate information have the potential to transform water resource and flood risk management practice. Benefits may cascade down to reduced flood risk and more robust water supply.                   Last Modified: 04/03/2020       Submitted by: Jeffrey R Czajkowski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
