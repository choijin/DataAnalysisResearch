<AbstractNarration>Following up on a special issue of Science (August 2013) that identified several Grand Challenges in Science Education, this project proposes a convocation to more deeply explore those challenges that are particularly relevant for K-12 teachers and highlights the roles teachers can play on issues vital to the improvement of K-12 STEM education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The convocation will: (1) pull together the evidence base on whether involving teachers in education policy and decision-making leads to improvements in policies; (2) identify the models of teacher engagement at the national, state, and local levels that currently exist; and (3) identify the kinds of communication efforts, resources and other activities that are needed to help policymakers better understand the role of teachers in these processes. The convocation addresses several important and timely questions: (1) how to help teachers engage in important education issues beyond their classrooms, and (2) what kinds of networks or mechanisms might be identified to accomplish that engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the meeting, materials will be developed that will be available both in hard copy and as PDF files from the National Academies Press.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Recent economic conditions and the performance of U.S. students on national and international assessments in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) have caused policymakers and politicians to focus attention on many aspects of K-12 STEM, including the quality and effectiveness of classroom teachers and their preparation, professional development, evaluation, compensation and collective bargaining, and career advancement. However, one critical set of voices in this discussion largely has been missing--that of classroom teachers themselves. To explore how the voices and leadership of STEM teachers might be better integrated into such conversations at the local, state, and national levels, under the aegis of the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/dbasse/tac/index.htm">Teacher Advisory Council of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</a> (National Academies) a committee of teachers and other education experts organized a convocation in 2014 that brought together a broad spectrum of education experts, policymakers, representatives from government agencies, private foundations, and teacher leaders and organizations that support them. The <strong>intellectual merit</strong> of this convening was that it enabled these attendees to examine some of the research literature on the ways that teachers can contribute to education policy- and decision making and how the knowledge, perspectives, and professional experiences of teachers can contribute to and inform discussions about some of the nation&rsquo;s most compelling and difficult issues in STEM education.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The convocation led to the publication of a National Academies report, <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18984/exploring-opportunities-for-stem-teacher-leadership-summary-of-a-convocation">Exploring Opportunities for STEM Teacher Leadership</a> and a <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/dbassesite/documents/webpage/dbasse_090131.pdf">brief summary of the report</a>.
