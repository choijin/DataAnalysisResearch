<AbstractNarration>Arctic sea ice is undergoing significant and accelerating change, which has been observed in increasing detail over the past several decades. Stakeholders in the Arctic and beyond are impacted by the cascading effects that these changes have on resource accessibility, ecosystem health, and earth?s physical climate system. Planning mitigation and adaptation strategies requires improvements in the ability to predict the arctic climate system. Confounding predictive model development are large gaps that remain in the understanding of the role albedo feedbacks are playing in sea ice loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve the understanding the impacts of solar energy absorption and partitioning on ice mass balance by tracking Arctic Observing Network (AON) sea ice sites as they move through space and time, using the rich datasets being collected at the sites as case studies. The approach integrates AON data with measurements from prior field campaigns, atmospheric reanalysis products, and high resolution remote sensing data using a 3D resolved sea ice-ocean mixed layer coupled model. The objectives are to quantify the deposition of solar energy within a 10x10km study domain around the sites with meter-scale resolution, identify the fate of that solar energy over time (e.g. ocean storage vs. ice bottom melt vs. lateral melt), and improve the ability of our resolved scale model to represent the processes controlling solar absorption and fate. The model explicitly represents critical ice and ocean processes such as melt pond formation, brine drainage, freshwater balance, and upper ocean stratification, providing a tool for data integration that can account for all first order processes impacting radiative transfer and heat storage. Important gaps in initialization datasets will be addressed by an ensemble modeling approach. Iterative comparison of site observations with model states will inform the selection of poorly constrained initial conditions, evaluate system sensitivity, and allow testing of improved model parameterizations for processes such as pond evolution.</AbstractNarration>

The focus of the project was on changes in the Arctic environment, ranging from the physical changes in the amount of sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean to how climate change is impacting the human communities that live Arctic regions. The Montshire Museum of Science, a small regional science center in Norwich, Vermont which serves rural audiences in northern New England collaborated with climate researchers at Dartmouth College, with the Museum providing the expertise in family science education supporting researchers' goals to better inform the public of their science and findings. The goals of this education project were:  Goal 1: Inform the public about changes observed in the major physical systems of the Arctic. Goal 2: Provide opportunities for museum visitors to investigate and understand the underlying phenomena and processes that control the Arctic's physical environment. Goal 3: Provide museum visitors opportunities to build their understanding of the cultural, physical, and biological geography of the circumpolar Arctic. Goal 4: Help museum visitors gain an understanding and appreciation for the process of climate science research. Goal 5: Provide an entry for conversations about climate science and climate change within social groups and between visitors and museum education staff.        To reach these goals, the Museum developed and delivered a number of science education activities, that included a series of public programs on climate change, family science workshops, teacher and student workshops and classroom resources on climate science. Additional project activities included the presentation of two adult courses in climate science and climate change, three special event days where museum visitors were able to meet climate researchers and take part in a variety of hands-on climate science activities, and the production of two audio stories used with family audience and middle school students introducing two local climate researchers who investigate changes in the Arctic regions.

Areas of misconceptions and lack of knowledge found among family visitors at the Montshire Museum of Science included:   Low levels of basic understanding of Arctic and Antarctic geography. Confusion about the difference between sea ice and land ice. Reasons for earth's seasons, and other drivers of climate systems.   Based on these findings, the project team developed a suite of climate science programs that can be incorporated into informal science programming at museums, science centers, and libraries, and in the formal K-8 classroom environment. These programs help young families have their first conversations about climate change. Programs developed incorporate hands-on science activities, in addition, the use of maps, globes, and satellite imagery to explore the changing Arctic in a family-friendly way.  Family science and student workshops developed focused on albedo and the earth's energy budget, properties and characteristics of sea ice, sediment cores and ice cores to study changes in the climate over time, and the geography of the polar regions.  The summative evaluation found that successful climate literacy learning experiences require meaningful hands-on, inquiry-based activities focused on a single earth process, and leads to an increase in science talk and conversation about climate change between the program instructor and audience members as learners begin to understand how these processes interact in the Earth's climate system.
