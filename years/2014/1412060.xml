<AbstractNarration>Professor Daniel A. Scherson of Case Western Reserve University is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Division of Chemistry to investigate the mechanism of reactions involving nitrogen and sulfur oxides both in molecular and ionic forms in aqueous solutions, as well as other species of relevance to energy conversion and electrosynthesis. Emphasis is centered on the development and implementation of spectroscopic techniques for monitoring in situ the time evolution of such species in the nanosecond domain and the factors that control the reaction pathways. The results emerging from these studies will open new prospects for addressing societal problems associated with environmental control and remediation, such as those derived from the overuse of fertilizers, and energy storage and conversion.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the in situ static and dynamic characterization of irreversibly adsorbed electrocatalysts for these reactions, as well as the effect of the microtopography of selected bare and atom-modified single crystal metal surfaces on the nature of adsorbed intermediates and other interfacial properties. Insight into these issues will be gained from the coupling of microelectrodes, charge injection, and an array of complementary microscope-based spectroscopic techniques, including UV visible reflection spectroscopy, resonance and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopies, and sum frequency and second harmonic generation. The success of this work would provide a means for extending in situ spectroelectrochemical techniques into the nanosecond range, allowing the study of the dynamic aspects of electron transfer events of relevance to a variety of other fields, including electrocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion, sensors, and environmental science. Students involved in this research will be trained in a broad range of fundamental and applied disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

Correlations between the coverage of the various species and E were obtained from data reported in the literature or by coulometric analysis of linear voltammetric scans. Excellent agreement was found for the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen and that of bisulfate from acidic electrolytes both on bare, and cyanide-modified Pt(111).</p> <p>The oxidation dynamics of the well-defined (2 x 2)-3CO (&theta;<sub>CO</sub>) = 0.75) and &radic;19x&radic;19 R23.4<sup>o</sup>-13CO (<span>&theta;</span><sub>CO</sub><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em> = 0.68) CO adlayer phases on quasi-perfect Pt(111) facets were examined in CO-saturated 0.1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> aqueous solutions via a combination of simultaneous, in situ, time-resolved, second harmonic generation (SHG, &lambda;(inc) = 590 nm), <span>&Delta;R/R</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>, (<span>&lambda;</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>l(inc) = 633 nm), and potential step techniques. For both of these phases, the onset of oxidation of CO<sub>ads</sub> was found to be delayed with respect to the time at which the potential was stepped to values positive enough, E<sub>ox</sub>, to promote oxidation of the entire CO adlayers.

In the case of the (2 x 2)-3CO phase, the transient in situ optical data collected for E<sub>ox</sub> = 0.98 V vs RHE could be quantitatively accounted for by a model that assumes all sites on the surface are occupied either by CO or bisulfate. In fact, excellent statistical fits to the CO transients for this latter phase derived from the SHG data could be obtained using Avrami's nucleation and growth model. On this basis, the oxidation of the fully assembled (2 x 2)-3CO phase occurs at the edge of the domain and propagates through the entire island until the entire process is completed. Similar experiments involving CO adlayers on Pt(111) facets below saturation coverages (i.e., <span>&theta;</span><sub>CO</sub><strong></strong><em></em> &lt; 0.75) formed by oxidative stripping of the fully assembled (2 x 2)-3CO phase yielded much longer tau(ind) values than surfaces with similar theta(CO) prepared by dosing the otherwise bare Pt(111) surfaces.
