<AbstractNarration>a non-technical explanation &lt;br/&gt;This project will support a team of scientists from several US universities and research institutes to participate in a 3-day workshop in France to establish a new international research collaboration for science of the Tropical Upper Troposphere / Lower Stratosphere (UT/LS).&lt;br/&gt;The new understanding of the dynamics, chemistry, and momentum exchange between the troposphere and stratosphere gained from Strateole 2 is critical for the new generation of climate models that extend as high as 1 hPa and attempt to incorporate variability in the stratosphere into our understanding of climate change. The workshop will also provide an opportunity for a group of undergraduate physics and engineering students from Puerto Rico interested in balloon platforms to learn about key motivations for stratospheric research, and get a new perspective on engineering challenges for making these types of measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a technical description &lt;br/&gt;Stratospheric water vapor plays an important role in the radiative budget of the stratosphere as well as in modulating surface warming. The tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is often referred to as the gateway to the global stratosphere, however there are still debates on the chemical transport pathways and how moist air is transported upward and eventually dehydrated in the TTL.  The objectives of the research are to 1) determine the roles of tropical waves and deep convection on the transport of water vapor into the stratosphere and formation of cirrus clouds in the tropical tropopause layer, 2) understand the relative roles of planetary-scale waves through small scale gravity waves in the forcing of the quasi-biennial oscillation, 3) characterize background aerosol loading, aerosol size distributions, and ozone chemistry in the tropical lower stratosphere to constrain this transport. New superpressure balloon instrumentation, including a fiber-optic temperature profiler, new pico-SDLA diode laser measurements of water vapor and lightweight frost point hygrometers that measure in-situ cold point temperatures and water vapor with unprecedented accuracy, will be key to new advances in this field.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Jules Verne&rsquo;s adventure novels <em>Five Weeks in a Balloon</em> and <em>Around the World in 80 Days </em>highlighted some of the great technological advances that were occurring in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century that revolutionized travel and captured the imagination of the public. These stories inspired Nelly Bly, American journalist for the New York World, to successfully complete an actual journey following the same path around the world in a record time of 72 days in 1890. These accounts demonstrated how new technology such as the Transcontinental Railroad in the US, the linking of the Indian railways, and the opening of the Suez Canal brought exotic destinations within reach. The revolutionary development of submarine cables and the electric telegraph allowed Nelly Bly to send back short reports so that people could follow her progress in &ldquo;real time&rdquo;.</p> <p>In that pioneering spirit and following in the footsteps of these fictional and factual adventurers, the Strat&eacute;ole-2 workshop set up US-France collaborative projects that will explore the world in a new way, and highlight technological advances in voyages to the exotic equatorial stratosphere to make observations that will inspire the next generation of scientists. Strat&eacute;ole-2 will launch super-pressure balloons into the infrequently sampled stratosphere from the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean. Simulations give an estimate of 84 days for the mean duration of balloon flights before chaotic motions or interaction with Rossby waves take them outside the 15<sup>o</sup>N to 20<sup>o</sup>S latitude band, in which time the balloons should travel approximately 2.5 times around the globe.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The workshop and the following collaborative work established the parameters for the Strat&eacute;ole Campaign. The Strat&eacute;ole-2 research program will begin with the first five test flights starting in boreal winter 2018-2019, and will then launch a sequence of 20 balloons over boreal winter 2020-2021 to circumnavigate the globe. Three balloons per week will be launched over two months starting in October or November 2020. Like Nelly Bly&rsquo;s telegraph reports over submarine cables, the Strat&eacute;ole-2 balloons will send back reports in near real-time over Iridium satellite links with exciting new data from the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and rarely observed properties of the Upper Troposphere / Lower Stratosphere (UT/LS). Two types of super-pressure balloons will be launched:&nbsp; 10 balloons at ~20km altitude, just above the TTL, and ten at ~18 km altitude, within the TTL. The mean winds at stratospheric heights near the equator travel around the Earth as fast as 20 m/s from east to west, or west to east, depending on the phase of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. A second science campaign to sample the opposite phase of the QBO is planned three years later (2023-2024).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The overarching objectives of Strat&eacute;ole-2 are to explore dynamical, physical, and chemical processes that control the transfer of mass and momentum between the equatorial Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere. Strat&eacute;ole-2 will provide unique new information on wave motions over a wide spectrum that are needed to improve climate models and accurately represent the transport of energy from the troposphere to the stratosphere and above. It will tackle the ultimate challenge of measuring the very very low levels of water vapor in the stratosphere, that are responsible for the formation of cirrus clouds that play a strong role in radiative balance of the atmosphere and affect surface temperatures.
