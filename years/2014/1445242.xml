<AbstractNarration>CBET-1445242&lt;br/&gt;Jaluria&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests partial travel support for several researchers and invited speakers to attend the conference. The conference is scheduled to be held May 25-29, 2014 at Piscataway, Rutgers University, New Jersey. The main objective of this proposal is to support participation at the 6th International Symposium on Advances in Computational Heat Transfer.The conference will provide an important forum for linking the basic work being done in computational heat transfer, particularly on new approaches and methods, with new areas, which could affect society in general.  Areas like biosystems, sensors and diagnostics, electronic devices, global climate change, transportation systems, heating and cooling systems, and energy storage are strongly dependent on the computational approach for analysis, prediction and control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the conference is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, methods and results in computational heat transfer.   The conference will provide an excellent venue for presenting recent research and advances in this field and for interaction with researchers from academic and research institutions, as well as from industry, around the world.  The interaction among researchers will improve the understanding of the fundamentals and expand the application to a wide variety of new and emerging areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide range of topics is covered in these conferences, ranging from the fundamentals and challenges in computational heat transfer to applications in energy, environment, manufacturing and biological systems.  Though the focus is on thermal transport, the associated fluid flow and mass transfer are also considered.  New and emerging areas such as micro/nanoscale transport phenomena, sustainability and materials processing are of particular interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be chosen based on their application for funds and acceptance of their submitted papers.  Priority will be given to students and under-represented minorities, followed by keynote speakers.  The participation of students will be useful for training graduate students and gaining meaningful research experience, particularly for under-represented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The papers presented at the conference will be available to the participants and will also be posted on the digital library of the International Center for Heat and Mass Transfer. Selected papers will be encouraged to submit to the Journal of Computational Thermal Sciences and other journals.</AbstractNarration>
