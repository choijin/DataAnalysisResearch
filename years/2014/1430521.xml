<AbstractNarration>1430521&lt;br/&gt;Cronin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will feature many world-renown invited speakers presenting cutting edge research on carbon nanotubes and related materials. The topics covered in this conference span a wide range including chemical separation techniques, materials science, and thermal and solar energy conversion. Many of the topics covered in this conference will address the key research challenges facing the community at large, such as inhomogeneity of carbon synthesis, toxicity, and utilization of carbon nanotubes in large integrated circuits. Student participation is an important component of this conference series, and it is expected that all students will present their own research in the poster sessions during the event. We recognize that this inclusion is important in developing the next generation of innovators, and hence, continued growth of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, Prof. Stephen Cronin won a bid to host the Fifteenth International Conference on the Science and Application of Nanotubes (www.NT14.org ) at the University of Southern California in June 2014. Based on the recommendations of the NT advisory board, we made a tight budget that offered low registration fees for attendees, especially students. While the conference registration fees are expected to cover the basic cost of the venue associated with the conference, funds are requested from the National Science Foundation to subsidize the registration costs for student attendees. These funds will be used for US student support only and no international travel. As a partial sponsor of this conference, we will display the National Science Foundation logo in our list of partners on the NT14 website and in the program abstract book. This is a great opportunity for the National Science Foundation to make a strong impression on this international scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
