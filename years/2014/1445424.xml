<AbstractNarration>Recent trends in computing have prompted users and organizations to store an increasingly large amount of sensitive data at third party locations in the cloud outside of their direct control. In order to protect this data, it needs to be encrypted. However, traditional encryption systems lack the expressiveness needed for most applications involving big and complex data. The continued adoption and deployment of cloud computing hinges crucially on the ability to provide cryptographic  measures that protect the privacy of our data, and new encryption schemes have the potential to affect how successful this computing paradigm will be. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functional encryption is an emerging paradigm for public-key encryption that enables more fine-grained access control to encrypted data. Functional encryption provides the ability to specify a decryption policy in the ciphertext  so that only individuals who satisfy the policy can decrypt, or the ability to associate keywords to a secret key so that it can only decrypt documents containing the keyword. This project investigates methods  to obtain more efficient pairings-based functional encryption, and methods to realize new functionalities and more expressive functional encryption schemes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work addresses cryptographic challenges arising in contexts where simple public key encryption is not sufficient, and more fine-grained access control to encrypted data is required. A major emergingcryptographic tools for such applications is functional encryption.  Functional encryption allows to encrypt data with a single public key,in a way that enables different parties to obtain different functions of the data, depending on the type of access-control granted to them via aspecialized secret key.  Several of our major research outcomes revolved around bringing functional encryption and related cryptographic tools closer topractice via efficiency optimized constructions, new frameworks and algorithms for stronger and more expressive primitives, and security analysis and improvement.  In addition to functional encryption, we have studied the related (andi n some cases equivalent) primitive of program obfuscation, allowing to provide a program which delivers the desired functionality, without revealing its internal secrets and implementation. In another direction, we have worked on a key-exchange protocol which helped shape the development of the upcoming TLS 1.3 standard. Other cryptographic tools we have developed include broadcast encryption,attribute-based encryption, chosen-ciphertext secure and non-malleable encryption, fully homomorphic encryption, garbled circuits, and non-malleable codes.  These primitives are useful in many modern contexts, where an attacker has strong capabilities to query and tamper with secret information.  The techniques we employed and developed in our work bring together techniques from information theory, complexity theory, and mathematics (in particular, pairing-based and lattice-based cryptography).
