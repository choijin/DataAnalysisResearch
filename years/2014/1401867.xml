<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Kathleen C. Craig is "Analysis and Numerics of Evolutionary Partial Differential Equations." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Los Angeles, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andrea Bertozzi.</AbstractNarration>
