<AbstractNarration>Mental trauma following disasters, military service, accidents, domestic violence and other traumatic events is a health issue costing multiple billion of dollars per year. Beyond its direct costs, there are indirect costs including a 45-150% greater use of medical and psychiatric care. While web-based support systems have been developed these are effectively a "one-size-fits all" approach lacking the personalization of regular treatment and the engagement and effectiveness associated with a tailored regimen. This project brings together a multi-disciplinary team of leading researchers in trauma treatment, facial analysis, computer vision and machine learning to develop a scalable, adaptive person-centered approach that uses vision and sensing to improve web-based trauma treatment.  In particular, the effort measures specific personalized variables during treatment and then uses a model to adapt treatment to individuals in need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core treatment design builds on well-established social-cognitive theory, where self-efficacy and physiological response are critical elements of recovery. The project measures these as well as engagement that is critical in self-directed web-based treatment. The modeling requires advances in computer vision and facial analysis to develop individualized models that can be computed with just a standard laptop. This project is the first effort to approximate changes in self-efficacy from sensory data. The effort uses and advances machine learning and domain adaption to support this approximation as well as to support the rapid personalization of models.  Building a smart system that empowers individuals by combining sensing and learning to improve web-based treatment offers a transformative approach to this national health need for cost-effective evidence-based treatment of trauma.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project produced several key findings that are important for both theory development and intervention design for trauma web-based support and automated processing of video and physiological data during web-based support. The results have important theoretical implications related to the role of self-appraisals in human-computer interactions when dealing with psychological adaptation.  Phase I provided important findings related to the measurement of engagement (objective and subjective) in relation to web-intervention programs. Subjective engagement is a stronger predictor of psychological outcomes.   We developed algorithms for context-sensitive engagement prediction directly from video of the subject using the website. We published a paper showing that combining our engagement prediction with psychological measurements, we could predict the change in PTSD levels during treatment.   While many experiments strive to ensure high-inter-rater reliability, in our face-based analysis, we showed that by training to predict inter-rater variance, using that estimate during testing, improved prediction of user engagement. This showed that, at least for our problem, the lack of rater reliability is itself an important signal that can be predicted from the data and used to improve engagement prediction.   We also published a paper that showed that the My Trauma Recovery website demonstrated a significant reduction in distress over the time of the study (three weeks) and that changes in coping self-efficacy perceptions were predictive of improvements in posttraumatic distress.  This is the first study of its kind to utilize theoretically derived variables in understanding mechanisms of improvement from a trauma support web-intervention. We demonstrated the importance of self-appraisals of coping capability while working through the My Trauma Recovery website.     Due to Covid-19, we were not able to complete our in-person data collection for Phase II, which reduced the overall sample size for this segment of our work.  However, we are actively utilizing the AFAR system for facial expression analyses (from Co-P.I. Jeff Cohn) to generate critical emotion regulation outcome data for this phase of the project.  Once we can verify the reliability of the AFAR system with this population, we will begin to analyze data related to differential responses to the My Trauma Recovery website related to engagement and self-regulation.  We are also looking at a narrative analysis of the participant’s descriptions of their trauma during their last session using the website.  We will be able to evaluate differential responses to the site relative to an e-book version and control group.  Lastly, we included a self-efficacy enhancement condition in Phase II, which we will begin to evaluate to determine the value of this type of boost in terms of user engagement and psychological outcomes.  In summary, during the next several months, we will be actively analyzing Phase II data and writing up the results.      One significant broader impact of our research is the benefit to our participants through the utilization of our trauma recovery website.  A total of 247 trauma-exposed individuals have worked through our web-intervention system for trauma recovery.  These individuals received a supportive intervention that has documented a significant reduction in posttraumatic distress and improved coping capacity. Phase I of this project resulted in a publication on the effectiveness of the My Trauma Recovery website.  This adds to the enhanced wellbeing of trauma survivors more broadly in helping to solidify the value of this technology in reducing traumatic distress and increasing coping self-efficacy. This project also included a significant number of women graduate (8) and undergraduate (7) students from psychology and computer science.  Additionally, a subset of these women were individuals of color (one graduate and three undergraduate).  A Ph.D. male student of color was also supported by this project. Lastly, a post-doctoral fellow from Japan was part of the research team, and greatly expanded his machine-learning skill set, while helping our CS doctoral student gain better skills in psychology and human subject research.   Thus, a broader impact of this research project was the interaction of cross-disciplinary graduate students who are typically underrepresented, enhancing the training and exposure to CISE disciplines.  The cross-disciplinary nature of this project also enhanced the understanding of different perspectives and scientific cultures.
