<AbstractNarration>This research project will lead to understanding and control of the dynamics of quantum systems, including but not limited to electrons escaping from atoms, trapped atoms, ultracold gases, and molecules. Control of quantum systems -- electrons, atoms and molecules is one of the 'grand challenges' of modern physics. This research cuts across many disciplines in physics, mathematics and chemistry. Microscopic quantum systems can be understood and controlled by understanding and controlling the analogous macroscopic classical systems. New discoveries in classical mechanics can be used to show how to obtain similar control over quantum systems.  For example, the theory of chaotic transport was first introduced to study systems of three bodies interacting under gravity, and has more recently been used to design spacecraft trajectories, examine orbits of comets, study transport of meteors from Mars to the Earth, and learn about mixing in fluids.  It will be used to study escape of atoms from cavities, escape of electrons from highly excited atoms, and transport of atoms through nanojunctions.  These are systems which have only a few degrees of freedom, for which the interparticle forces are known and controllable, and on which precise measurements can be made. This research is also connected to technology. The mechanisms of escape of electrons from atoms is similar to the mechanisms of escape of electrons from nanojunctions ('designer atoms') and similar to the mechanisms of escape of photons from optical resonators.  In addition, highly excited states of atoms can be used as infrared detectors, and chaotic ionization processes have been used to make a streak camera. The field of nonlinear dynamics is excellent for introducing students to research. As soon as students learn elementary aspects of Newton's Laws, they can begin computing trajectories, and analyzing their structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new phenomenon in classical and quantum integrable systems called monodromy will be studied.  Also new phenomena associated with pumping ultracold atoms from one reservoir to another, 'Ballistic Atom Pumps', has been discovered and will be further explored.  Computations predicting future observations of the 'tennis-racket flip' in isolated molecules will be carried out.  Finally dynamical control theory will be applied to understand respiration in premature infants.   For example, it is believed that periodic apneas occur when time-delays in a control loop throw the system into oscillation; this theory will be compared with data provided by University of Virginia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       One of the "Grand Challenges" of modern physics is the control of systems at the atomic level.  The primary goal of our research is to understand and control quantum systems by understanding and controlling the corresponding classical systems.  We start with classical mechanics, and build quantum wave functions from classical trajectories with phases.  Another perspective on this research is the following. When quantum theory was developed, classical mechanics was thought to be "fully understood", and the quantum revolution was new. Today, however, there are major advances in classical mechanics:  nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory, the "butterfly effect", new understanding of periodic orbits, their bifurcation and proliferation and their organization into families, chaotic transport and fractals, and some recently uncovered phenomena called "Hamiltonian monodromy".        Our research group contributes to new discoveries in classical mechanics, and shows their manifestations in quantum mechanics:  how can they be observed in atomic, molecular and optical systems?  Construction of quantum wave-functions from classical trajectories provides an intuitive picture and a depth of insight that cannot be obtained in other ways.              During the period of this grant, two students completed PhDs, with published papers, Chen Chen and Daniel Salmon.  Chen had already published a long paper in 2014, and a second very original and unusual paper was published in 2018, Topological changes of wave functions associated with Hamiltonian monodromy,  Phys. Rev. E 97, 062216 (2018) .  It deals with new and surprising aspects of the connection between quantum mechanics and classical Newtonian mechanics.  Chen has entered a program to get a degree in Big Data analysis at Columbia University.              Grad students Perry Nerem and Dan Salmon completed an experimental project and published the results in Physical Review Letters (one of our most selective journals) 120, 134301 (2018)  Experimental Observation of Classical Dynamical Monodromy.   This deals with a topological change in the structure of a loop of particles as the particles move under forces having long-range attraction and short-range repulsion together with added torques around a center.  Dan?s thesis has sufficient material for another paper, not yet submitted; he is now employed at the University of Alaska in Anchorage.  Perry is expected to complete his PhD this year; he is already employed as an instructor at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA.        Travels to China led to two publications with scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan.  These deal with highly excited states of atoms and with ionization in electric and magnetic fields.  Wave-function visualization of core-induced interaction of a non-hydrogenic Rydberg atom in an electric field, Canadian Journal of Physics, 2016, 94: 671-678 and Photoionization microscopy for a hydrogen atom in parallel electric and magnetic fields Physical Review A 93 063411  2016.        In addition I submitted an invited chapter to the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Handbook edited by Gordon Drake.  This chapter deals with highly excited states of atoms in strong electric and magnetic fields.        Finally, work not supported by NSF has also been very productive, with five papers published on heart rates and respiration of infants in neonatal intensive care units.  A lifetime of NSF-supported study of dynamical systems has led in unexpected directions, to research that is expected to lead to better outcomes for these very vulnerable infants.
