<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the novel design and fabrication of a polymer-based composite for bone fixation applications.  The project will result in a prototype of a composite bone fixation device. This composite device has the following unique features: matching elastic modulus to bone, excellent toughness, and it is biocompatible and bioresorable. These devices would eliminate the problems associated with the commonly used metallic bone fixation devices in the market, such as stress shielding, release of metal ions and bone re-fracture after healing.  This project addresses the use of novel materials design and fabrication techniques to enhance the mechanical properties of the composite.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, a multi-disciplinary team has been formed with expertise in biomaterials, polymer and composite processing and characterization, technology transfer and commercialization. The project engages investigators from University to industry in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new composite material will greatly benefit patients who suffer from bone fractures and are in need of orthopedic surgeries. This is because the novel bone fixation devices, based on the new composite material, will directly address the poor mechanical properties of existing apatite/polymer composites and the stress-shielding and bone re-fracture problems of metallic bone-fixation devices, the current market solutions. In addition, the work will present a new processing approach for fabrication of bone-fixation materials and thus contribute to U.S. competitiveness in the bone fixation device market.</AbstractNarration>

The optimum composites have the elastic modulus and strength near those of natural bone, good toughness, excellent biocompatibility, and appropriate degradation rate to be used as low- to medium-load bone fixation devices.  In vitro degradation and biocompatibility studies have shown that the composites degrade safely and do not exhibit cytotoxic responses.  This project presented a new processing approach for fabrication of polymer-based, biodegradable bone-fixation materials. The resulting novel bone-fixation devices will directly address the poor mechanical properties of the current existing apatite/polymer composites as well as the stress-shielding, ion release and bone re-fracture problems of normally experienced by metallic bone-fixation devices.  To this end, a multi-disciplinary team has been formed with expertise in biomaterials, polymer and composite processing and characterization, technology transfer and commercialization.  The project engages investigators from both the university and the industry in this technology transition effort from research discovery to commercial reality.  Currently, a start-up company has shown great interest in licensing the technology and further developing the composites into commercial products.  This award has provided research opportunities to a number of graduate and undergraduate students working in the fields of prototyping composite preparation, polymer-based composite processing and characterization, FDA documentation, and in vitro degradation study and cell viability tests.
