<AbstractNarration>Computer simulations, satellites and various other technological advances have paved the way into unprecedented scientific territory by generating volumes of previously uncollectable datasets.  Properly utilizing these new data products to promote scientific discovery requires that they, first, be (i) validated and (ii) paired with an appropriate measure of uncertainty.  Validating a data product entails comparing "synthetic" data (e.g., computer model simulations, remote sensing measurements, or statistical predictions) with observational counterparts to substantiate the digital data for its use in scientific discovery.  Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a necessary component to validation and entails accounting for and stating the uncertainties associated with scientific conclusions derived from digital or observational data.  The purpose of this research is to promote scientific discovery using digital data products by developing statistical methods to perform validation and uncertainty quantification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the strong need to perform, and the substantial challenges facing, statistical validation and UQ, this research will (i) develop new validation strategies for simulated and digital datasets based on scientifically motivated features; (ii) develop multivariate spatio-temporal statistical models that can be used to implement, and perform UQ for spatio-temporal data products; and, (iii) develop scalable computation techniques for fitting the developed spatio-temporal statistical models.  This research will implement these techniques on data products in atmospheric, agricultural and environmental sciences to facilitate their use in scientific inquiry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the digital era, scientific data are often collected digitally rather than physically.  For example, computer simulations and remote sensing instruments (e.g. satellites) are frequently used to observe natural phenomena at a fraction of the cost of physical measurements taken by on-site researchers.  This digital method of data collection has had a tremendous impact in the environmental and atmospheric sciences where, for example, such data are collected over large spatio-temporal regions (oftentimes covering the entire globe).  The use of digital data for scientific discovery, however, has two core issues: validation and uncertainty quantification.  Generally, validation entails comparing the "digital" data (e.g. computer model simulations, remote sensing measurements or statistical predictions) with observational counterparts to substantiate the digital data for its use in scientific discovery. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) entails accounting for and stating the uncertainties associated with scientific conclusions derived from such digital data.  This project developed novel statistical techniques to validate and quantify the uncertainty associated with digital data and, subsequently, utilized the digital data for scientific inquiry.  The scientific outcomes of this project included the development of various novel statistical strategies that were used to validate digital data across many scientific disciplines.  For example, in agriculture, this project validated remotely sensed measurements of ground water and, subsequently, used these measurements to identify key watering times and strategies to maximize crop yield while minimizing water use.  Or, in the atmospheric sciences, this project developed techniques to adjust satellite and computer simulations of temperature to be more in accordance with physical measurements and used these adjusted data products to assess the impact of extreme temperatures on public health outcomes.   Broader (i.e. beyond scientific) outcomes of this project included new scientific insights for a better society and student development experiences.  First, results of the scientific work of this project (i) provided farmers with strategies to more efficiently use water, (ii) identified socio-economic groups susceptible to extreme environmental conditions and (iii) identified roadway features that are associated with a high risk of crashes.  Second, this project provided authentic data analysis experiences for 6 master?s students and 1 undergraduate student.  Each of these students were provided with authentic digital datasets that they had to first, validate and, second, use for scientific inquiry.  Such hands-on experiences allowed students to develop necessary data analysis skills that could not otherwise be developed in a typical university classroom setting.  Additionally, 4 of these students were provided with opportunities to travel to professional meetings and present the results of their research.  Three of the students involved in the project were women so as to give equal opportunity to women.          Last Modified: 08/08/2018       Submitted by: Matthew J Heaton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
