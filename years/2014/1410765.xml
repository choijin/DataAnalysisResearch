<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: Gallium nitride is an important semiconductor due to its wide ranging applications in solid-state lighting and power electronics. Pennsylvania State University and Efficient Power Conversion (EPC) Corporation are partnering in this GOALI project to develop materials growth technology to integrate gallium nitride thin films with silicon wafers, which are the standard substrates used for integrated circuit fabrication. The ability to directly combine these two materials would allow flexibility in circuit design for a variety of applications. However, the hexagonal crystal structure of gallium nitride is incompatible with the cubic crystal structure of (100) silicon. This project seeks to overcome these limitations by intentionally introducing strain into the silicon to alter the surface structure and thereby reduce the crystal mismatch. Real-time wafer curvature measurements are used to directly measure strain in the silicon substrate and study dynamic changes in film stress during gallium nitride deposition. Post-growth structural characterization is used to elucidate mechanisms of stress generation and relaxation. The project supports the Ph.D. thesis work of two graduate students at Penn State University who are exposed to issues relevant to process scale-up and manufacturing in a global semiconductor foundry through the collaboration with EPC. Undergraduates and high-school students from underrepresented groups and economically challenged regions of Pennsylvania are participating in the research through summer programs at Penn State University. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This GOALI project is on the epitaxial growth of AlGaN/GaN heterostructures on on-axis (100) Si substrates for hybrid power electronics circuits. Strained Si/SiGe virtual substrates are being explored as a route to control the dominant reconstruction of the (100) Si surface and thereby reduce the in-plane rotational misalignment of AlN nuclei. In-situ wafer curvature measurements are used to monitor stress relaxation in the SiGe layers and measure tensile strain in the Si layer at the growth temperature and study its impact on GaN/AlN heteroepitaxy. The effects of n-type dopant chemistry on stress evolution in GaN are also being examined. The project seeks a fundamental understanding of the role of Si surface strain on GaN/AlN epitaxy, which can then be exploited to develop AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas heterostructures on (100) Si for power devices. The project team has complementary expertise in group III-nitride heteroepitaxy on Si substrates (Penn State University) and process scale-up and commercialization of GaN-on-Si for power field-effect transistors (EPC).  In addition, EPC is well positioned to capitalize on hybrid circuit designs that will be enabled by the GaN on (100) Si growth technology developed in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  Penn State and Efficient Power Conversion (EPC) Corporation partnered in this GOALI project to develop routes for direct integration of group III-nitride materials on CMOS-compatible (100) silicon (Si) substrates. Silicon is a desirable low cost, large area substrate for (0001) gallium nitride (GaN)-based devices, however, (111) oriented Si substrates are required for crystallographic compatibility.  In contrast, processing and fabrication technologies for Si-based integrated circuits are optimized for the (100) orientation of Si.  This project was aimed at developing a strategy to modify the (100) Si surface using either strain or template layers to enable epitaxial growth of group III-nitride heterostructures.  Strained Si/SiGe epilayers were investigated as one approach using wafer curvature measurements to measure changes in  film stress during growth. Tensile strained Si/SiGe epilayers were found to be an effective approach to improve the structural properties of GaN grown on (111) Si but did not provide a benefit for growth on (100) Si.  An alternative method involving the use of thin (111) Si template layers was then investigated which enabled the growth of textured (0001) GaN films on oxidized (100) Si with large single crystal regions.  The results provide a promising approach for patterned growth of group III-nitrides microstructures on (100) Si as well as on other amorphous or polycrystalline substrates.  Intellectual Merit: The research employed real time wafer curvature measurements in combination with post-growth structural characterization to study stress generation and relaxation in Si/SiGe and group III-nitride epilayers which is a critical issue for device fabrication.  Using this approach, the change in film stress during growth of SiGe epilayers and Si/SiGe heterostructures on (100) and (111) Si substrates was measured in real time as a function of composition and the results compared favorably with post-growth measurements.  The strained Si/SiGe epilayers were then used as virtual substrates for growth of GaN.  A reduction in tensile stress and defect density was measured in GaN films grown on strained (111) Si/SiGe compared to growth on unstrained (111) Si substrates but no difference was observed for (100) Si.  An alternative method was then investigated which involved the fabrication of thin (111) textured Si template layers on oxidized (100) Si substrates using aluminum-induced crystallization (AIC). GaN films grown on the textured (111) Si layers were comprised of single crystal grains tens of microns in size that mimicked the grain structure of the (111) Si template layer.  Similar results were obtained for GaN growth on fused quartz and polycrystalline diamond substrates demonstrating the versatility of the AIC Si template layer approach.   Broader Impacts: The results of this research provide a promising method for the growth of GaN microstructures on non-single crystal substrates which may impact device applications including GaN-based microLED arrays and AlGaN/GaN high frequency devices integrated with CMOS-compatible (100) Si.  In addition, the project provided full or partial financial support for 3 graduate students (1 female/1 underrepresented minority) at Penn State. Four undergraduate students participated in the research and three high school students received hands-on training as part of the Penn State Upward Bound Math and Science program.
