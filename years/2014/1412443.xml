<AbstractNarration>Nitriles are used extensively in the production of specialty chemicals like the polyamide nylon.  Nitrile hydratases (NHases) catalyze the hydration of nitriles to amides at ambient temperatures in neutral water.  The currently employed industrial conditions for the hydration of nitriles to amides use either strong acids or bases, and are often incompatible with the sensitive structures of the compounds to be produced. NHases have therefore attracted substantial interest as biocatalysts in preparative organic chemistry.  Despite the industrial importance of NHase enzymes, the details of how they work remain poorly understood.  The objective of this research proposal is to fill this knowledge gap.  The interdisciplinary nature of the effort will serve as a platform to increase the participation of women and classically underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students in scientific careers in biophysics, chemistry, and biochemistry.  As part of the proposed project, both PI's will participate in the SMART program that mentors Milwaukee area public high school students in research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Drs. Richard C. Holz and Brian Bennett from Marquette University to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of NHase enzymes.  An interdisciplinary approach will be used that will incorporate kinetics, spectroscopy, biochemistry, computational chemistry, and both X-ray and neutron crystallography.  The proposed experimental approach is designed to address three key questions:  i) What is the transition-state structure of nitrile hydration?  ii) What are the protonation states of catalytically important species throughout the reaction? and iii) What controls metallocenter assembly in a purported eukaryotic NHase?  The successful completion of this research will greatly benefit society by facilitating the intelligent design and manufacture of nitrile-based chiral pharmaceuticals and industrially important specialty chemicals, with enhanced synthetic flexibility and lower environmental impact, than at present.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The overall goals of this research is to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of nitrile hydratases (NHases, EC 4.2.1.84).  To this end, we have assigned each of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals observed for the the Fe-type NHases from Rhodococcus equi TG328-2 (ReNHase).  Methods were developed to obtain ReNHase as a homogenous preparation in each of the EPR-detectable states, a prerequisite for utilizing advanced EPR methods to gain insight into catalytic intermediates.  The g-tensors were reproduced to unprecedentedly high precision, confirming the assignments, using a newly developed computational approach that combines density functional and ligand-field theories.  Completely new EPR signals were observed upon the addition of the transition-state inhibitors, boronic acids, and the distinctive g1 features of these signals were recapitulated in the steady-state with the slow substrate, acetonitrile.  This latter signal constitutes the first EPR signal from a catalytic intermediate of an NHase and directly indicates binding of substrate to Fe(III) active site.  We also provided the first evidence that an Fe-type NHase activator protein exhibits GTPase activity and the first evidence for a functional eukaryotic NHase.  Thus, the collaborative approach provided a solid foundation upon which to interrogate the proposed catalytic mechanism and provide insight into metallocenter assembly of Fe-type NHases.  A better understanding of the structure and reaction mechanism of NHases, together with advances in protein screening and genetic engineering, will facilitate the exploitation of natural and synthetic biomimetic nitrile-hydrating catalysts with broader substrate ranges, higher activities and higher biocatalyst stabilities, further enhancing the future biotechnological application of these versatile biocatalysts.  Over the duration of this collaborative project, two postdoctoral associates [Misty Kuhn (RCH), Natalia Stein (BB)], five graduate students [Natalie Gumataotao, Salette Martinez, Irene Ogotu, Wasantha Lankathilaka, (RCH), Xinhang Xang (RCH)], seven undergraduate students [Ryan Howell (BB), Alex Garces (BB), Veronika Opalka (RCH), Natalia Hajnas (RCH), Karoline Krzywda (RCH), Derek Thayer (RCH), and Matthew Kujawa (RCH)], and four high school students (Hailee Chan, Imran Khan, Jessica DelMonaco, and Sarvottam Salvi (RCH)) participated in the project.  These students hail from the US, UK, Ghana, Sri Lanka, Russia, China, the Philippines, and Guam.  One identifies as Hispanic, another as Pacific Islander, and one sub-saharan African.  Therefore, project participants are gender (10 women and 8 men) and culturally diverse.   Five journal articles were published during the granting period and on Ph.D dissertation.  Work from this project was also presented at 10 conferences by the PI?s and students working on the project, two of which were oral presentations while the remaining were poster presentations.
