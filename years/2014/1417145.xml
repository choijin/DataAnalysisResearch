<AbstractNarration>Many of the chemicals that move within fluid undergo reactions.  Often the reactions convert toxic compounds into harmless by-products. An example is the cleanup of gasoline that has leaked into a groundwater aquifer.  It is very difficult, using current models, to predict the duration or rate of the reactions, primarily because of poor mixing of the reactants. This defines a significant theoretical and practical problem, because most current models of reactive transport in hydrologic systems are based on empirical adjustments to classical laws, which are built upon the flawed well-mixed assumption. In order to make reliable predictions in such systems, novel and improved methods are critical for the scientists and engineers, and ultimately decision makers, stakeholders, and policy developers working in fields such environmental contamination and remediation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the problem of mixing-limited reaction goes far beyond the hydrologic examples that motivated this proposal. Recent studies show that mixing-limited reactions play a dominant role in Earth-bound systems across a huge range of scales, including reactions in the atmosphere (e.g., ozone creation), in drinking-water aquifers (e.g., remediation of contaminants), in geologic basins (e.g., petroleum generation), and in magmas, hydrothermal areas, and ore bodies.  This project will have application to many fields, including climate-change related atmospheric reactions, ecologic, and micro-biochemical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators have developed new computer models that demonstrate the need for new paradigms of simulating reactions in imperfectly-mixed systems.  First, the project will apply the theoretical approach of "time subordination" that accounts for random particle migration time to active reaction sites.  Subordination has been successfully applied to simple systems, but it remains to be proven that it can be extended to more complicated reactions, geometries, and flow patterns.  Second, the project will develop a random continuum method that tracks the growth of concentration disturbances. These disturbances include low concentration zones that are the key to slower reaction rates. Third, the project will build on the new computer models, shown to be correct, for the purpose of benchmarking theoretical results and facilitating large-scale reactive simulations.  All approaches will be unified through detailed mathematical analysis and application to well-studied laboratory and field experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most chemical reactions that we think about happen in a laboratory---in a beaker full of rapidly-spinning liquids.  Under these conditions, it is usually easy to measure the rates of reactions.  In the real world---for example within groundwater aquifers beneath our feet---the reacting liquids are not as well mixed, and the reactions happen at much slower, and harder-to-predict rates.  It is important to figure out how much the poor mixing hampers the reaction rates when, for example, we try to predict the cleanup of contamination by placing beneficial reactants in the ground.    This project aimed to make the poorly-mixed reactions predictable again, by using an entirely different mathematical technique.  We used particles in computer simulations to represent reactants, and calculated the probabilities of particle/particle collisions, hence the probability of reaction.  It turns out that our method, based on the underlying physics of mixing and reactions, does not correspond to the classical equations that people have used for decades to model transport and reaction (the so-called Advection-Dispersion-Reaction-Equation (ADRE).  The ADRE represents mixing and spreading with only one parameter, called the dispersion coefficient.  Our model separately performs mixing and spreading, so it is more accurate and easy to use.  The mathematical underpinnings are somewhat complicated, and they were laid out in a series of articles researched and written by an applied mathematics PhD student. Another hydrology PhD student was able to apply the method to a series of experiments, starting from the laboratory scale up to a detailed experiment previously conducted at the Schoolcraft aquifer bioremediation experiment in Michigan. Our model was able to match the experiments without "fudging" or adjusting the reaction rates.  We continue to add more complexity to the model.  Recently we added the interaction of fluid and solid reactants, which allowed us to simulate processes such as acid mine-drainage and the changes to rock chemistry that may accompany CO2 sequestration in carbonate aquifers.  All in all, we've made simulation of chemical reactions in moving fluid systems more accurate, often much faster, and predictive when using data measured from a huge range of scales in time and space.
