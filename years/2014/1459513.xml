<AbstractNarration>In this project, investigators participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will measure neodymium isotopes and rare earth elements in seawater, sediment, and particulates collected from the western Arctic Ocean. In common with other national initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. Neodymium and rare earth elements are oceanographic tracers, and data from this research will provide benchmarks for other trace element and isotope studies to better understand their cycles and how future environmental changes will impact this important ocean basin. The project will support the training of undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers, and results will be disseminated via public outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neodymium (Nd) isotopes are tracers of water mass sources, transport and mixing, and rare earth elements (REEs) show systematic fractionations during environmental processes. Together they provide a powerful tool for analyzing provenances and processes in the oceans that reflect the changing environmental controls on the distribution of trace elements and their isotopes (TEIs). Inherent logistical difficulties make the Arctic Ocean especially scarce in TEI data (including Nd isotopes and REE concentrations), which hinders understanding and application of these tracers. In this study, researchers will examine Nd and REE concentrations in seawater, sediment, and particulate samples collected in the western Arctic Ocean, with the aim of (1) assessing Arctic circulation and water mass mixing in light of Nd isotopes and REEs; (2) attempting to quantify particle-dissolved exchanges of TEIs and; (3) using Nd isotopes and REEs to characterize the sources, sinks and exchanges of TEIs. It is expected that through improved understanding of the Nd isotope and REEs tracers, scientists will be able to relate these findings to other TEIs and to the broader understanding of Arctic oceanographic change in the past, present, and future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we measured the rare earth elements (REEs) and neodymium (Nd) isotopes in a return transect from the Bering Strait to the North Pole and back. This effort was part of a larger international GEOTRACES effort to map the distributions of such trace elements and isotopes in the global oceans.  In conjunction with the other data collected in this and other GEOTRACES cruises, these REE and Nd isotope data will be used to understand the processes that control trace element distributions in the oceans, to better constrain the deep circulation of this region and to use this information collectively to better understand the oceanography and environment of the Arctic.   The Arctic is a unique and paradoxically fragile environment: the ecology, peoples and culture of the Arctic have evolved in a balance with strong seasonality and patterns of oceanography/climate that are particularly prone to change from external forcing.  Our data will be used to try and develop a better model of where the likely points of failure are in this system that may result from human or natural pressure.  The link between REE and Nd isotope data and such a goal may seem tenuous but are in fact rather straightforward.  For example, Nd isotopes appear to be good tracers of ocean circulation, which is key to understanding the interplay between the Pacific and Atlantic waters that meet in the Arctic, or how deep basin water may or may not become corrosive or hypoxic.  The REEs, likewise have links to the biology and chemistry of sinking particles and/or benthic sources which can be associated with sea ice dynamics, biologic productivity and water oxygenation.  Thus, while the data that we have generated seem rather esoteric in nature they are very useful tools in understanding broader environmental processes in the Arctic.   Our efforts in this project are multi-institutional, nested in the greater multi-national efforts to generate a global database of these elements and isotopes.  As such, the data is rich with intricacies and nuance - both internal to the Arctic sections, but more so through comparison with other ocean basin data.   The complexity of the science increases as the databases grow, but this is the path towards a more holistic understanding of the processes governing marine biogeochemistry.  The Arctic data collected in this project will continue to move us towards this ultimate goal.  This project has supported research science at Oregon State University, including a lab technician and undergraduate assistants.  This project helped to continue the strong inter-institutional collaborations - both nationally and internationally - that foster scientific and cultural understanding and cooperation.  The project also helped to support the US sea-going science venture, which makes manifest the sense of exploration and curiosity characteristic of US science.
