<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the estimated 8 million people in the US with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The population of PAD is increasing due to the aging population, high prevalence of obesity and diabetes, and improved diagnosis of the disease. Patients with PAD suffer from pain, ischemia, and infection in their lower limbs, and cost the healthcare system an estimated $6000 in direct spending per patient annually. The current and emerging technologies to treat PAD are ineffective in patients with long, diffuse lesions, calcified plaques, or patients with kidney disease. Further, the standard practice of using cytostatic agents and antiplatelet drugs adds additional risk to the patient and cost to the healthcare system. There is therefore great need to develop new, effective, and safe therapies for use in vascular interventions, including balloon angioplasty, stenting, or atherectomy. New therapies should be robust enough to be effective in a wide range of interventions and patient populations and address the specific injury that is caused to the vessel during the intervention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project examines the therapeutic use of a new material in vascular interventions with robust application and that specifically targets the initiating injury. This new material is delivered to the vessel wall at the site of injury, where it binds and prevents the cascading inflammatory response that leads to scarring of the vessel. Additionally, the new therapeutic is expected to promote re-endothelialization of the vessel wall, so that the injury site is rapidly healed. This proposal will examine how the therapeutic is delivered to the vessel wall following injury, how long it remains on the vessel wall, and if it can promote the vessel healing so that the neo-intimal hyperplasia does not form. A rabbit animal will be used, and balloon angioplasty will be performed, followed by delivery of the new therapeutic. Visualization of the therapeutic, platelets, and endothelial cells will take place from 2 hours to 7 days to determine the interaction of the components during the healing process. It is expected that the therapeutic will remain at the site of injury and prevent undesirable platelet binding until healing of the vessel occurs through re-endothelialization. By protecting the injured site, it can be demonstrated that vessel scarring is prevented.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Balloon angioplasty is a procedure used to open up blood vessels that have become blocked, which limits blood flow to certain parts of your body.  While angioplasty opens up the blockage, it also has the unintended consequence of causing an injury to the wall of the blood vessel.  This injury can result in scarring inside of the blood vessel, which can cause a blockage.  Thus, while balloon angioplasty and other endovascular procedures open up the blood vessel following the procedure, the results can be short-lived, with procedural damage resulting in the need for a repeat procedure.   The injury that occurs in all endovascular procedures includes damage to the fragile endothelial lining of blood vessels.  This damage exposes underlying collagen in the vessel wall.  Platelets in the blood are well adapted to bind to collagen, where they become activated and release or upregulate numerous vasoactive agents and factors that induce coagulation and inflammation.  The body has evolved these responses as an effective means for controlling blood loss and fighting infection following injury; however, this same collagen initiated coagulation and inflammatory response occurring inside of the blood vessel is the initial steps in the pathways that result in thrombosis and neointimal hyperplasia, or scarring inside of the blood vessel.    Symic is developing a novel treatment that can be used in all endovascular procedures that addresses the injury that occurs at the vessel wall.  RLB (Resorbable Luminal Barrier) is a bioinspired molecular coating that is delivered locally to the site of injury in the vessel at the time of intervention.  The RLB compound binds to areas of damage and provides a local barrier to platelet binding at the vessel wall.   This barrier then stops the pathways that cause the internal scarring and re-blockage of the vessel.   The NSF funded studies tested a rabbit model following balloon angioplasty.  Immediately following a balloon angioplasty procedure, the RLB solution was flushed locally at the site of angioplasty.  After 1 hour, the vessels that were treated with RLB had approximately 50% fewer platelets bound to the vessel wall compared to untreated vessels.  After 28 days, vessels treated with RLB had 33% less scar formation than those that received no treatment.  This preclinical data indicates that RLB can inhibit scarring following vascular interventions and reduce re-blockage of the blood vessel.   Through the NSF work, Symic also developed new compounds that in the future could potentially have more efficacy than RLB, by binding more strongly to collagen and further inhibiting the local platelet response.   The results generated from the NSF funded work indicate that RLB can bind to the sites of vascular injury and inhibit platelet binding to the injured site.  This results in less scarring of the vessel.  Symic plans to continue developing RLB for use in endovascular procedures to result in long term patent vessels.
