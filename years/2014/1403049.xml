<AbstractNarration>PI: Kumar, Sanat / Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1403049 / 1402166 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University / Princeton University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Void Symmetries to Control the Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) into colloidal crystals is a promising way to obtain ordered nanocomposite materials with unique properties determined by the choice of the constituent NPs. If successful, this novel approach will have a significant impact on the ability of experimentalists to rationally design ordered colloidal crystals for a wide range of optical and catalytic applications, such as photonic crystals, optical switches and filters, and catalytic devices. The PIs have shown a novel way to selectively stabilize one crystal structure over another possible one by the use of polymers that can intercalate between the NPS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, the PIs have made an interesting discovery that, even when the energy, pressure, and packing fraction for two isomorphs, e.g., HCP and FCC, are the same, the distribution of voids within the crystals are different. By filling the voids with polymers of different length, they were able to show that one can selectively stabilize HCP over FCC crystals. Based on these findings, they propose to make use of this novel insight about void symmetries and size-distributions to select a desired polymorph from a suite of competing crystal structure. In this proposal, they propose to investigate what design principles are needed to achieve their goal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The novelty of the work we proposed was to critically exploit the void size distributions in colloidal crystals by using polymer chains of appropriate architecture and length to achieve two long-outstanding goals in soft matter engineering:  (i)  Crystal Structures: We stabilizes a desired crystal morphology from a suite of competing structures which have very similar free energies (e.g., face centered cubic versus body centered cubic; diamond versus tetrastack hard sphere morphologies), by using the fact that the polymer entropy is maximized strongly in one of morphologies. We predicted the design criteria, in terms of polymer chain length, topology, energetics and stiffness, and how they can be tailored to selectively stabilize any one of these competing morphologies.   (ii) Liquid-liquid coexistence: For systems at lower overall densities, the crystal phase is destabilized. Here we use the fact that long chains lose entropy when they are entrapped in a crystal to destabilize it in favor of self-assembled nanoparticle structures (such as fractal aggregates) and also well-dispersed systems. These ideas do not apply in the case of short chains, where we find that the crystal is likely only unstable relative to the dilute phase.   Broader Impacts: The key idea underlying our proposed work was a simple concept void size distributions in colloid crystals play a central role in determining the thermodynamics of polymer/nanoparticle mixtures.
