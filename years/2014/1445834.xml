<AbstractNarration>In terrestrial communities, grazer-facilitation of fungal disease in plants has been studied for over a century. Despite the prevalence of this interaction in terrestrial systems, it was not considered relevant to the structure of marine plant communities until the investigator's recent work in salt marshes. By manipulating both grazer and fungal presence, he demonstrated that snail grazing and subsequent fungal infection in live grass led to drastic reductions in plant growth and, at high grazer densities, destruction of canopy. If grazer promotion of fungal disease in marine plants is not limited to marshes (as suggested by preliminary data from a world-wide survey of 4 marine plant ecosystems) then small grazers that take small bites out of plants could be exerting similarly strong, but undetected control over marine plants globally. In addition, since physical stress commonly reduces plant immune responses, intensifying multiple stressors associated with marine global change could intensify and destabilize these unstudied grazer-disease-plant interactions. To test the global generality of this potentially keystone ecological interaction, this project will answer the following questions with a combination of multi-site surveys and manipulations across 4 ecosystems spanning 2 continents: 1) Is grazer facilitation of fungal disease in marine plants a common but overlooked interaction? 2) What is the resultant impact of grazer-facilitated fungal infection on marine plant growth? 3) How do multiple stressors impact the strength of grazer facilitation of fungal disease in marine plants? The work represents a transformative step forward in our understanding of plant-grazer interactions in marine ecosystems as it fills a &gt; 100-year intellectual gap in our understanding of top-down control in marine plant ecosystems: Do small grazers commonly facilitate fungal disease in marine plants and does this interaction suppress plant growth?&lt;br/&gt;Evidence for this cryptic, yet powerful mechanism of grazer regulation of marine plants will compel marine ecologists to reevaluate our understanding of top-down control and lead to widespread integration of disease dynamics in marine food web ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The consequences of marine plant ecosystem health are far-reaching for humans, since these communities provide many essential services. Results from this study will allow managers to better predict effects of disease and global change on marine plant systems and formulate effective strategies for conservation. To help integrate plant disease dynamics into marine ecology and conservation, the investigator will: (1) produce an edited volume on Food Webs and Disease in Marine Ecosystems and (2) work closely with The Nature Conservancy to incorporate findings into their global marine learning exchanges. In addition, an integrated educational plan will increase student: (1) understanding of disease and food web dynamics in marine ecosystems and (2) consideration of marine science careers. This goal will be accomplished through class development and early student exposure to field-based learning and independent research. Over the past 3 years, the investigator has organized a successful undergraduate marine field course at UF. He will enhance its curriculum by incorporating new lectures and laboratories based on food web disease-plant interactions. He will expand this integrated educational effort to high school students by engaging students that are excelling (boy scouts) and at-risk (low grades, attendance) in hands-on, field science and potential career opportunities through: 1) a two-week field class with integrated web support, 2) mentored summer research on marine plant disease and 3) presentation of results at the Marine Symposium initiated at UF in 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project was provided by the Biological Oceanography Program, Ocean Science Education Program, and Office of International Science and Engineering Americas Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[            From a research perspective, the goals of this project were to answer the following three questions through experiments and comparative studies:   1)  Is grazer facilitation of fungal disease in marine plants a common but overlooked interaction?  2)  What is the resultant impact of grazer-facilitated fungal infection on marine plant growth  3)  How do multiple stressors (i.e., warming, drought, eutrophication) impact the strength of grazer facilitation of fungal disease in marine plants?             For outreach, my goals were to generate a field course that involves high school students, work with The Nature Conservancy to incorproate my results into conservation plans, and integrate plant-grazer-disease interactions into my marine lectures and two edited books for graduate-level education.           Over the past 5 years, I have been very succesful in accompishing all of the goals set out in this proposal.   We found that mesograzers commonly faciliate microbial infection in marine foundation species across a diverse suite of ecosystems (seagrasses, salt marshes, corals, mangroves, kelps and macroalgae), that this infection suppresses plant growth, and that commonly occuring stressors in the marine system increase, and do not dampen this interaciton. This leads to increasing physical stress resulting in increased infection and decreased growth in marine foundation species when grazers are present.   This pattern was consistent in both North and South America, where we work in almost all of the above mentioned ecosystems  We published over 30 peer-reviewed articles as a result of funding from this grant. This includes 4 in Proeedings of the National Academy of Science, 1 in Science, 2 in Ecology Letters, and over 10 in outstanding marine based journals.   Our work has been featured in Science, The Washington Post, The NYTIMES, The Boston Globe, Regional newspapers such as the Charlotte Observer, and online on Science Daily, Nature Climate Change, and on the radio on local and national NPR stations, and on the BBC.   In addition, I co-edited 3 graduate level text books with support from this grant. One of those books, Marine Community Ecology and Conservation, is the leading gradaute level text book in marine ecology in the world.   Seven graduates students were trained and in part supported on this grant, as well as 10 undegraduate students and 3 post doctoral scholars. One of those graduate students and 3 post-doctoral scholars have matricluated into faculty positions. 14 of the papers published had students as lead author, and 4 of those were undegraduates. 28 of the papaers had students as co-authors.  Work produced as a result of funding from this grant has changed they way we think about disease in marine systems. It has shown that marco food webs in large way control microbial communities that attack foundation plants and that conserving predators can protect plants from disease. This overturns the idea that microbial diseases are mostly controlled from the bottom-up. I have also shown the positive interactions like these and many others will greatly increase efficiency in conservation and restoraion.         Most applicable to immediate human needs, this project funded work that helped determine the causes of die-off in seagrasses and salt marshes, economically important ecosystems to humans. In addition, work produced with funds from this grant helped decipher the impacts of the deepwater horizon oil spill on gulf coast salt marsh ecosystems.
