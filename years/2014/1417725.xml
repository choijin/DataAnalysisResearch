<AbstractNarration>The conference "Growth in Groups" will take place in the conference center Le Louverain, which is located in the vicinity of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, during the period June 24-27, 2014. Growth in groups has been a fascinating and successful subject connecting algebra, geometry, analysis and combinatorics to give some groundbreaking and profound results, such as the celebrated theorem of Gromov on groups of polynomial growth or the existence of groups of intermediate growth by Grigorchuck. This conference will provide an overview of recent results in the area through the research talks given by the invited speakers. It will also contain two mini-courses for PhD students and post-docs. The topics of the conference include: standard growth in groups and graphs, growth rates, growth in Coxeter groups, conjugacy growth, uniform growth, geodesic growth, subgroup growth, growth and amenability, growth and 2-Betti numbers, formal languages and growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through its nature, the conference seeks the interaction between senior and junior mathematicians. The conference will take place in an isolated, relatively small, but well organized conference center, a location which should be very conductive to discussions and research. The mixture of  world-class scientists presenting their work together with the mini-courses for young scientists will provide an introduction to this field in a friendly and accessible manner.  The conference is designed to be a great opportunity for networking and training for junior mathematicians. Funds will be used mainly to cover the travel and hosting costs for young participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details for the conference can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/neuchatel2014/</AbstractNarration>
