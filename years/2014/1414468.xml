<AbstractNarration>Biopolymers (such as DNA molecules, actin filaments and microtubules) and biomembranes (made of lipids, proteins, and cholesterols) are the most important building blocks of living cells. In recent years much momentum has been built up in the theoretical simulations of biopolymers and biomembranes. Since such simulations take very long computational time, an efficient algorithm is needed (use fast algorithm for generating matrices or better model to reduce the cost). This project will include the development and implementation of state-of-the-art fast numerical algorithms for hydrodynamic interactions, and will be of benefit to scientists and engineers studying DNA dynamics as well as emerging applications of biomimetic membranes. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ming-Chih Lai, a noted expert on simulating fluid-structure interactions, at National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In biologically relevant problems the non-local hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) of macromolecules in water are essential to the underlying physics for their dynamics. This project will develop an efficient coarse-grained numerical algorithm with a fast multiple method for HIs between biomembranes and solvents. In previous work it has been demonstrated that this scheme is fast and convergent for capturing Brownian dynamics (BD) of a biopolymer under flow. Based on these results the main focus of this project is to construct such a coarse-grained scheme to simulate the biologically complicated membranes with cholesterols and proteins interacting with different species of lipids. This project will investigate numerical schemes to efficiently calculate the HIs in coarse-grained BD modeling. By comparing with the continuum modeling, results from this investigation will lead to validation and refinement of the proposed numerical schemes. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with National Science Council of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>

To save computational time for a meso-scale system (of micron size) over a duration longer than microseconds, one alternative is the coarse-grained (CG) MD or Brownian Dynamics (BD) modeling that involves meso-scale (several microns) dynamics over several milliseconds.    However, the CG MD or BD is still limited by the admissible time step sizes due to the non-local hydrodynamic interactions. The outcome of this project has been shown that one can use time step size of order of millisecond, which is much larger than other CG MD or BD with hydrodynamic interactions.  The algorithms introduced in this EAPSI project are capable to capture the following phenomena: (a) dynamics of double stranded lambda DNA in extensional and shear flow; (b) self-assembly property of lipid bi-layer membranes and vesicles immersed in solvent and shear flow. The numerical methods involve so-called the Metropolis Integrator Method and the Fast Multipole Method which take advantages on speeding up the BD simulation with hydrodynamic interactions using much larger time step sizes.  The intellectual merit of this project is the successful numerical development of two introduced numerical methods applying to the coarse-grained DNA and lipid bi-layer membrane simulations with solvents. Based on the concept of this project one can apply the algorithms onto various biological problems featuring reaction-diffusion of chemicals.  Broader impacts of the proposed research include the development and implementation of numerical tools and the comparative studies with results from continuum modeling will be of benefit to scientists and engineers studying DNA dynamics as well as emerging applications of biomimetic membranes. Moreover, the proposed algorithms can also be implemented on red blood cell simulation coupling with the model of cytoskeleton.
