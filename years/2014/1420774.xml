<AbstractNarration>Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are transforming the way we explore the ocean, allowing longer explorations in a variety of ocean conditions. Biological-based designs could enhance the mobility and efficiency of future AUV's. In particular, flexible ribbon-fin propulsion represents an ideal propulsion mechanism for highly maneuverable vehicles. However, the hydrodynamics, fluid-fin interaction and maneuvers using elongated fin propulsion are still poorly understood. The outcome of this research will provide insights into the hydrodynamics of flexible ribbon fin-base propulsion during different maneuvers. Two students, one graduate student and one undergraduate, will be supported by this award to research possible ribbon-fin propulsion designs. The principal investigator will also present the research to a group of K-12 students participating in a local ocean science camp program and develop a new graduate and undergraduate course that will focus on the hydrodynamics of animal locomotion in the broad context of ocean exploration, biology, underwater vehicle design and fluid mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will study the hydrodynamics of a flexible undulating ribbon fin using a robotic fin as a model. In particular, the objectives are: 1) examine the effect of flexibility and morphology in the hydrodynamics performance, 2) investigate the interconnection of flow structure, propulsion efficiency and actuation control, and 3) study maneuvers and flow control. The series of experiments will include measurement of fin kinematics, propulsive forces, and flow measurements using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The experiments will be performed at the Hydrodynamics Laboratory at Florida Atlantic University.</AbstractNarration>

A series of experiments were conducted using robotic models to address these objectives. The experiments include measurements of propulsive force, power consumption, and vessel dynamics.  Below are the specific outcomes of the project:   -  Three robotic models were developed to perform different types of experiments. These robotic models served as a platform to study the propulsion mechanism of undulating fins. One of these models is a novel self-contained and free-swimming underwater vehicle that propels using a single undulating fin.  -  We found that the ray stiffness of the undulating fin could have a positive impact on the propulsive performance. We found that a decrease in fin ray stiffness reduces both thrust production and power consumption. Moreover, our results show that flexible rays can enhance the propulsive efficiency compared to a rigid counterpart.  -  We examined different fin morphology through the aspect ratio of the fin. We found that the propulsive performance is affected by the morphology. Our results suggest that there could be an optimal morphology for a given fin kinematics.  -  We performed analysis of thrust generated by the fin and its power consumption. We found that the thrust force generated by the fin scales linearly with the enclosed area swept by the fin, and square of the relative velocity between the incoming flow and traveling wave. We also found that we find that the power consumption scales by the cube of the effective tangential velocity of the rays.  -   We successfully controlled basic maneuvers including forward and backward swimming, station keeping and rapid reversal motion, of self-contained underwater vessel propelled by a single undulating fin.  Outcomes Broader Impacts  -   This project supported the development of a diverse research lab where the PI is an underrepresented minority (Hispanic).  -  Support of one Ph.D. student in Ocean Engineering  -  Partially support the research for one master student in Ocean Engineering  - Support one undergraduate summer internship (woman)  -  Partially support 4 research experiences for undergraduate students  -  An experiment was demonstrated in a summer camp for middle school students (11 students).  -  Facilitate the development of a new undergraduate course: Innovative Sensing and Actuation Technology.
