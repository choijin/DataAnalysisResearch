<AbstractNarration>The team has developed a Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) biosensor platform that incorporates elements for both separation and identification of ligase chain reaction (LCR) products for screening of Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC). This new platform is important because it can provide rapid and multiplexed detection of STEC serotypes with minimal processing. This is especially attractive to those agents in charge of controlling food-borne diseases. &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;There are many STEC diagnostic assays on the market but all require long detection times, and assays with improved specificity are counteracted by poor portablity. The innovation by this I-Corps team is in using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) coupled to ligase chain reaction (LCR) to prevent spectral overlap of fluorescent probe molecules. The current in vitro diagnostic market  encompasses several submarkets including immunochemistry, molecular diagnostics assays, blood donor screening, hematology, hemostasis, and point-of-care (POC) testing. The infectious disease market is expected to be driven by the continued development of molecular based assays for upper-respiratory, blood, and gastro-intestinal panels. Tools are in demand that offer robust multiplexing capability, rapid time to result, and good sensitivity. Toward this end, several multiplex PCR assays have been developed for gastrointestinal pathogens but are limited to five different targets due to spectral overlap of the fluorogenic-based probes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The iCORP project focused on the utility and market potential of the Accuplex Probe system for multiplex point-of-care diagnostics.  The evaluation of the product was based upon lessons learned as a result of the iCORP training program which the team participated in during the first quarter of 2014.  The evaluation of customer opinions continued on for approximately 1 year.  The customer for this technology, tested through a series of over 100 interviews over a six-week iCORP period, are clinical microbiology lab directors or managers in clinical laboratories. The customers interviewed were universal in their need for a GI MDx diagnostic tool and this is confirmed by their recent acquisition of multiplexing IVDs for upper respiratory panels. Use of these systems is on a limited basis due to the low throughput and high cost per test. While these two issues have not been addressed adequately to date, the requests by physicians to perform these tests have dramatically increased, a issue we were able to identify as a major pain point for our customer through interviews.  The overall outcome was that the current configuration of the Accuplex Probe system was not sufficiently robust to warrant its further development and more effort was needed to evaluate the other markets for this particular platform.  There were also substantial technical challenges that needed to be resolved to determine the breadth and depth of the assays which could be formatted on the platform.
