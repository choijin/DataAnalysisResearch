<AbstractNarration>This grant supports research that seeks to answer a fundamental question about matter. What is the nature of any new physics not described by the Standard Model - our current understanding of how particles and forces interact?  This question will be addressed by precision measurements of the weak charges of the proton and electron.  The proton and electron's weak charges are the weak force analogs of the ordinary electric charges of these particles.  The weak charges are precisely predicted in the Standard Model.  Any deviation of measurements from these predictions could be evidence of as yet undiscovered massive particles that represent new physics beyond our existing understanding.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will support graduate and undergraduate students who will form an essential part of this project.  The anticipated activities cover a range of hardware and software projects that will provide excellent training for these students.  This training in fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers both in basic research and in more applied research and industry.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The funds provided by this grant will support activities on two parity-violating electron scattering experiments at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF).  The  Qweak experiment will measure the proton's neutral weak charge via parity-violating electron scattering at very low momentum transfer. The proton's weak charge has a well-defined prediction in the Standard Model; a precise measurement of it is sensitive to many popular scenarios for extending the Standard Model. During the period of this grant, we will perform data analysis leading to the final determination of the proton's weak charge from the Qweak experiment.  We will also perform analysis to extract physics results from the Qweak data for two other topics - a probe of hadronic parity violation in the N to Delta transition and a measurement of the transverse asymmetry in Moller scattering.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The MOLLER experiment is an approved TJNAF experiment intended for the upgraded 12 GeV TJNAF.  It will measure the electron's neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at a very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders.  It would have excellent sensitivity to many beyond the Standard Model scenarios.  During the period of this grant, our group will contribute to the development of this experiment by working on beam charge and position monitor upgrades, luminosity monitor and background detector development and construction, and simulation design studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work supported by this grant contributed to a precision measurement of the proton's weak charge.  The proton's weak charge sets the strength of one form of its interaction with the Z-boson, which is the neutral carrier of the weak force.  It is analagous to the familiar electric charge which determines the strength of the interaction with the photon that is the carrier of the electromagnetic force.  The proton's weak charge was extracted by measuring the small difference in the scattering rate of two states of polarized electrons from the proton - a technique referred to as parity-violating electron scattering.  The measurement (the Qweak experiment) was carried out using the CEBAF accelerator at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility during large parts of the 2010-2012 period.  The experiment used a very high current polarized electron beam scattering from the world's highest power liquid hydrogen target.   Comparison of this precision measurement of the proton's weak charge with the prediction of the Standard Model show good agreement.  One way of indicating this is shown in the  attached figure which compares various determinations of the "weak mixing angle" (including the one obtained from this measurement) with the Standard Model prediction.  Any signifcant deviation from the Standard Model prediction could be interpreted as "new physics" that is beyond the currently understood theory.  The absence of any deviation in our measurement can be used to set constraints on possible new physics at mass scales in the multi-TeV range.  The work of our group during this funding period included data analysis for the Qweak experiment.  We also worked on continued development of a new experiment proposed for Jefferson Lab (the MOLLER experiment) that will make a very precise measurement of the electron's weak charge by parity-violating scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons.  This measurement would provide a complementary search for physics beyond the Standard Model.  During the period of this grant, two PhD theses were completed.  Three PhD students and seven undergraduate students received training in a variety of techniques in experimental nuclear physics while conducting research for these projects.
