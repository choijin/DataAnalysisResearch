<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Catalysis program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Tristan Lambert of Columbia University to develop new catalysts that improve the construction of complex molecules for areas such as drug discovery and materials research.  The catalysts being investigated are expected to increase the efficiency of a variety chemical reactions and also help reduce waste during the synthesis of important molecular targets. A planned approach to student training is in process which makes use of technology and recent findings in educational research to enable students to maximize their self-directed journey to master synthetic chemistry.  Graduate students, both within and outside the Lambert group, as well as undergraduate chemistry students, participate in this program, providing these students with both practical and intellectual training in modern organic synthesis, of value for the careers in industry and academe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One aim of this project is the development of a new acid catalyst based on an aromatic cyclopentadienyl anion scaffold, which is thus highly orthogonal to established platforms.  The development of a deep understanding of the structure-activity relationship of this platform will set the stage for its application to a range of important problems.  The second major aim addresses an unmet challenge in organic synthesis, namely catalysis of carbonyl-olefin metathesis reactions. The proposed plan to develop such catalysts entails two orthogonal strategies, one involving metal catalysis and the other relying on simple organic molecules (organocatalysis). These two approaches represent pioneering investigations into a chemical transformation that has  the potential to become a significant enabling technology in fields ranging from small molecule synthesis to materials and beyond. This is a high risk, high payoff aim; this class of reactions is potentially very powerful, as noted, but has resisted attempts at catalysis heretofore.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the development of several broadly useful new catalysts for important chemical transformations.  These catalysts have the potential to dramatically improve access to complex molecules that are relevant to the areas of materials and biomedical fields among others.    One major advancement was the discovery of a novel acid catalyst for asymmetric reactions that was cheaper and simpler to make than established catalysts and that has opened up new avenues of investigation in this area.    Other efforts were aimed at the development of catalysts for double bond metathesis reactions between carbonyl compounds and olefins, using a novel strategy for this type of chemistry.  The long term implications of this work include the possibility to use simple organic molecular catalysts to synthesize valuable polymers that currently require expensive metal-based catalysts.  Work under this grant also led to the first demonstration of hydrazines as a viable catalytic platform for oxidation chemistry, using atmospheric oxygen as the ultimate oxidant.  The understanding that widely available hydrazines can serve as oxidants could lead to further developments in the broadly useful area of oxidation chemistry.  The interest in hydrazine oxidation led to work, as part of a collaboration, examining chemical reactions on the single-molecule level using scanning tunneling microscopy.  This technique might reveal information about chemical reactivity that is obscure to traditional chemistry in the bulk.  Finally, work under this grant led to the design and synthesis of a new class of polymers that incorporate trisaminocyclopropenium ions, which are extremely stable cations (positively charged species).  These polymers have numerous potential applications including in the areas of transfection, cell imaging, and energy storage.
