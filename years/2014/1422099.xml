<AbstractNarration>The Citizen Science Embedded Assessment project will explore the use of embedded assessment to measure participant science inquiry skill development within the context of citizen science projects. Citizen science (CS) projects partner volunteers with scientists to participate directly in research endeavors. Embedded assessments (EAs) assess participant skills and performance that are directly integrated and are indistinguishable from day-to-day activities. As such, EAs allow learners to demonstrate their science competencies through tasks that are integrated seamlessly into the learning experience itself. The CS field has a growing inventory of self-assessment tools, however, the evaluation of citizen science (and other informal science projects) using such subjective assessments can be remarkably improved when these are used in combination with objective measures of knowledge, skills or other resources participants gain through their participation. Science skills, such as data collection and analysis, are particularly important for CS projects because of their focus on the scientific process and their need for rigorous data collection. Despite the focus on skill gains, CS projects rarely measure such improvements. Embedded assessments (EAs) offer a critical method for understanding the impacts of these participatory learning environments. The project will develop and field test EAs on citizen science topics with an environmental science focus. It will also design training to support their use by individual projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three primary research foci: (1) identifying common and unique science inquiry skills targeted by CS projects, and how skills are currently being measured to document project impact; (2) identifying the opportunities and challenges present in developing and administering EA tools customized for CS projects to assess science inquiry skills; and (3) assessing whether EA tools created for a CS project can provide project leaders with a better understanding of their project's impact on participant science inquiry skills. The project will address these questions with a needs assessment of research and evaluation studies within the CS community and case studies to develop and test EAs customized for three identified and interested CS projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Summary Citizen science offers an important informal learning approach as it immerses the public directly in scientific research. Such efforts vary in purpose and approach but all require volunteers to be proficient in their targeted science inquiry skills such as asking questions, making observations, and communicating results. Despite this common goal, initial evidence suggests citizen science projects rarely measure volunteers? science inquiry skills. Even when they do, they often rely on volunteers? self-reports of their proficiency, which may not align with their actual performance. Embedded assessments offer a critical method for measuring volunteer skills in informal learning venues. They allow learners to demonstrate their science proficiency through tasks that are integrated seamlessly into the learning experience itself. These methods can be performance assessments, in which learners do something to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, and authentic assessments, where the learning tasks mirror real-life problem-solving situations. Despite their benefits, the use of embedded assessment is limited, partially because practitioners lack the experience and expertise to develop and implement these complex tools. This project sought to deepen understanding of embedded assessment through two concurrent studies: (a) a review across the citizen science field to determine targeted science inquiry skills and assessment of these skills and (b) a pilot-test of embedded assessments that were developed for three existing citizen science projects. The project goals were to develop a deeper understanding of relevant science inquiry skills and issues around assessment of these skills; produce sample embedded assessment tools for a set of science inquiry skills; and describe the process to develop these skill-based embedded assessment tools.   Intellectual Merit The project?s review of the field demonstrated that most citizen science projects target a narrow range of skills centered on data collection. Volunteer skills were only infrequently measured using formal robust assessments. This restricted use occurred in part because projects did not have time and staff to conduct assessment and because projects often relied on informal or indirect methods that produced anecdotal data (e.g., observations and conversations lacking protocols).
