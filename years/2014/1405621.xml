<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate studies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) is the host site for the 2014-2016 (Cohort XII) BD program that supports a graduate student cohort of 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM Ph.D. students from LSAMP campuses across the nation.  The Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ALSAMP) BD Activity provides extensive training in specific STEM disciplines as well as professional development and guidance that promote peer mentoring and leadership in the scientific community.  Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants are required to attend special topic seminars concerning graduate school&lt;br/&gt;matriculation designed specifically for the program and procedures for applying for NSF and other fellowships. Retention strategies are carried out by providing the best available research experiences and resources, establishing appropriate faculty guidance and quality mentoring and providing the support needed to accomplish the goal of earning doctoral degrees. Students will be linked to projects such as the NSF Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP), Integrated Graduate Education Research and Traineeships (IGERT), the Southern Regional Education Board Doctoral Scholars Program (SREB), Alabama Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (Alabama EPSCoR) and other STEM graduate education programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the two year award period, students remaining in UAB doctoral programs are guaranteed a continuation of the same level of financial support through a combination of departmental fellowships and additional financial support from the university. BD students not remaining at UAB are assisted in connecting to doctoral programs of their choice at other institutions and securing fellowship and other support at the selected institution.  All ALSAMP BD students are tracked into STEM doctoral degree programs and the workforce, including the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best practices for recruitment and retention of graduate researchers are implemented and built upon lessons learned from previous ALSAMP BD host sites. The findings, lessons learned, and impact of the activities are disseminated through publications and presentations at national meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, the Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ALSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate activity has supported 114 underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students in in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics [STEM] disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce, both in academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing the future professoriate, as well as the scientific workforce, the value added is seen in the visibility of minorities in science and engineering, increasing representation and providing role models and motivation for the next generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Alabama LSAMP program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) selected twelve students from a large pool of applicants to participate in the program. The goal of the BD program was to recruit students with the greatest potential for earning a Ph.D. degree in STEM fields.    Because academic and personal support systems for graduate students are critical to the retention of students and the successful completion of a doctoral degree, the students were assigned former BD students to provide peer consultations and networking opportunities.     All BD students at UAB  applied for NSF graduate fellowships and other fellowship opportunities during their first year in the program.    As a result of the high quality of UAB?s  research faculty, bridge participants were successful in gaining admission to Ph.D. programs across the country.    Each BD student chose a faculty mentor from selected volunteers in the appropriate department to help guide their research activities and several students served as co-authors on research papers prepared by mentors.  A BD seminar series was held a monthly  to discuss issues relevant to their professional development and networking opportunities. A number of seminar activities were designed to prepare the students for application to doctoral programs and to learn how to prepare and  present research at national conferences,    Another important activity that was most beneficial to BD students was networking through conference participation.  Two such conferences were the Annual Alabama LSAMP Spring Research Conference and the Annual BD Winter Conference.   The spring conference brings all Alabama LSAMP undergraduate scholars, graduate students and BD students (current and former) together for a two-day event involving research presentations, presentation from a well-known minority scientist role model and breakout sessions to discuss a variety of topics and issues.  Sessions held particularly for BD students focus on networking, dissertation research, laboratory experiences and general Ph.D. degree requirements.  These sessions are chaired by BD site coordinators and research mentors.   Several of the student attended and presented at the NSF 25th LSAMP Anniversary held in Washington DC.      The BD program was evaluated by the Alabama LSAMP Social Science Team consisting of UAB evaluators: Dr. Angela Lewis and Dr. Olivio Clay.  This team was familiar with all aspects of the Alabama LSAMP project since they currently serve as social science researchers and evaluators for the Alabama LSAMP project. The team  set measurable objectives, benchmarks and indicators of progress.         Last Modified: 09/01/2017       Submitted by: Louis Dale]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
