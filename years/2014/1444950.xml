<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating UC Berkeley?s low power microheater sensor platform to fill the need for low-power combustible gas sensors. Accurate detection of flammable gases is essential for safe operation of many industrial processes, especially in the oil and gas industry. Installing networks of combustible gas monitors in industrial settings can allow for rapid leak detection and increased safety and environmental protection.  The construction and inspection cost associated with installing wired gas monitors in a hazardous facility, such as a refinery, are prohibitive. Battery-powered wireless monitors would eliminate this installation burden, but the high power requirements for current combustible gas sensor technology necessitate a large, expensive, heavy battery or represent a major inconvenience to facility personnel who must replace the battery as often as every week. This project focuses on addressing the need for combustible gas sensors with significantly lower power consumption (at least 100x) than the best commercially available sensor, while maintaining performance parameters such as sensitivity and lifetime.  The proposed ultra-low power combustible gas sensor with competitive sensitivity and lifetime characteristics will enable ubiquitous wireless monitoring of combustible gases in industrial settings, resulting in enhanced safety. Furthermore, in the long-term, the technology may enable embedding gas sensors in smart phones, which will result in increased personal safety. Additional significant impact is on human resource development, in particular in the training of graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core technology in this project is a suspended microheater coated with a sensing material that catalyzes hydrocarbon combustion.  These microheater sensors require only a few mW of power to reach operation temperatures of 500 Â°C.  However, several challenges remain in developing a commercial prototype for combustible gas sensing. These include stable adhesion of the sensing layer to the microheater, stability of materials and sensor response in appropriate atmospheric conditions, and reproducible catalyst deposition. This project addresses these technology gaps as it translates from discovery research toward commercial application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide core training for graduate and undergraduate students who will benefit from interdisciplinary training in surface chemistry, materials science, electrical engineering and market analysis. The students will gain experience not only in research but also in technical presentation through their participation in meetings with industry leaders. This will provide the students with a unique experience in the interconnectivity between research and development and technology and the marketplace.  In addition, the students will be able to take advantage of resources at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley (such as Launch: The Berkeley Start-Up Competition program) as well as the CleanTech Open Accelerator program to gain entrepreneurial/technology translation training.</AbstractNarration>
