<AbstractNarration>1403873 Thies&lt;br/&gt;GOALI: Tuning Renewable Solvent Systems for Lignin Purification and Fractionation&lt;br/&gt;Lignin is one of the most common organic compounds on earth, comprising about 30% of all organic carbon. Lignin is also unique among biopolymers in having significant aromatic character, which makes it potentially attractive for a wide range of uses, including coatings and carbon fibers. Unfortunately, the commercial-grade lignins available today are severely limited in their applications because of their high metals (primarily sodium) and ash content. Thus, less than 0.2% of these 50 million tons/yr of available lignin is being recovered. Clearly, cost-effective separations processes must be devised to dramatically improve the purities of today's commercial lignins, if lignin is to achieve its potential as a biopolymer. Such an ultrapure lignin would be of great interest for the production of high-value products, such as carbon fibers for automobile applications (for large reductions in fuel consumption). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clemson researchers have discovered a powerful, versatile, yet renewable hot solvent system that can be "tuned" to reduce the sodium content of lignin derived from the Kraft pulping process 100-fold down to &lt;150 ppm in a single step. Furthermore, preliminary evidence indicates that by incorporating compressed CO2 into the solvent system, the ultrapure lignin can be fractionated into cuts of well-defined molecular weight and chemical composition. A fundamental investigation of these phenomena, in order to lay the groundwork for future commercial application, is the overarching objective of this work. The research plan is as follows: (1) Measure elevated-temperature, liquid-liquid equilibrium phase behavior for the solvent system with lignin. Phase boundaries for the lignin-rich and solvent-rich phases, solvent compositions in each phase, and the effect of temperature will be the focus of these measurements. (2) Determine the distribution of metal salts between the lignin present in the above two phases. (3) Investigate the addition of CO2 to the lignin-solvent system for fractionating ultrapure lignin by molecular weight. (4) Characterize the lignin constituents in each phase in terms of phenolic and carboxylic acid content. (5) Evaluate ultrapure lignins as replacements for petroleum-derived polymers in coatings applications. The industrial partner will use the lignin for different polymer coating applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lignin is one of the world's most abundant renewable biopolymers, with ~25% of land biomass consisting of lignin (only cellulose is more plentiful).  Furthermore, it is the only abundant biopolymer with aromaticity.  Thus, it is attracting increased interest for materials applications, such as polyurethane foams, epoxy resins, and carbon fibers.  Like any polymer, the separation of lignin into fractions of controlled molecular weight can be an important part of its development for specific applications.  Furthermore, most polymers need to be devoid of metals contamination, which can poison processing catalysts or have a deleterious effect on materials properties.  Thus, the Aqueous Lignin Purification with Hot Acids (ALPHA) process was developed in order to address both of these issues in a sustainable manner.  In brief, the ALPHA process consists of contacting bulk Kraft lignins with hot, one-phase acetic acid&ndash;water mixtures such that two liquid phases are created, one solvent-rich and one polymeric and lignin-rich.  The solvent phase has a high selectivity for the metals, with an order-of-magnitude reduction in metals content being obtained for each equilibrium stage employed.  Furthermore, the lignin partitions between the two phases according to molecular weight (MW), with the solvent-rich phase containing the lower MW and the lignin-rich phase the higher MW portion of the lignin.  Thus, purification and fractionation of the lignin take place simultaneously.   One unique advantage of fractionating bulk lignins via ALPHA is that one lignin fraction is cleaned of metals simply by separating the two liquid phases created above; only a drying step and no washing is required.  Furthermore, selectivities to extract the metals away from the lignin-rich liquid phase are 15-50, on the high side of those used in commercial extraction processes.  With the above encouraging results for a single-stage extraction, we added a 2nd stage to see just how low we could drive the metals content of the recovered lignin fractions.  A 50/50 acetic acid/water (AcOH/H2O) solvent system at 95 &deg;C was used for the 1st stage of extraction, followed by a 70/30 AcOH/H2O solvent mixture at the same temperature. After this 2nd stage, both the solvent and lignin phases were ultraclean, containing as little as 25 ppm sodium in either phase.  Furthermore, the high mol wt lignin from Stage 2 was solvated with 68 wt % solvent, ready "as is" for processing into a product such as fibers. Thus, with only two stages the ALPHA process generated ultraclean, fractionated, and solvated fractions, with the MWs of said fractions ranging from 500 on the low side to &gt;10,000 on the high side.  Liquid&ndash;liquid equilibrium (LLE) compositions were measured for the pseudoternary system lignin&ndash;acetic acid&ndash;water at 70 and 95 &deg;C, conditions of interest for the ALPHA process for the purification and fractionation of lignin. For both temperatures, tie-lines encompassing the entire region of LLE were measured, from near the plait point in the AcOH-rich region to the solid&ndash;liquid&ndash;liquid (SLL) phase boundary in the water-rich region. This LLE region exhibited several interesting characteristics.  Surprisingly, there was essentially no difference between the solvent compositions in the solvent-rich vs. the polymeric lignin-rich phase, indicating that the solvent mixture is exhibiting the properties of a single liquid solvent with respect to the lignin polymer. Furthermore, a strong maximum was measured on the lignin-rich side of the binodal curve, which can occur when a solvent mixture consists of strongly associating fluids.  The average molecular weight of the lignin in the polymer-rich phase was found to be an order-of-magnitude higher than that in the solvent-rich phase.  Acid-catalyzed lignin condensation reactions were found to occur at the highest AcOH concentrations and temperatures in the lignin-rich phase, but there was no impact on the measured phase compositions.  Conversion of ALPHA to continuous-flow operation was investigated in order to determine the effect of reduced residence times on both the condensation reactions noted above, and on the extraction of metals from the solvated lignin to the solvent phase. When a static mixer was used for the mixing and equilibration device, reducing residence times to 20-30 s, condensation polymerization reactions were essentially eliminated.
