<AbstractNarration>Paleoanthropology uses the fossil record to work out how and when the defining characteristics of humans, such as large-brains, upright walking, extended juvenile period, and increased longevity, evolved. Advances in molecular biology now make it possible to investigate how the genes of our forbearers might have been modified to generate these defining characteristics. This project focuses on the evolution of a gene (NR2C1) potentially involved in early brain development, and will compare the activity of human versus non-human ape versions of the gene in mouse cells. The data that are generated will advance our understanding of the unique molecular interactions at play in the evolution and development of the modern human brain. In addition, the project has broader impacts to society that include potential pharmacological applications, generation of new, shared genetic data, training of a non-traditional, female graduate student, and public science education and outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear receptor genes are implicated in the control of growth and development, hormone regulation and behavior. Preliminary evidence suggests that one of these genes, NR2C1, has undergone positive selection in the human lineage. In this six-month study, copies of NR2C1 will be generated for modern humans and chimpanzees, and predicted/reconstructed for a last common ancestor (LCA) of chimpanzees/bonobos and modern humans. These three different gene variants will be inserted into mouse embryonic stem cells that have had NR2C1 knocked down, allowing quantification of the transcriptional and regulatory functions of NR2C1. These methods will allow the investigators to analyze how alterations to the modern human version of NR2C1 may have resulted in the morphological or functional changes we see in the modern human brain. Data on the locations and timing of primate amino acid substitutions for all 48 primate nuclear receptor genes will be generated and will be of interest to the general public and to researchers in biological anthropology, evolutionary biology, medical genetics, neuroscience, and pharmacology. The graduate student researcher, who has years of experience as a biology teacher, is dedicated to providing well-designed student and public education about evolutionary processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    At its core human evolutionary biology seeks to answer the question of how the defining characteristics of modern humans evolved, such as large-brains, obligatory bipedal gait, extended juvenile period, and increased longevity. Traditional fossil-based research uses morphology to infer behavior and life history, but recently introduced ancestral gene reconstruction (AGR) methods now allow us to reconstruct ancestral DNA and its corresponding protein sequences. We used these innovative methods to investigate the molecular evolution of an important group of genes, Nuclear Receptors (NR), that are involved in development, behavior, endocrine signaling, and reproduction.  We began by carrying out a comprehensive molecular evolutionary survey of 48 nuclear receptors across primate lineages to look for signs that the intensity of natural selection within humans had changed. We then used additional reliability and robustness analyses to identify the best candidate gene to focus on. The gene we chose, NR2C1, is involved in embryonic stem cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation &ndash; in other words it could be involved in helping to evolve our large brain.  We showed how modifications to the modern human version of NR2C1 affected the ability of an embryonic stem cell to remain in its proliferative state. We created three different copies of NR2C1: a human version, a chimpanzee version, and the version that would have been in the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and modern humans. Inserting these three different gene variants into mouse embryonic stem cells that had NR2C1 knocked down allowed us to quantitatively analyze the transcriptional and regulatory functions of NR2C1.  These assays suggest that evolution of NR2C1 along the human and chimpanzee lineages has 1) modulated a key regulator of pluripotency and cell lineage commitment, 2) impacted promoter activity, and 3) affected the average size of embryological stem cell colonies.  Our study represents both an empirical discovery (evolutionary significance of NR2C1 during hominid evolution) and a methodological advancement (the effective combination of a targeted evolutionary survey and experimental analyses for investigating the evolution of gene regulation). Our study generated testable hypotheses by combining statistical analyses followed by targeted laboratory experimentation.
