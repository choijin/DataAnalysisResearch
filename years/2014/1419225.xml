<AbstractNarration>Social scientists need to better understand the processes through which social interactions at multiple scales lead to the emergence and integration of larger social groups such as communities and societies. These processes are not limited to modern societies, and studying them in prehistoric contexts adds a deeper understanding of these processes. Drs. Mark A. Hill, Kevin C. Nolan, and Mark F. Seeman seek to understand the social world of prehistoric groups commonly referred to as "Ohio Hopewell."  Hopewell (ca. 50 AD-350 AD) has captivated scholars and the public alike for over a century. This study applies Social Network Analysis (SNA) to discover the differing scales and nature of interaction that will allow a reconstruction of the texture of variable group membership in Ohio Hopewell. This will not only help to understand the broad sweep of prehistory and the specific social realities that molded the past, but will also provide a better understanding of the integration of human social groups in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no one "Hopewell"; the many Hopewell-linked groups are characterized by variable participation in a variety of information and goods exchange networks. Until explicit and robust methods of classification and analysis are applied to understanding social interaction and integration, researchers will be unable to grasp the complexity, detail, and meaning of each overlying network. SNA has been successfully used in ethnographic and archaeological research around the world, and is now the most appropriate tool for beginning to disentangle the complex web that forms Ohio Hopewell. SNA offers a robust and objective set of quantitative methods for reconstructing connections among groups and its application here will be the first in the region, and among the first in eastern North America. This study, assumes that what falls under the "Ohio Hopewell" rubric is a series of dispersed family clusters choosing to participate variably in networks at a number of related, but distinct scales. Many divisions of Ohio Hopewell have been proposed; however, there has been no consistent or replicated method or conclusion of network classification. As a first step, the research focuses on Ohio Hopewell communities within the Scioto River watershed of southcentral Ohio. The project analyzes three explicit spatial scales of interaction through a combination of micro- and macro-stylistic attributes, and raw material source analysis. (1) The local/community level is targeted by a series of ceramic production traits which would be learned through enculturation and apprenticeships but not readily visible to outsiders (micro-style). (2) The regional/intercommunity level is targeted by analyzing the distribution of lithic raw material proportions and ceramic vessel elements that are externally observable (macro-style) and can be transmitted among communities. (3) The extra-regional scale of interaction is targeted by the sourcing of rare exotic materials (copper, silver) via Laser Ablation Inductively Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be patterns (and potentially many) at each scale. With this multi-scalar approach, the project will build a detailed picture of how the larger Ohio Hopewell networks are constructed from the bottom up, by families and communities.</AbstractNarration>

This project, then, not only helps to understand the broad sweep of prehistory and the specific social realities that molded the past, but also informs our understanding of the organization of human social groups in general.  In addition, the project contributed empirical data to the geographic sources of copper used by Ohio Hopewell coppersmiths in the production of ritual objects, tools, and jewelry.  Previous models had proposed that copper was obtained through long distance journeys to a few specific sources in the Lake Superior region.  Our analysis reveals a much more complex picture in which copper sources are highly varied and may have included glacially deposited copper from south of the Great Lakes.  This study also is the first to demonstrate that copper was also obtained from the Appalachian Mountains to the south.  Combined, these results suggest a very different means of copper procurement than often assumed; copper procurement is more likely arranged through the social networks that channel the movements of other materials such as stone, mica, and ceramics rather than through arduous treks to Lake Superior.  As such, copper becomes another indication of the importance of social networks in the formation of the Hopewell phenomenon.  These represent the initial results, and additional analysis is ongoing.  The project developed an extensive database of Ohio Hopewell lithics, ceramic attributes and composition, and copper composition which is still the subject of detailed analysis.  Additional patterns may be expected at each scale, and a detailed picture of the how the Ohio Hopewell networks were constructed is still emerging from the data.
