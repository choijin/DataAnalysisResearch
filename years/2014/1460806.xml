<AbstractNarration>At this REU Sites called "A Research Incubator REU Site in Chemistry at Furman University" funded by the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professors Karen L. Buchmueller and colleagues at Furman University will provide research opportunities for ten students for ten weeks. The Site will involve three visiting teams, each consisting of a faculty mentor and two students who will come to Furman each summer to conduct research. Four Furman teams, each consisting of a faculty mentor and one student, will join them. Research topics may be developed independently by the visiting teams, or in collaboration with one of the Furman teams. Early in the summer, a customizable workshop schedule will provide safety and ethics training, career advising and hands-on experience with key analytical instrumentation. Social and outreach activities will complement focused laboratory research to encourage the intellectual development of young scientists. Additional mentor-focused development activities will help to advance long-term sustainable research programs at the partner institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site will serve as a "research incubator", resulting in beneficial impacts well beyond the host institution's summer program and the participation of the immediate undergraduate. This will be accomplished by hosting faculty/student teams from partner institutions or schools where internal research activities are limited or non-existent. Potential partners will include 2-year institutions and institutions with diverse student populations. The approach will encourage continued faculty/student research activity after the formal summer program, while simultaneously providing an outstanding experience for those students directly involved in the program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Research Incubator REU Site in Chemistry at Furman University works to create research opportunities to students both at Furman and at regional colleges that do not have strong research infrastructures of their own. Typically, three visiting teams, each composed of a faculty member and two students, came to Furman each summer and worked alongside Furman teams. In some cases, the visiting teams brought their own projects, while in others, they formed collaborative partnerships with Furman teams. The visiting teams came from historically black colleges, a two-year institution and institutions that primarily serve first generation college students. All of the students received training in safety, scientific ethics, technical communication, career planning and on state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation. Each summer, the group staged an outreach event at the Frazee Dream Center to promote science and scientific education to at-risk and disadvantaged children.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The specific research areas varied greatly, based upon the interests and expertise of the participating faculty. These included biochemistry, organic synthesis, supramolecular and polymer chemistry, analytical chemistry and inorganic chemistry. Of the five students NSF-REU supported in the most recent cohort, two have earned their associates degrees and matriculated to a four year college (Furman and Converse College). Two are starting Chemistry PhD programs in the fall (North Carolina State University and Florida State University). Of the 21 additional REU participants funded in the summers of 2015-2017, five (5) are pursuing their PhDs in Chemistry or a related field (Purdue, Minnesota, Clemson, Montana State and UNC Greensboro), three (3) have matriculated to four-year colleges, one (1) is employed as a Forensic Technician with a police department in a major city, two (2) are pursuing Master's degrees in Chemistry, one (1) starts medical school in the fall, one (1) is in physical therapy school, one (1) is pursuing her MBA, two (2) are undergraduates and one (1) is teaching STEM disciplines in High School. Of the 26 unique students funded through the NSF-REU (2015-2018), four (4) visiting students joined the program for two summers. All four of these students come from groups underrepresented in the chemical sciences; thereby, providing opportunities for leadership and engaging their research projects at a deeper level.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/26/2019<br>      Modified by: Karen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Buchmueller</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460806/1460806_10360282_1559505741481_DSC_7696--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460806/1460806_10360282_1559505741481_DSC_7696--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2016 REU Group"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460806/1460806_10360282_1559505741481_DSC_7696--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2016 REU Group"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Each summer a diverse group of students and faculty participated in the program.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Timothy Hanks</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Timothy&nbsp;W&nbsp;Hanks</div> <div class="imageTitle">2016 REU Group</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460806/1460806_10360282_1559506338942_IMG_3015--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460806/1460806_10360282_1559506338942_IMG_3015--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Professional Development"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460806/1460806_10360282_1559506338942_IMG_3015--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Professional Development"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students  received training in a variety of non-technical activities, including safety, scientific ethics, leadership and scientific communication.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Timothy Hanks</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Timothy&nbsp;W&nbsp;Hanks</div> <div class="imageTitle">Professional Development</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460806/1460806_10360282_1559506473495_DSC_7781--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460806/1460806_10360282_1559506473495_DSC_7781--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Community Outreach"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460806/1460806_10360282_1559506473495_DSC_7781--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Community Outreach"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The REU team shares its excitement about science with disadvantaged children.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Timothy Hanks</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Timothy&nbsp;W&nbsp;Hanks</div> <div class="imageTitle">Community Outreach</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
