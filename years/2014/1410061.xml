<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Raymond E. Schaak of the Pennsylvania State University will study the formation of nanoparticles (particles on the scale of a few billionths of a meter) that contain three distinct material components in contact.  Such nanoparticles offer important and unique properties for applications in energy, optics, medicine, and catalysis.  However, these nanoparticles can be difficult to make in a way that is both predictable and controllable.  This project will reveal important new insights into how three-component nanoparticles form, as well as generate new chemical tools for making them in a way that meets specific design criteria for their target applications.  A diverse group of students will participate in this project, and the research results will also feed into the development of new laboratory and classroom learning modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid inorganic nanoparticles that incorporate multiple distinct materials into a single particle offer multi-functionality and synergistic properties that underpin emerging applications in solar energy conversion, nanophotonics, biomedicine, and catalysis.  Most examples of hybrid nanoparticles involve two-component systems, or heterodimers.  Heterotrimers, which are three-component hybrid nanoparticles, offer greater complexity and functional diversity, as well as unique materials characteristics that are required by these applications.  However, different materials configurations within a heterotrimer system (A-B-C vs. C-A-B) can lead to different properties, and therefore precise control over the relative locations of each material component is required.  This project will provide significant new knowledge and understanding about the formation, stability, and chemical reactivity of hybrid nanoparticles.  These results are anticipated to enable the predictable synthesis of nanoparticle heterotrimers with precisely controlled configurations and spatial arrangements.  This project will provide multi-disciplinary training for both undergraduate and graduate students, and also serve as a platform for the new laboratory and classroom learning modules.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many emerging applications in energy, optics, electronics, medicine, and catalysis require multiple distinct materials to be integrated together at nanoscale dimensions. To function as designed, such hybrid nanoparticles must contain interfaces that facilitate direct electronic communication, as well as asymmetry and a precise arrangement of components. Three-component hybrid nanoparticle systems are especially important targets, as they form the basis for many of these designs. It is possible to construct three-component hybrid nanoparticles by starting with one type of nanoparticle (?A?) as a seed, then sequentially growing additional nanoparticles (?B? and ?C?) off of it. However, several products are possible from these reactions (i.e. ?A-B-C? vs ?C-A-B?), and it can be challenging to selectively access the desired target. This project uncovered important new insights into the formation of three-component hybrid nanoparticles and how their A-B-C vs C-A-B configurations can be controlled. A library of three-component hybrid nanoparticles, including metal/metal/metal sulfide and metal/metal/metal oxide systems, was synthesized to identify the configurations that preferentially form. A microscopic investigation then revealed the pathway by which these preferred configurations form. For example, when Pt-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> hybrid nanoparticles react with Ag reagents in an attempt to form a three-component Ag/Pt/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> system, it was observed that Ag nucleates on both Pt and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. However, over time, Ag moves around and eventually ends up exclusively on the Pt to form Ag-Pt-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (rather than Pt-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Ag). This provided important knowledge about how the reactions that form three-component hybrid nanoparticles occur and can be controlled. An alternative pathway for forming three-component hybrid nanoparticles, which does not involve surface seeded growth, was also developed. Here, a third nanoparticle could be inserted between two connected nanoparticles through a supersaturation-precipitation pathway. For example, Ge reagents react with the Au in Au-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to form (AuGe)-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and then Ge precipitates between the Au-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> interface to form Au-Ge-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Under different conditions, Ge instead can be made to grow on the Au surface to form Au-Ge-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, thereby providing access to two distinct three-component hybrid nanoparticle configurations of the same materials. To begin diversifying the scope of materials that can be included in hybrid nanoparticle systems, a method was developed for decoupling the formation of particle-particle interfaces from the incorporation of desired materials. For example, Pt-MnO was formed to define the hybrid nanoparticle structure, and then chemical reactions transformed the MnO to MnS and MnSe to form Pt-MnS and Pt-MnSe, respectively. Subsequent reactions further transformed the MnS and MnSe components to other materials, providing access to Pt-Ag<sub>2</sub>S, Pt-Cu<sub>2</sub>S, Pt-Ag<sub>2</sub>Se, Pt-Cu<sub>2</sub>Se, and Pt-CoS ?&nbsp;all derived from the single Pt-MnO precursor. Application of this approach to three-component systems allowed Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Pt-MnO to be transformed to FeS<sub>x</sub>-Pt-Cu<sub>2</sub>S. Taken together, this project provided new capabilities and understanding that will enable researchers to predictably synthesize three-component hybrid nanoparticles that require precise configuration control to function as designed. This project also provided multi-disciplinary training to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, a published resource for setting up and troubleshooting hybrid nanoparticle reactions, and opportunities for students to participate in developing new pedagogical materials that will be integrated into undergraduate lecture and laboratory courses.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Raymond&nbsp;Schaak</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
