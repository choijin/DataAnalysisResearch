<AbstractNarration>The detection of gravitational waves will provide a totally new view of the transient sky. The advanced LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, will soon open an era when mysterious questions regarding gamma-ray bursts, the most relativistic and energetic stellar explosions, will be clarified via multi-messenger studies. In this framework, the present award supports: (i) the training of a graduate student who can work, within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, on LIGO searches in coincidence with gamma-ray bursts; (ii) studies related to the electromagnetic follow-up of LIGO-Virgo triple coincidence triggers; (iii) searches for "longer-duration" gravitational wave signals, aimed at probing the magnetar progenitor scenario for gamma-ray bursts. The detection of gravitational waves could probe, for the first time directly, the nature of gamma-ray burst progenitors. The discovery of an "orphan afterglow" via electromagnetic follow-up of a gravitational wave trigger, would yield the most dramatic confirmation of the jet model for gamma-ray bursts. The detection of a longer-duration gravitational wave signal in coincidence with a gamma-ray burst, could probe the nature of the central engine (magnetar versus black-hole), and explain some of the most puzzling observational properties of the early afterglow phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important component of this project is the training of graduate and undergraduate students at being the next generation of astrophysicists: scientists capable of bridging astronomy and gravitational physics. Students' participation in LIGO engineering runs dedicated to the preparation of the advanced detectors, is encouraged. A wider dissemination of the concept of gravitational wave astronomy, and awareness of LIGO as the US national facility dedicated to opening a new era in astronomy, are promoted through lectures offered at a local planetarium. The last serves public school students belonging, for the vast majority, to underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
