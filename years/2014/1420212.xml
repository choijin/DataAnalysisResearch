<AbstractNarration>How does our visual system transform the light patterns impinging onto the retina into a meaningful three-dimensional world of objects and movement? Over the last few decades we have made enormous progress in our understanding of brain functions. Yet, the fundamental computational and biological principles underlying visual information processing remain elusive. Like other species, we humans do not simply sit back and passively accept the sensory data that flows around us. Instead, we actively seek out useful information by coordinating sensory processing with motor activity on multiple scales. The hypothesis of this project is that visual perception in humans is an intrinsically sensory-motor process, in which the observer's behavior plays a key computational role.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To investigate this hypothesis, the project brings together researchers from the Netherlands (Dr. Brenner at VU University in Amsterdam), the US (Dr. Rucci at Boston University), and the UK (Dr. Rushton at Cardiff University), who have developed critical expertise on the analyses of different types of motor activities in humans. These researchers and their teams will investigate the mechanisms by which people use motor/proprioceptive signals to accomplish visual tasks. Understanding the impact motor activity has on perception is critical to advancing our knowledge of how the visual system functions. Additionally, understanding the interplay between our senses and motor processes will help us to replicate those mechanisms in artificial systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the potential for advancing our understanding of visual perception, this research also has several broader impacts. Many pathological conditions that feature abnormal motor activity also present visual impairments. Understanding the role of behavior in the extraction and processing of visual information could point towards potential treatments for such visual impairments. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of this research offers new opportunities for training students. By collaborating with the PI, students at Boston University will have an opportunity to combine experimental and theoretical research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A long-standing question in modern neuroscience is how the visual system transforms the light patterns impinging onto the retina into a meaningful world of objects and animates.  While enormous progress has been made in the understanding of brain functions, the fundamental computational principles underlying the processing and extraction of spatial information in the human visual system remain elusive.  This project builds on the observation that perception has been traditionally studied in a passive manner, paying relatively little attention to the observer's motor activity during the acquisition of visual information. Like other species, humans are not passively exposed to the incoming flow of sensory data.  Instead, they actively seek useful information by coordinating sensory processing with motor activity.  It has long been proposed that visuomotor behavior may not just serve the function of redirecting gaze, but also participate in the processing of sensory information by simplifying perceptual computations.  In this project, with funding from the National Science Foundation, researchers at Boston University examined the visual consequences of different types of eye movements in humans.  This work was the US component of a broader international collaboration with laboratories in the Netherlands and the UK, each funded by agencies in their countries.  These three groups possess complementary expertise in the analysis of motor activity in humans and worked together to explore the underlying hypothesis that different sensorimotor strategies serve similar computational purposes. The research of this project has shed new light on the visual consequences of the luminance modulations that the observer?s motor activity elicits on the retina.  Results from this research suggest that the way humans normally move their eyes facilitate sequential processing at different scales of analysis.  Intellectual merit.  The results of this international collaboration indicate that humans use different sensorimotor strategies to transform spatial patterns into temporal signals, a format that facilitates neural processing.  Within this general framework, the US component of this project has led to the formulation of new specific hypotheses on the very functions of eye movements.  Elucidation of the computational consequences of motor activity is instrumental to advancing the field: motor behavior is always present, but often ignored by studies of visual perception.  Broader impact.  In addition to advancing current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for visual perception, the knowledge acquired in this project also bears clinical implications.   Abnormal eye movements occur in many pathological conditions, and analysis of its impact is essential for fully understanding the origins of the visual impairments associated with these conditions.  The knowledge generated by this project is therefore a prerequisite for making progress toward the development of treatments and effective prosthetic devices.
