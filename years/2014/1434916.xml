<AbstractNarration>Title: Photoheterotrophy in Unicellular Cyanobacteria: Ecological Drivers and Significance for Marine Biogeochemistry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unicellular cyanobacteria are major contributors to primary production and carbon export in the open ocean. They also play an important role in the control of nutrient availability. The ability of these microbes to harvest light energy benefits a range of physiological functions, but the effect of light on their metabolism (other than for photosynthesis) is poorly known and controversial. This project will investigate the role of light in uptake of organic substrates (carbon and nutrients) by unicellular cyanobacteria and elucidate the importance of photoheterotrophy. The ability of these organisms to assimilate organic compounds and its modulation by light and nutrients will provide additional hints about the ecological success of unicellular cyanobacteria in the ocean. The proposed work will involve field experiments in the southwest Pacific Ocean, complemented by laboratory experiments in controlled cultures of ecologically relevant cyanobacteria. The study will employ innovative methods, including single cell assays and molecular tools that target individual cyanobacteria and evaluate their response to light for the assimilation of organic substrates. This research project will lead to an increased understanding of the microbial adaptations to light and nutrient gradients and the role these adaptations play in elemental cycling in oceanic habitats. This project will support an early career female investigator. Both undergraduate students and local high school students will be trained in research techniques and mentored by the investigator. Findings resulting from this project will be communicated to scientists through open-access publications. A video documenting the scientific cruise and summarizing the major discoveries of the proposed research will be produced and be widely accessible to the public. These activities will thus reach a broad audience including a significant fraction of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unicellular cyanobacteria inhabit the surface ocean (generally &lt;150 m deep), and use solar energy to compete for a limited supply of available nutrients. Therefore, they are expected to utilize light energy not only for photosynthesis but also to enhance their metabolism of dissolved organic compounds. Yet, the role of light in the uptake of organic compounds (both carbon and nutrients) and the importance of photoheterotrophy are still poorly understood. This proposal seeks to investigate the ecological drivers and significance of photoheterotrophy in the unicellular cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the most abundant groups of primary producers in the ocean, and Crocosphaera an important nitrogen fixing organism. This proposal argues that adaptations to specific light regimes must shape spatiotemporal partitioning of resources among microbial groups in the ocean. Field experiments along a west-east transect in the southwest Pacific Ocean will cover a range of nutrient conditions and cyanobacterial abundances. Radioactive substrate incubations combined with flow cytometry cell sorting and microautoradiography paired to catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (MICRO-CARD-FISH) will allow the separation of unicellular cyanobacteria from non-pigmented bacterioplankton and evaluation of their response to light for the uptake of different organic substrates. These experiments will be complemented by laboratory tests in controlled cultures of axenic strains representative of different ecologically relevant functional groups of cyanobacteria. Lastly, the capacity of the important nitrogen fixer Crocosphaera watsonii to feed on glucose will be tested, taking advantage of the sequenced genome of the representative strain WH8501 in targeting the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism in situ.</AbstractNarration>
