<AbstractNarration>We will study co-evolution between a coral reef fish (Siphamia tubifer) and its symbiotic, light-emitting bacterium (Photobacterium mandapamensis). To test the hypothesis that the host fish?s ecology and behavior shape and maintain the specificity of the fish?s association with the bacterium, this study will determine the extent to which genetic differences exist among populations of both the fish and bacterium, and how these differences correlate over space and time. Work will be carried out on specimens of the fish collected from coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan. We will use a recently developed method in population genetics, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing, to determine the genetic structures of populations of the fish and bacterium with fine-scale resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbiotic associations between fish and specific types of luminous bacteria are biologically important components of many marine ecosystems, and their persistence depends on their biological specificity. Understanding how specificity arises and is maintained is especially important now, as changes in the marine environment, such as increases in sea surface temperature and acidification, are occurring more rapidly. These changes have the potential to de-couple symbiotic associations by altering the ecology of both organisms. As a vertebrate ? microbe symbiosis, this association is also being developed as an experimental model system for learning how vertebrate animals, including humans, acquire, accommodate, and function cooperatively with beneficial bacteria. This project will contribute to scientific infrastructure by providing research training for undergraduate students and will promote international research exchange with Japanese scientists and students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Virtually all animals, including humans, depend on bacteria for their success, yet how these interactions are established and maintained remains largely unknown. By examining an intimate association between a coral reef fish and a bioluminescent bacterium, this study investigated how host-symbiont relationships form and are maintained in nature. The highly specific symbiosis between the sea urchin cardinalfish, <em>Siphamia tubifer</em>, and the luminous bacterium<em>, Photobacterium mandapamensis</em>, was examined as a model association for determining how aspects of the host&rsquo;s ecology promote the maintenance of specificity of the symbiosis. First, the biology and behavior of the fish was defined with respect to its association with its symbiotic bacteria in its natural environment. Then, using a recently developed genetic method called double-digest restriction site associated sequencing (ddRAD-Seq), the population genetic structure of both the host fish and its symbiotic bacteria were defined in order to understand where the larvae go during development and when and where they acquire their luminous symbionts. The results revealed that adult fish return to the same sea urchin every day at their home reef after hunting for food at night. The fish then release excess symbiont cells as waste throughout the day, causing the surrounding seawater to become enriched with their symbiotic bacteria. Upon completion of their development, larval fish settle out of the open water onto a reef and acquire a symbiont from the locally enriched seawater near the adult fish population at that reef. This behavior ensures that larval fish are able to acquire their luminous symbiont before settling onto a reef, and consequently, the specificity of the symbiosis is maintained between host generations. Overall, this study highlighted the important role of a host animal in promoting the stability of its symbiotic relationship with bacteria over time and provides new perspective on how animals help shape populations of bacteria in the wild.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Alison&nbsp;Gould</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1405286/1405286_10294922_1496176071578_IMG_3101-Version2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1405286/1405286_10294922_1496176071578_IMG_3101-Version2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Siphamia tubifer with host sea urchin"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1405286/1405286_10294922_1496176071578_IMG_3101-Version2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Siphamia tubifer with host sea urchin"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A group of the symbiotically luminous cardinalfish Siphamia tubifer resting among the spines of their host sea urchin on a coral reef in Okinawa, Japan</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alison L Gould</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alison&nbsp;Gould</div> <div class="imageTitle">Siphamia tubifer with host sea urchin</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
