<AbstractNarration>Combinatorial commutative algebra concerns discrete methods or structures that govern or are governed by systems of polynomial equations, for example in algorithmic computations of their solution sets.  This field is growing rapidly, to the extent that some of the key researchers in the area have never met in person. The MOCCA conference &lt;http://www.uni-magdeburg.de/mocca&gt;, to be held in Levico Terme, Italy for a week in September, 2014, will rectify this situation with an unusual worldwide portfolio of two dozen invited speakers and a particular focus on early career participants; it is the major event in the area of combinatorial commutative algebra in Europe in 2014.  Funding through this grant enables the organizers to support U.S.-based mathematicians traveling to Levico and thus allow these researchers to interact face-to-face with other MOCCA participants, integrating them fully into the international community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MOCCA conference will provide an opportunity for researchers in commutative algebra to interact, exchange ideas, and establish new connections.  Developments are expected in the applications of combinatorics to positive-characteristic methods as well as to representation theory and algebraic geometry.  The two dozen invited speakers have diverse backgrounds broadly covering combinatorial commutative algebra.  Special focus on early-career participants will allow for an active, stimulating, hands-on atmosphere.  With an expected 50 attendees other than the invited speakers, the conference is small enough so that people will know each other while at the same time diverse enough to foster innovation.  The conference is expected to serve as an inspiration to participating students and as a source of new ideas and new colleagues for speakers and participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this project was to support U.S. based researchers to attend the conference "Meeting on combinatorial commutative algebra (MOCCA)", held summer 2014 in Levico Terme, Italy.  In 2014, MOCCA was the main conference for the mathematical field of combinatorial commutative algebra.  The research community in combinatorial commutative algebra is spread all over the world.  Many early-career researchers, who may not have access to significant amounts of travel funding, have already made important contributions to the field.  To have a diverse meeting, it was therefore crucial to be able to support the participants financially.  Through this grant, NSF contributed to the success of the conference by supporting accomodation and travel of 7 researchers from the U.S.  Intellectual Merit: The speakers presented a spectrum of topics in which the field is evolving.  Numerous discussions among speakers and participants led to new connections and fundamental insights. Participants expressed that they very much enjoyed the intellectual atmosphere and the inspiring talks.  Broader impacts: The conference attracted a large number of young participants whose view of the field and outlook on the future were shaped by the conference.  Those involved were particularly happy about the diversity of the speakers and participants, who came from more than 10 countries on four continents; the grant allowed the U.S. participants to benefit from this diversity and bring the international messages -- scientific and otherwise -- home.  More than a quarter of the participants were female.       Last Modified: 09/02/2015       Submitted by: Ezra N Miller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
