<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering, and Materials (SusChEM) Collaborative Research project will allow for experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of Molten Oxide Inductolysis, a new concept that holds the promise to reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and the capital investment required to process metal alloys. This concept relies on the use of electricity (derived from renewable sources) to convert various oxide ore feedstock to metal, allowing for greater flexibility on the raw materials to be used for alloy production. With this concept, it may be possible to use lower grade (i.e. cheaper) feedstock with comparable product quality. This enhanced flexibility, coupled with the potential to operate with less harmful emissions, could impact the return of metal manufacturing in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines electrolysis with inductive heating to eliminate the dependence on resistive heating during processing of high temperature master alloys.  The underlying premise is that it will be possible to decouple the heat-generation processes from the electrolysis process through the use of induction heating. The goal is to balance the energy such that the energy required for the oxide decomposition would be derived from the electrochemical potential difference while induction would provide the other energy needs such as melting and superheating. The proposed work will seek to demonstrate an experimental proof-of-concept for this innovation using a model laboratory reactor system. Future work will address the fundamentals of the process-structure relationships, the development of a comprehensive electrochemical and thermal process model as well as a path to scale-up for Molten Oxide Inductolysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The demand for metals and alloys, stainless steel in particular, has experienced the fastest growth globally among material classes. The stainless steel industry estimates that around 40% of its CO2 impact comes from the carbothermic processing of chromium, implying that the emissions for the chromium extraction for stainless steel applications are actually larger than 5 tCO2/ tCr. New technologies for refractory metals extraction are therefore needed in order to reduce their environmental impact and improve the industry life-cycle.  Molten Oxide Inductolysis (MOI) is an innovative processing approach that offers to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions from refractory metal and alloy production. A proof-of-concept demonstration for iron extraction has been successfully accomplished.  We have experimentally shown the ability to combine the two most energy efficient processing methods for heating (electromagnetic induction coupling) and transforming matter (electrolytic decomposition) to demonstrate synergistic compatibility.  Our research sets the stage for the investigation of the interaction between molten oxide constituents and liquid alloys via electrochemistry. In addition, it describes the fundamental interaction between heat transport and electrochemical phenomena by allowing precise control of both phenomena at temperature in excess of 1800K.  The foreseen use of MOI will allow the production of high melting alloys and metals potentially using only green electricity sources such as from hydroelectric power generation facilities. The independent control of process temperature and reaction rates will increase resource utilization by allowing the recovery of the majority of the components of the oxide feedstocks including the most refractory metals in the liquid state.
