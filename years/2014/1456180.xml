<AbstractNarration>This project will help determine whether the adoption of drug and parole reforms is indicative of a comprehensive shift away from the policies and practices that led to mass incarceration. The findings will contribute to a variety of socio-legal literatures, as well as more policy-oriented discussions regarding the potential and limits of drug law reform as a means of reducing mass incarceration and racial disproportionality in the U.S. criminal justice system.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mixed methods study will analyze changing and potentially contradictory criminal justice practices and policies and the discourse through which the latter are legitimated. Analysis of National Corrections Reporting Program data (2000-2012) will shed light on recent and potentially contradictory trends in prison admissions, sentences, and time served. Compilation of a legislative dataset drawn from the National Council on State Legislatures? Significant State Corrections and Sentencing Legislation reports will identify potentially contradictory trends in criminal justice policy-making. The informal mechanisms that help to account for changing criminal justice outcomes will also be identified through a case study of criminal case processing in King County, Washington.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF support enabled me to involve several graduate students/co-authors in the project, to strengthen the connection between the University of Washington and the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, and to produce several distinct sets of empirical analyses that yield important insights regarding the legal, cultural, and institutional dynamics that are working to sustain mass incarceration.

Our findings indicate that legislative reforms were limited to minor drug offenses, low-level property crimes, and technical parole violations. Moreover, these (quite modest) reforms were often legitimated by reform advocates in terms of the need to preserve resources to more muscularly punish "serious" criminals, especially people convicted of violent crimes.  This article thus identifies the cultural and legal limits of mainstream reform strategies. Our next paper, in press at Law &amp; Policy, analyzes Uniform Crime Report (UCR) and National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) data regarding crime, arrest and prison related trends, from 2007 to 2014 to identify any changes in criminal justice case processing that may also be working to bolster mass incarceration.

In short, other than a notable drop in drug arrests, the criminal justice response to crime actually became stronger during the recent "reform" era despite the widespread adoption of legislative reforms aimed at reducing prison and jail populations.   A third analysis assesses how the intensity of the penal response to crime and arrests varies across urban, suburban and rural areas. The findings show that the use of prisons has eased for non-violent offenses in urban counties, but has increased in suburban and rural counties in the Post-Recession context. We plan to submit this paper to ASR in the fall.   In addition to these empirical analyses, I also authored an essay entitled "The Politics, Promise and Peril of Criminal Justice Reform in the Context of Mass Incarceration" that appeared in The Annual Review of Criminology.   Finally, my research assistants and I have collected and coded samples of King County felony case files from 2000 and 2010.
