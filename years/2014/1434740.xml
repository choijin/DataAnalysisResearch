<AbstractNarration>An award to Pennsylvania State University is made to support a workshop to discuss and develop a community plan for a DNA sequence-based classification of fungi. A large proportion of fungal diversity is only known from DNA sequence fragments, but these taxa cannot be incorporated within current classification systems because their scientific names are not associated with a physical specimen.   This workshop will consider the various technical, analytical and taxonomic/nomenclatural challenges and opportunities for implementing a DNA sequence-based taxonomy of fungi. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be two days in length and will include a total 40 participants.  Participants will include researchers from diverse career stages and types of institution, with at least ten students and post-doctoral researchers, including members from under-represented groups, expected to participate. Workshop management will be handled by a steering committee of six individuals including three women, two faculty from Principally Undergraduate Institutions, and two people from under-represented groups. The workshop will result in: 1) a broadly distributed meeting report, 2) a position paper to be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, and 3) a proposal to modify the International Code for Algae, Fungi and Plants to allow sequence-based classification of fungi. Recommendations from this workshop will not only provide a framework for the classification of fungi using DNA sequence data, but will also serve as a model for the classification of other taxa known only from DNA sequences such as microbes.</AbstractNarration>

The group put forward the following specific recommendations, with the goal of improving fungal SBI and SBC in ways that maximize its impact across diverse disciplines:  1)   Develop community standards for taxon definition: It is recognized that a "one size fits all" approach is not desirable in fungal taxonomy, but groups working on different clades can implement and recommend specific sequence-based tools for classification and identification.  Fungal taxonomists must work with users in mind in developing tools for SBC and SBI, to ensure the highest impact of their work. It is broadly recognized that the major barcode marker for Fungi, the ITS region, is a very useful (but blunt) instrument that merits status as a universal tool for fungal SBI, but it requires judicious use.  Multilocus approaches for SBC and SBI have been very effectively adopted in Fungi, and NGS techniques are well-suited for this approach.  2)   Provide practical provisions for SBC in the Nomenclatural Code:  The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants does not currently permit species description based solely on a nucleic acid sequence without a physical specimen, but that can be changed.
