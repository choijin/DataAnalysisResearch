<AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EBICS (Emergent Behaviors of Integrated Cellular Systems): Virtually Integrated Team Approach (VITA) REU Site seeks to engineer a variety of cell types to work together in functional clusters, or biological machines, that will perform desired tasks. These biological machines have the potential to enhance or even transform our ability to accomplish certain tasks, e.g., detecting and removing unwanted chemical or toxin from a food or drug, monitoring the environment, or mimicking certain aspects of organ function. In addition to the scientific foundational needs addressed by this project, there are U.S. workforce development considerations being addressed, training next generation of U.S. researchers how to communicate and perform multi-disciplinary work, multi-institutional research, and to productively working in collaborative, multi-ethnic, virtual teams, as these formats are progressively being used across all enterprises. To do so, EBICS: VITA REU will immerse scholars into virtual research teams at one of three institutions (Georgia Tech, Univ. of Illinois, or MIT) with an independent project and mentor that contributes to a larger research goal aligned with EBICS grand challenge. Targeted approaches for recruiting cohorts of students traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines (women, underrepresented minority (URM) students, students with disabilities, and students from schools with limited STEM research opportunities) will occur with a set plan in place having already being initiated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project acknowledges the support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers to train the next generation U.S. workforce to function successfully in virtual teams that are multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary, and multi-ethnic. EBICS is an NSF Science and Technology Center addressing the grand challenge of engineering clusters of living cells or biological machines that have desired functionalities and perform prescribed tasks. EBICS is also defining quantitative design principles for creating such machines, and for understanding and controlling the flow of information (genetic, biochemical, mechanical, electrical) within and between cells, in a dynamic, multi-scale fashion. This involves integration of concepts from tissue engineering, systems biology, and synthetic biology, as well as established disciplines such as electrical engineering and computer science; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; biomedical engineering; biology; chemistry. Research and educational activities will incorporate REU scholars into virtual, multi-institutional research Working Groups, with independent projects contributing to a larger research thrust. Video- and tele-conferencing during the research experience will provide committed professional development on presenting in virtual formats.  All virtual teams and REU scholars will travel and meet face-to-face at the annual EBICS retreat to interact with their Working Group, as well as other EBICS faculty from Georgia Tech, Univ. of Illinois, and MIT, EBICS graduate and postdoctoral trainees, providing a broader network far beyond that of just being at one institution. This EBICS:VITA REU will also employ a robust evaluation to validate and document the effectiveness of this new multi-site, virtual team REU model using a value-engaged, educative approach that defines high quality STEM educational programming as that which effectively incorporates cutting edge scientific content, strong instructional pedagogy and sensitivity to diversity and equity issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:   Over the tenure of EBICS:VITA REU site the virtual integrated teams approach (VITA) was implemented across three campuses, Georgia Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. The goals were met:  To provide student experiences of multi-institutional interactions for research and professional development purposes.  To prepare students for acceptance into STEM graduate programs  To use targeted approaches for recruiting cohorts of students that are traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines: women, underrepresented minority (URM) students, and students with disabilities and from schools with limited STEM research opportunities. To recruit students from our minority serving institution partner institutions into the REU program, provide positive, educational, immersive experiences to encourage their successful applications and matriculation into the graduate programs. Summer researchers were exposed to ?team science? and integrated into EBICS projects building multicellular engineered living system, aligned with the goals of the STC Emergent Behavior of Integrated Cellular Systems (EBICS), as a part of a multi-institutional virtual team, to develop collaborative skills aspect of a diverse workforce. To facilitate the management of EBICS research, tele- and videoconferencing systems have been used extensively and integrated into all aspects of EBICS collaborative research. Videoconnections between three campuses. Three videoconferenced meetings to connect EBICS REU scholars at all three institutions were held with a central focus of developing an application for the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. As a perennial reviewer for the NSF GRFP and Panel Chair for Biomedical Engineering review, the PI, Dr. Platt led these discussions with participating input from EBICS trainees that were NSFGRFP awardees.      Broader Impacts  Over the three years, there have been 34 students that participated with 75% of them being URM and 50% being women.  The EBICS REU program also provided a number of professional development activities facilitated by Center staff, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows covering topics including:  Transitioning to graduate school Applying for graduate funding/fellowships Preparing oral and poster presentations MD/PhD programs Career development: What to do after graduation? Tours of Pharmaceutical companies   With the professional development and research opportunities and training provided by EBICS:VITA REU, we have successfully been able to place a number of these students into graduate and professional schools, and others into the scientific/engineering workforce.
