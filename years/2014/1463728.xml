<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Nessan J. Kerrigan of the Department of Chemistry at Oakland University to explore the development of new methods for the synthesis of gamma-lactones.  Gamma-lactones are medicinally relevant compounds, acting as key constituents of many biologically active molecules (e.g., antibiotics and HIV-1 inhibitors) and also with the potential to function as conduits for the synthesis of other biologically interesting molecules. The development of methods to prepare structural motifs commonly found in natural products and biological active synthetics has great importance for both the academic and the industrial sectors, both in pharma and in biotechnology.  The broader impacts of this project also involve technical training of students, from the undergraduate to post-doctoral levels, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three different strategies are being pursued for the development of enantioselective variants of gamma-lactone forming reactions from sulfoxonium salts.  Current methods for the synthesis of gamma-lactones are often characterized by multistep approaches, limited substrate scope, and modest diastereoselectivity or enantioselectivity. The Kerrigan research group has developed a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of gamma-lactones bearing an alpha-quaternary stereogenic center, through the reaction of sulfoxonium ylides, aldehydes and ketenes (the ?3-component reaction?). It features an interesting [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement as the key step. Under this project, the Kerrigan research team plans to explore the scope of the reaction e.g., including an examination of stabilized ylides, semi-stabilized ylides, and monosubstituted ketenes.   Professor Kerrigan's group is investigating enantioenriched aminosulfoxonium salts, chiral Koga amines, and chiral Bronsted acids (chiral hydrogen bond donor catalysts) for asymmetric induction in the gamma-lactone-forming reactions.  Successful development of the project has the potential to provide as it proposes efficient and inexpensive access to a number of desirable 5-membered cyclic synthons.</AbstractNarration>

Broader Impacts:  The PI’s group over the grant period (2015-2019) has consisted of one Ph.D. student, three postdoctoral research associates, and eleven undergraduate student researchers.  Graduate students who have worked on this project have learned a number of important advanced laboratory techniques in pursuing the goals of the project.  They have learned to appreciate reaction development from a mechanistic point of view, and to set up reactions that test mechanistic proposals. Graduate students have gained experience at characterizing compounds, preparing supporting information documents for peer-reviewed publications, and generally learning about the process by which manuscripts are prepared and submitted to journals for peer review.  In addition, graduate students have taken advantage of the opportunity to gain valuable teaching experience through instruction of undergraduates in the research laboratory.  Graduate students have also developed their presentation skills through regular group and joint group meetings in the Department of Chemistry.  Undergraduates have been fully exposed to the scientific culture of a productive research laboratory.  Since summer 2012, the PI’s group has had fifteen undergraduate students involved in the group’s research, with eleven involved since Fall 2015.  Oakland University has provided a formal structured Summer Undergraduate Research Program for the last 15 years.  The PI’s group has participated fully in this program with 4 undergraduate members of our group involved during the summers of 2015-2017.  The benefits to the undergraduate students are considerable.  They are involved in a genuine research program (40-45 hours laboratory work per week for undergraduates) and they also have opportunities to hone their presentation skills.  In the PI’s laboratory, undergraduate students learn advanced synthetic techniques, modern purification methods, and advanced analytical methods.   One Ph.D. student graduated from the group in 2017 &ndash; he is currently working as a postdoctoral research associate at Wayne State University.  Two postdoctoral researchers who worked on this project are now employed as a postdoctoral researcher at Oklahoma State University and visiting professor at Oakland University.  Three undergraduate students who have worked on the project have been accepted into University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, UC Santa Barbara, and Oakland University graduate school.  Four undergraduate students who worked on our previous NSF-funded project attended Medical School (University of Michigan, Ohio University, Wayne State University, and Michigan State University), while another two undergraduate students from our previous project are also thriving, with one working in the quality control department of a local scientific company (Michigan Dynamics) and another attending Chemistry Graduate School (University of Utah).
