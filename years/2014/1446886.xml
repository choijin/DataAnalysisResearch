<AbstractNarration>Over 92 species of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals have developed the ability to store ejaculated sperm in the female reproductive tract for extended periods of time (days to years) with no decrease in its ability to fertilize the ovum. However, in most mammals sperm can be maintained for up to 15 days in the cauda epididymis, but only live for approximately 24 hours after ejaculation. The long term goal of this research is to determine the mechanisms by which sperm can be stored long term in the female reproductive tract of chickens and in the epididymis of the bull, and to utilize the knowledge to develop a cold-chain-free system to allow artificial insemination of domestic farms animals, especially in developing countries that do not have the infrastructure for cryopreservation. A thorough understanding of the proteins that create the microenvironment of the epididymis and chicken semen storage tubules will advance our understanding of how these proteins may enhance membrane integrity to improve long term storage.  Leveraging the new knowledge of the epididymal environment should enable cold-free sperm storage for extended periods, and may have other applications for somatic cell preservation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies supported by this award will utilize 2D LC-MS/MS to compare protein profiles of bovine epididymal sperm and ejaculated sperm to the protein profiles of chicken sperm stored in the female reproductive tract, and determine the mitochondrial activity in each group of sperm. To determine if increased longevity is accomplished through decreased activity. Ejaculated bull sperm will then be washed and cultured in media containing epididymal or chicken proteins at the pH of epididymal sperm to determine changes in sperm kinetics. The PI will recruit one Master's student to be an integral part of this proposal, and will continue to recruit undergraduate students and international interns for research training and direct involvement in the research efforts.  Results from the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through scientific conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[During final maturation, sperm lose their ability to biosynthesize, repair, grow, and divide, thus becoming completely dependent on their external environment.  While in the epididymis, sperm are stored for a long period of time, but upon ejaculation motility is increased and viability is decreased .  However, over 92 species of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals have developed the ability to store ejaculated sperm in the female reproductive tract for extended periods of time (7 days to 7 years) with no decrease in its ability to fertilize.  Through our current studies we have investigated changes in the environment between epididymal fluid, chicken sperm storage tubule fluid (the site in the chicken female tract that stores sperm for extended periods of time), and seminal fluid (the fluid that sperm is in following ejaculation).    When cultured in the same media epididymal sperm stayed motile longer than ejaculated sperm, and when evaluated at the same pH mitochondrial membrane potential was increased in epididymal sperm compared to ejaculated sperm.  We also found that there were 208 proteins identified in epididymal fluid that were not identified in ejaculated fluid (the top pathway identified was involved in mitochondrial function), and 75 proteins identified in ejaculated fluid that were not identified in epididymal fluid (the top pathway identified was involved in motility).  One hundred and three proteins were identified in both for a total of 386 unique proteins identified in the fluid samples.  Proteins were also removed from the sperm to determine differences in the proteins that were directly attached to the sperm.  Among proteins attached to the sperm there were 113 proteins identified from the epididymal samples that were not identified in the ejaculated samples (the top pathway identified was involved in enzyme inhibitor activity), 77 proteins identified from the ejaculated samples that were not identified in epididymal samples (the top pathway identified was involved in enzyme activity with several of these enzymes most active in an acidic environment similar to the uterus when a female is ready to be bred), and 221 proteins identified in both for a total of 411 proteins identified that were attached to sperm.  Furthermore, there were 69 proteins identified attached to sperm that were not identified in fluid samples, and 49 proteins identified in fluid samples that were not identified in the samples attached to sperm.   There were 322 unique proteins identified in the chicken sperm storage tubule fluid samples. Eighty-seven proteins were present in both the chicken pools and the bovine epididymal fluid; thus a large proportion (27%) of proteins were similar between the chicken sperm storage tubule fluid samples and the bovine epididymal fluid samples.  Pathway analysis of these 87 proteins identified enrichment for proteins involved in eukaryotic cell surface binding.  Specifically within this pathway, ANXA5 has been associated with asthenospermia (lack of sperm motility).       To investigate the ability of proteins found in these samples to impact the viability of sperm stored for extended periods of time, semen from 10 bulls was collected and cultured in 1) a commercial extender, 2) a commercial extender plus Mannose, 3) epididymal fluid, 4) epididymal fluid plus mannose, 5) sperm were stripped of proteins and cultured in a commercial extender, or 6) stripped of proteins and cultured in epididymal fluid.  Mannose was chosen because the enzymes needed to utilize mannose were present in both the epididymal fluid and the chicken sperm storage tubule samples.  Sperm were evaluated on days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 10 for motility, velocity, progressive motility, and viability.  Treatment did have a significant impact on the motility of the sperm.  Sperm stripped of proteins prior to culture had decreased motility compared to sperm from which proteins were not removed.  This indicates that it is not only the proteins in the environment (fluid) that impact the sperm but also likely the proteins that are bound to the sperm.  However, curve linear velocity of the sperm that was motile tended to be increased among sperm with proteins stripped and cultured in a commercial extender, indicating that the environmental proteins play a critical role in the speed at which sperm move. Viability of the sperm was also impacted by the treatments.   Sperm cultured in commercial media alone had decreased viability compared to all other treatments.  Commercial media with mannose also had decreased viability compared to epididymal fluid with mannose.  This indicates that mannose alone was not able to increase sperm viability, but when it was paired with epididymal fluid (which contains the enzymes needed to utilize mannose) it was able to increase the viability of sperm.  With further investigation of the proteins identified in the grant, more advances could be made to understand how to store sperm cells for extended periods of time without cryopreservation.
