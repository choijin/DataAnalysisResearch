<AbstractNarration>This REU site award to New York University, located in New York City, NY, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2019. Students will conduct research in neural science -- the study of the biological basis of human nature -- and use their basic knowledge in biology, mathematics, physics and chemistry to solve research problems needing a multidisciplinary approach. A wide variety of projects are available, ranging in scale from the molecular to cellular, and from neuronal network to behavior. Examples of questions students can investigate include: how individuals learn and memorize; what parts of the brain are activated when risky versus carefully calculated decisions are made; how attention modifies perception; how neonatal sensory experience affect mental capacities in adulthood, etc. Students are selected based on their desire to partake in basic research, as well as a match between their expressed topic of interest and those of mentors. The program aims to diversify the workforce in the field of neuroscience by attracting highly motivated individuals interested in pursuing a graduate degree in neuroscience. Students who are underrepresented in the field of neuroscience and have limited research opportunity at their home college/university will be given high priority for the program. For the application process, students will submit a CV and a personal statement describing their research interest in the field of neural science, and obtain two letters of recommendations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that approximately 50 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and students will be required to present their results through a poster and oral presentation at the SURP symposium. Student will also be required to write a scientific paper describing the results of their summer research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system (SALG URSSA). More information is available by visiting http://www.cns.nyu.edu/undergrad/surp/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Chiye Aoki at ca3@nyu.edu) or the co-Director (Dr. Margarita Kaplow at mkaplow@nyu.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this program were to (1) enhance diversity of the students entering a career involving neuroscience research; (2) provide scientific skills, including scientific writing skills; and (3) enhance students’ educational aspirations, confidence and commitment to pursuing a research career path.  This program was offered to students with expressed interest of pursuing a career involving neuroscience research. The NSF-REU funding was provided exclusively to ten non-NYU students per summer, targeting those from under-represented minority backgrounds or with disabilities, first generation to attend college, and/or attending small colleges that could not offer research opportunities in neuroscience. We included students with marginal GPAs or from junior colleges but with recommendation letters and personal statements revealing self-directed, inquisitive minds.   The SURP mentoring was multi-tiered: SURP students conducted research closely with graduate students and post-docs who served as daily mentors, often alongside CNS’s undergraduates, within labs led by PIs with proven effectiveness in mentoring. Mentors received guidance from SURP directors (Aoki and Kaplow) through direct meetings. Directors also met with all SURP undergraduates once per week as a group and one-to-one at least twice.    Intellectual Merit: We attained our Project Goal (2) by providing them with meaningful, hands-on experience in research and confirm that 100% of the students completed all parts of the 10-week program (wrote a research paper, presented the research outcome as a poster and as a public talk at the CNS Symposium)..  Over 10 summer weeks, students were placed in one of the research laboratories that were within CNS or affiliated with the CNS, encompassing departments of Psychology and Biology at NYU and The Neuroscience Institute within NYU’s School of Medicine (NI), and Bellevue Hospital (public hospital with substance abuse rehab services).The Center provided a wide array of research opportunities of the highest quality in the field of neuroscience, spanning from those that focus on molecular to cellular to multiple brain regions to the entire organisms, and relating to behavior and diseases.  Each and every student was provided with guidance to participate in all parts of the research process, beginning with guided literature reading, scientific writing of literature surveys, learning of laboratory techniques and the rationale for particular approaches, data analysis and interpretations, research designing, and practice with oral as well as written presentations. Responsible conducts in research, including the use and care of animals and ethical considerations in using human subjects are taught through reading, discussions and lectures. The Boot Camp taught wet lab techniques, introduced students to neuroscience questions and computer programming. It was offered on a voluntary basis, scheduled as an intense four-day event during the first week of the program.  Students met with others of SURP on a weekly basis to report on progress in research and scientific writing. These weekly meetings provided all SURP students with the glimpse of the highly synergistic nature and societal relevance of neuroscience. In addition to becoming active participants in research design, research execution and data interpretation, students were exposed to a variety of fields within neuroscience by hearing lectures, chatting with mentors that were not assigned to them directly during luncheons and by visiting labs and institutions that hosted the other members of the cohort.     Broader impacts: The center actively selected under-represented minorities in the field of neuroscience, with 46% of the admitted students from small colleges lacking research opportunities in neuroscience, community colleges and historically black colleges, and 45% were of the first generation to attend college, relative to 24% among the applicant pool. The participants of NYU-CNS SURP included those funded by an NIH training grant that was designed to foster entry of students from diverse background into a career path in neuroscience (BP-ENDURE). 67% of the admitted students were under-represented minorities, greatly outnumbering the URM proportion of the applicant pool (26%). 67% of those admitted to the CNS SURP were women, as compared to 30% in the applicant pool. We believe these numbers indicate our success with achieving the Project Goal (1), namely to enhance research opportunities for students to explore this as their career option.  Follow-up of the SURP participants provided indices for our success in achieving the Project Goal (3): enhance students’ educational aspirations, confidence and commitment to pursuing a research career path. Our survey verified that 56% of SURP participants up to 2018 have entered a PhD program in neuroscience and 44% of them identify themselves as URM and 47% were women.  These numbers indicate to us that we were successful in promoting the entry of undergraduates into PhD programs in neuroscience and succeeded in increasing the diversity of the undergraduate population entering PhD programs in neuroscience.
