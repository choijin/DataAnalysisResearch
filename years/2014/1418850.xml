<AbstractNarration>Women are underrepresented in science and technology within research and academic institutions.&lt;br/&gt;Women of the STEM diaspora within the U.S. represent an important element in bringing more women into STEM fields as role models, mentors and peers. This proposed workshop builds on two previous general sessions on the diaspora and focuses the outcome on research collaborations and targeted proposals. The synthesis model is designed to quickly form teams among participants and is outcome focused throughout the workshop session. In addition, the workshop builds on the International Gender Summit (hosted by NSF in 2013) and the Global Diaspora Forum (hosted by U.S. State Department in 2013). Both venues have provided collaborative opportunities for women of the STEM diaspora and it is anticipated that most of the participants will be identified from these two summits. Graduate students and early career women from the diaspora and women of color will be invited to attend the workshop and meet with academic and researchers from the STEM diaspora. Organizers will also use networking survey tools and assessments to explore network characteristics of women in the workshop and use social media tools to follow participants post-workshop and to maintain network connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mobilizing Women of the STEM Diaspora (MW-STEM) workshop has two goals: (1) build global network on women of the STEM diaspora, and (2) provide peer-to-peer and institution-to-institutional mentoring in the development of scientific collaborations. MW-STEM will be hosted in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago, February 2014 and will be co-hosted by the U.S. State Department and AAAS Fellows. The proposed workshop will provide a space where the participants work to a common outcome using facilitated breakout sessions. The MW-STEM agenda is designed around creating teams that first organize around general topic themes: (1) research collaborations; (2) peer mentoring networks; (3) theme and proposal development towards 2014 and 2015 Gender Summits; and (4) white paper/review authorship. Workshop products will be disseminated through (1) proposal development and submission; (2) published review paper on identified issues for women of the STEM diaspora; (3) peer mentoring networks established through LinkedIn and other social media.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Women of the STEM Diaspora grew out of a meeting at the AAAS-NSF hosted Gender Summit in 2013.  The Gender Summits, started in the EU, were a way to bring together women in leadership positions throughout the world to address women in science issues.  One of those issues is to create cross institutional and cross cultural mentoring opportunities where women, espeically women of the diaspora who are often rare in a given department within the sciences, may seek mentorships and collaborations outside of their home departments, institutions and countries.  The MWStem project brought together women scientists from a variety of institutions at AAAS meetings which lead to a series of collaborations among women from different institutions, countries and even scientific disciplines.  One of the those projects generated by such collaborations is the Three Circles Alamet--a joint USAID-NSF funded project with Colorado State University and Jordan Scientific Society. Three Circles is a mentoring project that starts within the Arab world and eventually spreads to the women of the diaspora within the United States. The first circle took place in Jordan, the second included the wider Arab World and Colorado State, and the final circle is scheduled to take place at the UN Commission on the Status of Women in 2017.   MWStem generated partnerships among women scientists of the diaspora to work together to mentor and encourage future women scientists to explore international partnerships and interdisciplinary collaborations.  Women of the Diaspora tend to be isolated and by providing a networking system beyond the boundaries of a single institution, these scientists can advance and succeed in the STEM disciplines.
