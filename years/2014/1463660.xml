<AbstractNarration>Clusters of galaxies are sensitive cosmological probes which can be used to study large-scale structure formation, the physics of diffuse astrophysical plasmas, and dark matter on megaparsec scales.  A better understanding is needed of cluster masses, which rely critically on knowledge of cluster astrophysics, as well as biases and limitations of various measurement methods. This conference provides the opportunity for the astrophysical community to critically examine how all mass estimators can be combined for maximum accuracy in galaxy cluster mass estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will be an excellent opportunity for young astrophysicists to gain information and for them to interact with more experienced researchers in an informal setting. The Scientific Organizing Committee has taken care to include key representatives from underrepresented groups in the invitation list.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award provided support for participants in the SnowCluster 2015 conference " Art of Galaxy Cluster Mass Measurement " held at Snowbird, UT from March 15-20, 2015.  Through NSF and departmental matching funds, support was given to 31 of 120 participants, including 21 graduate students, 10 early career scientists, and 7 self-identified minority participants, and 12 women. The NSF funding was crucial in enabling early career scientists and scientists form under-represented groups to attend this international  conference. The average funding given to each attendee was travel support of $360/person.  The remaining funds were used to support the costs of running the week-long conference.     The conference was the first conference on galaxy clusters in the US since March 2013.  It succeeded in bringing together two previously unconnected subfields within astronomy; the community that studies black holes in galaxies, and those who study transient astronomical events.  This connection was made because in current and upcoming transient surveys, disruptions of stars around black holes will revolutionize the study of black hole demographics.  There was also an even representation of both observers of these phenomenon and theorists who predict and interpret them.  A total of 97 talks were given and 26 posters were put up in the lecture hall and visible all week.  The 120 scientific participants came from 13 countries.
