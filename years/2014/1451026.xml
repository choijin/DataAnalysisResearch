<AbstractNarration>Neuronal circuits in the brainstem are at the "front-end" of sensorimotor loops that underlie behavior and cognitive processing. They control life-sustaining functions that include breathing, movement and balance, sniffing, chewing, suckling in neonates, and, in rodents, whisking. These circuits further drive active sensation through taste, smell, balance, and touch. In this project the PI will delimit the circuits that control different motor actions and show how behaviors emerge as an assembly of these actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "front-end" circuits of orofacial processing control life-sustaining functions that include breathing, movement and balance, sniffing, chewing, suckling in neonates, whisking in rodents, and vocalization. The functions, some of which share common muscles, must occur without compromising the patency of the airway. The control structure is not understood and nontrivial and it will serve as a model for the control and coordination of concurrent neuronal processes at any level in the nervous system.  The application of control theory to nervous systems was proposed by the Cyberneticists of the 1940s to 1960s. These prescient notions were stymied by a lack of experimental tools to identify and control the circuits that underlie behavior. We now have sufficient tools to map brainstem circuits and the PI will exploit the tools of engineering and physics to gain insight into fundamental sensorimotor processes. The technical aspect of the the PI's approach involves the introduction of molecular tools based on the expression of lineage factors and constitutive proteins to identify brainstem neurons and track tracing tools based on trans-synaptic viruses to reveal connectivity The project will contribute to the education and the training of future multidisciplinary scientists through research-based education of undergraduate and graduate students. Technical aspects of work will be broadly disseminated through the involvement of the PIs and colleagues in graduate and post-graduate summer schools.</AbstractNarration>

We examined the underlying neurons that form the control structure of these circuits in rodents, all of which are located in the brainstem.. We found that breathing, which has been previously associated solely with metabolic needs, serves as the underlying clock to coordinate the output of these "front end" circuits. This control structure leads to stereotypical patterns of exploration that involve the motor actions for sniffing, licking, and whisking. The circuitry consists of the oscillator for breathing, discovered back in 1990, that entrains newly discovered oscillators for each motor action. The entrainment leads to a sequence, a dance of sorts, in which the animal bobs it's head upward to pierce a new region of space, sweeps it's vibrissa forward to sense objects, and inhales to smell. Beyond this rhythmic sequence, the "front-end" circuits consists of fast feedback that control the shape of the motion on a cycle-by-cycle basis, much as a dancer is seen to constantly control her or his balance and poise.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/04/2018<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Kleinfeld</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
