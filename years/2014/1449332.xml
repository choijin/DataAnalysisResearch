<AbstractNarration>The Board on Higher Education and the Workforce of the National Research Council will plan and convene a workshop to engage a diverse group of researchers, practitioners, employers, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders in conversations to (1) describe the current status of research in STEM workforce development, (2) discuss and refine priority research themes and topics that will support development of a national STEM workforce strategy, and (3) inform the efforts of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources to establish a STEM Workforce Development track in its Core program. The results of the stakeholder forum will help frame future research priorities and inform the directorate's current and future investments in STEM teaching and learning, interdisciplinary research and training, and broadening participation. It also will suggest research that could support the development of a coherent STEM workforce development strategy for the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With NSF support, the Board on Higher Education and Workforce (BHEW) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a national workshop on September 21-22, 2015 that focused on developing a national STEM workforce strategy.  More than 150 educators, policymakers, researchers, industry leaders, and federal agency officials attended the workshop.  Among the key themes that emerged from the workshop were the following:  There is often a significant gap between the knowledge, skills and abilities most often sought by employers (e.g. data analysis skills and computational skills, problem-solving skills, creativity, and employability skills such as teamwork and communication) and the knowledge, skills and abilities that students bring into the workforce immediately upon graduation. It may be that the traditional boundaries of interdisciplinary focus--reflected in the undergraduate "major" and the graduate area of concentration--are becoming increasingly "blurred," resulting in a need for greater emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches to classroom instruction and labs--as well as extracurricular activities. More work-based learning may be the wave of the future for giving students the rich, experiential, project-based learning activities they need to develop the range of skills required to thrive in the STEM workforce. Equity and diversity were common themes of the workshop, and there was a consensus that more must be done to broaden the participation of underrepresented minority student and women student in STEM fields.  While much has been studied in this space, the significant gaps in enrollment, graduation, and workforce participation remain, and new initiative should be explore to address this issue. Employers should be more involved in helping shape the curricula, labs, and extracurricular activities of students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Internships, fellowships, and other learning activities that engage students in the real world of STEM research and business should become more available to STEM students.   While there were significant conversations at the workshop that can and will drive useful discussions among federal agency officials about the nature and scope of future federal investments in STEM undergraduate and graduate education, more detailed analysis should be done to provide a clearer game plan in the years ahead for agencies such as NSF, NIH, DOD Department of Education, Department of Energy, NASA and others to prioritize their federal STEM investments.
