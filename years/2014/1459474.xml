<AbstractNarration>The sinking of cold, saline water at high latitudes in the Atlantic Ocean and its spread along the sea floor, which is balanced by the return flow of warmer waters at the surface, is known as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). It plays an important role in maintaining Earth?s climate as well as key ocean properties. Labrador Sea overturning is a key component of AMOC, but its magnitude and variability has been difficult to measure accurately. This study will explore whether float observations can be used as a cost-effective way to answer such questions. The project has the potential to enhance and quantify our understanding of the connection between dense water formation and overturning circulation in the Labrador Sea and lead to an improved strategy for continued AMOC sampling.  Information from the study will improve understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of Labrador Sea overturning and export on interannual and decadal timescales. A quality-controlled data set will be available online and incorporated into undergraduate and graduate classes. The project will also support a post doc and facilitate his transition to a more permanent position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Labrador Sea's contribution to the AMOC is relatively unknown and the potential change between the 1900s and 2000s is still uncertain. The primary objective of the project is to quantify the Labrador Sea?s contribution to the AMOC using profiling floats. The mean overturning calculated in a preliminary analysis is in line with previous estimates, suggesting that floats are a viable dataset for examining these aspects of the Labrador Sea. The project will be part of a large ongoing effort to understand AMOC over the next few years and complement OSNAP moored data. Argo and PALACE floats in the Labrador Sea and boundary current have collected data for the past two decades. The Argo floats offer seasonal and spatial data coverage at the basin-wide scale. PALACE floats data from the 1990s allows the opportunity to compare Labrador Sea overturning from two different periods; one of enhanced deep convection in the 1990s, and weaker convection in the 2000s.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, a key component of Earth's climate, is characterized by the northward movement of warm, saline waters at the surface and the southward movement of cool, fresh water at depth.  The Labrador Sea is thought to be one of the primary regions where these warm surface waters are cooled, sink, and begin to move southward at depth.  In this study we use data from autonomous Argo floats (profile locations and float trajectory-derived velocities are shown in the top figure below) to estimate the overturning in the Labrador Sea; that is, how much warm surface water is converted to cool deep water.  Floats offer some advantages over previous observations because they collect observations in all seasons, allowing for an examination of the seasonal signal of the overturning.  We find that the overturning (shown in the bottom figure below) exhibits a pronounced seasonal cycle, essentially tripling over the course of the year.  The largest overturning occurs in spring and corresponds to the outflow of water cooled during the previous winter.  The overturning decreases through summer and reaches a minimum in winter.  This is the first observational estimate of the seasonal cycle of Labrador Sea overturning.  The mean overturning is relatively small, suggesting that, over the course of a year, the Labrador Sea?s contribution to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is small. The large seasonal variability in the overturning implies that sustained observations that resolve the seasonal signal will be needed to monitor long term changes in the overturning.
