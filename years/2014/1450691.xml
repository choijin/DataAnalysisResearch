<AbstractNarration>This award will emable the participation of students and early-career professionals in the conference, Shaping the Developing Brain:  Prenatal through Early Childhood, to be held November 11 - 13, 2014 at the New York Academy of Sciences in New York City. This multidisciplinary conference will convene leading researchers with expertise in the fundamental stages of early brain development, and will include exploration of the connection between research and improved outcomes for children. Conference sessions will present the latest discoveries regarding the development of human learning and memory, emotion, and social behavior in the first few years of life and explore socioeconomic, family, and nutritional factors that can influence both brain and behavior.  Discussion topics will include implications for educational practices, health and nutrition practices, applied research, and government policy with the potential for enhancing healthy brain development and assisting children with, or at risk for, developmental delays and disorders.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a competitive application process, travel and registration fellowships, underrepresented minority fellowships, and child care grants will be awarded to 23 students, postdoctoral fellows, junior investigators, and recent graduates in science, medicine, psychology, education, and public health. Fellowships and grants will be awarded to applicants based on a written description of need, the relevance of their work to the conference topics, and letters of recommendation. Applicants who received high marks on their research abstracts to present during the conference poster sessions will be given priority.  Participation in the conference will provide opportunities for outstanding individuals in the initial stages of their careers to interact with and gain insight from senior researchers, promoting future collaborations addressing the cognitive and behavioral development of the nation's most vulnerable children.</AbstractNarration>

To advance the field, it is imperative to convene fora that facilitate discussions combining multidisciplinary avenues of research. As a child grows, massive changes take place in brain connectivity and plasticity. Deepening our understanding of the connection between a childÆs early behavioral milestones and their brainÆs structural and neural development is a critical first step for promoting healthy brain development and improving treatments for developmental and learning disorders. Social and family relationships, socioeconomic status, stress, nutrition, and other environmental experiences produce lasting effects on the brain and impact how children will respond to adversity, interact with their peers, and whether they will succeed in school and throughout their lives. One strategy to help children from all backgrounds have better learning experiences before entering school involves closing the "word gap" &mdash; by as early as three years of age, children who are born into early-life poverty can have a deficit of 30 million words, leading to poor performance in school and a lifetime "achievement gap." This forum aimed to address these challenges by bringing together leaders in the field to develop strategies for fostering healthy childhood brain development.  Speakers presented the latest discoveries from neuroscience and experimental psychology regarding typical and atypical development of human learning and memory, emotion, and social behavior in the first few years of life.
