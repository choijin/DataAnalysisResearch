<AbstractNarration>Proteins carry out many different tasks that are necessary for life.  The specific task performed depends on the 3-dimensional structure of the protein molecule.  In nature, a protein's structure can be purposely altered through interaction with ions, like calcium, or by chemical modifications, such as adding a sugar group.  Even though it is predicted that most proteins have sugars attached to them, forming so-called glycoproteins, only a small proportion of the 100,000+ protein structures studied by scientists are glycoproteins.  To understand how attached sugars alter the structure of a calcium-binding protein, the effects of the attached sugars must be systematically investigated.  Understanding the synergistic effects of the sugar, calcium, and protein will allow investigators to study the function of these unique protein shapes and to predict the structure of similar glycoproteins.  Graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be recruited for this project.  They will acquire specialized training in protein chemistry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, NSF-EPSCoR and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division are funding Dr. Megan Macnaughtan from Louisiana State University to determine the synergistic effects of calcium binding and glycosylation on the structure of the mouse Notch1 Abruptex region.  The structure and function of epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, like those in the Notch1 Abruptex region, are regulated by highly conserved glycosylation and calcium-binding sites.  The effects of high-affinity calcium-binding sites on the structure of tandem EGF repeats has been well-studied, but the synergistic and singular effects of glycosylation have not been systematically investigated.  EGF repeats 26-28 of the Notch1 Abruptex region will be studied to determine the calcium dissociation constants and the structural changes upon sequential glycosylation using fluorescence spectrophotometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The high-resolution 3-dimensional structure of calcium-bound, glycosylated EGF26-28 will be determined using NMR to identify important interactions.  By defining the interactions between calcium, the glycans, and the protein, new insights into the structure of other glycosylated EGF repeats and the regulation of EGF repeat function will be revealed, impacting the fields of structural biology and cellular signaling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientists have found small protein regions, called epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, in long chains that extend from the surface of cells and allow two neighboring cells to transmit signals.  Enzymes modify the repeats in specific patterns with sugars in a process called glycosylation.  The repeats also bind calcium at predictable sites.  These features regulate the activity of the signaling chain.  Our understanding of how glycosylation changes signaling is an emerging field to which outcomes from this project have contributed.  We focused on developing methods to produce EGF repeats and studying the effects of glycosylation on EGF repeats (EGF25, EGF26, and EGF27) from a protein called Notch 1.  We identified that adding the native disaccharide, GlcNAc-&beta;(1-3)-Fuc-&alpha;-O, to EGF27 changed the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of EGF27 at the atomic level.  In order to understand the chemical interactions that cause this change, an atomic-level 3D structure must be determined.  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is an excellent technique for structure determination, especially for glycosylated proteins that can be difficult to analyze with other techniques.  In order to use NMR to analyze the EGF repeats, we must produce milligram quantities of the repeat.  Our group tested methods for producing EGF repeats using E. coli cells to express protein from recombinant DNA.  While these methods are standard, the EGF repeats are difficult to express because each repeat has three disulfide bonds that must form in a specific order.  We tested many methods and successfully produced a tandem repeat, EGF25-26, and a single repeat, EGF27, each with the proper disulfide bond arrangement.  The quantities are still limiting the determination of 3D structures, so further optimization is ongoing.  In addition to the scientific outcomes of this project, the development of human resources and impacts on society are significant outcomes of this project.  The award supported the training and professional development of three undergraduate students, four graduate students, and one post-doctoral student.  Of these eight individuals, four are African American and six are female, advancing the desired societal outcome of increasing the number of underrepresented minorities and female scientists in bioanalytical chemistry.  We also organized several outreach activities for pre-Kindergarten to 12th grade students during the award period, sharing hands-on science activities with approximately three thousand students and their parents.
