<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore surfaces capable of producing terahertz (THz) waves for novel detection and sensing applications. These surfaces have micron scale patterns that produce changes in light beam reflected from them. With proper design it is expected that these metasurfaces, will lead to THz light waves. The THz portion of the electromagnetic spectrum represents a frontier for multidisciplinary fundamental research in engineering, physics, and materials science with enormous potential impact on imaging and sensing. The proposed research will enhance the outreach programs that PI has built at the University of Alabama. PI has been active in education program for under representative minorities, veterans, and K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research can potentially lead to a new paradigm for imaging and sensing in the THz frequency region, by enabling new classes of optics components, which can replace conventional bulky counterparts for integrated optical devices. The proposed research will also lead to a new class of metasurfaces and planar photonics with the ability to operate in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, the proposed research will be able to disclose properties of optical orbital angular momentum, and its direct application to the sensing and imaging that can open whole new concepts of imaging and sensing technologies. The approach is to investigate the role of helical waves in multiple different modes for sensing biomolecules which have high chirality, and in imaging of complex media with both far-field and near-field high resolution. Based on this research, the PI will develop a new course, Metamaterials and Waves, for undergrads and graduates.</AbstractNarration>

The Terahertz (THz) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, between 0.3 and 20 THz represents a current frontier for multidisciplinary fundamental research in engineering, physics, materials science, chemistry, biology, and medicine with enormous potential in application of imaging and sensing. This proposed research and outcome of the work can potentially lead to a new paradigm for imaging and sensing in the THz frequency, by enabling new classes of optics components, including flat lenses, waveplates, and surface wave couplers, which can create new types of optics and replace conventional bulky counterparts for integrated optical devices. The proposed research leads to a new class of metasurfaces and planar photonics with the ability to operate in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The project awarded made us to have a better fundamental understanding of how photon orbital angular momentum can be manipulated through the metasurfaces by both experimentally and by simulation and can disclose some properties of optical orbital angular momentum, and its direct application to the sensing and imaging. The proposed research will be able to ample the outreach programs that PI has built at the University of Alabama.

The PI will leverage 1) developing a new course, Metamaterials and Waves, for undergrads and graduates, which is lacking in current curriculum, 2) hosting summer REU students and high school internship program, 3) engaging an E-day hosted by College of Engineering for demonstration and open house activities for local high school students.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impact: </span></strong>The proposed research were able to ample the outreach programs that PI has built at the University of Alabama.

Three graduate students were successfully trained as a workforce in this area of the research. One started this project with design and simulation as part of his dissertation research and successfully defended his PhD and graduate in the last period. During this process, he was well trained in THz technology, in terms of simulation and experiments, presented his work in the numerous conference and published more than 20 articles. Second student who received fellowship from the Tri-campus Material Science PhD program at the University ofAlabama successfully finished his Master&rsquo;s. The award also supported new female graduate student to start her graduate work at University of Alabama. Thanks to the REU supplements from the grant, we could have two REU undergraduate students, Ms. Brianna Smiley majoring Physics, and Ms. Amanda Marotto majoring Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Alabama. Both are very talented and smart, and devoted their times on research to understand the operating principles and probe the biosensing using THz spectroscopy and metasurfaces.
