<AbstractNarration>Globalization of trade means the United States is under constant threat of invasion by foreign plant species, which, once established, can become invasive weeds. Such weeds can sometimes be managed through biocontrol, by importing insect enemies from their ancestral land. Impacts of an ancestral enemy on its host plant in new environments depend on the toxicity of the weed's chemical defenses and the efficacy of the insect's detoxification enzymes. Wild parsnips and parsnip webworms, both native to Europe, were accidentally introduced to North America and co-occur across the continent. This project will determine how the parsnip's chemical defense profile and the webworm's detoxification enzyme profile coevolve in response to each other and local conditions. This reciprocal adaptation may involve re-use of the same genetic variants or it may require different variants in different places. Understanding which of these options is most common can inform both basic research on the patterns and processes of coevolution and agricultural research about how invasive plants either escape from or succumb to herbivores. This project builds on past NSF funded research and will provide diverse training and outreach opportunities for students and the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expression of cytochrome P450 detoxification genes in webworms and of cytochrome P450 biosynthetic genes in parsnips will be assayed by RNAseq in samples from different populations. Differentially expressed genes, their allelic variants, and their impact on chemical defense and detoxification will be characterized in parsnips and webworms across their range.  Genotyping-By-Sequencing, another genome-enabled method, will be used to identify molecular polymorphisms in the interacting genomes in multiple environments. These data will be statistically analyzed to determine if these species re-use the same genetic variants when they interact or whether different genetic variants in different locations permit coadaptation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Unlike most forms of global environmental change, the impacts of invasive species&mdash;organisms that expand their range from their native areas to non-native areas&mdash;can be immediate, profound, and irreversible. Because in new habitats invasive species rarely encounter the range of natural enemies that keep them in check in their places of origin, they can spread rapidly, attacking or outcompeting native species and causing economic or even physical harm to humans. Over 6,600 nonnative species have become established in the USA; costs of controlling just the invasive weeds is estimated to exceed $100 million annually. The science of ecology has yet to establish a reliable framework of principles for understanding why certain plant species are successful invaders or how they can be controlled. One approach that has been successful in some cases has been to import natural enemies of the invaders from their country of origin. This approach, called classical biocontrol, requires many years of research, entailing traveling to the country of origin to identify insects that suppress population growth of the plant in its native habitat, testing the hostplant-specificity of the natural enemy (to insure that it won&rsquo;t attack any native plants), and developing techniques for mass-rearing and releasing the insects in the hope that they will become established and control the invasive weed.</p> <p>The wild parsnip is a particularly noxious invasive weed, an import that accompanied European settlers 400 years ago and that is now found throughout much of North America. &nbsp;Very few North American insects can eat wild parsnip&mdash;the plant produces chemicals called furanocoumarins that are toxic to a broad range of organisms. In humans, this toxicity is manifested as phytophotodermatitis; casual contact with the plant induces painful, unsightly blisters. About 150 years ago, another European species arrived unexpectedly&mdash;the parsnip webworm, <em>Depressaria pastinacella</em>, a caterpillar that feeds exclusively on the flowers and seeds of wild parsnip and its close relatives, called cow&ndash;parsnips. The webworm quickly colonized much of North America, appearing wherever wild parsnips are found. Webworms thrive on wild parsnips by virtue of a diversity of behavioral and biochemical adaptations to circumvent the toxic effects of furanocoumarins. Parsnip webworms and wild parsnips thus constitute a &ldquo;natural experiment&rdquo; in biocontrol that has been in progress for much longer than any human-designed biocontrol project. Our study was aimed at examining this interaction to identify the genes that allow webworms to thrive on their toxic hosts and parsnips to withstand the attacks of their webworms enemy. Many of these genes belong to the same family&mdash;the cytochrome P450s, which in plants biosynthesize toxins and in insects break them down.</p> <p>In this project, we set out to identify webworm P450 genes that encode enzymes that help detoxify furanocoumarins and parsnip P450 genes that encode enzymes that help synthesize furanocoumarins, and to characterize how these genes vary in response to the reciprocal selective pressures experienced by these two interacting species. To identify webworm P450 genes, we sequenced its genome and found 79 P450 genes, only a handful of which are selectively upregulated, or turned on, by furanocoumarins. We used a bacterial assay system to express the enzymes encoded by these genes and discovered that, in comparison with other insect P450s, they are remarkably specific in their activity, each breaking down a subset of the six furanocoumarins produced by wild parsnip with unprecedented efficiency. Across the geographic range of this interaction, these furancoumarin-metabolizing genes enzymes differ in the extent to which they vary in structure; variation appears to increase when furanocoumarin concentrations are low and selection pressures less intense.</p> <p>Ironically, in the course of this work, we discovered two more invasive species new to Illinois. One is the parasitic wasp <em>Copidosoma sosares</em> from Europe, where its only known host is the parsnip webworm. Although established in the western USA for years, it has never before been reported in the eastern USA. We sequenced its&nbsp; RNA and made these sequences available for use by the scientific community. Also new to the Midwest are caterpillars of the purple carrot-seed moth, <em>Depressaria depressana</em>, which we found feeding on parsnip seeds. Although closely related to parsnip webworms, these caterpillars, native to Europe, feed not just on two members of the carrot family but on at least a dozen species. We investigated whether this insect poses a threat to any of our native plants in the carrot family and identified at least two enemies (parasitic wasps) in the Midwest that might limit its spread. We have also identified variants in wild parsnip genes involved in furanocoumarin biosynthesis and shared these with the scientific community. In addition to publishing our research in scientific journals, we have presented our findings to the general public in multiple venues; we also routinely answer queries from the press and the public about wild parsnips, furanocoumarins, and invasive species in general.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2018<br>      Modified by: May&nbsp;R&nbsp;Berenbaum</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457731/1457731_10361848_1535635802270_Parsnipwebwormonparsnip--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457731/1457731_10361848_1535635802270_Parsnipwebwormonparsnip--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Parsnip webworm on parsnip"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457731/1457731_10361848_1535635802270_Parsnipwebwormonparsnip--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Parsnip webworm on parsnip"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The parsnip webworm feeds on the flowers and seeds of the wild parsnip.
