<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award concerned the area of mathematics known as number theory.  In number theory, mathematicians are interested in understanding the solution sets to systems of polynomial equations, when the coefficients of these equations are rational or whole numbers.  The way mathematicians understand these solution sets are varied: they attempt to understand which and how many rational numbers solve the equations; they try to understand the solution sets geometrically; they try to understand their symmetry; and they try to uderstand certain analytic objects called L-functions that are attached to these systems of equations.      Broadly speaking, this award concerned the problem of finding upper bounds on the number of solutions to a system of polynomial equations in certain interesting cases, and finding upper bounds on a generalization of this solution set called a "Selmer group".  More specifically, this project concerned the construction and analysis of "Euler systems", which are powerful technical tools that can be used to bound the sizes  of these solution sets or Selmer groups. Only a handful of Euler systems  are known, although they are believed to exist is some generality.     In the project application, the PI proposed to study Euler systems by virtue of their connection to a much better undertood (yet still somewhat mysterious) phenomenon in representation theory called the Rankin-Selberg method.  Many of the key mathematical outcomes of this award were in this direction.  In one joint work with Shrenik Shah, completed under this award, the PI gave good theoretical evidence for the existence of one Euler system.  (In technical language, this work concerned the group GSp(6).)  In two other joint projects with Shrenik Shah, started under this award, the PI gave strong theoretical evidence for two more Euler systems.  (In technical language, these projects concerned the groups GU(2,1) and GU(2,2).)  These papers show the connection between Euler systems and the Rankin-Selberg method, exactly as predicted by the PI in the project application.  Futhermore, they can be used as "roadmaps" by other researches for the future development of these and other Euler systems.     In addition to the results above, the PI also worked on other projects under the tenure of this award.  This included work on what are called "Siegel modular forms", and a developing area of algebra and number theory called "arithmetic invariant theory".     During the tenure of the award, the PI was a junior mathematician.  This award contributed to the development of human resources by enabling the PI to obtain substantial professional development in both research and teaching.
