<AbstractNarration>This funding establishes a new Research Experience for Teachers (RET) Site at Polytechnic University of New York (NYU-Poly). The primary objective of this RET site is to engage high school teachers in cyber security related activities and involve them in introducing a topic of critical national need to students. The project will introduce a cadre of teachers to the basic concepts of cyber security and engage them in ongoing research projects at NYU-Poly. The teachers and their students will participate in a nationwide high school forensics challenge. The NYU-Poly RET team has an outstanding track record of achievements in cyber security research, education, outreach, capacity building, and K-12 educational initiatives. The team plans to provide research and professional development opportunities to teachers from urban, inner city schools and broadly disseminate the curricular materials the teachers design to bring the cyber-security topics and their research into classrooms in the greater New York City area. Thus the project will develop a community of teachers and students who are passionate about cyber security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is abundant in intellectual strengths anchored by a research area this is compelling and relevant to all citizens and by an exceptional faculty team that has demonstrated expertise in both research and K-12 outreach. The site features projects that are teacher accessible as well as connected to current research and practice. The RET site includes sound evaluation and dissemination plans that may provide models for secondary cyber security education, filling an important disciplinary gap. The project could help establish a sustainable/scalable pathway to an abundant group of US computer scientists proficient in the next generation of cyber security concepts and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has many broader impacts. The project will provide professional development to teachers from urban, inner-city high schools with socially diverse, economically disadvantaged, and underrepresented student populations. Teachers will develop and hone their research, communication, and presentation skills, all of which are essential to their professional growth and success. The project will build the technical capacity of teachers so they are capable of developing and deploying cyber security topics at their schools. The project team will disseminate the results of the project through the TeachEngineering digital library, tutorials, and course materials for adoption by others.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary objective of this  proposal  was to engage high school teachers in cyber security related activity during a  summer camp at NYU.  Over a period of four years 39 teachers participated in the summer camp. 15 of the participants were women and 13 were underrepresented minorities. The summer camp first  trained the high school teachers in the basic concepts of cyber security (2 weeks online and 2 weeks on campus) and engaged them for four weeks in ongoing research projects at NYU. Help was  provided to them  to create learning modules that introduced cyber security concepts in their classrooms. Some of the teachers and their students collaborated in research as well and presented their results in a conference.  In its four years the project accomplished the following:  1) The project provided professional development opportunities to teachers from primarily urban, inner-city middle and high schools with socially diverse, economically disadvantaged, and underrepresented student body.  2) Teachers developed and honed their research, communication, and presentation skills, which are critical to their professional growth and success. During the summer camp the teachers had to present atleast twice to their colleagues and NYU students and faculty.  They attended frequent presentations (2 to 3 a week) by faculty and students on state of the art topics in cyber security.    3) The project built technical capacity of teachers so that they become capable of developing and deploying cyber security topics at their schools. Many teachers created cyber security related clubs in their school. Many created and mentored teams of students to participate in very high profile national competitions such as CyberPatriot and CSAW.  Some teachers organized trips for their classes to NYU during CSAW finals.  Somer teachers invited graduate students from NYU to present at their schools to inspire their students interest in cyber security.   4) Teachers disseminated their results by publishing the cyber security modules they created  or by presenting their research results at a conference.   The government and private sectors have repeatedly emphasized the critical need for trained cyber security professionals.   There has been an increasing understanding in the academic community that any scalable and sustainable effort to grow the workforce in cyber security cannot ignore pre-college students. By engaging high school teachers in a cyber security research experience and by using them to introduce students to the challenges of cyber security, this project could ultimately help in establishing an abundant domestic supply of computer scientists who are proficient with the next generation of cyber security concepts and techniques.
