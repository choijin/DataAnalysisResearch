<AbstractNarration>This project involves comprehensive observational studies, guided by state-of-the-art modeling, to quantify gravity wave (GW) momentum transport and the instability dynamics that drive energy and momentum deposition and GW spectral evolution in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region. The observations will build on recent successes by this team employing an Advanced Mesosphere Temperature Mapper (AMTM), the Weber Wind and Temperature sodium lidar, and other correlative instrumentation operated at the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR) in northern Norway (69.3oN). These earlier correlative measurement capabilities have demonstrated an excellent potential to quantify GW momentum fluxes, and the GW characteristics that account for these fluxes, to a degree not possible with traditional airglow imagers or wind profiling radars or lidars. As such, this program represents a new frontier in the community's ability to measure, explore and understand small-scale GW and instability dynamics in the MLT that directly impact the Space-Atmospheric Interaction Region (SAIR) of prime importance to the NSF Aeronomy and CEDAR programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will continue to employ the high-quality correlative wintertime measurement capabilities at ALOMAR and will include extensive summertime Na lidar and AMTM measurement capability recently available at Bear Lake Observatory (BLO) and the nearby Utah State University (USU) campus (41.9oN). Together these two data sets will provide an excellent measure of the different geophysical forcing effects on the high- and mid-latitude MLT region. These facilities provide the best potential for multiple correlative data sets, given the on-site access to lidar operators. These proven measurement capabilities will also facilitate estimates of the spatial and temporal scales of the GW packets, accounting for mean forcing and the generation of secondary GWs, which are largely unknown at present, but are needed for understanding and parameterizing GW effects in weather, climate, and general circulation models addressing both research and societal needs. The measurements from these two stations, if successful, will provide the necessary inputs for a realistic model development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This small (2-year, $40,000) grant supported analyses of gravity wave dynamics at very high altitudes (in the mesosphere at ~80-90 km). Gravity waves have major influences in the atmosphere, and are thus important to understand in order to better predict weather and avoid or anticipate significant risks, among them strong turbulence posing hazards to aviation and strong downslope winds that can impact communities in the lee of major mountains.  The mesosphere is an ideal place to observed these dynamics, given their large spatial scales and instruments that can provide the needed observations. Such studies address needs at lower altitudes because the dynamics are similar throughout the atmosphere, but they are often much more challenging or expensive to measure at lower altitudes.  This study contributed to a better understanding of gravity wave momentum transport and deposition, and the instabilities leading to turbulence that underly these dynamics. Such improvements in our understanding of these dynamics are also needed to allow better descriptions of their effects in global weather prediction models.  The measurements enabling these studies were performed at multiple sites having ground-based instruments allowing us to probe the high altitudes at which these dynamics are most easily observed. These were at locations in northern Norway, in the mountains of northern Chile, and at an observatory in Utah operated by Utah State University.
