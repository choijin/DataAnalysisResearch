<AbstractNarration>This project will conduct research that will inform future development and national dissemination of geospatial resources, materials, and tools for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (STEM) teacher preparation.  The project will respond to opportunities created by the recent announcement of Esri, the world's largest supplier of geographic information system (GIS) software and geodatabase management applications, to donate free ArcGIS Online software licenses to schools in support of the ConnectED initiative.  This project will draw on key recommendations for improving research, professional development, and assessment in geography education developed through the Road Map Project coordinated by the National Geographic Society.  The researchers will develop a model set of resources, materials, and tools that teaches a variety of spatial thinking and problem-solving skills and that reinforces cross-curricular applications of GIS.  The research will set the stage for future longitudinal research with trained teachers as they enter the workforce and implement their training in schools.  The project will address immediate needs to provide teachers with geospatial resources, materials, and tools while pursuing important research measures for long-term reform and improvement of STEM teacher education.  This project therefore will contribute to the development of the capabilities of teachers nationwide to use geospatial data and technology for STEM instruction, thereby assisting their students in gaining essential geographical knowledge and geospatial skills for the 21st century workforce.  The project will be a collaborative effort between the Association of American Geographers and the Texas State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of this project, the researchers will create and evaluate the effectiveness of a prototype web-based set of geospatial resources, materials, and tools that introduces STEM pre-service and in-service teachers to fundamental geographic and spatial concepts for effective teaching with ArcGIS Online.  The prototype resources, materials, and tools will be built using ArcGIS Online data, student-collected datasets, and other geospatial technologies to present compelling examples of teaching STEM content in the context of geographical problems.  This prototype will illustrate for teachers how to develop inquiry-based lessons that support STEM education standards.  Emphasis will be placed on the interdisciplinary characteristics of the resources, materials, and tools for fostering teachers' abilities to support spatial thinking skills and geographic inquiry across the curriculum.  During the second part of this project, the researchers will use the prototype geospatial resources, materials, and tools to conduct pre- and post-tests, surveys, and interviews with the participating teachers.  Data collection will focus on measuring change in teachers' perceptions of using geospatial resources, materials, and tools for improving STEM teacher professional development in three domains of practice:  (1) technological knowledge, (2) pedagogical knowledge, and (3) disciplinary content knowledge.  The researchers also will gather data about changes in spatial thinking and analytical skills of the teachers themselves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Context  From the latest smartphone apps that enable parents to track their children on the way home from school, to the worldÆs most sophisticated climate models and emergency response systems, the ability to think and work with geospatial concepts, data and technology has never been more crucial to life, work and citizenship. One indicator of this "geospatial revolution" can be found in the rapidly evolving and expanding geospatial technology industry and the exciting and rewarding career opportunities it provides. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, employment of geographic information scientists, technicians and analysts is forecast to grow rapidly over the coming decade, with upwards of 15,000 additional employees needed annually through 2022.   Serious concerns, however, exist among educators and U.S. government officials as to whether these critical workforce needs can be met without transformative interventions in K-12 education. A study published in October 2015 by the Government Accountability Office notes that "&hellip;throughout the country, K-12 students may not be acquiring adequate skills in and exposure to geography, which are needed to meet workforce needs in geospatial and other geography-related industries".  In response to these challenges, funding under this grant was used to launch the GeoSpatial Teaching Enrichment Modules (GeoSTEM) project. GeoSTEM's goal is to help teachers of math, science, geography and social science learn how to teach with geospatial concepts, data and technology.  Teacher Education resources  The GeoSTEM produced a prototype module on the topic of water resources. The module features ArcGIS Online, a powerful yet easy-to-use technology for mapping and spatial analysis. All U.S. schools are eligible to receive free ArcGIS Online accounts through the Esri-ConnectED program.  The project also supported planning for additional GeoSTEM modules on the topics of precision agriculture, tornado alley, and urban heat islands. All GeoSTEM modules are designed to illustrate for teachers the many ways ArcGIS Online and other geospatial technologies can support instructional goals across the curriculum. By completing a GeoSTEM module, teachers will gain ideas for using spatial concepts to teach content and create activities that enhance the spatial thinking abilities of their students.  Research  Formative testing of the prototype water resources module was conducted in three methods courses (a total of four sections) with 65 pre-service teachers during the spring 2015 semester at Texas State University. Two sections were a Mathematics methods course, one section was a Science methods course, and one section was a Geography course. A week prior to the lesson, a pre-test of geospatial thinking skills was implemented using a previously validated and reliable assessment of geospatial thinking. After the lesson, the post-test was implemented. The analysis found significant and positive effects on the participating teachers' geospatial thinking abilities.  Another research objective was to acquire baseline data of teacher and student performance in math, science and social science/geography in Texas, as precedent for a longitudinal research program that will measure the impact of GeoSTEM training on teacher candidates at Texas State University over successive years. GeoSTEM researchers examined the TExES certification test data for the elementary, middle and high school tests that examine teacher candidatesÆ knowledge in those subject areas. GeoSTEM researchers also examined the percentage of questions answered correctly on the state assessments associated with math, science and social science/geography.
