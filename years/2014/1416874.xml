<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes applications ranging from peak load shifting, grid buffering for renewable energy input, frequency regulation, and chemical conversions.  As the percentage of energy from renewables on the grid increases, energy storage will be essential to stabilize the supply and demand.  Currently, 20-40% of wind energy is often stranded due to the inability to capture the energy in the peak generation periods.  Germany, Europe, Japan, Korea, and other countries are funding significant efforts in energy storage projects.  Energy storage is also a critical need for all of the United States armed services, including microgrids for forward operating bases and other off grid installations.  While batteries can demonstrate very good round trip efficiencies, they suffer from self-discharge, capacity fade, and high cost.  Flow batteries separate the reactant and product storage from the electrode active area, enabling higher capacities through merely adding more storage.  Many systems have not been practical in the past due to low energy density values, but fuel cell and electrolysis developments have provided pathways to higher energy density.  Advances in these areas would find immediate commercial interest, and address key strategic areas related to energy security and grid stabilization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project addresses the present technology gaps in flow battery cell stack design to enable a reliable, efficient, high rate hydrogen-bromine flow battery for energy storage applications.  The goal of this project is a proof of concept hydrogen bromide stack that operates at a practical hydrogen storage pressure in electrolysis mode, while providing acceptable energy density in fuel cell mode.  The majority of hydrogen bromine flow battery research to date has focused on the discharge reaction, leading to material choices that may not be practical for the charging mode.  This project will demonstrate feasibility of sealing and supporting thin membranes to practical storage pressures.  Objectives include demonstration of differential pressure electrolysis with materials that can support high power fuel cell mode, determining the bromine/bromide crossover rates as a function of hydrogen back pressure, and exploring compatible materials for the full flow battery system.  Going beyond the Phase I funded effort, research being planned will include cell stack design optimization, down-selection of appropriate materials, and prototype system development for charge battery cycling.  The anticipated result will be a highly efficient flow battery system with durability in charge mode and high power density in discharge mode for a cost effective energy storage system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In Phase 1 of this project, Proton Energy Systems, Inc. d/b/a Proton OnSite ("Proton") demonstrated feasibility of developing a hydrogen-bromine electrolyzer which produces hydrogen at elevated pressure.  The device is based on proton exchange membrane cells, which enable separation of the reactants and products as they are produced.  Hydrogen bromide is fed to the anode side of the cell where it is oxidized, generating bromine and protons.  The protons selectively cross the membrane and are then recombined to form pure hydrogen gas on the other side of the membrane.  The outlet stream can be pressurized by putting a back pressure regulator on the outlet port so that the electrochemically generated hydrogen pressure builds up to the regulator value.  Thus, pure hydrogen is formed and compressed.  The cell can either be used as a flow battery, or purely for hydrogen and bromine production for industrial purposes.  The advantage of this technology over traditional water electrolysis is the efficiency of the bromine reaction, which reduces the energy required for hydrogen production while producing another value-added chemical.  The Phase 1 goals were to design and build a pressurized test system for safe operation, demonstrate durability of the cell at elevated pressure, and investigate new catalysts and membranes to reduce catalyst poisoning due to bromine crossover at the hydrogen electrode.  Several significant advancements were achieved in the course of the 12 month project.  First, a new bench scale test system was built and passed a comprehensive safety review.   The system was designed to feed liquid hydrogen bromide to the cell and generate 400 psi high purity hydrogen.  Second, new membranes from Vanderbilt University were demonstrated to have lower bromine crossover than the baseline commercial membranes, while maintaining proton conductivity.  Third, new catalysts from Kansas University were demonstrated to have increased robustness to bromine exposure, while achieving similar hydrogen production efficiencies to platinum.  Finally, the cell stack design was modified for bromine compatibility and was operated with baseline membranes and catalysts as well as the advanced materials.  The cell showed good early stability and performance similar to state of the art hydrogen-bromine flow batteries which were not designed for elevated pressure hydrogen.  The advanced design also enabled cost reduction vs. the water electrolysis cell.  This technology represents an alternative to current solutions for energy storage, which is becoming increasingly important as renewable energy penetration on the electrical grid grows.  Flow batteries in general are attractive from a scalability perspective, and hydrogen bromine is one of the lower cost chemical systems.  The hydrogen bromine system also has the advantage of enabling cross-linking between infrastructures such as the electrical grid, transportation grid, and chemical processing, for added flexibility and deployability of the captured energy.  Finally, electricity is the major lifecycle cost for hydrogen production via electrolysis, which is reduced by over one third by replacing the oxygen electrode with bromine.  Advances in these areas have immediate commercial interest, and address key strategic areas on the government agenda related to energy savings and green technology.
