<AbstractNarration>Atmospheric new-particle formation, cluster growth leading to secondary aerosol (SOA) formation, involves facile oxidation of organic compounds and is being revealed as a complex and challenging topic in atmospheric chemistry. Aerosol-climate interactions are a key source of uncertainty in climate forcing [IPCC], affecting both planetary radiation balances, and climate through direct and indirect changes in cloud formation and their properties. Uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing terms limits our ability to project climate sensitivity (the global average temperature change caused by a given forcing) from currently observed climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the range of chemical mechanisms occurring in natural atmospheres, chemists may choose to study the oxidation and condensation steps in the controllable environment of a chamber, typically interfaced to a desired set of analytical instruments to enable the progress of particle formation, condensation and growth to be optimally studied. Work under this project is directed towards improving understanding of particle formation steps involving interactions of low volatility hydrocarbons (e.g. terpene - ozone adducts) with sulfuric acid clusters. Graduate students will carry out a series of measurements, along with photochemical modelling, in chambers both at Pittsburgh (CMU), and the European CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) atmospheric facility at CERN.</AbstractNarration>

Doctoral students from Carnegie Mellon University measured the intensity of light driving photochemistry in the chamber during carefully designed experiments and also measured the end products of reactions generating particles and causing them to grow using a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer purchased with Major Research Instrumentation funds from the NSF. Much of this research focused on oxidation of volatile organic compounds emitted by trees, such as alpha-pinene emitted by pine trees and isoprene emitted by oaks, among other plant types.    Formation and growth of particles plays a key role in the climate system because the number of particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei controls the number of cloud droplets, and that in turn controls how much light is reflected by clouds and how long it takes clouds to form rain (if they do at all). Our research into particle formation from naturally occurring terpenes for the first time showed mechanisms that can nucleate new particles under un-polluted conditions typical of the pre-industrial atmosphere. We further identified several fascinating chemical pathways where perturbation of atmospheric chemistry by human activity or indeed interactions in the natural atmosphere can significantly change the rates of particle formation and growth.   At CMU we have pioneered a modeling framework to describe the behavior of these organic oxidation products in the atmosphere, and during this project we added dynamics to this framework so that we could model the growth of particles. Our model was able to explain the growth rate observations at CLOUD over a wide range of temperature.   Finally, we collaborated to model organic aerosol pollution in China using this framework, showing that much of the fine-particle haze in Eastern China is derived from chemical processing of emissions from vehicles. This research thus made substantial advances in fundamental scientific understanding of the chemical processes making condensible organic products in the atmosphere, reported via 25 peer-reviewed publications (2 in Nature, 1 in Science, and 1 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, among the world's most respected journals) and 44 more publications still being written.    Our doctoral students participated in a world-leading collaborative team and developed relationships with other leading young researchers from across Europe and the US.   Finally, the work is directly relevant to climate science and policy and has been reported and discussed at levels ranging from the City of Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan (v 3.0) to the National Academy of Sciences Sackler Symposium on the Science of Science Communication. The work also helped the PI develop a succession of educational modules being embedded in all required Chemical Engineering courses at Carnegie Mellon, which will subsequently be offered to Chemical Engineering educators around the country.
