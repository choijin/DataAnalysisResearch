<AbstractNarration>NON TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This 2014 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Scientific Methods in Cultural Heritage Research provides an exceptional forum where scientists can discuss the latest research advances on the material components, degradation processes, and conservation strategies for cultural heritage objects. Materials science is a key primary discipline involved in preserving our global cultural patrimony for future study, interpretation, wealth generation through tourism, enjoyment and maintenance of cultural capital. This GRC is a powerful conduit to create a robust network of US and international scientists that can address important societal questions, encourage diverse participation, create a pipeline of scientists into cultural heritage science and STEM workforce, and attract positive media attention on the role of science in society. With support of travel and registration expenses of early career scientists and students, this project promotes the participation of young investigators through the allied Gordon Research Seminar and the GRC poster sessions. This conference also effectively enhances the infrastructure for research and education by fostering partnerships between, for example, museum scientists and scientists at large scale facilities, as well as professors at small liberal arts colleges and minority-based colleges who use art to teach science at the undergraduate level and to attract students to STEM careers and graduate studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This award provides partial support to the 2014 Gordon Research Conference on "Scientific Methods in Cultural Heritage Research: Challenges and Complexity in Characterization and Conservation" (July 27- August 1, 2014, Newry, ME). The conference brings together thirty-four leading researchers representing 11 countries, 4 continents, and a diversity of backgrounds (Museums, Academia, National laboratories and Libraries). Extraordinary participation of female speakers and discussion leaders is a model of gender inclusivity, presenting research conducted in almost equal amount by male and female researchers. Support is provided also for the associated Gordon research Seminar "Molecular and Material Analysis for Art, Archaeometry and Conservation", the first of its kind. The conference advances discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning by offering a platform for graduate student and postdoctoral researchers to present their research and participate fully in the conference activities, fostering extended interactions with some of the most established international leaders in the field. The 2014 conference highlights innovative approaches to a) understanding time-dependent changes; b) investigating structure/ property relationships at multiple length and time-scales; and c) advancing our knowledge of materials processing, performance, and failure in artworks produced in antiquity all the way to contemporary art. The examination of the failure mechanisms of ancient and historic materials expands our knowledge of how materials function and interact at the nanoscale, and has direct relevance to our understanding of high performance materials being developed for modern applications. For example, dye sensitized solar cells are based on titanium or zinc oxides and organic dyes (including alizarin), that are also used as artists' pigments. The solution-seeking research that is captured at this Gordon Conference therefore speaks to the NSF priorities to pursue innovative approaches to address cutting-edge challenges and to integrate theoretical, experimental, observational, simulation and modeling results in a holistic platform able to address increasingly complex research questions.</AbstractNarration>
