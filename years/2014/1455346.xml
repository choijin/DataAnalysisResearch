<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interfaces in solids, such as p-n junctions and heterojunctions in diodes and transistors, are excellent platforms for fundamental scientific research, and they are the foundation of the microelectronics industry. In these structures, a very large number of electrons interact with each other and shape the conductance, thermal activity, magnetism, optical response, and other fundamental properties of the materials.  This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research and education, in which the PI will focus on many-electron interactions in a new type of structure that can be viewed as "sandwiches" of two-dimensional layers of different materials. The layers are held together by weak forces called van der Waals (vdW) forces.  Materials with interfaces in which vdW forces dominate combine the properties of the different layers in exotic ways to produce novel effects, such as unusual light-matter interactions and charge transport. Thus, such materials are useful for studying new physical phenomena and for designing small electronic devices of targeted functionalities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will use parameter-free quantum mechanical simulations and simpler models based on these computations to explore how electronic interactions at vdW interfaces yield unique electrical transport and optical properties. This research can pave the way towards manipulating electronic, thermal, and optical properties of devices, such as diodes, transistors and low-cost photovoltaic solar cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this activity includes student mentoring, course development, seminars and workshops, and diverse collaborations involving students. In particular, the PI will focus on various K-12 activities. Collaborations with neighboring and international institutes will provide opportunities for training under-represented minority students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphene and related two-dimensional structures have attracted a great deal of scientific and technological interest over the last decade. Towards this end, few-layer heterostructures and superlattices held together by interlayer van der Waals (vdW) interactions have recently been fabricated. Creating few-layer composites of different materials allows one to achieve a wide range of new material characteristics  - the individual materials' properties do not simply superpose.  Accordingly, it is very likely that vdW interfaces will be central to the future of scientific and industrial research based on two-dimensional materials. This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research and education focused on many-electron interactions and excited-state properties of these interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan includes three facets:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. At the single-particle excitation level, the PI and his team will compute the quasiparticle band offsets and charge transfer at vdW junctions, which dictate their electrical and transport properties. The team will further develop practical methods for engineering these characteristic properties. Ultimately, the aim is to design a new type of low-power-dissipation diode that is based on quantum tunneling across vdW junctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. At the two-particle excitation level, the project focuses on optical excitations: excitons (electron-hole pairs). The electron-hole binding energy spectra of unique interlayer and intralayer excitons will be computed for vdW heterostructures, which is ultimately expected to lead to a parameter-free exciton model. The team will also focus on physical and chemical approaches for manipulating the energy spectra, optical activities, and lifetimes of these excitons in few-layer and superlattice structures. These ideas will be applied toward achieving exciton Bose-Einstein condensation and designing photovoltaic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. At the higher-order excitations level, the project will focus on three-body interactions (trions) and four-body interactions (biexcitons). By modeling the screened Coulomb interactions in vdW interfaces based on first principles simulations, the PI will develop efficient means for obtaining the energy spectra and optical activities of trions and biexcitons. These models are particularly useful for interpreting experimental results and predicting new optical devices without requiring costly first-principles simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this activity includes student mentoring, course development, seminars and workshops, and diverse collaborations involving students. In particular, the PI will focus on various K-12 activities. Collaborations with neighboring and international institutes will provide opportunities for training under-represented minority students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.</AbstractNarration>

With the support from NSF, the research scope has also been expanded to predict unique electric and magnetic polarization properties of emerging quantum materials for broad applications.</span></p> <p><span>Regarding the study of many-electron quantum mechanics and light-matter interactions, the proposed research has produced reliable predictions of optical spectra of a wide range of important 2D structures, covering narrow-gap semiconductors, magnets, and twisted moire crystals. For example, Figure 1 shows that the twisted 2D structure can form periodic moire potential and confine optically excited states (excitons). This confinement can be tuned by the twisting angle, giving hope to ?twisting-programmable? quantum emitters/detectors. Meanwhile, the PI's group have developed many-body perturbation theory to reveal the couplings between fundamental quantum excitations, such as quasiparticles, excitons, and carrier plasmons. As shown in Figure 2, they predicted the band gap and optical responses of 2D structures are substantially renormalized by carrier plasmons because of the reduced dimensionality.</span></p> <p><span>The PI's group have studied excited-state properties of nonlinear light-matter interactions, e.g., second-harmonic generation and bulk photovoltaic effects, of emerging quantum materials. As shown in Figure 3, their predicted photoconductivity of bilayer MnBi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>4</sub>, a magnetic topological material,&nbsp;is about two orders of magnitude larger than those of the widely used ferroelectric materials. These enhanced nonlinear optical effects are valuable for characterizing the subtle topological orders in emerging topological materials and shed light on the design of novel infrared photo-detectors and photovoltaic devices.</span></p> <p><span>The PI's group have expanded the research to search for unusual piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of 2D materials. They predicted giant piezoelectric effects in monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides. As shown in Figure 4, the strain responses of electric polarization of these monolayer materials are about two orders of magnitude larger than those of the industrial bulk materials. This provides guidance to find new mechanical sensors and acoustic wave generators/detectors. Moreover, they predicted that a single-atomic layer of these materials is ferroelectric. This 2D ferroelectric polarization can be tuned and kept at room temperature (inset of Figure 4), giving hope to reducing the size of non-volatile memory and devices by using atomic-thin materials.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, the PI's group have studied the magnetic polarizations and noncollinear spin textures in low-dimensional magnetic systems. Employing first-principles and Monto Carlo simulations, they proposed that an emerging 2D vdW magnet, monolayer chromium trichloride (CrCl<sub>3</sub>), can be a promising candidate to observe the vortex/antivortex type of topological defects, which are the so-called merons, as shown in Figure 5. These vortices and antivortices are material analogies to a solution of the high-energy Yang?Mills theory, in which merons are described in the context of quark confinement. Their results also indicate that magnetic vdW materials can be a promising family for realizing and studying the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) physics in 2D structures.</span></p> <p><span>The achieved broad impact of this proposal can be seen from the following aspects. First, the research scope and outcomes are broad. These not only include the fundamental light-matter interactions and noncollinear magnetic orders of condensed matter physics, but also cover the spintronics, photovoltaics, and optoelectronic applications. As a result, with worldwide collaborations, the PI's group have contributed to more than 40 peer-reviewed publications that have been cited frequently. Secondly, the grant has supported three graduate students to obtain their PhD degrees and one postdoc for more than one year (2019-2020).
