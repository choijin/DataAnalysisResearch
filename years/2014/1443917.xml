<AbstractNarration>Providing ubiquitous access to the rapidly expanding suite of mobile social applications has strained modern-day wireless networks, motivating the need for new technologies to optimize the usage of the scarce radio resources. Device-to-device (D2D) communications between mobile devices over the reliable and pervasive cellular network infrastructure constitutes one of the most promising technologies for further accelerating the penetration of mobile social services. As compared to conventional D2D over short-range and limited-capacity technologies such as Bluetooth, D2D over cellular provides longer transmission ranges, improved spectrum sharing, higher capacities, guaranteed quality-of-service, and a broader range of applications and services. Owing to its promising potential, D2D is now viewed by both academia and standardization bodies as a cornerstone technology in emerging 5th generation (5G) wireless systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging cellular D2D for mobile social applications requires addressing a variety of technical challenges that are characterized by a strong interplay between social factors such as content correlation, and wireless features such as network-controlled resource allocation and interference management. This project addresses these challenges by introducing a novel network optimization framework, cognizant of both social and wireless realms, suitable for ensuring the delivery of high-speed, high-quality social networking services over cellular D2D communications. Specifically, new D2D-oriented socio-technological metrics and novel semi-distributed resource allocation and content delivery algorithms will be developed to optimize the quality-of-service of social network-aware D2D systems. In addition, hierarchical resource allocation tools will be introduced to optimize the distribution of social content over D2D while maximizing the spread of data over multiple D2D connections. The results will be evaluated and deployed on two platforms: a large-scale testbed based on open-source Android devices for validating the approach and exploring new social metrics, and a software defined radio platform to analyze the performance of the proposed schemes within a realistic cellular setting.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research project provided new scientific frameworks with the intellectual merits including a suite of algorithms and protocols that can be used to deliver reliable D2D communications over cellular networks, in order to support social networking applications. For instance, the developed solutions provided new scientific foundations to understand the synergies between social and wireless communication networks. Moreover, the developed algorithms for resource management in D2D networks laid the foundation for the deployment of the technology in upcoming 5G networks. D2D has been jointly considered with different 5G techniques such as full duplex, mmwave, visible light communication (VLC), Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), backscatter, Internet of Things (IoT) and energy harvesting. By developing new algorithms, built on the Nobel-prize winning frameworks such as matching theory, contract theory and game theory, this research shed important light on how to design effective mechanisms for distributed self-organized networks. The designed algorithms also provided new techniques to optimize the placement of cached contents in multi-hop systems while leveraging the use of D2D communication. The foundational nature of the research led to broad impacts across multiple disciplines ranging from wireless networks to game theory, social networks, economics, vehicular networks, contract theory, matching theory, machine learning and optimization theory. The broader impacts included modification of existing courses at University of Houston that introduce the synergies between social and wireless networks as well as an involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in wireless and social networking research. Outreach events targeted at under-represented female groups were conducted and a broad dissemination was done using tutorials, workshops, and online tools.</p> <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/01/2019<br>      Modified by: Zhu&nbsp;Han</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637826973_Proposed--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637826973_Proposed--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Research Thrusts"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637826973_Proposed--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Research Thrusts"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Research Thrusts</div> <div class="imageCredit">N/A</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhu&nbsp;Han</div> <div class="imageTitle">Research Thrusts</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637874753_yanru--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637874753_yanru--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ph.D. graduation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637874753_yanru--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ph.D. graduation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Yanzhu Zhang's Ph.D. Defense</div> <div class="imageCredit">N/A</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhu&nbsp;Han</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ph.D. graduation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637922597_yunan--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637922597_yunan--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ph.D. graduation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637922597_yunan--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ph.D. graduation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Yunan Gu's Commencement</div> <div class="imageCredit">N/A</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhu&nbsp;Han</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ph.D. graduation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637968989_outreach--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637968989_outreach--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Outreach Event"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443917/1443917_10339136_1522637968989_outreach--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Outreach Event"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Outreach Event</div> <div class="imageCredit">N/A</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhu&nbsp;Han</div> <div class="imageTitle">Outreach Event</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
