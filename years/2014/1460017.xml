<AbstractNarration>The age at which an adolescent is viewed as an adult in the eyes of the criminal justice system varies widely both across and within different states. If tried as an adult, the adolescent faces dramatically different consequences: higher probabilities of incarceration, longer sentences, less rehabilitative programming, an adult criminal record, and increased exposure to adult criminals. The PI proposes to estimate the causal impact of prosecuting an adolescent as an adult, using an instrumental variables research design. Using data from the state of Florida the PI will study crime, high school graduation, post-secondary education, wages, and unemployment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of theories offer competing predictions as to how these two justice systems affect future outcomes. On the one hand, the `specific deterrence' theory predicts that the greater unpleasantness of adult incarceration will deter the youth from future crime simply by increasing his expected cost of re-incarceration. On the other hand, theories of peer influence predict that exposure to older, more criminally experienced peers will increase the likelihood of crime after release due to either criminal skill transfer, persistent network formation, or social contagion of attitudes and preferences. Theories which view crime and legal employment as substitutes would also expect worse outcomes from adult prosecution due to the decreased access to education and vocational training as well the burdens of an adult criminal record. Finally, those that emphasize the role that noncognitive traits have in crime would predict that the rehabilitative programming available in juvenile facilities would be beneficial for future outcomes. While all of these theories offer plausible arguments, empirical research is necessary to determine which effect dominates in practice. Previous research examining this question has largely used matched comparisons; while they find detrimental effects of adult incarceration, it is unclear whether the research strategies have been successful in eliminating all selection bias. This work will contribute to the literature by estimating the causal impact of prosecuting an adolescent as an adult, using a research design in which selection bias is not a concern. There are currently more than 7 million Americans under correctional supervision, with minorities disproportionately represented. While adult incarceration is expensive, juvenile incarceration is even more so, averaging $80,000 per person per year. At the same time, research in psychology and neurosciences suggests that adolescents are still very much in a formative stage, implying that improvements to correctional policies which affect teenagers may have wide reaching benefit.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Prosecutors wield enormous power in the United States criminal justice system, including, at least in some states, broad discretion over whether to charge teenagers as adults or as juveniles.&nbsp; Florida authorizes discretionary transfer for any youth charged with a felony who is at least 16 years old, and even allows transfer for 16 olds charged with misdemeanors, provided they have been adjudicated of certain felonies in the past.&nbsp; Even 14 year olds can be transferred to adult court if they are charged with one of 19 felonies, including several that are nonviolent.&nbsp; In order to test the long term impacts of adult transfer, we collected a detailed dataset on all youths who have been referred to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice from 2000-2015.&nbsp; This dataset was then matched to adult records on arrest and confinement as maintained by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Department of Corrections. Our strategy for identifying the long term impacts of adult transfer is to exploit discontinuities in the likelihood of adult transfer that occur around the 16th birthday.&nbsp; Our analysis focuses on judicial circuits with a high transfer rate, and on youths whose charge and criminal history characteristics make them likely candidates for transfer.&nbsp; First we find, consistent with prior literature, that youths are not sensitive to the change in expected punishment that occurs at the 16th birthday; this is shown in the attached histogram of arrests by age.&nbsp; Youth characteristics such as gender, race, and prior charges are similar for those arrested right before and right after their 16th birthday, as shown in the attached "Balance Test" images.&nbsp; However, the 16th birthday results in a sharp increase in the likelihood of being prosecuted as an adult.&nbsp; This is shown the image titled "First Stage".&nbsp; A youth who is arrested for an eligible offense right before their 16th birthday has only an 8% chance of adult transfer; that likelihood increases to 18% right after the 16th birthday.&nbsp; Thus discontinuities in transfer-likelihood that occur around the 16th birthday provide a plausible instrument for identifying the effect of adult transfer on future arrest, incarceration, and other outcomes.&nbsp; This is a work in progress, so we are not yet ready to make these results publicly available.&nbsp; We are grateful to the NSF for their support of this research and look forward to sharing the full results of the study in the future.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/03/2019<br>      Modified by: Megan&nbsp;Stevenson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556834138095_hitrans_RDplot--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556834138095_hitrans_RDplot--rgov-800width.jpg" title="First stage"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556834138095_hitrans_RDplot--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="First stage"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sharp change in the likelihood of being prosecuted as an adult at the age of 16</div> <div class="imageCredit">Megan Stevenson</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Megan&nbsp;Stevenson</div> <div class="imageTitle">First stage</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556833970729_hitrans_RDplot_black--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556833970729_hitrans_RDplot_black--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Balance test 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556833970729_hitrans_RDplot_black--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Balance test 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">No change in race of arrestees around 16th birthday</div> <div class="imageCredit">Megan Stevenson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Megan&nbsp;Stevenson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Balance test 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556833887865_hitrans_RDplot_male--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556833887865_hitrans_RDplot_male--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Balance test 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556833887865_hitrans_RDplot_male--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Balance test 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">No change in gender of arrestees around 16th birthday</div> <div class="imageCredit">Megan Stevenson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Megan&nbsp;Stevenson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Balance test 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556834040414_hitrans_RDplot_priorviolfel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556834040414_hitrans_RDplot_priorviolfel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Balance test 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556834040414_hitrans_RDplot_priorviolfel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Balance test 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">No change in the fraction of arrestees with a prior violent felony charge</div> <div class="imageCredit">Megan Stevenson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Megan&nbsp;Stevenson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Balance test 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556899136840_hitrans_hist--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556899136840_hitrans_hist--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Histogram of arrests around 16th birthday"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460017/1460017_10361804_1556899136840_hitrans_hist--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Histogram of arrests around 16th birthday"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">No change in the frequency of arrest around the 16th birthday</div> <div class="imageCredit">Megan Stevenson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Megan&nbsp;Stevenson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Histogram of arrests around 16th birthday</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
