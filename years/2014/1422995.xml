<AbstractNarration>By 2020, it is projected that every human being will contribute 1,000GB&lt;br/&gt;of the sensor data individually. These sensors include but not limited &lt;br/&gt;to GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, camera, all kinds of&lt;br/&gt;wearable biomedical sensors, etc. Beyond the domain of monitoring&lt;br/&gt;human activity, multi-sensor data processing has been an active&lt;br/&gt;research topic within the context of numerous practical applications, &lt;br/&gt;such as medical image analysis, remote sensing, and military&lt;br/&gt;target/threat detection. One powerful tool to tackle these critical&lt;br/&gt;Big Data problems is sparsity-driven signal-processing techniques. A&lt;br/&gt;sparse representation not only provides better signal compression for&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth/storage efficiency, but also leads to faster processing&lt;br/&gt;algorithms as well as more effective signal separation for detection,&lt;br/&gt;classification and recognition purposes since it focuses on the most&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic property of the data. Sparse signal representation allows one to&lt;br/&gt;capture the hidden simplified structure present in the data jungle, and&lt;br/&gt;thus minimizes the harmful effects of noise in practical settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates the problem of dynamic dictionary learning to&lt;br/&gt;obtain the most effective and adaptive sparse data representation even&lt;br/&gt;in the presence of low-rank interference. The investigator seeks to&lt;br/&gt;develop a general framework that takes advantage of diversity, yet&lt;br/&gt;complementary, features in vast correlated data sources collected from&lt;br/&gt;multiple, possibly heterogeneous, sensors co-located in the same &lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal physical space, recording the same physical event. &lt;br/&gt;Such scenarios ensure that interference noise patterns are very similar,&lt;br/&gt;hence justifying the low-rank property of the interference, while allow&lt;br/&gt;specific structural sparsity pattern of the signal of interest to be captured&lt;br/&gt;in the dictionary and/or in the sparse codes.</AbstractNarration>
