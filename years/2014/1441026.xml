<AbstractNarration>This grant funds a one-day workshop for researchers who aspire to participate in NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program. The workshop is open to people with research interests in secure and trustworthy computing who are not currently funded by SaTC or any of its predecessor programs (Trustworthy Computing and/or Cyber Trust). The goal of this workshop is to help aspiring SaTC PIs understand what NSF (and NSF review panels) are looking for in reviewing SaTC proposals, with the goal of increasing the quality of submitted proposals and, in turn, the percentage of proposals funded.  The workshop will be held in the same location as the USENIX Security conference, on the day before the conference workshops.  Co-locating this event with one of the major research conferences for the field will reduce overall costs for researchers, since many of them will be attending the conference for other professional reasons.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As we increasingly rely for our business, government, education, and recreation on networked computers and their interactions, there is a great need for these systems to provide security, privacy, accountability, and reliability.  In order to enhance the foundations and applications of cybersecurity as well as to contribute to the cybersecurity education of the future workforce, NSFÃ†s Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program addresses cybersecurity research, development, and education that leverages the disciplines of mathematics and statistics, the social sciences, and engineering together with the computing, communications and information sciences.  The goal of this project was to hold a one-day workshop to help aspiring SaTC PIs understand what NSF (and NSF review panels) are looking for in reviewing SaTC proposals, with the goal of increasing the quality of submitted SaTC proposals and, in turn, the percentage of SaTC proposals funded.  This workshop is the second such workshop, building on the success of the first workshop in 2012.  The 2014 NSF/DIMACS Workshop for Aspiring PIs in Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace workshop was held on August 17, 2014, co-located with the 23rd Usenix Security Symposium.  Workshop activities included an overview by NSF SaTC program officers of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace program, brief talks by current SaTC PIs (with a focus on the process of developing research ideas from inception to funded project to successfully carrying out the work), a mock grant review panel, brief one-on-one meetings with participants and a SaTC program officer, and an open Q&amp;A with program officers.   Application to participate was open to people with research interests in secure and trustworthy computing who were not currently funded by SaTC or any of its predecessor programs (Trustworthy Computing and/or Cyber Trust).  Within the categories of eligible participants, particular effort was made to reach junior faculty to participate in the workshop.  60 participants were selected to participate from 79 applications received, with prioritization to junior faculty.  As reported by 54 respondents to a post-workshop survey, 42 of the respondents (78%) were at a research university with high or very high research activity, 3 at other PhD-granting universities (6%), 7 at undergraduate-only or primarily undergraduate universities (13%), and 2 at other types of institution (4%).   The survey showed that participants rated the workshop highly overall.  Specifically 61% rated it Excellent, 33% Very Good, 4% Good, 2% Fair, and 0% Poor.  93% said they would recommend a similar workshop in the future to other aspiring SaTC PIs, 7% said they might recommend it, and none said they would not recommend it.  As a lasting resource for workshop participants and for others, both slides and videotapes of presentations have been posted on the DIMACS workshop web site at http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/Aspiring2014.
