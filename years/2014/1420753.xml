<AbstractNarration>Maritime transport is an essential dimension of globalization as ninety percent of all internationally traded goods are transported at sea. Despite all of the significant commercial and scholarly interest in the implications of globalization over the last twenty years, the oceans upon which the vast majority of the world's commerce takes place are a surprisingly understudied scientific terrain. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous, scientifically grounded fieldwork, explores the sea as a socially, economically, and politically important space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Johanna Markkula, under the supervision of Dr. Liisa Malkki from the Department of Anthropology at Stanford University will explore how the sea, often seen as a natural space outside of society, is a social space that is produced by specific human practices. The project asks how maritime workers and institutions shape the global mobility of goods, labor, and capital, and what impact processes as globalization and global governance have on commercial maritime activity.  With ninety percent of all internationally traded goods being transported at sea, maritime transport is a key component of globalization, and Filipinos are the by far largest national group (1/3) in today's seafaring labor force. Coastguards, for their part, are in charge of policing and governing the maritime space on behalf of nation-states. A study of their practices as workers who have to navigate the limits of the national and the non-national will provide important insights into the blurred boundaries between different forms of sovereignty. The researcher will carry out ethnographic research among merchant seafarers using a range of inductively oriented data collection techniques, including participant observation, and interviews with a range of actors and stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My doctoral dissertation is an anthropological study of the sea as a social, political and legal space and of the people, such as seafarers and coastguards, who make and shape the maritime world through their everyday work and their movements across it. With ninety percent of all internationally traded goods being transported by sea; with many of the world?s future resources located in the ocean bed; and with the "off-shore" taking us outside the nation-state framework into new spaces of sovereignty, the sea is a key space of global society rather than outside of it. Yet, despite its importance for human society and culture, the sea is more commonly a research concern of physical sciences such as oceanography, than of social sciences like anthropology, and it has remained largely invisible in the social sciences? discussions of the global.  My dissertation is based on eighteen months of intensive ethnographic research in three clusters of sites. I have spent six months with key maritime organizations, institutions and businesses ashore in various locations in the Philippines and in Europe; six months with the Coast Guard in the Philippines; and six months working onboard internationally trading cargo-ships with multinational crews. My focus on merchant seafarers, coastguards and institutions of maritime governance works in a complementary way to shed light on the different kinds of work that are involved in the making of the global maritime world.  First, my research with maritime institutions such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO), in London, UK, the World Maritime University (WMU) in Malm&ouml;, Sweden, and the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) in Manila, Philippines, shows the processes and challenges of governing an enormous geographical area that exists largely outside of national territorial boundaries. The ocean is the classic global commons, but it is also the main space for global transport, which is largely the domain of private companies. Rather than governing the ocean space itself, the strategy of policy makers has been to govern human activities at sea, such as maritime transport and navigation.  Second, while the regulatory frameworks and policies that govern the global maritime industry are decided in international fora such as the IMO, their implementation is the responsibility of individual states, which have varied capacities for enforcement. My ethnographic research with the Philippine Coast Guard and the Maritime Industry Authority in the Philippines enabled me to observe the challenges and practices of one country?s maritime agencies in implementing and enforcing the international regulations, and in projecting the power of the nation-state and other land-based institutions seawards.  Third, the ethnographic component onboard multi-nationally crewed cargo-ships gives insight into the practices of work and experiences of contemporary seafarers as global workers who spend the majority of their time in international waters, beyond the reach of individual nation-states and the protection that national jurisdictions entails. My work onboard internationally trading cargo-ships shows globalization carried out through everyday practices of work. It also highlights the dependency of the maritime industry on a global and multinational labor force that is hired on differential contracts. On contemporary cargo-ships, fifteen to twenty persons of different nationalities share the same limited space but work under different employment conditions. Thus, the seafarers that are tasked with integrating the global economy through their everyday work are themselves part of communities where ethnic stratification is built into the work organization, but where they still have to collaborate and get along with their shipmates.  Ultimately, my dissertation contributes to theories of the "production of space", and to theories of globalization, global governance, sovereignty and territoriality, with an ethnographic study of how such processes exist through concrete practices of "work", carried out by maritime workers whose life-worlds are in turn shaped and transformed by these same processes. My dissertation is thus a multi-scalar study of the production, governance, practices and social relations of global spaces, both localized and situated global workspaces like multicultural cargo-ships, and the interconnected physical spaces of global transport, with their ports, routes, as well as the international regulatory framework and organizational network of the maritime industry.  Moreover, a study of the challenges involved in navigating and managing this "social ocean" illuminates broader issues around global labor. Many forms of work are increasingly outsourced, off-shore and disembedded from national contexts. A better understanding of the difficulty in regulating maritime labor and protecting workers on flexible subcontracts outside of national territory can help us understand these new realities. The same goes for practices such as "secondary registers", and "open registers", where nationalities of ships become flexible instruments for negotiating favorable conditions for companies, often to the detriment of workers? labor conditions. These practices sheds light on the limits of national sovereignty more generally, the constructed nature of nationality, and contemporary transformations of a global work environment.
