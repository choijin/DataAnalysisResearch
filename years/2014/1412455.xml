<AbstractNarration>Understanding how molecules interact with each other to form stable assemblies is of fundamental scientific interest and has potential applications in fields as diverse as drug development, targeting and delivery, novel responsive/intelligent materials, and the development of new sensors.   In this context, the formation of host-guest complexes, in which a large container molecule (the host) provides a welcoming space for the docking of a smaller molecule (the guest), is of great importance.  Professor Angel E. Kaifer of the University of Miami is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program at NSF to study the formation of host-guest complexes by an important class of hosts, known as the cucurbiturils.  This project provides research opportunities to graduate, undergraduate, and high school students (including women and members of underrepresented groups).  Through this research, students receive training across the boundaries of the traditional disciplines of chemistry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cucurbituril hosts are very attractive because they form extremely stable complexes with suitable guests in aqueous media.  This research explores the following avenues: (1) Use of cucurbiturils as modular components of complex supramolecular systems, including at least two types of hosts.  (2) Synthesis of functionalized cucurbiturils as active components for the preparation of well-defined supramolecular oligomers, as well as modification of the surface of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, endowing them with high-affinity binding properties. (3) Electrochemical and EPR investigation of the polarity of the aqueous microenvironments adjacent to the cucurbituril cavity entrances. (4) Kinetics of cucurbituril exchange reactions between two different guests, with particular emphasis on the detection of ternary intermediates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research is concerned with a particular type of molecular containers, called cucurbiturils (CB receptors), which are capable of including smaller molecules with great affinity.  One of the key advantages of CB receptors is that they operate in aqueous media, making them potentially useful for biomedical and environmental applications.  One of the main aspects of our work has focused on the search for synthetic methods to functionalize the CB receptors.  In other words, we are interested in developing chemical reactions that will add functional groups to the outside of the CB receptors, facilitating their attachment to other chemical entities, such as surfaces, nanoparticles, or other molecules.  This is important because it will enhance the range of practical applications for the CB receptors. The CB receptors operate as they do because they contain an internal cavity to include smaller molecules.  While this cavity is extremely important, the chemical structure of the cavity entrances (portals) also plays an important role.  The fact that the portals are lined by oxygen atoms gives them a negative charge density, which we have utilized to control the assembly of CB receptors in more complicated molecular assemblies,by docking the portals close to other components with positive charges.  By the same token, the nature of the cavity entrances has a strong effect on the ability of specific small molecules to enter the cavity.
