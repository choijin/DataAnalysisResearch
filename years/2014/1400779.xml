<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Karol Koziol is "Functoriality of  Pro-p-Iwahori-Hecke Algebras in Characteristic p." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Toronto, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Florian Herzig. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being supported by funding from the Office of International and Integrative Activities, International Science and Engineering Section, International Postdoctoral Fellowship Fund.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the past four years (2014 -- 2018), I have been supported by an NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.  The fellowship supported research conducted at the University of Toronto, under the supervision of Florian Herzig. The research was broadly focused on the mod-p Local Langlands program, a vast web of conjectures which aim to connect two disparate fields of mathematics, number theory and representation theory. More specifically, my research focused on ways in which a certain combinatorial object, called the pro-p-Iwahori-Hecke algebra, may be used to shed light on these conjectures.  Since the Langlands program has connections to geometry, arithmetic, and physics, it is of paramount importance in modern mathematics.      As a result of the fellowship, I have written 6 research articles (several jointly with international collaborators), and am currently in the process of writing 1 additional article which began during the fellowship.  Many of these articles have been published (or have been accepted to be published) in top mathematics journals.  Further, several of these papers solved some of the projects put forward in my project description, and the results contained therein serve to sharpen our understanding of the Langlands program and how different branches of math are interconnected.      During my time under the fellowship I gave numerous talks about my research, both at conferences and departmental seminars.  The support of the NSF allowed me to travel (to Europe and California, among others) to visit collaborators and colleagues and discuss mathematical projects.  As part of the number theory group at the University of Toronto, I was responsible for co-organizing the weekly seminar, which promoted interaction among mathematicians from all over the world.  I was also active in outreach activities: I gave many expository talks to young high school students on various mathematical topics, and mentored a student from a local Toronto high school in a semester-long reading project.
