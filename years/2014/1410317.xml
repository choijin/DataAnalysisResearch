<AbstractNarration>The overarching goal of this project is to reconstruct rates and patterns in the evolution&lt;br/&gt;of early animal life and ocean chemistry. To this end, the principal investigators will compile 50 years of published&lt;br/&gt;stratigraphic data, including recent geochronological, chemostratigraphic and biostratigraphic data from China, Mongolia, Siberia and South Australia, together with new field projects in North America and Morocco, to develop an integrated and accessible, globally correlated and radiometrically constrained timeline of early Cambrian fossil appearances and geochemical change. With the new timeline, they will test hypotheses that link patterns in animal evolution to environmental change, and vice versa, using a coupled seawater ? pore fluid Earth-system model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global correlation of the lower Cambrian has been difficult to achieve. Biostratigraphic correlation has been hampered by the provinciality of many early animal groups, including trilobites, and the inevitable diachroneity of fossil first appearance datums (FADs). Likewise, deriving correlations based only on qualitative ?wiggle matching? of chemostratigrapic records such as carbon (ä13C) or strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotopes usually is ambiguous, and can be distorted by disconformities and carbonate diagenesis. Furthermore, without U-Pb zircon ages from interbedded tuffs and volcaniclastic rocks, even stratigraphy that is well correlated in relative time will not constrain the rate and duration of important biological and geochemical changes. The principal investigators will construct a comprehensive database of animal fossil occurrences, litho- and chemostratigraphy, and U-Pb zircon geochronology of interbedded volcaniclastics. Multiproxy records of variable diversity and completeness from around the globe will be correlated using the CONOP (constrained optimization) seriation software. The resulting composite stratigraphy will place each local record in relative and absolute time, based not on one variable, like FADs or ä13C, but rather on all available stratigraphic observations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most spectacular, important, and enigmatic intervals in Earth history is the early Cambrian radiation of animals.  How did we go from three billion years of bacteria, algae, and eventaully rare soft-bodied ancestors of animals to a world teeming with skeletal animals? How did virtually all the worlds animal phyla appear in the geological record over just ~20 million years?  These questions have puzzled geologists since Darwin.  With this grant, we set out to improve the backbone for any interpretation of this evolutionary radiation -- the timeline. We recognized the circularity of building a timeline primarily from fossil first appearances, since it is those fossil first appearances we most want to interpret. So instead, we built a timeline from carbon isotope chemostratigraphy and from radiometric dating of ash beds within the chemo- and bio-stratigraphies, and we brought together data from Morocco, Siberia, China, Mongolia, Australia, and North America.  However, along the way, we realized that our assumptions that carbon isotopes were faithful and synchronous recorders of the global carbon cycle were flawed.  So, we did parallel deep dives into (1) modern analog environments to find out how seawater chemistry was translated into the sedimentary record and (2) novel metal isotope systems that help reveal the extent of diagnetic alteration of the carbon isotope signal, both to figure out how best to interpret the carbon isotope records from the Cambrian.  Next, we developed new probabilistic techniques for correlating stratigraphic records within and between ancient basins, quantifying uncertainties, and ultimately coming up with a library of early Cambrian timelines for animal radiation and seawater geochemical change.    Did we find a single perfect timeline of Cambrian animal evolution and tie it to an unambiguous interpretation of changes to the global carbon cycle and climate change -- no. Did we develop a whole host of new measurement and interpretive tools that have helped us define specific new hypotheses to test in the field, in the lab, and with new models -- yes!
