<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) Program, this project will address the national need for high quality mathematics teaching in elementary schools. In particular, the project will represent a research and materials development effort aimed at helping prospective elementary teachers to develop responsive teaching skills and practices in the areas of numeracy and early-algebraic thinking. These responsive teaching practices, referred to as professional noticing (of children's mathematical thinking) are comprised of three interrelated components; namely, (i) observing and attending to the child's mathematical actions and words, (ii) interpreting these actions and words with respect to a particular developmental progression, and (iii) responding with an appropriate instructional or diagnostic decision. Researchers from Northern Kentucky University (lead institution), Morehead State University and the University of Kentucky will collaborate to develop online and classroom materials and conduct research to push the field of professional noticing forward to provide teachers of elementary mathematics with valuable tools to help improve teaching and student learning. The project will build on earlier work by the investigators regarding prospective teachers' development of professional noticing skills.  The previous project focused exclusively on noticing with respect to individual children's numeracy strategies; whereas, this project will investigate prospective elementary teachers' development of professional noticing skills in group and whole-class contexts in a more sophisticated, but essential mathematical domain - early algebraic thinking. The project will also engage personnel from Appalachian State University, Eastern Kentucky University and Western Kentucky University to use the materials developed and provide important feedback. Each university has committed to institutionalize the project activities as part of their teacher education programs. In connection with this, the project will directly impact over six-hundred (600) prospective (pre-service) teachers across the State of Kentucky as well as parts of North Carolina during the period of the grant funding. These teachers, in turn, will collectively have impact on thousands of elementary students throughout their teaching careers. Making the developed and well-researched materials available online will further enhance the overall impact of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, professional noticing is an ability to recognize and act on key indicators significant to one's profession. In connection with this,  the Project Team will develop online and in-class modules for teaching professional noticing to pre-service elementary teachers (PSETS) and, in turn, will investigate research questions related to the extent to which the innovative learning experience for pre-service elementary teachers (PSETs) focused on the professional noticing of children's numeracy and early-algebraic thinking will enhance PSETs' teaching and observation skills. The research questions include: (1) To what extent can teacher educators facilitate the development of PSETs' capacity to professionally notice children's mathematical thinking in the context of early numeracy in individual settings? (2) To what extent can teacher educators facilitate the development of PSETs' capacity to professionally notice children's mathematical thinking in the context of algebraic thinking in whole class settings? (3) To what extent do PSETs' professional noticing skills in individual settings relate to their professional noticing skills in whole class settings? (4) To what extent do PSETs' professional noticing skills relate to PSETs' mathematical knowledge for teaching and attitudes towards mathematics? (5) What differences (if any) occur in PSETs' professional noticing skills, attitudes towards mathematics, and mathematical knowledge for teaching when professional noticing modules are administered via an online format when compared to a traditional face-to-face format? Researchers will use proprietary video-based professional noticing measures to determine changes in PSET skills in this area and will administer according to a pre-, mid-, and post-assessment design with a video-based professional noticing assessment. Mathematical knowledge for teaching and attitudes towards mathematics will be assessed on the same time schedule. Assessment instruments will be the LMT-TKAS and the Mathematics Experiences and Conceptions (MECS) instrument, and interviews also will be conducted with PSETs to understand their experiences with the modules and their professional noticing skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There were three intended outcomes for this project  1)    Development of preservice teachers? abilities in whole-class noticing practice from noticing of individual students, across developmental span of early-algebraic thinking. The creation of the Exploring Essential Elements of Algebra (E3A) module aimed to advance participants' skills in professional noticing into more authentic approximations of whole-class instructional practice.

The research team has designed more authentic, systematic, and potentially generalizable measures of professional noticing capacities, via electronic scoring platforms using flow processes, that have been enacted in concert with the E3A module. While the measure associated with the Noticing Numeracy Now (N3) module (from previous NSF-funded activity) centered on professional noticing performance in the context of a single child's mathematical activity, the E3A measure features multifaceted noticing demands including attending, interpreting, and deciding in the context of whole-class activities in complex intersection of children?s mathematical ideas as they relate to early-algebraic thinking.  3)    Transition activities to technology-centered experiences. Presently, the predominant pedagogical approach to develop practitioners' professional development skills has been situated in face-to-face learning experiences. The E3A module was adapted for technology-centered implementation.  The primary aim of this impact component was to ascertain the extent to which preservice teachers' professional noticing skills may be developed within technology-centered learning environments.  The development and concerted implementation of multi-modular professional learning experiences focused on responsive teaching practices in mathematics (i.e., teacher noticing) has impacted participants' professional practice.   Additionally, this project has impacted the existing knowledge base in the areas of teacher noticing development (e.g., technology-mediated and traditional) and measurement (e.g., specific trajectory-based vs. general practice-based). Lastly, this project will impact the manner in which the practice of teacher noticing is measured and the extent to which such measurement may be applied to future projects in different mathematical contexts.  At the conclusion of our project we have completed refinements to the E3A module and implemented this module in elementary mathematics methods courses across the collaborating institutions. We are concluding data analysis in the areas of professional noticing, pedagogical content knowledge, and attitudes and beliefs measures. Our analytic process has moved from scoring and evaluating responses towards broader statistical analysis and connections across areas (i.e., professional noticing, pedagogical content knowledge). We anticipate that these analyses will have key impacts described in subsequent sections of this report.

In addition to improving the efficiency of the rating process, this tool enhances scoring reliability across raters as the interpretive demand upon raters regarding the scoring of individual responses is greatly reduced on this platform.  Additionally, this electronic platform maintains a record of yes/no choice pathways for each response which will enhance the potential for reproducibility by creating a record of researcher decision-making processes for each data point.  This scoring tool is adaptable in that it provides a framework for varying video anchors and each anchor?s associated relevant elements for professional noticing. Our intent is to share this tool broadly such that it may be appropriated for use in other teacher noticing endeavors.  We also studied elementary and middle school inservice teachers? perceptions of and purported enactment of teacher noticing.  The inservice teachers were participants in a mathematics professional development program designed and implemented in statewide professional development.  We anticipate our manuscript (in press) to impact the practice of teacher noticing, particularly in terms of how it is defined and enacted in practice.  Our dissemination outcomes include seven publications in peer reviewed journals or conference proceedings; one book chapter, one edited book, one international presentation, and 11 presentations at national conferences.
