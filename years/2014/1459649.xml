<AbstractNarration>The development and application of new experimental approaches that can control key components of a system provide opportunities for breakthroughs; not only for the topic for which the method was developed, but many times also for other systems and disciplines.  This research takes a novel, newly developed approach for quantitatively controlling very small amounts of H2O in high temperature/pressure experiments and applies it to one of the most fundamental rock forming processes on the planet: the melting of mantle rocks (peridotite) to form magmas, some of which eventually reach Earth?s surface. Because hydrogen diffuses rapidly into olivine, one of the most common minerals in the Earth?s mantle, the researchers receiving this award are now able to infuse predetermined concentrations of H2O into spheres of olivine about 300 microns in diameter. These olivines are then used as hygrometers in experiments that allow the pressure dependence to be determined of the exact instant when melting of mantle rock begins (i.e., the peridotite solidus). Understanding this fundamental reaction is important because the melting of Earth's mantle (i.e., peridotite) drives the spreading apart of the mid-ocean ridges and has a significant impact on the transfer of mass and heat from Earth?s interior to its surface as well as on the thickness of Earth?s crust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine the lherzolite solidus at H2O-undersaturated conditions, partial melting experiments around 1300 C and from 1 to 3 GPa will be conducted using synthetic peridotite containing spheres of San Carlos olivine doped with specified H2O contents.  Using the spheres as hygrometers, the olivines will be analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry to determine when the H2O content of the olivine changes, indicating the initiating of melting. Research goals are to determine the peridotite solidus and the impact of Na2O and mineral mode on melting. Results will provide the first quantitative experimental determination of the H2O-undersaturated peridotite solidus. Broader impacts of the work include method development and application, thus, building infrastructure for science. It also provides student training at the graduate and undergraduate level. The unique mineralogical hygrometer may also have applications for materials science and other areas where the exact temperature and pressure of a solidus for a material of a specific composition is needed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The global system of mid-ocean ridges comprises ~65,000 km of boundaries separating divergent tectonic plates. These regions are characterized by elevated topography, shallow earthquakes, and high heat flow.  Tectonic plates move apart along these boundaries at velocities ranging from less than 10 to greater than 160 kilometers per million years.  Hot upper mantle rock ascends in response to the plates diverging, elevating the local geotherm and initiating melting of mantle rock (peridotite) to produce magma.  The generation and ascent of magma beneath mid-ocean ridges produces the ocean crust.  Two parameters that exert important controls on the process of peridotite melting are the geotherm of the oceanic mantle and the temperature at which peridotite of a given bulk composition begins to melt as a function of pressure (the solidus).  Because temperature increases systematically with depth within the Earth, temperatures of different portions of the upper mantle are compared by extrapolating mantle geotherms to the Earth’s surface, so that temperatures can be compared at a common depth (potential temperature).  A parcel of ascending peridotite with an elevated potential temperature reaches its solidus at a higher pressure, so that melting begins at greater depths.  This leads to greater extents of melting and thicker ocean crust.  The pattern of mantle flow beneath mid-ocean ridges favors the development of a triangularly shaped melting regime, so that partial melts from a parcel of ascending peridotite with a higher potential temperature sample a much larger volume of mantle. The peridotite solidus is sensitive to the presence of small amounts of hydrogen (commonly referred to as H2O because it is bonded to oxygen) dissolved in the nominally anhydrous minerals that comprise the rock. When small amounts of H2O are present, the melting temperature of peridotite (the "damp" solidus) is dramatically lower at any given pressure relative to the anhydrous ("dry") solidus, thereby increasing the depth at which partial melting begins for any potential temperature. Partial melting that begins beneath a ridge at the "damp" solidus involves a larger volume of peridotite and produces a higher mean pressure of melting combined with lower mean extent of melting.  The bulk oceanic upper mantle is estimated to contain 50 to 200 &mu;g/g H2O dissolved in nominally anhydrous minerals, but its influence on the onset of peridotite melting has proven challenging to determine experimentally. This requires controlling and characterizing the amount of H2O dissolved in the minerals. Despite meticulous drying protocols, a small amount of H2O is present in most high-pressure melting experiments due to adsorption onto starting materials (usually powders).

The rapid diffusivity of H2O in olivine allows these spheres to equilibrate with the H2O dissolved in the peridotite matrix within a few hours, thereby acting as hygrometers that can be analyzed for H2O using secondary ion mass spectrometry. Once the H2O concentration of the spheres has been measured, the bulk H2O content of the peridotite can be calculated using existing experimental determinations of how it is distributed among the coexisting minerals.  Comparison of our experimental results with previous experimental determinations of the peridotite solidus &ndash; for which the bulk H2O contents were not known &ndash; demonstrates that existing estimates for the anhydrous peridotite solidus are systematically too low.  The widely used parameterization of the solidus for nominally anhydrous peridotite of Hirschmann (2000) predicts temperatures (1248 &deg;C at 1.0 GPa; 1309 &deg;C at 1.5 GPa; 1366 &deg;C at 2.0 GPa; 1421 &deg;C at 2.5 GPa) that are in reasonably good agreement with our parameterization of the experimentally determined solidus for peridotite containing ~145 &mu;g/g H2O dissolved in nominally anhydrous minerals (1261 &deg;C at 1.0 GPa; 1317 &deg;C at 1.5 GPa; 1363 &deg;C at 2.0 GPa; 1399 &deg;C at 2.5 GPa).
