<AbstractNarration>RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is the protein machine that transcribes the majority of genes in the eukaryotic cell into RNA. Pol II core component consists of 12  proteins, and the tail end of the largest protein, called the C-terminal domain (CTD), is the site of interaction with other proteins and cellular machines. In this project, we will earn how these interactions are affected by chemical changes of the CTD in the baker's yeast cells. Since CTD-related mechanisms are highly conserved in evolution, the research will enable our understanding of gene expression in other eukaryotes, including humans. The program will expand the horizons of students and colleagues by working in teams that bring expertise from multiple disciplines, train the next generation of globally engaged scientists/technologists, and provide widely enabling tools to the scientific community. To engage the next generation of students in STEM subjects, as well as the larger community, we will in particular develop a computer game that begins with the collection and assembly of basic biological processes that underlie The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and leads the players to identify features required to form a "minimal living genome."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "CTD code" hypothesis posits that the engagement of relevant proteins with Pol II is coordinated by sequential post-translational modifications of the CTD. An important feature of this unusual domain is the occurrence of a repeating hepta-peptide that is modified on all five of the hydroxyl-bearing amino side chains. This project focuses on phosphorylation of threonine in position four of this hepta-peptide repeat; such phosphorylation has been implicated in directing the post-transcriptional modification of a specific set of Pol II-transcribed genes. The project will integrate chemical, biological and computational approaches to identify cellular kinases that phosphorylate threonine four of the Pol II CTD from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The next level of experimentation and analysis will focus on obtaining mechanistic insights into how phosphorylation of this residue contributes to global versus gene class-specific transcriptional control.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We set out to understand how cellular machinery deciphers cell signals and accesses the relevant information buried in its DNA genome. &nbsp;We focused on the central player, a machine composed of a dozen protein parts, that melts the DNA and copies (transcribes) the information into specific RNA messengers. The largest component of this RNA transcribing machine (RNA polymerase II) has a long tail that is made of a seven amino acid unit that repeats nearly 25 times in baker's yeast and nearly 52 times in humans. Interestingly, this tail -or the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II- was previously shown to be stamped by four "writer" proteins. Just like visa stamps in a passport, phosphate stamps on different positions of the seven amino acid CTD repeat identify where the polymerase is during its path across a given gene. Phosphate stamps at different positions are "read" or "decoded" by other cellular machines that ensure safe passage of the polymerase across the gene and prepare the messenger RNA for its next functional phase. In this sense, the pattern of CTD stamps codes for specific events and has been therefore described as the "CTD code."</p> <p>To understand how the phospho-CTD marks are placed by the four known "writer"<em> kinases</em>, we developed a novel chemical method to specifically poison Kin28/CDK7, the primary CTD kinase (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). The ability to inactivate this kinase/writer without interfering with any of the millions of other parallel reactions in a living cell, revealed new functions of this well studied CTD kinase (Rodriguez-Molina, et al. <em>Mol Cell </em>2016). Moreover, the results from our work in baker's yeast, yielded key insights into the action of an exciting new drug that was thought to work on cancer cells by solely targeting CDK7 -the human homolog of Kin28. Our studies suggested that the effect of THZ1 were due to poisoning not only of CDK7 but other writers of CTD. This was later shown to be the case. Thus, our investigations on the CTD writers in yeast provided a key guidance on the mechanism of action of a promising therapeutic agent for human cancers.</p> <p>Rather than dwell on the positions of the CTD repeat that are phospho-stamped by the four known writer kinases, we decided to examine the role of the lesser studied phospho-CTD stamps. In particular, we focused on the 4th position of the Y<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub><strong>T<sub>4</sub></strong>S<sub>5</sub>P<sub>6</sub>S<sub>7</sub> repeat. We discovered new "readers" of this phospho-stamp and those readers implied new functions for cellular machines that control RNA polymerase function at different classes of genes (Nemec et al. <em>PNAS</em> 2016).&nbsp;</p> <p>The differences in phospho-CTD stamps at position 4 suggested that there were other writers of this code that were yet to be discovered.&nbsp;So, we utilized our chemical-genetic approach we developed to study Kin28/CDK7, to find and confirm the existence of 10 new CTD code writers (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). This discovery suggested a new mode of selectively controling RNA polymerase, a central machine that transcribes all protein-coding genes, at only a subset of genes that are necessary for responding a specific signal sensed by the cell (Nemec et al. <em>Nature Chem Bio </em>2019).</p> <p>We extended our efforts and discovered additional 10 CTD kinases and found that the human counterparts were also able to perform the same reaction. Thus we accomplished the goals of grant by discovering over 20 new writers of the CTD code. This has greatly expanded the number of known CTD writers (from 4 to 24) and revealed new modes of regulating the function of RNA polymerase II at signal-responsive genes rather than across the entire genome.</p> <p>Finally, guided by the patterns of CTD phospho-stamps at different sages of gene transcription, we developed chemical gene switches (synthetic transcription factors -SynTFs) that engage CDK9 and enable the passage of stalled polymerase at a diseased gene (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). The molecule we designed, targets the diseased frataxin gene in cells derived from patients and restored its expression, thereby providing a potential therapeutic path for Friedreich's ataxia, an incurable disease (Erwin et al. <em>Science</em> 2017).</p> <p>The societal impact of developing a potential therapeutic is self-evident. More broadly, the long-term impact of training postdoctoral fellows, visiting scientists, and students from high school to undergraduates to graduate students at the interface of chemistry, biology, and computation will manifest itself through exciting new contributions each of these individuals will make to society during the course of their careers. More immediately, the development of new rationally designed and widely applicable chemical-genetic inhibition strategies, synthetic gene switches and new insights into biological systems have already begun to spur innovation and blurred the lines between physical and biological sciences. We continue our study of gene regulation by implementing chemical and computational approaches to gain a clearer understanding of how genomes are deciphered to give rise to living systems.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/18/2020<br>      Modified by: Aseem&nbsp;Z&nbsp;Ansari</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1413547/1413547_10339750_1581554724513_NSFOutcomesReport2020figures_Page_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1413547/1413547_10339750_1581554724513_NSFOutcomesReport2020figures_Page_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="New roles for an old CTD code writer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1413547/1413547_10339750_1581554724513_NSFOutcomesReport2020figures_Page_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="New roles for an old CTD code writer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Development of a novel irreversible chemical inhibition strategy permitted the discovery of new functions of Kin28/CDK7 by Juan Rodriguez-Molina (NSF predoctoral Fellow in Aseem Ansari's laboratory).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Aseem Z.
