<AbstractNarration>Funds from this award will be used to acquire an excimer laser ablation system for a broad range of cutting edge geoscience and anthropological research. The laser system will interface with an existing multiple collector ICP-MS and be housed in an established NSF-funded laboratory. The resulting system will comprise a state-of-the-art laboratory for measuring isotopic ratios at micron scales in a variety of solid samples (minerals, rocks, glasses, and teeth).  The addition of this laser system to the facility will provide essential training on modern instrumentation for graduate students from several research groups and valuable experience with key methods for other graduate students. Undergraduate research will be greatly enhanced by being able to use this instrument. The plasma mass spectrometer laboratory has become a regional resource with a number of outside users from the Midwest region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use of this device by interdisciplinary researchers will simultaneously advance several fields at the fore-front of integrated geoscience research by enabling high precision measurements of isotopic compositions at microscale resolution. This will be applied to major research projects that include: (1) assessing whether a temperature gradient driven differentiation process has led to the development of Earth?s silicic continental crust; (2) determining the spatial distribution of U and Th in zircon to improve the ability to perform accurate U-Th/He in zircon thermochronology; (3) tracing the migration of hominids and archaeological artifacts through measurements of Sr isotopes in teeth and artifacts; (4) determining Sr isotopes in solid materials such as carbonates to trace reactions with natural waters; and (5) determining&lt;br/&gt;Sr isotope ratios in carbonate minerals in order to reveal biocomplex microbe-water-mineral interactions in hot springs and coral reefs.</AbstractNarration>
