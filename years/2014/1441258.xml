<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to organize the annual principal investigator meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI). The NRI was launched in the summer of 2011 and there is a clear need to bring together the researchers of the awarded projects to provide cross-project coordination in terms of common intellectual challenges, methods for education and training, best practice in terms of transition of results and opportunities for broader dissemination of project status, activities and results. The meeting will be organized as a two-day meeting in the vicinity of Washington DC which broadens the impact to other governmental agencies, as members will be invited due to proximity. The meeting will include all the PIs for the NRI initiative, and invitations to all the program managers for robotics related programs in DC in addition to organizers of the Robotics-VO (Virtual Organization). Finally, the meeting is organized to take place during fall of 2014 to allow the first three cohorts of NRI projects to participate, allowing cross-fertilization of topics and ideas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the General Public (POR)    The first National Robotics Initiative Principal Investigators (NRI PI)  meeting was held on November 19-20, 2014 in Arlington, Virginia at the  Hyatt Regency Crystal City. The objective of this meeting was to bring  together the community of researchers, companies and program managers  from various government agencies that are actively engaged in the  National Robotics Initiative (NRI), a nationally coordinated program  across multiple government agencies, which was launched in 2011 to  develop the next generation of robotics, to advance the capability and  usability of such systems and artifacts, and to encourage existing and  new communities to focus on innovative application areas. The first  projects funded as part of the NRI were launched in 2012, and it is  considered important to build a community across the projects for  sharing of research results, best practice in terms of education and  training, opportunities for exploitation of results and mechanisms for  broader impact.  The main motivation behind the 2014 NRI PI meeting was  to continue community building across the set of sponsored  projects to maximize impact of the research, to optimize educational  effort and to strengthen the broader impact.    The intellectual merit of the meeting was to bring together the different efforts in robotics which covers aspects from hardware design to human   interaction into discussions about how they all contribute to future  growth across manufacturing, healthcare and national security.     The meeting was attended by more than 210 participants and served as a  great mechanism for community coordination; this year there was a  strong engagement of program managers from the NRI sponsoring agencies.  This 2-day event was organized as a mix of keynotes, plenary sessions,  industry and educational panels, and parallel sessions on Co-Worker,  Co-Inhabitant/Medical, and Co-Protector/Space topics.  Over 100 posters  were presented during three poster sessions.  These posters presented  the results of research, which was sponsored by various NRI awards.  There were also sessions about commercialization of project results, and  Best practice for broader impact of research.     From a broader aspects perspective it is important to note that robotics   has the potential to impact many aspects of general life from future   economic growth over quality to life to support for future. Not only was robotics discussed both as basic science, and its potential impact, but the   NRI PI meeting also included a session with discussion of how broader impact  best practice can be applied across the projects funded by the NRI.     Copies of meeting material: presentations, tutorials, and posters are available  for the members of US robotics community at the Robotics Virtual  Organization (VO) web site at http://www.robotics-vo.us.
