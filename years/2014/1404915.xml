<AbstractNarration>The largest increase in atmospheric CO2 in the recent geologic past occurred during the last deglaciation (from 20,000 to 10,000 years ago).  As the large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets melted, atmospheric CO2 levels rose by ~30%.  Despite extensive research, the underlying cause of the CO2 change has yet to be fully explained.  Recent ice core results show that the CO2 rise coincided with a negative carbon isotopic excursion.   Similar although larger carbon isotope anomalies occurred at surface and intermediate depths in multiple ocean basins, pointing to an oceanic source.  The largest documented changes occurred from ~1 to 2 km in the Atlantic, suggesting that processes at mid-depth in this basin played a key role in the CO2 rise.  Identifying the origin of the carbon isotope signal is essential to unraveling the mechanisms that drove atmospheric CO2 variability in the recent geologic past.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to use data from the Southwest Atlantic to diagnose the source of the carbon isotope anomalies during the deglaciation.  The researcher team will use a depth transect of high resolution sediment cores from the Brazil Margin to evaluate the relative timing of surface and deep water signals.  The team will also use radiocarbon and other chemical analyses of microfossils to infer the origin of the carbon isotope anomaly.  Work will focus on testing two competing hypotheses, one that calls for carbon originating from the abyssal ocean and the other that invokes carbon from a geological reservoir. The results could transform our understanding of the climate system by constraining the source of carbon isotopic minima and therefore the driver of atmospheric CO2 variability on glacial-interglacial timescales.   The educational broader impacts of the proposed work include the participation of a graduate student and two undergraduates who will pursue independent research projects that complement the overall goals of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conveyor belt circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, which carries warm water northwards as part of the Gulf Stream and cold water southwards as North Atlantic Deep Water, plays a key role in the Earth's climate system.  Heat transported in the conveyor circulation warms the North Atlantic region and plays a key role influencing the position of tropical rain belts.  Results from computer models suggest the conveyor circulation can slow considerably as the result of freshwater input to the North Atlantic, which in turn can cause dramatic changes in climate.   The primary focus of this study was to reconstruct changes in the conveyor belt circulation in the recent geologic past.  Our reconstruction is based on marine sediment cores from the South Atlantic, a location that has been shown to be sensitive to the conveyor.  We used chemical analyses of microscopic shells to infer changes in circulation and carbon storage in the deep Atlantic.  Our modeling work suggests that a weaker conveyor circulation not only cools the North Atlantic region but also enhaces carbon storage at depth.  Our results are consistent with a weakened conveyor circulation from 17,500 to 14,500 years ago, confirming earlier studies.  More importantly, our results indicate that as the circulation slowed, the deep Atlantic stored more carbon than usual, consistent with our model predictions.  At the same time, weakening of biological productivity in the ocean caused a net rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This novel result tell us that a weaker conveyor not only cools the North Atlantic but also has important implications for the carbon cycle, both in terms of biological productivity and carbon storage in the deep ocean.  Future studies of the conveyor circulation will need to take into account the direct influence on climate as a result of heat transport and the indirect influence via the carbon cycle.  The broader educational impacts of this work include the professional development of a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and two undergraduates.  Their research projects would not have been possible without funding from NSF.                  Last Modified: 09/18/2017       Submitted by: David C Lund]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
