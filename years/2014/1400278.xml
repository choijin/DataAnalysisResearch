<AbstractNarration>An appointed National Research Council committee will conduct the second phase of a study to consider future research goals and directions for foundational science in cybersecurity and how investments in foundational work support civilian and national security mission needs in the long term.  It will consider relevant topics in social and behavioral sciences as well as more "traditional" cybersecurity topics. The committee will review current federal cybersecurity research strategies, plans, and programs as well as requirements for both civilian and national security applications. It will consider major challenge problems, explore proposed new directions, identify gaps in the current portfolio, consider the complementary roles of research in unclassified and classified settings, and consider how foundational work in an unclassified setting can be translated to meet national security objectives. In Phase 1, already completed with separate funding, the study committee conducted initial data gathering and analysis. In Phase 2, to be funded under this activity, the committee will undertake additional data-gathering, analysis and deliberations and produce a report providing a high-level roadmap for foundational cybersecurity research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Foundational cybersecurity research that yields yield new technologies and approaches is an important element of the nation's response to the cybersecurity challenge.  The results of this study are expected to inform future activities by federal agencies that conduct cybersecurity research and federal coordinating bodies for IT and cybersecurity. It is also expected to inform cybersecurity researchers as well as industry -- which is both a developer and consumer of cybersecurity technologies and services -- about needs, opportunities, and future directions.</AbstractNarration>

Sustain long-term support for security science research   Each of these is described in more detail below.  1. Support, develop, and improve security science. A scientific approach to cybersecurity challenges helps enrich understanding of the existing landscape of systems, defenses, attacks, and adversaries. Security science has the goal of improving understanding of which aspects of a system (including its environment and users) create vulnerabilities or enable someone or something (inside or outside the system) to exploit them.

Research that links social, behavioral, and decision sciences and cybersecurity should encourage advances in cybersecurity practices.

The traditional decoupling of academic research from engineering, quality control, and operations leaves gaps in a domain like cybersecurity, where solutions are needed for systems deployed at scale in the real world. These gaps highlight the importance of incorporating a life-cycle perspective (from development to deployment, maintenance, administration, and aftermarket activities) into proposed foundational research approaches.

Researchers similarly can benefit significantly from industry contacts and trust relationships with practitioner colleagues, who are often on the front lines of security systems. Such collaborations have transformative potential for the participants while addressing the urgent practical problems of cybersecurity.  4. Sustain long-term support for security science research. The report is intended to complement the federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program?s 2016 Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan.  Accordingly, it outlines a foundational technical research agenda clustered around three broad themes that correspond to those in the strategic plan: detect (detection and attribution of attacks and vulnerabilities), protect (defensible systems that are prepared for and can resist attacks), and adapt (resilient systems that can recover from or cope with a wide range of adversarial behavior).  One potential distinction considered in the study was between research in support of classi?ed and unclassi?ed mission needs. Although there may be differences in the nature of threat and what is known and by whom about that threat, private-sector entities are increasingly on the front line, facing and securing themselves against "nation-state"-level attacks. Still, problems and assumptions may need to be translated across the classi?ed/unclassi?ed boundary, and it will be particularly important to develop and ?nd people who are skilled at these translations.  The challenge of cybersecurity and the urgent nature of risks to society posed by insecure systems and a dynamic and fast-changing environment understandably promotes an emphasis on moving fast.  Paradoxically, however, the field is still so comparatively new, and the nature of the challenge is so hard, that in-depth, long-time-horizon scientific research and sustained commitments and engagements are critical.
