<AbstractNarration>PI:  Fainman, Yeshaiahu&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 1445158&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-San Diego&lt;br/&gt;EAGER: Cartridge lab-on-chip (CLOC) for Mobile Health&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile health (mHealth) uses mobile technologies for health research and healthcare delivery in concert with the more general electronic health concept which encompasses a wide range of services that are at the cutting edge of healthcare and information technology, including access to electronic health records, electronic prescribing, telemedicine, and health informatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The realization of a portable, affordable medical diagnostic platform will have a profound impact on the global level. The proposed research will not only advance the basic science and technology of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems, but will also lead to the development of additional LOCs that do not require external optical components.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and develop a smartphone interface system that would enable rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable measurements with simultaneous detection using a medical sensing and diagnostic platform (MSDP) with a disposable cartridge lab-on-a-chip (CLOC) biochip. For integration with advanced mobile platforms They will utilize Google's open hardware platform, Project Ara, exploiting Java programming language which is commonly used by all mobile smartphone companies, including Google's Android. This device will include the use of an inexpensive, single use, disposable and universal CLOC that would be available in both developed and developing countries. The MSDP will perform detection on-chip, obviating the need for bulky detection equipment, paving the way for a truly portable medical diagnostic add-on for future smartphones.</AbstractNarration>

It is evident that the main technological challenge in creating such a low cost MSDP we developed its key component - an inexpensive, single use, disposable and universal cartridge lab-on-chip (CLOC) optofluidic platform that can be inserted into&nbsp; MSDP for detection and analysis of human fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, urine, breath, etc.). The intellectual merits of this project include fast (&lt;15 minutes), high sensitivity (0.1pM) and specificity (surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)) performed in parallel on the same multimodal sensing chip platform. We designed, fabricated and tested all the components necessary for realization of the CLOC including a novel metacoaxial nanoantenna for SERS, investigated the charge-transfer mechanism for chemical enhancement of SERS and developed digital microfluidics to deliver the analytes of interest to the sensing surface on the CLOC.&nbsp; Building upon these components research, they were integrated into a few compact multimodal CLOC transducers.&nbsp; Design and fabrication of an SPR-Raman combination biosensor has been developed that exhibits the efficient SPR modal coupling necessary for sensing, as well as significant Raman enhancement for specificity.&nbsp; Leveraging the chemical selectivity of binding, we have developed novel techniques to identify signature binding sites and decompose complex Raman spectra signals to quantify relative biochemical composition in analyte mixtures.&nbsp; We also designed, fabricated and tested an integrated device co-localizing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and Faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (f-EIS) biosensing measurements with neither mutual signal interference nor sensitivity degradation.&nbsp; The ability to integrate microfluidic filters, nanoscale transducers, on-chip spectrometer and complex data analysis software for the realization of a portable, affordable medical diagnostic platform will have a profound broader impact on the global level. The proposed research not only advanced the basic science and technology of lab-on-a-chip systems, but will also led to the development of additional systems that do not require external optical components. The project provided scientific training for students at graduate and undergraduate levels. Their training included developing rigorous electromagnetic, electronic and thermal modeling tools to design and analyze nanoscale surface plasmon polariton nanostructures and nanoantennas.&nbsp; They also are trained in establishing the advanced tools and techniques required to fabricate these nanostructured devices, and use advanced characterization techniques such as SPR and Raman spectroscopy, study of biomedical reactions using optical techniques as well as optical systems design. We continued our outreach, education and collaborative efforts with San Diego middle and high schools. Through our relationships with the Sweetwater, Preuss, and High Tech High Schools, we successfully engaged students of diverse ethnicity, gender and economic backgrounds in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).
