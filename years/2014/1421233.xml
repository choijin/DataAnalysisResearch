<AbstractNarration>As recently as Spring 2015 the topic of the origins of the indigenous peoples of North America has been broadly discussed in the popular press as a result of the recent findings of an ASSP supported project on Inuit genetics, PI Geoff Hayes, Northwestern University (see Forbes article, "How Alaska Natives Spurred Archaeologists To Research Their Origins." May 13, 2015).    This led to numerous additional articles in Tech Times, SitNews, Biology News Net etc.  The topic of the origins of Native Americans continues to be one of great public interest.   However, the academic community spurred by new information coming out of recent DNA research has yet to fully consider how this new research, that supports a Beringian origin of early North Americans, fits within the known anthropological, archaeological, linguistic, and environmental record.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a workshop planned for approximately 30 participants, chosen on the basis of their active research on the Beringian model and the late Pleistocene environment and archaeology of Beringia. It also would include participation by graduate students from several universities, who are working on related thesis projects.  The workshop would bring together for the first time researchers from multiple disciplines, researchers who have insight into various aspects of the Beringia issue but have not yet synthesized their knowledge.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop would be held at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at the University of Colorado in Boulder, which has a long history of research in the region. The workshop is organized and chaired by the PI John F. Hoffecker (INSTAAR), and CoPI Scott A. Elias (Royal Holloway, University of London), and Dennis H. O'Rourke (University of Utah).  It is proposed that the workshop take place in the Fall, most likely October of 2015.   An interdisciplinary workshop on the Out of Beringia thesis offers the most effective means of initiating progress among geneticists, ecologists, and anthropologists on the most important idea to emerge from the study of Native American origins in the past fifty years.  The workshop is intended to have a significant impact on the direction of research on the peopling of the Western Hemisphere. This workshop would bring together the world's foremost scholars and students to present the state of the art science on this topic and, more importantly, by synthesizing this information, discuss the trajectories that new research on this topic should take.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The immediate goal of the project was to hold an international workshop on the "Beringian Standstill Hypothesis" with participating scientists from human genetics, paleo-ecology, and anthropology (both archaeology and physical anthropology).  The Beringian Standstill Hypothesis derives Native Americans from a population that was isolated in Beringia during the Last Glacial Maximum (roughly 30,000 to 15,000 years ago).  It contradicts the widely held assumption that Native Americans migrated from Northeast Asia to the Americas less than 15,000 years ago.  Although explicitly proposed in 2007 by a team of geneticists, the hypothesis has roots in the research of several anthropologists that began in the 1970s.  And, although the current hypothesis was developed by geneticists, many elements of the model have found support from paleo-ecology and archaeology--and, most recently, from physical anthropology.   Two major research papers were published following the workshop; these papers reflected research conducted by participants of the workshop in the months leading up to the meeting.  The most important of them was a new analysis of Asian and Native American teeth that revealed a pattern similar to the human genetics data used to generate the Beringian Standstill Hypothesis in 2007. After the workshop, NSF granted permission to use unexpended funds to obtain some new radiocarbon dates on sites in northwestern Beringia (i.e., in the Russian Federation) that represent a key component of the archaeology of the Standstill Hypothesis.  The ultimate goal of the project was to stimulate discussion, publication, and new field and laboratory research on the role of Beringia in the peopling of the Americas with a new perspective on Beringia--not simply as a "bridge" from Asia to America, but as an Ice-Age refuge for people and a possibly the original homeland of all Native Americans, including the Native peoples of Alaska.  Beringia was warmer and wetter than other regions of the Far North during the Last Glacial Maximum because of the effects of the North Pacific Ocean circulation on the low-lying land between Siberia and Alaska exposed by fallen sea level between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago.    The project workshop, held at the University of Colorado in Boulder in late February 2016, triggered a series of follow-up meetings and events, including a symposium at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in early 2017, and development of a book project with Texas A&amp;M University Press several months later.  Both the AAAS symposium and book project brought anthropological linguistics into the discussion, specifically to address questions about the links of Dene-speakers to the Standstill Hypothesis.  New research at a remote cave in northern Yukon, published in early 2017, tentatively confirmed a human presence in eastern Beringia during the Last Glacial Maximum.  This research was stimulated in part by the Beringian Standstill debate, and the young woman who undertook it recently traveled to the University of Kansas for two days of discussion and research planning with participants of the 2016 workshop and 2017 symposium. Future interdisciplinary research in northern Yukon, including ancient DNA work, is tentatively planned for the summer of 2018.      In terms of wider societal impacts, it may be noted that the 2016 workshop and follow-up events attracted public media attention, most notably an article on the AAAS symposium published in The Economist (February 2017). The media attention reflects broad public interest and curiosity about the idea that Beringia, not Northern Asia, is the true homeland of all Native Americans.  To this may be added the potential impact of the idea that Native Alaskan peoples are not recent arrivals from Northern Asia, as is commonly believed, but are part of the original movement into Beringia before 30,000 years ago.  This is based on both the genetics and anatomy (and eventually perhaps on the archaeology and the linguistics) of the Beringian Standstill Hypothesis.    In terms of size and budget, this project was small, but its outcomes and consequences were large and they continue to affect both the research community and the wider public.
