<AbstractNarration>Texas Lutheran University (TLU) has received an NSF Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award for their project entitled "Learning Applied Science and Effective Research (LASER)." LASER will increase the number of academically talented and financially needy students and graduates in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, and physics. The project team will recruit and enroll 16 students to form two LASER cohorts: eight students in year one and eight students in year two. Students will be retained through graduation, achieving a baccalaureate degree, and employed in a STEM career within six months of graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A well-planned retention program will build on TLU academic support services that include supplemental instruction, peer tutoring, and strong career development programs. New STEM support services being designed specifically for LASER include a LASER living/learning community, cohorted courses, LASER peer and faculty mentors, professional networking, cohorted co-curricular STEM career modules, and science internship/research opportunities.  The project external evaluator will use both formative and summative evaluations to assess student progress to degree, participation in project activities, graduation rates, and career placement. Particular emphasis will be placed on the surveys to assess and improve the co-curricular career modules and professional conferences/networking.  These data will provide information about effective support of students through to graduation.</AbstractNarration>
