<AbstractNarration>Symposium on Learning Sciences and Online Learning: Interaction and Influence for&lt;br/&gt;Quality Practice and Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is currently witnessing a revolution within higher education due to the rapid emergence of online courses designed for large enrollment. Meanwhile, learning science research has been contributing to an increased understanding of how people learn and what it means to learn within specific disciplines, particularly for Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics (STEM). The potential to improve learning and reduce cost, coupled with the resources and efforts currently focused on emerging forms of online learning, provides the impetus for conducting conversations on how findings from the learning sciences can inform the development of meaningful and effective online learning education and, in turn, how online learning efforts can inform learning research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the rapid growth and evolution of online learning and learning research, it is often challenging for designers and practitioners to take into account findings from the learning sciences. Similarly, it is challenging for educational researchers to be well-informed of the various online learning experiments underway. As a response to these challenges, a symposium will bring together experts in the learning sciences and practitioners of online learning to provide recommendations for the design and implementation of online learning experiences that is grounded in research findings, outline future research directions in the learning sciences afforded by online learning. The symposium will create and catalyze a new publication and community site for the broader dissemination of research, practice, and resources in online learning. The outcomes of this symposium will be instrumental in guiding the development of quality online learning experiences for students worldwide and future research on student learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Online learning is becoming central to educational transformation efforts at institutions around the world. Currently, online learning ranges from exclusively online courses to smaller scale online modules utilized to advance learning objectives and/or facilitate flipped classroom and other blended formats. Meanwhile, learning sciences and discipline-based educational research (DBER) studies have been contributing to an increased understanding of how people learn and what it means to learn within specific disciplines. Given the rapid growth and evolution of educational technologies, online learning, and learning research, it is often challenging for designers and practitioners of emerging online learning experiences to take into account findings from the learning sciences, and similarly, it is challenging for educational researchers to be well informed on the various technological and pedagogical experiments underway in online learning. The increasing interest and engagement in digital and online learning suggest an urgency to examine the intersection of learning sciences/education research with digital learning practice. MIT hosted a symposium on May 21-22, 2015 that engaged over 90 leading researchers and educational practitioners in a discussion on how findings from the learning sciences can inform the development of meaningful online learning experiences, particularly for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and how the implementation of these experiences can in turn contribute and shape future research on learning in STEM. The goals of the symposium were to convene experts to share perspectives and collectively address the synergistic opportunities at the intersection of the learning sciences, discipline-based education research and online learning. The symposium succeeded in its goals by:  Initiating the development of a network or nascent community of scholars and practitioners from diverse fields. Motivating participants to work within their existing network of colleagues to increase collaborative research at the intersection of the learning sciences and online learning. And it also succeeded in linking people to others they had not previously known.   To ensure a broad impact, the project is undertaking a wide distribution of the materials and recommendations from the symposium, beyond the initially invited group, and is aiming to advance ongoing interactions and the engagement of practitioners and researchers in this emergent area of education.
