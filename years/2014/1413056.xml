<AbstractNarration>One of the primary objectives of extragalactic astronomy is to understand the formation and evolution of structures over cosmic time. Clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, and so a better understanding of their formation and evolution leads to deeper knowledge of the physics of the cosmos. In order to fully probe the physics and evolution of clusters, however, a co-ordinated multi-wavelength campaign is needed: while observations with X-ray telescopes are excellent at finding clusters, follow-up observations with optical telescopes are critical to measuring their distances from us. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will use the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) 2.4m, Magellan, and Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) optical observatories to measure the redshifts and distances to clusters identified in the X-ray Swift Serendipitous Cluster Survey (SSCS). The program will produce one of the largest X-ray selected cluster catalogs to date, and make it available to the entire astronomical community. The increased numbers of high-redshift clusters as a result of this work will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of cluster properties over cosmic time. The team will also study the relationships between the optical and X-ray properties of clusters as a function of redshift. Finally, they will use the sample to constrain cosmological parameters, such as the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two Principal Investigators of this collaboration will also launch an innovative series of outreach events that are designed to further develop the STEM workforce.  At the University of Oklahoma-Norman, Dr. Xinyu Dai will use a portable planetarium to deliver presentations to high schools in the Greater Oklahoma City area. At the same time, Dr. Joel Bregman will develop new shows for the on-campus planetarium at the University of Michigan Ann-Arbor. The results of their scientific efforts will also be distributed to the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project has yielded 442 uniformly selected galaxy clusters from the X-ray band.  This has significantly increased the sample of X-ray clusters discovered to date.  For example, a meta-catalog of ROSAT clusters contains 1500 clusters.  More significantly, the median redshift distribution of the clusters is evaluated be be z~0.5, and thus the project will significantly increase the sample of X-ray selected high redshift clusters with z&gt;0.5 after the final IR follow-up stage.  We have accurately constrained the logN-logS relation for galaxy clusters over the largest flux range from a single survey, suggesting that the cluster selection function is well modeled.  The pureness and completeness of the cluster sampled has been measured by our initial SDSS paper and further papers using optical follow-up observations.  18 refereed publication were resulted with the support of this fund.  4 graduate students and 4 undergraduate students were trained under this project. These students have been offered numerous observing opportunities at various telescopes, for imaging, standard single slit spectroscopic, and multi-slit spectroscopic observations. Besides training on research techniques and critical thinking, students are also trained on writing of scientific journals, telescope proposals, collaboration between team members, and presentation skills.  The team held two-day professional development workshops in 2016, 2017, and 2018 for astronomy education with the support of a portable planetarium.  Astronomy lesson contents are provided during the training, which are enhanced by planetarium shows. 24 Oklahoma K12 teachers have gone through the workshop, and a large fraction of them expressed interests in adopting the planetarium into their future teachings. The request for Soonertarium visits sky-rocketed after these workshops, and at the end of project period in 2019,  approximately 1,200 Oklahoma K12 students are impacted by the educational products enabled by the portable planetariums annually.
