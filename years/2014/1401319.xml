<AbstractNarration>The interplay between finding solutions to sets of equations and questions in geometry has been very fruitful in Mathematics. The PI's research fits into this way of thinking about both topics. The study of linear algebraic groups and homogeneous spaces provides a unified plank to understanding distinct interesting objects in algebra, geometry and number theory.  Extending the classical study over number fields, for example the rational numbers, to function fields, which includes  the class of simple functions such as polynomials, which is part of the PI's proposal,is useful from the geometric perspective.  Engaging graduate students on topics related to algebraic groups and homogeneous spaces, an area ripe with questions accessible to students, via seminars and workshops, will be part of the activities of the PI during this project execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of quadratic forms and their zeros over function fields over number fields and p-adic fields is an example of the objects studied during this proposal period. The PI plans to investigate questions related to the study of homogeneous spaces with special reference to quadratic forms and Brauer groups. The PI shall study the period-index questions for the Brauer group of function fields of curves over number fields with a view to bounding the u-invariant of such fields. It is an open question whether quadratic forms in sufficiently many variables over function fields of curves over totally imaginary number fields have a nontrivial zero with conditional results dependent on the Hasse principle for twisted moduli spaces over curves over number fields; the PI will investigate the obstruction to the Hasse principle for such spaces. Higher reciprocity obstructions using the Bloch-Ogus theory will be used to study the existence of rational points on homogeneous spaces over function fields. The PI also proposes to study G-trace forms, via construction of invariants, towards answering realisability questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Significant results   The main goals of the project were the study of period-index  and u- invariant questions over 2-dimensional fields, study of Hasse principles for  homogeneous spaces under connected linear algebraic groups and the study of trace forms of Galois algebras. The following are the main results proved during the project period.   On the u-invariant of function fields of curves over complete discrete valued fields (jointly with V. Suresh).     Let F be a function field in one variable over a complete discrete valued field with residue field k of characteristic p &gt; 0 and  has finite 2-rank d. We prove that there is an integer N dependent only on d such that every quadratic form in at least N variables over F has a nontrivial zero.  The method of proof is to prove that the p-torsion in the Brauer group of F is uniformly bounded.     Local-global principle for reduced norms over function fields of p-adic curves (jointly with R. Preeti and V. Suresh).   A classical theorem of Hasse-Maass-Schilling asserts that local reduced norms are reduced norms from division algebras over a number field. An analogous question was posed as a conjecture by Colliot-Thelene, Parimala and Suresh for function fields of curves over p-adic fields. We settle this conjecture in the affirmative if the exponent of the division algebra is coprime to p. The method of proof is to give a cohomological criterion for an element to be a reduced norm analogous to Suslin?s criterion for prime index algebras.   Cohomological invariants for G-Galois algebras and self-dual normal bases (jointly with Eva Bayer-Fluckiger).        Subsequent to the proof of Hasse principle for self-dual normal basis for G-Galois algebras jointly with E. Bayer-Fluckiger and J.-P. Serre, a project to understand local conditions for the existence of self-dual normal basis G-Galois algebras over global fields was started together with E. Bayer-Fluckiger. Certain Galois cohomological invariants of degree 2 for trace forms of G-Galois algebras have been defined and using these invariants, precise local necessary conditions are given in terms of the vanishing of these invariants. Using these local criteria, one can characterise the existence of self-dual normal basis globally in terms of the invariants.    Embedding of maximal tori in classical groups over local and global fields and explicit Brauer-Manin obstruction (Jointly with Eva Bayer- Fluckiger and Ting-Yu Lee).   Embeddings of maximal tori in classical groups over global fields of characteristic not 2 are the subject matter of several recent papers with special reference to Hasse principles. The embedding problem reduces to embeddings of  etale algebras with involutions into central simple algebras with involution. In this paper we construct explicit Brauer-Manin set which captures the obstruction to the embedding problem. All known failures of Hasse principle are explained in terms of the obstruction.
