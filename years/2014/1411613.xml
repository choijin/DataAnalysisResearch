<AbstractNarration>This award funds work to use a new instrument developed by the PI for astronomical observations with the Palomar 200-inch and Shane 3-m telescopes in California. The instrument is called the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-IR Spectrophotometry (ARCONS), and is the first of a new generation of astronomical instrumentation that uses a recently developed superconducting detector technology: Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs).  MKIDs may replace semiconductor and microchannel plate detectors in the UV, optical, and near-IR wavelength bands, and have the potential to benefit nearly every branch of astronomy.  The PI and his team will use ARCONS to obtain time and energy resolved imaging of optical pulsars, a highly magnetized, rotating neutron star that emits a beam of light.  Neutron stars are city-sized objects that form out of the gravitational collapse of massive stars during a supernova explosion. Optical pulsars change too quickly to be accurately recorded by charge-coupled devices (CCDs), which are currently the dominant astronomical detector. These observations will be useful for better understanding the complicated physics that dominates pulsar emission, and also help open new applications of this detector for other fields of astrophysics. The PI will also train and mentor a graduate student in research with instrumentation, experimental and observational techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MKID arrays are nearly ideal photon sensors, capable of measuring the energy (to several percent) and the arrival time to a microsecond of each incoming photon, optimized for near infrared and optical (3,500 - 13,500 Angstroms) wavelengths. They have no read noise or dark current and perfect cosmic ray rejection, and are ideally suited to measuring rapidly varying sources. The observations and analysis will be used to improve understanding of the link between radio and optical emission in pulsars, search for spectral changes as a function of phase in the faint known optical pulsars PSR B0656+14 and Geminga, and open a new temporal regime by searching for pulsations in isolated and binary millisecond pulsars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this work was to use a unique new camera named ARCONS to take data on pulsars in the optical and near infrared in order to learn about how Pulsars emit light.  Pulsars are fascinating objects ? the neutron rich cores of massive dying stars, they contain ~1.4 times the mass of the sun in a sphere the size of Manhattan that can spin up to ~500 times per second.   Studying Pulsars is very difficult or impossible with a conventional astronomical instrument as the detectors used (usually CCDs) are too slow to measure the rapidly rotating neutron stars.  ARCONS uses a unique superconducting detector called a Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector, or MKID, to allow us to measure the arrival time of every photon to ~1 microsecond without any false counts.  This allows a quantum leap in the ability to measure rapidly changing objects like Pulsars.  As a part of this work we observed several Pulsars.  We discovered and published a fascinating correlation in the arrival time of Giant Radio Pulsars (measured by Greenbank) and optical pulses (measured by ARCONS at Palomar) that had never been seen before.  We also published two papers that put upper limits on the optical and near infrared flux of millisecond pulsar J0336+1715 and on the fascinating super-Eddington pulsar and Ultraluminuos X-ray source (ULX) at the heart of nearby galaxy M82 called M82 X-2.
