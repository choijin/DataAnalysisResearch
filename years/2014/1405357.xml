<AbstractNarration>The goal of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative research award is to offer insights into improving patient flow through inpatient units and efficiently managing staff workload. This research will allow hospital managers to increase patient satisfaction and service throughput, policy makers to develop improved benchmarks for hospital workflows, and front-line providers to make intelligent data-driven decisions. Hospitals locally and nationally will be able to better align care processes, improve patient flow, all while lowering costs. Patients will have improved access to and quality of care. One of the concrete outputs of the project is a decision-support system that is expected to have have high potential for commercialization, and hence yield broad impact of the research, in the healthcare analytics market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goals will be met via the development of a set of innovative models and solution approaches for analyzing and optimizing inpatient discharge decisions pertaining to patient flow alignment and care professional workload management. This work will help reduce inpatient discharge lateness and overnight stays, alleviate delays in transfers from upstream units, as well as balance discharge and non-discharge related workload for hospital staff. These improvements will be accomplished by optimally aligning bed-requests from upstream units with bed-releases from the inpatient unit. A novel decision-dependent stochastic combinatorial optimization framework will be developed that integrates inpatient discharge prioritization and workload scheduling decisions, which will be solved using an innovative scenario decomposition method. Rigorous theoretical derivation and comprehensive computational studies will be conducted for the proposed solution approach using real-data from our hospital partner.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative research award, Kong, Lawley and their research groups at Purdue and Texas A&amp;M, respectively, have primarily developed stochastic programming formulations that aim to sequence the inpatient discharge related workload for those in-charge nurses, as well as the workload of hospital in-house ancillary service providers (ASPs), i.e., those support services other than room, board, and medical and nursing services for hospital patients in the course of care, such as laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, and physical therapy services. Furthermore, the formulations developed aim to streamline inpatient discharges and admissions (i.e., bed requests from those who plan to transfer from the emergency department). Uncertainty of various sources arise during the decision making, which not only include processing times of in-charge nurses and ASPs, but also random arrivals of the bed requests. Meanwhile, ASPs not only provide services to ready-to-discharge patients but also newly arrival and recurring patients in the viewpoint of inpatient unit management. The aforementioned factors present challenges to the formulation activities.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In this research project, Kong, Lawley, and their research teams mainly took charge of developing a two-stage stochastic programming model for the in-charge nurse workload sequencing under uncertainty problem. In addition, Kong provided assistance to the formalization of the ASP workload sequencing under uncertainty problem. Kong was also the main driving force behind developing a two-stage stochastic programming model for the ASP workload sequencing under uncertainty problem. Kong also lent his expertise on the necessary stochastic programming algorithm development. As an initial attempt for the in-charge nursing workload sequencing problem, the research team adapted a stochastic decomposition algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This research was motivated by challenges in current practice of numerous hospitals around the country. The main collaborators on this project included Kettering Health Networks at the beginning and M.D Anderson Cancer Center lately. On the Wright State University site, a collaboration with Maine Health was forged. With these collaborations, the research team has acquired in-depth understanding on the processes of inpatient discharge related services and their interplay with other hospital services. More specifically, the research team has generated a set of scenarios that well represent the current service pattern. With further testing and integration, delivered mathematical optimization models and numerical solution tools are expect to be useful to inpatient discharge management.</p> <p>This project has created opportunities for training and professional development at Purdue and Texas A&amp;M. Kong expects to graduate 2 PhD students in 2018 or 2019. Lawley has trained 1 postdoc (who is currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor) and 1 PhD student. Together, we have published one paper at IIE Transactions. We also submitted one manuscript to MSOM and are currently revising it. We have also made several presentations in national/international conferences in the OR/MS area.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kong has further strengthened his collaboration with Dr. Pratik Parikh at Wright State University. During the project, our collaboration led to another CMMI OE proposal submission. The second round of submission is currently under review. Together we also submitted an AHRQ proposal. During the project duration, the two sides together published 2 papers with one currently under review. Furthermore, Kong has established a fruitful line of research collaboration with Dr Mingyang Li at the University of South Florida. Together we have published 1 journal paper, 1 conference proceedings paper, and 1 book chapter. Furthermore, Kong has strengthen his collaborations with his Chinese colleagues on healthcare OR. They together have published 1 journal paper with one other currently under review. &nbsp;Finally, Kong has taken more leadership in the area of healthcare OR. He co-edited two books in the area and co-chaired the cluster &ldquo;Healthcare Operations Management&rdquo; at INFORMS Healthcare 2017 Conference.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Nan&nbsp;Kong</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1405357/1405357_10300151_1512042990855_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1405357/1405357_10300151_1512042990855_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A two-stage stochastic programming formulation for the IDP"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1405357/1405357_10300151_1512042990855_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A two-stage stochastic programming formulation for the IDP"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The first-stage model is on the top and the second-stage model is at the bottom half.
