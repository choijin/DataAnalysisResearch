<AbstractNarration>As the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has grown, EHRs are now composed of a diverse array of data, including structured information (e.g., diagnoses, medications, and lab results), molecular sequences, unstructured clinical progress notes, and social network information. There is mounting evidence that EHRs are a rich resource for clinical research, but they are notoriously difficult to leverage because of their orientation to healthcare business operations, heterogeneity across commercial systems, and high levels of missing or erroneous entries. Moreover, the interactions among different data sources within an EHR are challenging to model, hampering our ability to leverage traditional analytic frameworks. In recognition of this problem, various efforts have been undertaken to transform EHR data into concise and meaningful concepts, or phenotypes. Yet, to date, these efforts have been ad hoc and labor intensive, resulting in specific phenotypes for specific environments; e.g., type 2 diabetes in the EHR system at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). There is an urgent need for scalable phenotyping methods, but several major challenges must be addressed, including: a) patient representation, b) high-throughput phenotype generation from EHRs, c) expert-guided phenotype refinement, and d) phenotype adaptation across institutions. The goal of this project is to address these challenges by developing a general computational framework for transforming EHR data into meaningful phenotypes with only modest levels of expert guidance.  The PIs will develop novel courses on Healthcare Analytics as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) that covers cross-disciplinary topics at the confluence of computer science and medical informatics, while embellishing existing graduate courses on biomedical informatics. The PIs plan to deliver tutorials and organize workshops at relevant computer science and medical informatics conferences with the goal of sharing research results and developing a community. The PIs will develop outreach modules that focus on freshmen and under-represented students, as well as educational sessions for clinical researchers who are currently performing phenotyping in academic medical centers.  Thus, the project has a significant component the integrates research and education as well as providing for new scientific insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In support of this goal, the team plans to represent and analyze EHR data as inter-connected high-order relations i.e. tensors (e.g. tuples of patient-medication-diagnosis, patient-lab, and patient-symptoms). The proposed analytic framework generalizes several existing data mining methodologies, including dimensionality reduction, topic modeling and co-clustering, which all arise as limited special cases of analyzing second order tensors. It will also enable flexible refinement of candidates to adapt phenotypes from one healthcare institution to another, and will incorporate feedback from domain experts. The accompanying suite of algorithms and methods will enable the automation of high-throughput phenotype generation, refinement, adaptation and applications, in a broad range of health informatics settings and across multiple institutions. This project will integrate biomedical informaticists, computer scientists, and clinical experts. The significance of the resulting phenotypes in diverse clinical applications, including: a) cohort construction, where case and control patients are identified with respect to specific phenotype combinations; b) genome wide association studies (GWAS), where target phenotypes of patients are tested against DNA sequence variation for significant statistical associations; and c) clinical predictive modeling, where a model is developed to predict target phenotypes or diseases will be demonstrated. The framework will be developed with public accessible data from MIMIC-II and CMS and validate in real clinical environments at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and VUMC through several high-impact disease targets (including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis). Additionally, the methodologies developed through this project will be integrated into existing software platforms that support the representation of EHR-derived phenotypes, but lack a data-driven component for the generation and refinement of candidates. Overall, the proposed framework is expected to have a major impact on translational clinical research including clinical trial design, predictive modeling, epidemiology studies and clinical decision support.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this collaboration between four institutions (Georgia Tech, University of Texas Austin, Vanderbilt University, and Northwestern University), we set out to develop and implement a novel method to define disease subtypes (phenotypes).    Our specific aims were:  1) To develop unsupervised/high-throughput phenotyping algorithms using tensor factorization  2) To apply and evaluate the proposed phenotyping algorithms on real electronic health record data  3) To demonstrate the utility of those discovered phenotypes through important clinical research applications such as cohort construction, predictive modeling, and genome-wise association study.   4) To develop methods for effectively refining phenotypes based on domain expert's feedback  5) To adapt phenotyping algorithms across institutions  Our primary outcomes were:  1) We developed novel software tools to enable investigators to apply Tensor Factorization to identify clusters of similar patients using electronic health records.    2) We demonstrated, using data from Electronic Health Records, that unsupervised phenotyping algorithms (using the tools developed above) can generate clinically relevant phenotypes, and that these phenotypes are portable across institutions.    3) We generated multiple publications.  Specific to the Northwestern team we were involved in four publications, two posters and one podium presentation at a national conference.  The tools developed as part of this work have been made available to other investigative teams and have given us a new method to explore clustering of disease expression to identify potentially novel sub-phenotypes.  We are able to apply these methods to a host of new conditions in healthcare.            Last Modified: 11/28/2018       Submitted by: Abel N Kho]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
