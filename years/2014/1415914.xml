<AbstractNarration>Convergent margins, where an oceanic plate dives under the edge of a continental plate, are the sites of many fundamental Earth processes and features that include the world?s largest earthquakes, the longest volcanic chains with some of the youngest supervolcano eruptions, and one of the world?s longest mountain ranges, the Andes.  The subduction of the (Pacific) oceanic plate beneath the western margin of South America constitutes the largest ocean-continent convergent margin system on Earth, and hence, is an ideal location to study these important processes and features. We propose to study a large portion of the South American convergent margin by taking advantage of existing seismic data from over 1000 permanent and portable seismic stations that span over 4000 km of the central Andes.  We will use modern computational techniques to generate seismic images of the subsurface beneath the Andes to depths as great as 1000 km.  By using these new seismic images, our specific scientific goals are to improve our understanding of how earthquakes and volcanoes are building and destroying the mountains, and whether and how water is transported to great depths in the Earth. This project will build on and synthesize two decades of work in the region by the seismology group at the University of Arizona and our scientific collaborators in Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. The broader impacts include training graduate students in modern seismic techniques and strengthening our international collaborations in South America.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismic methods potentially provide the highest resolution images of the Earth from the upper crust to the lower mantle. We will use Surface Wave Tomography, Finite-Frequency Teleseismic Travel Time Tomography (P- &amp; S-wave and Vp/Vs), Receiver Functions and a joint inversion of Surface Wave Data and Receiver Functions to produce uniform seismic images of the western margin of South America.  Using our newly developed seismic images, our specific scientific goals are to:&lt;br/&gt;? Evaluate the along strike role of delamination in the building of the Andes.&lt;br/&gt;? Investigate the along strike variability in lower crustal accommodation of crustal shortening, including pure shear thickening, lower crustal flow, and high-angle Moho-cutting faults.&lt;br/&gt;? Revisit the question of the importance of magmatic addition in the thickening of the Andean crust. &lt;br/&gt;? Investigate the deformation of the subducted Nazca slab as it penetrates the mantle transition zone, and the role of deeply subducted fluids in the mantle transition zone and below the slab.&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase our knowledge about mountain building, crustal deformation and the subduction process by producing a uniform set of high-resolution seismic images of a large along-strike region of the western margin of South America.  With uniform seismic images, we can better evaluate different mechanisms that create high elevations and the causes of along-strike variability.  Our last goal is related to improving our understanding of the deeper structure of the Nazca slab and the surrounding mantle. Our improved seismic images will help us evaluate the presence of and pathways for water in the mantle transition zone.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate is one of our best modern examples of a long-lived ocean-continent subduction plate boundary on the Earth, serving as a natural laboratory for studies to understand the subduction process.  Subduction zones are the sites of the largest earthquakes and volcanoes are produced and often form large mountains such as the Andes that span length of ~6000 km. Over the last 25 years numerous portable seismic deployments and an increase in permanent seismic stations have produce a wealth of seismic data to image the subduction zone and Andes from the surface to ~1200 km depth.  We have been able to use this data to study crustal thickness (crustal thickness between 35 and 75 km), the process of removal of the dense lower parts of the upper plate, volcanic processes at depth, and the subducted Nazca plate geometry in much more detail than ever before.   We have used seismic tomography methods (a technique much like a medical CATSCAN) to image the subducting oceanic Nazca plate as it descends into the Earth to a depth of ~1200 km. The subducted plate is higher density that the surrounding rock so it wants to descend. This represents at least 30 million years of subducted material. The subducting oceanic plate or slab penetrates into the lower part of the mantle but stagnates at ~1000 km depth.  This provides clues to properties in the lower mantle suggesting a possible change in viscosity (ability to flow) and/or a mineral phase change at ~1000 km.   We have improved our knowledge of flat slab subduction where the down-going plate takes on a near horizontal geometry instead of descending at a moderate angle. The flat slabs are strongly coupled to the upper plate and cause deformation many 100s of km inland.   We have measured the continental crustal thickness along the Andes and surrounding regions and find crust 35 to 75 km thick.  In the regions of extremely thick continental crust (60-75 km thick) we observe evidence that the crust is flowing in the north south direction suggesting crustal material can move due to stresses in the Earth.  In the central Andes, the Puna Plateau contains some of the largest and highest volcanic fields on Earth.  We have imaged these large volcanic fields in southern Bolivia and northern Argentina called the Altiplano Puna Volcanic Field.  This volcanic field has a long eruption history over the last 11 million years with ~15,000 km3 of volcanic rock at the surface.  In this area, we have identified a very large region of partial melt associated with these eruptions at ~15-20 km depth where the partial melts pools before going to the surface magma chamber to erupt.  From our seismic images we estimate that this magma body has a volume of ~520,000 km3, one of the largest ever imaged.  This shows that material from the mantle (region below the continental crust) does not ascend up through the crust at the time of an eruption but rather pools at ~15-20 km depth and interacts with the continental crust before erupting.  Overall, we were able to do a wide of seismic imaging studies taking advantage of the large seismic data set that exists in the Andes, despite the variations in the type of data and duration of recordings.  Overall the high Andean Mountains are formed by thick crust with minor additions of magma from the mantle.  The Andean Mountains are sites of both crustal formation and crustal destruction.  Broader Impacts:  This project has contributed to the education and parts of the dissertations of 6 PhD students.  The graduate students gained skills and knowledge in seismology, computational methods and tectonics.  The project had a large international component with collaborators from Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. We organized a small workshop for each country to send a student and combined with University of Arizona students we taught the basics of a seismic tomography method using ambient noise (signals form wind and waves on the coast of South America as sources for our imaging).  This provided education and training for graduate students from 7 institutions world-wide.  The results of this project have been used in two University of Arizona courses providing exciting and new results about seismic imaging and subduction to students.
