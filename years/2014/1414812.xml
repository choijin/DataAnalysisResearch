<AbstractNarration>While many adults struggle to learn a second language, children have the ability to learn multiple languages very quickly and easily. This project will investigate why some adults may be better at learning languages than others. This project will also address the on-going debate as to whether adult second language (L2) learners truly process language in the same way as native speakers, even according to precise online, or real-time, measurements. These questions are particularly relevant to Korean learners of English because Korean and English have very different language structures. Understanding if adult Korean speakers are able to become fully native-like in their online processing of English sentences can help to inform research-based pedagogical practices and policy decisions in language education. This project will be completed in collaboration with Dr. Yo-An Lee at Sogang University in South Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Native speakers of a language do not wait until the end of the sentence to try to understand it or predict upcoming words. However, little is known about whether L2 learners are also predictive processors. The current study tests two competing hypotheses regarding the use of prediction in L2 processing. Whereas one proposal predicts that advanced L2 learners will be able to use prediction similarly to native speakers, a more recent proposal suggests that such native-like processing is not possible even at advanced proficiency levels. Specifically, this project examines pre-verbal gap-filling in wh-dependencies using a moving window, non-cumulative self-paced reading paradigm. In particular, this project will investigate whether manipulating the linguistic distance between the filler and possible gap mediates whether native or nonnative speakers are able to demonstrate subject filled-gap effects. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview     This National Science Foundation funded dissertation research informs a debate that exists in both the scientific community and the general public as to whether a person can fully acquire a language after puberty.  Current second language acquisition theories suggest that an adult second language (L2) learner relies on different information when attempting to understand a language than is used by a native speaker of the language.  However, critics of such theories point to examples of L2 learners who are virtually indistinguishable from native speakers in measures of language processing.  If some adult learners of a language are able to demonstrate native-like proficiency in a language, than possible language differences between native and L2 language speakers must be dependent on factors other than age.  This project aims to investigate a sample of possible factors which may influence L2 learnersÃ† ability to process sentences using similar information as native speakers.        Intellectual Merit     In collaboration with Dr. Yo-An Lee at Sogang University in Seoul, South Korea, I collected language processing data from native Korean speaking, adult learners of English.  My goal was to test competing hypotheses regarding whether adult L2 learners can rapidly predict sentence structure during online, or real-time, language processing, similar to native speakers of English.  Many current theories propose that native speakers of a language use prediction to help them efficiently process language.  However, L2 learners are thought to be unable to use similar strategies.  My study examined whether L2 learners were, indeed, able to make predictions, but were otherwise limited by general processing factors, such as the time available to make a prediction or an individualÃ†s general cognitive capacities.  To achieve this goal, I collected data from over 100 adult Korean learners of English in Seoul, South Korea.  Participants completed a sentence processing task, followed by a series of tasks measuring their general cognitive abilities.  These data will then be compared to similar data points collected from adult native speakers of English in the United States.      As few studies have specifically examined L2 learnersÃ† ability to make predictions during online sentence processing, the findings from this study will help to further inform the debate as to why children seem to be better able to learn languages than adults.         Broader Impacts     The specific results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed presentations and journal publications. Throughout the development and implementation of this project, I introduced other linguistics students to psycholinguistic research. Furthermore, I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in a preK-12 teacher education preparation program at an open enrollment university.  In this position, I am able to train current and future K-12 public school teachers in action research to improve preK-12 student outcomes, particularly students who are learning English as a second language (ESL).  I specifically have used my EAPSI experiences to improve my college studentsÃ† understanding of the cultural differences they may see in their English language learners and to dispel myths regarding second language acquisition. Such myths can lead to poorly designed ESL programs which contribute to the pervasive inequalities observed in the academic achievement of minority language speakers as compared to their English-speaking peers.  Thus, this opportunity has helped me to progress toward my goal of encouraging international collaboration and exchanges to develop research-based best practices in language education and teaching.     In addition to learning about conversational analysis from Dr. Yo-An Lee  and his helpful graduate students, I also met with researchers in other  universities for the purpose of developing future international  collaborations in the areas of psycholi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
