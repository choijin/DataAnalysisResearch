<AbstractNarration>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry is a unique sensor that can provide all-weather, day-and-night, high resolution information about Earth's dynamic processes on a global scale. This sensor is now an integral part of many disciplines with a wide range of applications including environmental remote sensing, geosciences and climate research, earthquake and volcanic research, 3D and 4D mapping of Earth's topography, ocean surface current monitoring, hazard and disaster monitoring, as well as defense and security related tasks. The trend in user requirements show an increasing demand for information content with the ultimate goal of global monitoring of Earth's surface and dynamic phenomena continuously. Ever-increasing demand on information requires higher bandwidth transmission, higher transmit power and consequently more complex and larger system design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a fundamentally new theory and subsequent methods and algorithms for synthetic aperture interferometry using ultra-narrowband continuous waveforms (UNB-CW). Unlike pulsed systems, UNB-CW systems are low-power, low-cost, robust, environmentally friendly, lightweight and suitable for low-payload platforms, such as micro-satellites. Central to our approach is an alternative imaging paradigm, which we refer to as Doppler-SAR imaging. Conventional SAR relies on wideband waveforms to image scatterers that lie on high resolution range contours. Doppler-SAR takes advantage of high Doppler resolution and images scatterers that lie on Doppler contours. The objective of this project is to establish the basic interferometric observable equations in the Doppler-SAR paradigm. The investigators study the interferometric phase relationships; the sensitivity to underlying parameters and topography; corresponding appropriate coherence relations; and study the effect of noise, clutter and ambiguities for the Doppler-SAR across-track interferometry.</AbstractNarration>

Unlike wide-band transmitters, UNCW systems are low-power, low-cost, robust, environmentally friendly, lightweight and suitable for low-payload platforms, such as micro-satellites.    Intellectual merit: Central to our approach is an alternative imaging paradigm, which we refer to as Doppler-SAR imaging.

Doppler-SAR imaging relies on high Doppler resolution provided by UNCW and Doppler-rate provided by the movement of sensors. While conventional approach reconstructs scatterers that lie on constant range contours, Doppler-SAR reconstructs scatterers that lie on constant Doppler contours. The mathematical underpinnings of Doppler-SAR imaging are in inverse scattering theory and generalized Radon transforms and their inversion.  We developed theoretical foundations for the following new and novel interferometric modalities in Doppler-SAR paradigm:    1)      Doppler Across-Track Interferometry: Conventional SAR interferometry relies on wideband transmitted waveforms to obtain high range resolution. Topography of a surface is directly related to the range difference between two antennas con?gured at different positions. We derived interferometric phase model and develop the equations of height mapping in Doppler-SAR paradigm. Unlike conventional SAR interferometry, we show that the topography of a scene is related to the difference in Doppler between two antennas con?gured at different velocities.   2)      Doppler Displaced Phase Center Antenna (Doppler-DPCA) and Doppler Along-Track Interferometry (Doppler-ATI: The DPCA and ATI techniques have the distinct advantage of removing the response from stationary scatterers (clutter). We developed DPCA and ATI techniques in Doppler synthetic aperture radar (Doppler-SAR) paradigm to image moving scatterers embedded in clutter. We consider a two-channel bistatic configuration with a stationary antenna transmitting UNCW and two receiving antennas moving along an arbitrary trajectory in tandem. We derive interferometric phase model and develop equations of velocity mapping. While conventional wideband SAR DPCA and ATI use range difference, Doppler-DPCA and Doppler-ATI use high resolution temporal Doppler difference in imaging of moving targets.   These novel modalities can be used for applications requiring high signal-to-noise ratio, long-range, low-power and low payload such as micro-satellites and uninhabited aerial vehicles; passive imaging using sources of opportunity, such as TV and radio stations and applications requiring spectrum efficiency. Additionally, they provide efficient use of electromagnetic spectrum.  Broader impact: Synthetic aperture interferometry contributes to the solution of many societal challenges including climate change, sustainable development, mobility, civil and environmental protection and homeland-security. In the near future it is envisioned that a web of space-based micro-satellites equipped with SAR interferometry will provide a view of our planet like we are used to seeing with Google Earth, but with high-resolution images and relevant geospatial information being updated continuously.
