<AbstractNarration>Despite growing demands for a technically and scientifically literate US labor force, women and members of racial/ethnic minority groups remain underrepresented in STEM careers. A major gap in the knowledge base around this phenomenon is an understanding of the different pathways that many underrepresented students take when making STEM education and career choices. For example, women and underrepresented minorities are disproportionately likely to enroll in a community college initially with the intent of transferring to a four-year institution. The proposed research will address the gap in the current research base by investigating how pathways through community colleges to four-year institutions contribute to the roots of gender and racial inequalities in those who earn STEM degrees. The study will explicitly examine the individual characteristics and educational experiences of students who started their post-secondary education in community colleges. Specifically, this multi-phased study will investigate the structural and individual factors that contribute to women and underrepresented minorities' lower probability of completing a STEM major, compared to White men. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quantitative portion of the project will integrate data on community college students into an existing dataset (Roots 8-16 dataset). This current dataset links administrative records on students from the public schools of North Carolina from eighth grade into one of the sixteen campuses of the UNC university system. This project will add administrative records on students who transfer from community colleges into the four-year university system, thus diversifying the sample while strengthening the conclusions that may be drawn from it. This portion of the project focuses on the structural opportunities and constraints to math and science learning in middle and high school and their impact on later educational trajectories. Researchers will examine the barriers and opportunities to learning to determine whether there are differential impacts on students from various backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The qualitative portion of the study consists of a series of interviews with community college students who have indicated a desire to transfer to a four-year university and an interest in majoring in STEM. Students will be interviewed the first year of the project and again three years later to examine their experiences and to further probe the findings from the quantitative study, including: influences on making the transition to four-year colleges and how female STEM majors navigate social structural constraints and opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-funded study investigated the factors that contribute to the underrepresentationof women and people of color in STEM majors, with a particular focus on the experiences ofcommunity college students. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal multi-methodinvestigation of the interactive effects of organizational and individual factors from middleschool through community college and into four-year universities that influence people's choice of college major and probability of graduating with those majors.  The study had two major components; first, members of the research team worked with several different organizations to expand an existing "Roots of STEM" dataset which combined educational records from seventh grade through college graduation for the members of the 2004 public high school graduating class who attended a campus of the University of North Carolina immediately after graduation. Through this project, we added information from students who attended community college prior to joining college to the dataset. The expanded dataset allowed us to follow a larger cohort of students’ progress through different levels of schooling and more accurately reflect the educational trajectories of the public school students who graduated high school in 2004.  The second component of the project involved interviews with community college students who sought to transfer to STEM majors in four-year NC public universities and follow-up interviews with those students several years later. In the first round of interviews (2015), we interviewed 200 students who were (1) enrolled at NC community colleges, (2) stated an interest in STEM fields, and (3) planned to transfer to four-year colleges. During the second round of interviews (2018), we interviewed 67 students who were interviewed in the initial round to gain knowledge about their transferring processes from community college into four-year colleges. In addition, in this second round we also interviewed 37 other students who had successfully transferred from community colleges to the four-year university system (but were not interviewed in 2015). These interviews allowed us to explore in more detail the experiences students lived during their transfer processes.  Insights from our study have contributed to the refinement of theories regarding the roots of gender, SES and racial inequalities in college major choice, especially as those theories concern the impact of educational trajectories that include community college experiences. Notably, our findings regarding the discontinuity between the social climate of community colleges and four-year institutions and the extent to which that discontinuity has particularly gender- and racial-specific elements represent important steps forward. Additionally, our qualitative data continue to serve as a resource for students and scholars who wish to investigate topics of academic preparation, family support, development of a science identity, and experiences with racial and gender discrimination for a large cohort of community college students. Insights from the findings of our project focus on the relevance of community college attendance in students’ futures in STEM.  A brief overview of some of these findings include:  For our sample of students who attended a four&#8208;year institution and declared a major within six years of high school graduation, attending a community college and/or starting post&#8208;secondary education at a community college had a significant positive relationshipwith their likelihood of declaring and graduating with a STEM major.  The benefits of community college attendance on students’ likelihood of declaring and graduating with a STEM major are not restricted to only low&#8208;SES students.  Two&#8208;year colleges could work as means of helping push students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds into STEM.  Given the nature of our quantitative data, we can only draw conclusions about those community college students who transferred to four-year universities. Students who did not transfer are not part of our quantitative study.       Last Modified: 03/19/2021       Submitted by: Melissa Dancy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
