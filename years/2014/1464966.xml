<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program is supporting the Collaborative research of Professor John C. Poutsma at the College of William and Mary and Professor Jennifer Poutsma at Old Dominion University. Professor John Poutsma employs mass spectrometry-based experiments to study the subtle interplay between the structure of amino acids and their gas-phase energetic properties. He is studying a class of compounds known as non-protein amino acids (NPAA), which are found naturally in plants and fungi, but are not used in protein synthesis. Many NPAAs are toxic to humans and other animals in part due to structural similarity to one or more of the twenty common protein amino acids (PAA). NPAAs can compete with PAAs in a variety of biological pathways including being mis-incorporated into proteins and peptides. These experiments will further understanding of the intrinsic chemistry of NPAAs as isolated entities and when incorporated into small peptides. Professor Jennifer Poutsma is performing density functional theory calculations that support and guide the experimental studies. Both research programs integrate research and educational components through the training of undergraduate researchers. The vast majority of the research projects outlined in this proposal are being performed by undergraduates at William and Mary and Old Dominion University. Performing independent research helps to teach these students not only the joy of discovery but also how to handle and work though the inevitable failures that accompany real-world science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, the intrinsic gas-phase thermochemical properties of di-peptides are being determined using the extended kinetic method in a triple quadrupole instrument. Specifically, the PIs are studying the gas-phase acid-base chemistry of dipeptides that contain proline or one of its non-protein amino acid analogs azetidine-2-carboxylic acid or pipecolic acid. Thar are working to determine the effects of ring-size and conformational flexibility on the acid-base properties of these species with the goal of applying this knowledge towards a better understanding the mechanisms for selective fragmentations in low-energy tandem mass spectrometry experiments of proline-containing peptides.</AbstractNarration>

These experiments form the basis of MS-based proteomics experiments aimed at an enhanced knowledge of the behavior of proteins. Though highly automated, these MS-based proteomics experiments rely on empirically-derived "rules" for how peptides fall apart in mass spectrometers. Our goal is to improve our understanding of these "rules" so as to better predict when they will fail. During the three year term of the award, we published four papers on the structure of small biomolecules with an additional paper recently submitted.</p> <p>Much of the research in this on-going study centered on using Infrared Multiple Photon Dissociation Spectroscopy to determine the structure of peptide fragmentation products.&nbsp; The "rules" specify that when energy is added to peptides in the mass spectrometer, they fragment to give b<sub>n</sub><sup>+</sup> and y<sub>m</sub><sup>+</sup> ions, where n and m are the number of amino acids in the individual fragments. By studying not only what the product ions of fragmentation are, but also what their structures are, we hope to further our understanding of the mechanisms for fragmentation and have a better chance of predicting the distribution of fragment ions from any given dissociation.&nbsp; Our first paper on this topic was in collaboration with Vicki Wysocki of Ohio State University in which we showed that the PP b2+ ion from PPG has an oxazolone structure (see Figure 3). This is in stark contrast to the previous study in which the PP b2+ ion from PPP has a diketopiperazine structure. This study shows that one must consider not only the residues that end up in the b-ion fragment, but other nearby residues as well. In a recently submitted paper, we showed that peptides AOAA and AAOA gave b<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> and b<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ions that have a novel lactam structure (see Figure 2), which is the first such experimental evidence for this novel structure. Similarly, in collaboration with Professor Paul Wenthold at Purdue University we demonstrated a lactone structure for the ammonia loss product of sulfonated phenylalanine (see Figure 3), a novel product for deprotonated amino acids.</p> <p>In addition to our peptide fragment work, we demonstrated that the arginine analog canavanine forms zwitterionic structures when complexed with Cs<sup>+</sup>, a mixture of zwitterionic and canonical structures with K<sup>+</sup> and canonical structures with Na<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, and H<sup>+ </sup>(Figures 4 and 5). These results contrast those for arginine, which forms zwitterions with Na<sup>+</sup> &ndash; Cs<sup>+</sup>. The differences could be rationalized by slight changes in molecular structure, which highlights the importance of learning as much possible about the types of structures biomolecules can adopt and the energetics required to adopt them.</p> <p>Finally, we published a collaborative paper with Professor Alex Kandel of the University of Notre Dame on the structures of small organic cluster. We found that isatin can form especially strong pentamer structures, both in the mass spectrometer when deposited on surfaces (See Figure 6). These pentamers take advantage of C-H hydrogen bonding, which is usually only found in OH, NH and HF bonds. When either the hydrogen bonding donor or acceptor site is removed, the molecule only forms dimers.
