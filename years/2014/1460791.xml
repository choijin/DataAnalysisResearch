<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, located in Princess Anne, MD, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015- 2017. The program focuses on marine and estuarine science. Students will be offered a broad range of mentorship in various areas including, but not limited to, fish and macroinvertebrate population dynamics, marine microbiology and parasitology, molecular biology, genetics, environmental chemistry, and ecotoxicology. REU interns will also participate in field trips along the Maryland Coastal Bays and Pocomoke River. Students, particularly rising sophomores, will be recruited by various means, including use of flyers describing the program and by digital-based advertising. Students with limited opportunities for research, particularly in coastal systems, and from groups under-represented in science are particularly encouraged to apply. Selection is based on academic record, letters of recommendation, and interest in further studies in the areas of marine and environmental science. Students will receive a stipend and travel support. Housing and board will be provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. In addition to research, workshops will be conducted to train students in science communication, data analyses, scientific ethics, and various contemporary topics in marine science such as global climate change, and anthropogenic eutrophication. Interns will present their results at a symposium that will be held at the Paul S. Sarbanes Coastal Ecology Center. Interns will also prepare a short report of their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.umes.edu/reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Paulinus Chigbu at pchigbu@umes.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Maggie Sexton at masexton@umes.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) REU program was to recruit, mentor and prepare undergraduates, particularly undergraduate minorities, in laboratory and/or field research focusing on the ecology of coastal rivers, lagoons, and estuaries in Maryland.  Students had opportunities to work in various research areas including, but not limited to, the population dynamics of fish and macroinvertebrates, marine microbiology and parasitology, molecular biology and genetics, environmental chemistry, physical oceanography, and ecotoxicology.   From 2015 to 2017, a total of forty-two (42) students (plus two QEM REU INCLUDES program interns supported by NSF) selected from more than 25 institutions across the United States took part in the 10 weeks REU program.  The majority of the interns were rising sophomores or rising juniors.  They participated in hands-on research experience, professional development activities such as lectures, workshops, and seminars, and in field trips that were educationally enriching.  Interns worked on various research projects, some of which pertained to the ecology of species in coastal and estuarine waters, particularly the Maryland Coastal Bays (MCBs).  Data generated from these studies have helped to enhance our knowledge of the estuarine systems, and have formed or will form parts of manuscripts that will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.  The project has made a significant impact on the development of human resources in marine and estuarine science, particularly on those belonging to members of underrepresented groups.  Of the 44 interns who took part in the program from 2015 to 2017, 77% belonged to underrepresented minority groups, and 52% were females.  Most of the students, especially those supported with NSF REU funds, had just completed freshman or sophomore years before participating in the REU program.  By participating in the program, freshmen and sophomores have become better prepared for junior and senior level classes, for subsequent participation in REU programs targeting upper class levels, and for graduate school.  Interns' responses to survey questions indicated that they had significant gains from their participation in the research program.  The project has helped to increase ocean literacy by exposing undergraduate students to various areas of marine science.  It has also helped to strengthen their academic backgrounds through research experiences and professional development activities which have been demonstrated to help increase undergraduate student retention, academic performance, and the likelihood of success in graduate school.  Thus, the program has had positive impacts on STEM workforce development in the United States.       Last Modified: 08/10/2018       Submitted by: Paulinus Chigbu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
