<AbstractNarration>The surface condition of a road is critical for driving safety, particularly during adverse weather. Wet and icy roads occur only 3 percent of the time but account for more than 18 percent of crashes.  The project will develop a model to estimate tire-pavement friction based on the fusion of tire and vehicle sensors with advanced algorithms.   The ability to collect and evaluate such information in real time will help drivers make better driving decisions. Transportation agencies will also be able to design proactive strategies.  For example, agencies could use the friction estimates to identify and treat accident-prone "hot spots" before crashes happen, or to prioritize the most critical road segments to treat first during a winter storm. The resulting enhanced decision-making can help reduce the number of crashes and save lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will combine responses from tire and vehicle sensors to develop models to evaluate the friction levels between tires and pavement. The project has two specific goals: (1) to develop a theory to describe the tire-road contact mechanics and the resulting friction properties; and (2) to conduct experiments to validate the proposed model.  The project fills a critical gap in the development of mathematical models and algorithms for predicting tire-pavement contact and friction. The project also integrates knowledge from mechanical engineering and civil engineering to advance the techniques for evaluating tire-pavement friction. Available, real-time, vehicle-based estimates of hazardous driving conditions will help improve operations in transportation agencies and driving safety.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project produced a method to estimate the grip available to drivers under various weather conditions using intelligent tires and vehicle sensors.  The developed technology can provide continuous real-time data about roadway friction levels and pinpoint the time when roadway conditions become slippery and hazardous.  The availability of this real-time, vehicle-based estimation of hazardous slippery driving condition will improve operations in transportation agencies and the safety of the driving public.   Furthermore, tire-Road friction coefficient plays an important role in the performance of vehicle controllers, like ABS and Traction and Stability controller. Accurate estimation of the friction coefficient along with the information of tire and road condition (through intelligent tire concept) help improve the performance of vehicle controllers and decrease the number of fatal vehicular crashes.  The research team developed an instrumented vehicle, which uses intelligent tires, and advanced vehicle instrumentation and conducted experiments on the Virginia Smart Road and adjacent roads under different weather and pavement conditions.  The results of these experiments were compared with standard friction and macrotexture measurements.  The researcher team then used the results to develop algorithms to estimate the available friction, and tested and validated the approach using data obtained using a vehicle simulation model.  The results of this project will have a broad impact on tire traction and braking performance and road safety. When the technology is fully implemented, it has great potential to: (1) improve the understanding of the interaction between road friction, road surface condition, and crash risk and (2) reduce crashes and associated fatalities and injuries.  Given that 40,000 people lost their lives and 4.6 million resulted seriously injured in roadways crashes in the U.S. alone in 2016, if the technology can help reduce a small percentage of these fatalities and injuries, it would have a very significant societal impact.
