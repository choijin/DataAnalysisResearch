<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program, within the Division of Human Resource Development (HRD), was established by Congressional mandate in 1991 to significantly increase the quality and quantity of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) who successfully complete baccalaureate degrees in STEM and who continue to graduate studies in these fields. The Houston alliance is a comprehensive partnership that includes the country's largest school districts, two community college systems, one doctoral-granting Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and two Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs).   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a senior-level alliance, H-LSAMP will support new efforts in student transition, student support mechanisms for non-traditional students, the inclusion of social support mechanisms to facilitate STEM retention, and the institutionalization of high-impact practices developed during earlier LSAMP funding.  Over the five-year project, Houston LSAMP Senior Alliance will: (1) Graduate 4,000 minority students in STEM disciplines, 2) Provide all directly supported students with the opportunity to participate in research activities, 3) Have at least sixty percent of directly supported students attend professional or graduate school, 4) Retain at least eighty percent of minority STEM undergraduates, including transfer students, in STEM majors. Upon completion of the award period, the H-LSAMP project will have provided the opportunity for all supported students to meaningfully participate in research activities, including international research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation activities will have three major components. 1) Interviews of participants, staff, and faculty to identify in real time which intervention activities need adjustment, i.e., formative feedback, as well as assess both the measured and perceived impact of project-based activities; 2) Gathering, analyzing, and reporting specific measures that operationalize each project goal or objective; and 3) The use of multivariate models isolating and measuring how the specific intervention strategies and support mechanisms relate to success. Construction of these models will be guided by the literature on academic and social integration, engagement, and achievement, and will draw upon appropriate statistical techniques, e.g., factor analysis and structural equation modeling. The results of these analyses will contribute to the literature on broadening participation and achievement in STEM and serve as a guide for other universities and alliances who share these goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Houston Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation: Senior Alliance                                Project Outcomes Report - Phase IV  "The Houston LSAMP has continued to be a 'national model" in its work in developing meaningful learning communities and involving students in high impact practices such as involving undergraduate students, inluding lower division students in research."  The H-LSAMP program has produced a total of 19,022 since the base year of 1999 of 458 to UREP STEM students over the twenty-year period. (Source: https:://www.lsamp.or/exact/start_r.cfm).  Over the five year project, the Houston LSAMP Senior Alliance tasked itself with the following goals:  Graduate 4000 minority students in STEM disciplines Improve minority student social integration to better retain and transfer students. Work to improve comfort levels in STEM, provide opportunities for the social challenges of the global workforce. Provide students with improved research and educational opportunities. As a senior alliance, work toward eliminatring the two well-documented causes of attrition in STEM fields at the University level: financial need and academic support.   Upon completion of the award period, the H-LSAMP program will have provided the opportunity for all level-one students to participate in research. Further, project that around 60% will move on to professional or graduate school and that minority STEM retention will improve to 80%.  Success of these goals was accomplished through innovative recruitment, financial support, summer bridge programs, closely monitoring the academic progress of each student toward degree completion each semester, paid summer research experiences, STEM workshops, scientific conferences, and students engaged and joined professional organizations, and learning leadership skills as officers in the organizations.  All level one students completed at least (1) paid summer internship and most students completed a minimum of (2) out of the four-years as an undergraduate. This exposed the students to many different research opporutnities from the National Laboratory's (Brookhaven, ORISE, etc.), to the Department of Enery, National Science Foundation REU's at the various colleges/university campuses, and industry.  Students who completed internships which ranged from six weeks to twelve weeks in the summer months presented a poster/oral presentation at the indiviudal sites which hosted the research.  The students presented the research at National Conferences/Meetings; American Chemical Society, National Organization for the Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers, Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM, Society for Advancing Native Americans and Chicanos in Science, National Society of Black Engineers, The Fields of Dreams Conference for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences etc.)  Quoting from the External Evaluator's report, H-LSAMP, May 2019 "Strategies for Success. In past reports we have identified several strategies that the Houston Alliance has used extensively.  Each of the Alliance institutions has implemented all of these aspects into its programs: They are:  Extensive recruitment Constant mentoring, Creating a peer culture of student support aimed at academic excellence, and  Engaging the community colleges and tapping the tremendous talent of people often from poverty, who begin their college education at a community college."     The H-LSAMP Alliance met all of the goals set forth and exceeded the goal of graduating 4000 minority students in STEM.  The number of graduating UREP minority students to to date for PHASE IV of this grant is 7760 and is expected to doulbe to over 8000.
