<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $4,000 are requested to provide for partial support (travel, registration) for approximately 10 junior faculty, post-docs and students to attend the day-and-a-half TDPOLY Short Course on ?Polymer Glasses? to be held Feb. 28-March 1, 2015) under the auspices of the Division of Polymer Physics (DPOLY) of the American Physical Society (APS) in conjunction with the Society?s March 2-6, 2015 meeting in San Antonio, Texas. The purpose of the short course is to provide an advanced survey of the present state of knowledge of polymer glasses. It is designed for advanced graduate students, faculty and industrial researchers who are working in the general area of polymer physics and who have a need to deepen their understanding of glass-forming polymers and their extensive applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The glass transition is an area of intense fundamental research and remains a deep challenge to our understanding of complex materials.  Yet, it is also highly important in practical applications as it determines use temperatures of polymers and composites, long term durability, and novel nanotechnology applications.  The short course on glasses reviewed classic theories of the glass and the fundamental experimental phenomenology of the glass transition and how practical applications are affected by the glassy behavior of polymers.  In addition, descriptions of the modern glass transition theories and simulation methods were provided.  Finally, the course gave a window on open questions and unresolved problems in glassy materials. Figure 1 shows the cover page from the booklet describing presenters for the short course.  The course covered 1.5 days and included 14 lectures by 13 different lecturers.     The NSF support for the short course provided partial travel assistance to 20 graduate students of whom 10 were female and at least 2 were Hispanic.       The short course was widely attended by members of the physics community and had a record attendance of 97 "students".  These included the 20 students supported by NSF funds and they were not only "diverse" in terms of minority status but also geographically and by job status. Attendees came from industry (3), government laboratories (10) and universities (84) and represented eight countries plus the US.  84 attendees were from the US, 5 from Canada, 4 from China, 3 from Germany, 2 each from Chile, England and Spain, and one each from Brazil, Finland and Japan.       In addition, the instructors included internationally known researchers from 7 universities and 3 different national laboratory or institutions. Instructors came from the US (11), France (1) and Germany (1). In addition, three of the instructors were female. The second and third images show  the short course agenda.
