<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on several problems connected with the long-term dynamics of solutions of partial differential evolution equations. Equations of this type are central to the modeling and simulation of a wide range of phenomena, including water waves, propagation of light, behavior of plasmas, and gravitation. The investigators are senior researchers with experience in different aspects of the study of partial differential equations; their complementary expertise will be brought to bear on four main research directions in the study of solutions of dispersive and hyperbolic equations. The four aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations are all manifestations of the general goal of understanding the long time dynamics of solutions to important nonlinear dispersive and hyperbolic equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collective effort of a group of five senior researchers from four institutions with research experience in various areas of partial differential equations. The investigators have been interested in both dispersive and hyperbolic partial differential equations and will collaborate to approach the problems under study from several different directions. The project centers on four main research directions in the study of solutions of dispersive and hyperbolic equations: (1) the analysis of critical semilinear evolutions, with special emphasis on the "soliton resolution conjecture" for extended type II solutions, (2) construction of global solutions of certain quasilinear dispersive models, such as water wave models, plasma models, and crystal optics, (3) stability problems in General Relativity, motivated by the outstanding Kerr nonlinear stability conjecture, and (4) long-term dynamics of solutions corresponding to randomized data. These four aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations are all manifestations of the general goal of understanding the long time dynamics of solutions. While specific major problems are identified for the project, this is a very active field, and it is anticipated that this project will identify and study other important problems during the course of the investigation. The project will also enhance links and collaborations among researchers at leading mathematical centers in the U.S., promoting training through active research involvement of students and postdoctoral researchers. Research resulting from this project will be disseminated widely in advanced graduate courses, survey articles, and monographs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is the PI report on a project submitted in collaboration as a Focused Research Group. The general theme of the proposed project was centered on the long time dynamics of solutions to certain nonlinear wave and dispersive equations. These equations are fundamental in physics since they model phenomena that deal with nonlinear interactions of waves, from the microscopic scale to the macroscopic one.  Some notable examples are the description of the Bose Einstein Condensate, water waves and black holes.  The reason why nonlinear wave solutions are difficult to analyze is that they cannot be written explicitly, hence one has to infer implicitly, from the equation at hand and the physics laws that produced them, what their properties are.  While the study of these nonlinear interactions are by now pretty well understood at a very small time scale, analyzing what happens far away in the future is a completely different ball game. Often traditional mathematical and very sophisticated tools, such as  Fourier analysis, are not enough, and different ingredients, from different fields of mathematics need to be introduced. In recent years the PI has brought into the mix ideas from probability, which is a logical step if one wants to at least prove that certain properties of nonlinear wave solutions are true generically.  Surprisingly enough though the PI, with collaborators, had to become familiar also with ideas from analytic number theory, a very abstract branch of mathematics that one could hardly believe to be extremely relevant for the study of physical phenomena.     During the time the PI worked on this project she trained several graduate students and postdocs. She also co-organized three workshop involving both junior and senior researchers  and she co-organized a workshop for women working in the area of dispersive and wave equations. During these workshops time was also dedicated to professional development activities and to mentoring. Exit surveys were collected at the end of each workshop and they were submitted with the annual reports. These surveys clearly showed that the junior participants really appreciated the possibility of interacting with senior resaerchers as well as their peers. New collaborations started and a strong network formed. In particular the women who participated in the Women Workshop clearly indicated the desire to see   more of such meetings in the future. It is absolutely essential for this minority group to feel connected and encouraged.  It is via this kind of networking that the morale is kept up as well as the productivity.
