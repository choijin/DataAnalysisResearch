<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support for junior faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who need to redirect and rebuild a research program or need to build a research program.  It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the researcher's home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tennessee State University(TSU)'s project is multidisciplinary combining engineering and computational sciences to develop rapid storm surge simulation models.  The project's objectives are to develop and study an implicit storm surge model for rapid and accurate simulation by: (1) parallelizing the implicit storm surge model developed by the principal investigator, and (2) benchmrking the model performance and accuracy against that of explicit surge models. The expected outcomes of the project are described as (1) a new understanding of the performance and accuracy of the implicit solver in storm surge modeling and (2) a novel storm surge model capable of simulating surges rapidly and accurately.  Past hurricane data, including data from Hurricane Katrina, will be used for benchmarking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An efficient implicit storm surge model will be a valuable contribution to the coastal engineering community. This investigation is expected to transform current storm surge modeling and add valuable insight into multidisciplinary hands-on engineering education as follows: a) The study will address a long-standing engineering question - 'how feasible are the implicit solvers for storm surge modeling?' b) An implicit solution technique will establish a computational benchmark for similar problems, such as flood models. c) The research and education plans will prepare a unique workforce from underrepresented communities ready for multidisciplinary global challenges. d) The educational approach and assessment will be significant since the study is based on a genuine challenge. The approach will strongly support the curriculum overhaul effort at Tennessee State University (TSU) and is expected to serve as a model for other HBCU institutes. Through this project the potential for a storm surge research community and multidisciplinary, authentic educational ecosystem is established at TSU. This project builds the foundational knowledge for future investigations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and education plans are synergistically integrated. The project activities promote retention and engage capable underrepresented minority undergraduate students, encouraging higher level study. Summer activities are designed to attract talented high school students to engineering education. The educational objective is to prepare a new generation of well-rounded minority engineers to take on multidisciplinary global challenges. The objective is achieved by providing a learn-by-doing experience to the students within an ecosystem of multidisciplinary education to address a real global challenge - hurricane storm surges. Students will have the opportunity to enroll in a project-based computer course. The expected outcomes are a novel educational approach and a new generation of well-rounded minority engineers with the knowledge and cognitive skills to undertake multidisciplinary global challenges. The education plan will be assessed using established frameworks.</AbstractNarration>

The research goal of this Research Initiative Award project is to develop and study an implicit model for the rapid and accurate prediction of hurricane storm surges. The Computation and Modeling Engineering Laboratory (CaMEL), an implicit solver-based storm surge model developed by the Principal Investigator (PI), has been extended for use on high performance computing platforms. CaMEL uses a hybrid finite element and finite volume technique to implicitly solve the shallow water equations needed for such a prediction. An explicit solver finds solutions at a new time step based on the solution of the previous step. This algorithm is easy to implement, but numerical stability requirements heavily restrict the time step size, which may lead to a longer surge forecasting period.

This algorithm has its own challenges, but it can use larger time steps, potentially minimizing simulation time.</p> <p>Two different versions of implicit time stepping formulations are implemented in CaMEL. A Message Passing Interface-based parallel version of CaMEL is developed from the serial version previously developed. Once the parallel implementation is properly validated, CaMEL is evaluated against Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC), an established storm surge model, using a hindcast of the storm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina. Observed high water marks are used to verify that both models produce results of a comparable accuracy. The effect of the implemented time step on the stability and accuracy of the models is investigated, which indicates that CaMEL has superior stability and allows the use of about ten times larger time steps than ADCIRC.&nbsp; However, ADCIRC outperforms CaMEL in parallel scalability and execution wall clock times. Wall times of CaMEL improve significantly when the largest stable time step sizes are used, which is very encouraging. Results are already published in an open access journal.

One important finding of this study is that parametric wind models are inadequate to accurately predict hurricane wind fields and storm surges.&nbsp; An extensive literature survey is also done on the complex interactions between the air and sea during a hurricane. A critical knowledge gap in hurricane storm surge evolution has been identified and a new study is proposed in a CAREER proposal.</p> <p>This project has helped with the education and training of participating students at Tennessee State University (TSU). Seven undergraduate and five graduate students participated in this project. Among them were two women, three minority, and four veteran students.

At least one regular course will be developed from these special topic courses. The effort has helped prepare a unique workforce from underrepresented minority communities to take on multidisciplinary global challenges. Four students attended extensive boot camp training in 2015 and 2016 to acquire hands-on experience with the ADCIRC model. Three students presented their research results in different conferences. Eight students presented their research results in an annual research symposium at TSU. Four of them won awards in their respective categories. Two graduate students have finished theses.
