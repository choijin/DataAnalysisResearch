<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Will Boney is "Classification Theory of Abstract Elementary Classes." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Illinois, Chicago, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. John Baldwin.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: Boney proposed to continue inverstigations into nonelementary classification theory, especially tame Abstract Elementary Classes.  This area has seen a huge amount of activity during the course of the grant, with many contribution supported by the grant.  Boney cowrote a survey article with Sebastien Vasey that summarized the state of knowledge on tame Abstract Elementary Classes in mid-2016.  The general goal of nonelementary classification theory is to extend the classification results of first-order model theory to nonelementary classes.  The most notable difficulty in this endeavor is the loss of the compactness theorem.  Tameness has emerged as a property that satisfies two key requirements: it is strong enough to replace compactness in many arguments, and is also natural enough to appear in many classes (classically valued fields, locally finite groups, etc.).  During the grant, Boney (along with various collaborators) generalized many first-order results to tame Abstract Elementary Classes, especially the canonicity of stable nonforking relations and the relationship between the unions of saturated models being saturated and stability.  Boney also extended results on Shelah's Categoricity Conjecture by helping show that it held in multiuniversal classes.  Boney also worked outside the assumption of tameness to help develop notions of stability and superstability for general Abstract Elementary Classes.  Boney's work also helped strengthen the relationship between model theory, set theory, and category theory.  Boney's work on this grant established an equivalence between a large cardinal principle from set theory, global tameness statements for nonelementary classes first studied in his thesis, and accessibility results from category theory.  He also provided a class of new characterizations of large cardinals by logical compactness, including surpassing the previous upper bound of Vopenka's Principle.  Broader Impacts: During the grant, Boney gave several talks aimed to make nonelementary classification theory and Abstract Elementary Classes more accessible to various groups of reasearchers including graduate students. Boney's survey article with Vasey on tame Abstract Elementary Classes furhered this goal.  Boney's work forged new connections between model theory and other areas of mathematics, especially set theory and category theory.  Boney restrarted a dormant weekly logic seminar at Harvard with a focus on giving graduate students and other early researchers a place to practice presenting their results.
