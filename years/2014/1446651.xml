<AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies is comprised of prominent scientists and engineers who provide studies and advice to the Academy on issues involving scientific uses of the radio spectrum. Such uses often involve techniques and applications that are outside the realm of traditional radio spectrum applications. The Committee provides advice and guidance to the FCC (through filings in appropriate FCC proceedings) and other regulatory bodies toward the adoption of spectrum rules and policies needed to protect sensitive science applications that make use of the radio spectrum, particularly in the fields of radio astronomy, meteorology, remote sensing, oceanography, and some other sciences. Because of the multi-disciplinary aspect of the Committee's goals, it is supported by both the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The full Committee, comprised of 15 members, meets regularly, twice a year, and between meetings it works on crafting comments and other written documents in response to various regulatory proceedings. Some recent publications are: Handbook of Frequency Allocations and Spectrum Protection for Scientific Uses (National Academies Press, 2007) and Spectrum Management for Science in the 21st Century (National Academies Press, 2009). The Committee also sends representatives to appropriate meetings of scientific (e.g., the International Union of Radio Scientists) and policy-setting bodies (e.g., the International Telecommunication Union) to help publicize their positions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This proposal is not for scientific research, but it constitutes fundamental support for protecting the infrastructure that allows carrying out such research. There is a need to protect the scientific uses of the spectrum, particularly in view of the ever increasing number of commercial uses, particularly wireless applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: 1) Without CORF as a watchdog, much of radio astronomy and remote sensing might become impossible within just a few years, as the radio spectrm becomes more and more crowded. 2) CORF's outreach activities to specialized audiences, such as the FCC and to the general public, about the need of scientists to have access to portions of the radio spectrum and 3) CORF's attempt to involve younger scientists in engineering and spectrum management issues are also deemed to contribute to the broader impact of the committee. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Committee maintains a website, where CORF filings are available, along with presentations at the meetings and other useful information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A major CORF activity is participation in public proceedings before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding allocation and assignment of radio frequencies and other regulatory matters. CORF filings provide information on radio science frequency matters to commercial radio interests, who often become aware of the needs of the scientific community through them.  CORF has filed 12 filings with the FCC on various matters that have potential impact on radio astronomy and/or Earth remote sensing.  Another major CORF activity was the execution and completion of the "Handbook of Frequency Allocations and Spectrum Protections for Scientific Uses: Second Edition." The CORF Handbook was released in November 2015 and debuted at the 2015 World Radiocommunication Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, at which over 200 copies of the report were distributed either in-person or by mail after the conference.  The Handbook has been downloaded nearly 3500 times.  Another major CORF activity was the execution and completion of its report, "Views of the U.S. NAS and NAE on Agenda Items at the World Radiocommunication Conference 2019."  The document was released in 2017 and has been downloaded about 600 times.  Yet another major CORF activity was the completion of the independent study committee which surveyed the active scientific use of the radio spectrum and issued its report, "A Strategy for Active Remote Sensing Amid Increased Demand for Radio Spectrum."  This report has been downloaded over 2,700 times.  CORF met 6 times in-person. CORF members, agency representatives, and others have mentioned that the CORF meetings provide a unique opportunity for frequency managers from various agencies (globally) to meet with each other and with members of the radio science community. Such an opportunity is important to disseminate and exchange information.  All in-person CORF meetings feature open sessions during which members of the public can and do attend.  CORF holds teleconferences on a monthly basis, usually monthly, in order to work on filings and to more readily deal with issues as they arise, as well as to brainstorm new outreach ideas and other activities.  CORF also gave a number of talks at society meetings, attended national and international spectrum policymaking meetings and conducted related outreach activities.  The direct URL for the CORF website is now http://sites.nationalacademies.org/BPA/BPA_048819.  CORF members acquire significant experience on radio issues in other fields and on regulatory matters through participating in CORF meetings and activities and carry that experience back to their institutions and community. An xample of CORF?s role in training the community is that former CORF members Tom Wilson and Sandra Cruz-Pol joined NSF ESM.     CORF Filing Impacts  A summary our assessment of CORF?s impact in the FCC process over the reporting period is given below.  It is important to note that FCC actions on proceedings can take several years (or longer), if any action is ever taken. Because of length limitations in this form we have not listed matters with no FCC actions.     November 16, 2016  September 29, 2016  January 21, 2016  January 15, 2015   RESULT: The FCC acknowledged CORF concerns, noting that ongoing international studies include analyses to determine IMT-2020 out-of-band (OOB) emission limits necessary to protect passive sensors onboard weather satellites in the 23.6-24.0 GHz band. The FCC recognized the need to protect these passive satellite operations that provide important data necessary for weather predictions and warnings. Once the international studies have been completed, the Commission stated that interested parties may propose revisions to the Commission?s rules as necessary for protection of weather satellites operating in the 23.6-24.0 GHz band.  However, the FCC adopted rules allowing unlicensed operation on-board most aircraft in the 57-71 GHz band under Part 15 of the rules. The decision opens this band for unlicensed use on-board aircraft and would allow up to six non-overlapping WiGig channels of 2160 megahertz each. It decided that allowing 60 GHz unlicensed transmitters to operate in all flight phases of aircraft operation in the 57-71 GHz spectrum, with the limitations described herein, will not cause harmful interference to other authorized radio services, including EESS and the radio astronomy service (RAS). This was contrary to CORF recommendations.     March 14, 2016  RESULT: Major victory for CORF.  At least for now, the FCC has prohibited unlicensed operations at 60 GHz on aircraft, due to the potential for interference to EESS observations at 57-59.3 GHz.   This is a tremendous accomplishment for CORF and the passive community, and especially in light of opposing commercial parties on the other side arguing strongly for their position.     February 2, 2015   RESULT: In an August 2015 Order, The FCC enacted some version of each of CORF?s proposals.  Concerns may remain, however, regarding the shape and size of VLBA separation area, and the relative strength (or weakness) of out-of-band emission limits.   In addition, the FCC authorized operation of WSDs on channels 36 and 38, where available.       Last Modified: 03/13/2018       Submitted by: James C Lancaster]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
