<AbstractNarration>Computation in all its definitions (Computer Science, Computing, Computational Thinking, etc.) is becoming increasingly significant in STEM and non-STEM disciplines.  Historically, Mathematics has been the discipline seen as required by all other disciplines.  Computer Science faculty are wrestling with determining whether there is a single approach to infusing computation in other disciplines or whether there are many approaches. Coupled with the increased computational ability of students in other disciplines, it is known that interdisciplinary courses are more appealing to underrepresented groups.  Ideally, the Computer Science community would be provided with a set of validated approaches to interdisciplinary education. In order to reach this goal, the community must investigate the educational value of various approaches.  This workshop seeks to begin cataloging experiences to attain that goal.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative proposal a number of PIs from different college level institutions (research university, technology focused university, four-year engineering college, and four-year liberal arts college) will cooperate on holding a workshop where a number of different approaches to cross-disciplinary education will be investigated.  This workshop will gather a number of faculty who have attempted such courses. The outcome will be a report that outlines approaches to computational interdisciplinary courses.  This report will be made widely available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this project was to conduct knowledge-seeking activities towards developing models for partnered teaching of interdisciplinary computer science + discipline X courses at the undergraduate level where X includes a broad set of disciplines, including and, beyond the sciences.  We sought to gather and synthesize knowledge, experiences, and unanswered questions and challenges about preparing and implementing a truly interdisciplinary CS+X course through partnered teaching.  The major outcomes of this project were: (1) identification of faculty who have designed some flavor of CS+X courses, (2) development and implementation of a workshop program to bring together these experienced faculty with a set of faculty partners (CS and X) committed to create prototypes to gather knowledge on faculty preparation and resource needs and various models for partnered teaching of CS+X courses, and a report published and presented at the Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges &mdash; Northeastern Region (CCSCNE 2017) describing the findings from the collective experience.  Specifically, the first outcome of this project was a workshop held at Olin College of Engineering in October 2015, which brought together 24 faculty within and outside Computer Science to facilitated activities focused on aspects of teaching interdisciplinary courses.

The CCSCNE 2017 paper describes the major findings, summarized here. Three broad categories of courses were identified from the data. Undergraduate level CS courses taught with another STEM discipline (CS + STEM) were the most common, and usually involved the application of basic computer science concepts and simple programming to analyze and synthesize lab data pertaining to X. Undergraduate CS courses taught alongside a discipline in the arts (CS + Arts) were focused on the applications of computing in creating art pieces, learning to work and manage time as part of a team, and presentation and peer review skills.

When designing class activities, a number of challenges arose that would be atypical in a traditional, disciplinary course.

A commonly expressed hallmark of successful assignments in CS+X courses was allowing for every student to do work in both CS and X.   This goal is made more difficult for team-based assignments where students may gravitate towards doing work on the part of the assignment that they already know how to do well.  Another challenge in designing classroom experiences was integrating activities that are alien to one discipline but essential to the other.  A final challenge was the difficulty of framing a class in such a way that it was compelling to multiple student audiences.   The faculty commonly encountered administrative challenges in developing, delivering, and sustaining their CS+X course.  The first challenge was related to the fact that the courses were co-taught.  A second class of problems arose at the departmental level -- the issue of which requirements the course would fulfill was contentious for a number of the courses in our sample.    This project?s findings help to guide universities in how to direct their efforts in developing interdisciplinary CS+X courses, with the ultimate goal of preparing students to work in interdisciplinary areas and teams.
