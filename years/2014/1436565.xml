<AbstractNarration>As inspired by the Japanese art of paper folding, programmed origami is emerging as a new avenue towards manufacturing three-dimensional objects via autonomous folding of two-dimensional sheets of materials. To realize the programmed origami, a programmable folding mechanism at the small length scales is the key and thus in high demand. Liquid crystal polymers are weakly cross-linked polymers incorporated with rod or disk-like molecular units. When these molecular units are aligned in non-uniform directional patterns, the liquid crystal polymers can be triggered to self-deform by external stimuli such as temperature and light. This award supports fundamental research to develop the needed technology for aligning the molecular orientations in complex patterns in small length scales and to gain basic understanding on how to design molecular orientation patterns to achieve desired three-dimensional microstructures. Three-dimensional microstructures are highly desired in a variety of industrial applications such as sensors, actuators, drug delivery and photonic devices. The outcome from this research should contribute to the U.S. economy and benefit society. This multidisciplinary research provides a great opportunity to educate graduate and undergraduate students with knowledge and skills in photonics, liquid crystal science and technology, nanomanufacturing and numerical modeling, and to enhance diversity by involving minority and high-school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmed origami promises manufacturing of exotic three-dimensional micro and nanostructures by self-folding of two-dimensional materials or structures. This project aims to develop capabilities to imprint folding trajectories of liquid crystal polymer films in their molecular orientation fields. It will study a novel photo-patterning technique for defining complex molecular orientation order. It will develop a basic understanding of the relationship between molecular orientation and self-folding processes. The research team will (1) design, simulate, fabricate and characterize plasmonic photomasks for desired molecular orientation patterns; (2) develop an optical exposure system for exposing photoalignment materials; and (3) design, model and fabricate liquid crystal polymer films or microstructures with embedded molecular orientational orders and characterize their shape evolution under external stimuli. The proposed photopatterning technique is advantageous in several aspects: capability of large scale patterning, single exposure and scaling-up feasibility. This research will yield both fundamental understanding and new technologies to produce self-folding and twisting microstructures and programmable three-dimensional micro/nanomanufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
