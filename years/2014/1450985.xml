<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. This exploratory project will research how teachers learn to adapt open-ended, self-directed, and fabrication-rich maker space pedagogy and technology to school settings in ways that are responsive to the needs and interests of the students, their families, and the surrounding community.  Maker culture is a do-it-yourself movement supported by technology, such as electronics, robotics and 3-D printing, available in maker spaces in many communities. The project will look at whether the maker culture can help reshape how we connect high school vocational education, academic coursework, informal learning, and community based learning.  The project will bring teachers, university-based researchers, and leaders of non-school maker spaces to rethink how academic and vocational topics relate to one another. By doing so, the project is moving towards a new technical environment in which different groups of people can work on personally relevant technical problems (like fixing your own car) and simultaneously learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use design-based research and a partnership between the Malden Schools, Tufts University, and Artisan's Asylum to design and implement a community-school partnership maker space. This space will host activities involving formal vocational education, formal academic courses, informal education, and community participation. An iterative curriculum design and development process will create a number of learning units that take advantage of the space and of the skills of vocationally tracked students, some of whom will be paid to tutor peers and adults in the technologies available. Research will examine the degree to which the social status of vocational subjects and students in vocational tracks can be raised, and whether it can be used to increase academic achievement in core academic subjects. Additionally, research will examine the impact of bringing together adult makers with teachers to design these units, including especially whether this co-design process helps infuse inquiry driven teaching and learning across subjects.</AbstractNarration>

In a school-wide survey, we learned that girls and low-tracked students were significantly underrepresented in technology, engineering, and computer science offerings.

Specifically, we focused on problems in students&rsquo; lives, we offered supports for scoping those problems, and we scaffolded their ways of designing and making solutions. This &nbsp;impacted who could participant and who was successful; over 50% of the students participating in Nedlam&rsquo;s Workshop were girls, and a similarly large percentage were low-tracked students.

The expectations for what one is supposed to do in a makerspace are less clear for teachers than the expectations, and obligations, they feel in their own academic classroom environments. For example,Biology teachers admitted that they had slowly drifted away from teaching using inquiry, but that their professional development workshops in Nedlam&rsquo;s Workshop opened up their thinking about to the possibilities and excitement around inquiry through making.

In sum, we argue that Nedlam&rsquo;s Workshop encouraged teachers, students, and the community to become re-enchanted with the power of learning through making, and the importance of inquiry in teaching STEM.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Brian&nbsp;Gravel</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1450985/1450985_10329621_1512009576840_IMG_0531--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1450985/1450985_10329621_1512009576840_IMG_0531--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nedlam's Workshop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1450985/1450985_10329621_1512009576840_IMG_0531--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nedlam's Workshop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The 3,500 square foot makerspace at Malden High School, Nedlam's Workshop, built to encourage engineering inquiry through making.
