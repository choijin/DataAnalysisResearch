<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is development of a microbial technology for the conversion of low-value sugars into high-value chemicals. Most industrial chemicals produced today are derived from petroleum and other nonrenewable raw materials. The long-term growth and sustainability of the chemical industry benefits from development of new routes to existing chemicals using renewable raw materials. Furthermore, due to higher infrastructure costs and stricter environmental requirements, many chemicals that were once produced in the United States are now produced abroad. This contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. This Phase II proposal aims to develop a fermentation technology where domestically grown agricultural materials (for example, corn and waste agricultural residues) are converted into high-value chemicals. The optimized fermentation process is estimated to be cost-competitive with the incumbent petrochemical route when scaled. If successful, this proposal will facilitate growth of a domestic bio-chemical manufacturing industry, targeting the $30 billion organic acids market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop large-scale, high-throughput techniques to optimize gene expression in industrial yeast. A significant problem within the field of industrial biotechnology is the ability to engineer and optimize the fermentation performance of non-academic or model microbes. Most molecular metabolic engineering tools are developed for use in two model prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and are not suitable for use with industrially relevant microbes. Without these tools it is costly and slow to commercialize new fermentation technologies. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop and implement a set of molecular biology tools designed for acid-tolerant yeast, and working to apply them toward improving small molecule production. Specifically, the molecular biology tools are useful for tuning (up- or down-regulation) user-defined gene transcription and translation. Engineered microbes harboring the desired genetic modification(s) are assayed for improved small molecule production from sugar in small scale fermentations. Successful genetic modifications are those that result in more efficient small molecule product formation from sugar, and ideally decreased biomass formation from sugar, providing a lower production cost in a scaled, commercial process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Lygos has developed an engineered yeast that converts glucose to malonic acid, a high-value chemical with diverse applications as an intermediate chemical across several industries today, including flavors and fragrances, pharmaceuticals, semiconductor manufacturing and bio-polymers. Lygos scientists and engineers are currently working on developing a second generation (Gen2) strain and accompanying fermentation process in order to capture additional, incremental improvements in performance. This will decrease production costs to enable new application development and entry into larger-volume, lower-price point markets.   In more detail, this NSF-funded project is directed toward improving a key strain performance metric, specific productivity (Qp; the rate of product formed per amount of biocatalyst dry cell weight; g-malonic acid/g-DCW/hr), which we have determined has the most significant impact on commercial production costs. Based on our internal analysis of intermediate and byproduct accumulation in our fermentations, we concluded that acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway. Thus, the goal of this project was to identify a strain with enhanced acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity by testing various factors believed to have an impact on ACC activity. We screened combinatorial libraries of engineered strain variants using our proprietary malonic acid yeast strain. Factors evaluated included, but were not limited to testing the following: varying expression levels of the ACC, expressing heterologous ACC homologs, improving enzyme cofactor availability, mitigating negative enzyme regulatory effects, altering expression of the other malonic acid pathway enzymes, enhancing the strain's ability to export malonate and augmenting fatty acid biosynthesis. As well, CO2 supplementation studies were investigated to optimize the fermentation process.   Over 2,000 unique strains were generated during this project, leading to strains with significantly improved Qp values that surpassed all Milestone objectives for this grant, resulting in improved production strains for malonic acid.
