<AbstractNarration>Approximately 30,000 people lose their lives in traffic crashes on our nation's roadways with about 300 of these fatalities occurring in Massachusetts. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, along with assistance from the federal government, invests nearly $1 billion per year in transportation infrastructure. A portion of these funds are paid to the consultants who design and oversee the construction of the projects. A small, but still significant, portion of the design process is dedicated to assessing pre-build traffic conditions and crash data analyses. This I-Corps team will be merging two pieces of technology they have developed to create an improve platform for managing transportation data.  The proposed technology has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of such analyses and to reduce the amount of time and cost to conduct the overall design process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed two systems at the University of Massachusetts.  The first is the Regional Traveler Information Center (RTIC), an Intelligent Transportation System that collects travel times and traffic volumes in Western Massachusetts using cameras and sensors strategically placed on major arterials and highways.  The other is the UMass Safety Data Warehouse that compiles numerous data sets from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These datasets allow researchers to investigate crash causes, identify high risk demographics and locate crash hot spots.  Crash, citation, hospital, death certificate, and roadway inventory data have been linked using advanced statistical methodologies to create a single dataset that allows analysts to consider the comprehensive crash experience; including driver behavior, crash characteristics, roadway environment, and crash outcomes such as injuries and costs. The new platform will provide real time traffic collection and crash data analyses to customers through a web tool. This would be accomplished by expanding the real time traffic collection reach of RTIC, uploading data from RTIC and the UMass Safety Data Warehouse onto a web tool, and building algorithms to automate crash data analyses.</AbstractNarration>

This would be accomplished by: i) expanding the real time traffic collection reach of RTIC, ii) uploading data from RTIC and the UMass Safety Data Warehouse onto a webtool, and iii) building algorithms to automate crash data analyses.   Project Outcomes Report  The UMass Safety Data Warehouse is a collection of 14 datasets from ten different data suppliers. The diverse data sets allow researchers and practitioners to investigate traffic safety questions that are otherwise unanswerable. Researchers in the UMassSafe research group have successfully used the Data Warehouse for many years on projects for the Massachusetts State Police, Office of Public Safety and the Massachusetts DOT, among others.  During the project, our team interviewed 100 stakeholders and potential customers to explore the demand for our product outside of these large public agencies. Among these customers were transportation engineers, police departments, insurance customers and personal injury attorneys. Through our initial conversations with transportation engineers we found that there was limited demand for our additional datasets as engineers only needed one of them for their projects and they were able to obtain it, upon request, from the state DOT.  We shifted the conversation to insurance companies to investigate how they use crash data and whether our product would be of interest to them. We discovered that insurance companies routinely request the police reports from the jurisdiction that responded to the crash. While this data exists within the UMass Safety Data Warehouse, the individual reports are anonymized and would thus be of no use to insurance companies. Identifying the potential opportunity that lied with insurance companies and the frequent need for crash reports, we spoke with police officers and police chiefs specifically to gauge their interest in a partnership where our company would provide the service of responding to these requests for reports in exchange for a portion of the fee charged. Most police chiefs were very receptive to the idea as their records clerks are frequently overburdened by requests for crash reports. However, we also discovered that a company, Appriss, provides this very service in the Northeast US through getcrashreports.com.  Upon learning of ApprissÆ current market penetration and the fact that our idea to partner with police was not novel, we shifted back to transportation engineers with the thought that we could provide a service using our Safety Data Warehouse. Similar to how transportation consulting firms subcontract traffic data collection, we asked consultants if they would consider subcontracting safety analyses. Results were mixed as some engineers felt that conducting these analyses in-house led to a more complete understanding of the problem they were trying to fix. Others felt that subcontracting the often tedious task of safety analysis could save them money and free up time to focus on other aspects of the project....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
