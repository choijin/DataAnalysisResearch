<AbstractNarration>1435131 / 1435233&lt;br/&gt;Bergman / Faghri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have scientific, technological, educational, and societal impacts relevant to power plant cooling. Currently power plant cooling represents the second largest source of water withdrawl in the United States. The research forms the basis upon which current dry cooling tower technologies could be potentially transformed, leading to reduced water consumption for power plant cooling. In addition to supporting graduate students, research experiences will be provided for undergraduates. The proposed concept will also have a broad-based, beneficial impact on applications ranging from high power electronic cooling to large scale data center and server thermal management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative exploratory effort, involving investigators at The University of Kansas and The University of Connecticut, involves the innovative integration of two-phase, closed thermosyphons or heat pipes with heat transfer augmentation techniques to develop a new heat exchanger concept with expected very low air-side thermal resistance. The heat transfer augmentation techniques include, specifically, judicious use of porous metal foams or fins on the air side of the thermosyphons. A new physics-based continuum physical model will be developed that will describe the pertinent multi-phase, multi-domain, three-dimensional transient heat transfer occurring within an integrated two-phase, closed thermosyphon heat exchanger. The heat and mass transfer effects within the two-phase, closed thermosyphon are coupled to heat transfer phenomena external to the thermosyphon-heat pipe, specifically on the air- and cooling water sides of the thermosyphon. This physics-based model will provide the necessary insight to understand the pertinent heat transfer phenomena and how they interact to reduce the overall thermal resistance of the device. The physical model will be validated by conducting a set of carefully-designed experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Areas of minimal freshwater often struggle to provide the large amounts of water required for industrial processes, such as for the cooling of thermoelectric power plants. A complete thermal network analysis for conventional heat pipes is presented and the dominant thermal resistances are identified in reference to integration of thermosyphon/heat pipe in dry cooling systems for thermoelectric power generation. The proposed numerical model has been verified for both low and high temperature applications including multiple heat sources and sinks as a single-domain conjugate problem  Two concepts were investigated by the integration of thermosyphon/heat pipe in dry cooling systems for thermoelectric power generation: (i) replacing the existing steam condenser with a direct-dry condenser, to provide the phase change and heat rejection of previous once-through and re-circulation cooling systems, and (ii) replacing the conventional wet cooling towers with completely dry indirect cooling of the recirculation water stream. For each concept, innovative hybridization of existing systems with closed two-phase thermosyphons allows for the necessary heat transfer of the power cycle.   A parametric study is also performed for the addition of Al2O3, CuO and TiO2 nanoparticles, and provides guidance towards better understanding of nanofluids and their effect on the thermal performance of heat pipes. The optimal nanoparticle concentration of Al2O3, TiO2 and CuO corresponding to the capillary limit for a conventional nanofluid-filled heat pipe was determined to be 25% by vol. for both Al2O3 and TiO2, and 35% for CuO. Overall, a maximum decrease in total thermal resistance was observed to be 83%, 79% and 76% for Al2O3, CuO and TiO2, respectively.
