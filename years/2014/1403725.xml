<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description:&lt;br/&gt;The Florida State University cryogenic Penning trap mass spectrometer is currently the world's most precise apparatus for measuring atomic masses (more colloquially, for "weighing atoms"). The mass of an atom is a basic property and so atomic masses have many important applications in chemistry and physics. In particular, because of the equivalence of energy and mass (through "E = mc2"), atomic mass differences determine the energy released in nuclear reactions. Although many atomic masses have already been precisely measured, there are several scientifically important applications where measurements at still higher precision are required. These applications include determining the mass of the neutrino, an extremely light and weakly interacting fundamental particle that pervades the universe. For years it was believed that the neutrino had no mass.   We now know this not to be the case, and this new knowledge raises fundamental questions concerning the origin and structure of the universe.  The project also provides training for student and post-doctoral researchers who are likely to make careers in academe, industry or national laboratories, hence contributing to the scientifically trained workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;Three of the measurements we propose will provide atomic mass differences, or nuclear Q-values, that will be used to test systematics in other projects that seek to set upper limits on the mass of the electron anti-neutrino from low energy beta-decays. These are measurements of the 3T-3He mass difference for the ongoing, very-large-scale tritium beta-decay spectrometer KATRIN; and the mass differences 187Re-187Os and 163Ho-163Dy, for projects that will use micro-calorimeter beta-decay spectrometers. Other measurements on light ions will reduce the uncertainty of the atomic mass of the proton. Another mass difference, 35Cl-36Cl, will enable a check of precision gamma-ray metrology. Measurements of the atomic masses of 40,48Ca are also planned, to enable ongoing precision g-factor measurements of 40,48Ca19+ to test relativistic atomic theory for the g-factor of hydrogen-like ions and to probe the dependence on nuclear structure.  The measurements will consist of ratios of cyclotron frequencies of pairs of ions in the 8.5 tesla magnetic field of the FSU Penning trap mass spectrometer. Unique features of this spectrometer include the ability to make and isolate, in the Penning trap, a single ion of nearly any element; phase-coherent detection of the axial motion of an ion, via image currents, using a high-Q super-conducting tuned-circuit coupled to a dc-SQUID;  and measurement of the ion's cyclotron frequency by mapping evolved cyclotron phase onto axial motion using an rf pi-pulse at the cyclotron-to-axial coupling frequency. Cyclotron frequency noise due to variation in the magnetic field is reduced by trapping both ions in the pair simultaneously.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The atomic masses of hydrogen (H), deuterium (D), tritium (T), and helium-3 (3He), are regarded as Fundamental Constants, quantities used in diverse fields of physics and chemistry.  In particular, various highly developed theoretical calculations require these quantities as input in order to make predictions that can be compared with other experimental measurements. For instance, calculations of the energy difference between the quantized vibrational levels of the molecular ion HD+ require the ratio of the mass of the deuteron to the proton. A disagreement between a precise theoretical prediction that uses Fundamental Constants and a precise experimental measurement may point to a significant omission in the theory, which is how physics develops.  Another application of precise values for these atomic masses concerns the mass of neutrinos, mysterious ultra-light particles that pervade the universe.  The most direct method to determine the mass of neutrinos is from the study of beta-decay of tritium to helium-3, as is being done by a large, multinational collaboration called KATRIN. An important quantity needed to verify these neutrino mass determinations is the mass difference between tritium and helium-3.  Our project measures atomic mass ratios by trapping pairs of ions (one of each type) in an 8.5 tesla, cryogenic Penning ion trap.  In the Penning trap a specially shaped electric field and a strong magnetic field create a trap for ions:  the ions, "suspended" by the fields, oscillate about the trap center in an extreme high vacuum.  Each ion has two circular motions perpendicular to the magnetic field. One of these, the cyclotron motion, has a frequency (orbits per second) that is nearly inversely proportional to the ion's mass. By measuring the cyclotron frequencies of two ions trapped in the same magnetic field, we precisely measure the ratio of their masses.  In the period covered by this report, we modified the Penning trap and associated electronics from a configuration for measuring heavier atoms to one for measuring hydrogen and helium isotopes. We then measured the ion mass ratios T+/HD+ and 3He+/HD+. From these we obtained a value for the mass difference between tritium and helium-3 a factor of 10 more precise than all previous measurements. Our new value has been used by KATRIN to validate a reduced upper-limit on the mass of the electron antineutrino.  We also obtained, using H and D as references, more precise values for the masses of tritium and helium-3.  Our helium-3 measurement disagreed with a later value by another research group. In response, we repeated the 3He+/HD+ measurement with an upgraded detector system, a rebuilt magnet cryostat and other improvements. Our new result confirmed our first result.  We also measured 3He+/H3+ and HD+/H3+. This resulted in the discovery that the triatomic hydrogen ion H3+ was sometimes formed in our trap in a highly excited, extremely long lived (months) rotational level.  H3+ is the most abundant molecular ion in the universe and is important to astrophysics. We detected that the H3+ ions were in excited rotational levels through "E=mc2": the energy due to molecular rotation resulted in a tiny but measurable increase in mass. This was the first direct observation of the very long lifetimes of H3+ rotational levels.   We then obtained a precise value for the mass ratio of the deuteron to the proton, md/mp by measuring H2+/D+.  In the case of H2+ the vibrational energy levels are also very long lived (about a week).  Previously, the "E=mc2" mass shift due to vibration had limited the precision with which md/mp could be obtained. Because of our increased precision, we could determine when the H2+ ion was in its ground vibrational energy level, so uncertainty due to unknown vibrational energy was not a limitation. Our new value for md/mp has an uncertainty of only 20 parts-per-trillion, a factor of three more precise than previous work. Incorporated into analysis of laser spectroscopy of HD+ by another group, this resulted in a more precise value for the mass ratio of the proton to the electron.  We have also developed a special technique in which the cyclotron frequencies of two ions are measured simultaneously rather than alternately.

This method makes use of the second circular motion, the magnetron motion. Using this technique we expect to obtain md/mp with an uncertainty of only a few parts-per-trillion.  In the future, this method can be applied to compare the mass of the proton and antiproton, to test the currently predicted perfect symmetry between matter and antimatter.  This project has provided unique experience relevant to a wide range of careers in science and technology for one graduate student, one postdoctoral researcher, 5 undergraduates (of whom three are pursuing graduate research in Physics) and 6 high-school students.
