<AbstractNarration>This award supports the NSF goal to 'achieve excellence in U.S. Science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education at all levels', and will 'provide opportunities for young people that will attract them to and prepare them for careers in science, mathematics, and engineering'. Through a student essay competition, undergraduate and graduate students will be selected to attend two premier conferences in engineering and systems design.  The competition will be widely advertised through the conference websites of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and to researchers in engineering design. Posing the essay assignment as an exercise by an industry employee requires the students to consider the effect of global competitiveness on engineering design practices, particularly in light of complex systems. Conference experiences promote growth in individual students and can also serve to strengthen the overall research quality of the research at the student's home institution when this knowledge is shared among their peers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this award is to support undergraduate and graduate student attendance at the annual ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences (IDETC) and the AIAA Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MAO) Conference. A secondary objective is to encourage students to think deeply about what engineering design of complex systems will be like 20-30 years in the future. Students will communicate their thoughts on this topic in an essay which will be judged by a distinguished group of engineering design researchers and educators. Travel funds will be provided for students who are selected through the design essay competition. A poster session will be organized at the conferences to give the students an opportunity to interact with researchers and discuss their ideas on the future of engineering design of complex systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is imperative to encourage some of our best and brightest students to become part of the engineering design research community.  This grant provided funding to encourage both undergraduate and graduate students to compete in separate categories for travel awards to attend the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) premier annual design conference, the International Design Engineering Technical Conferences (IDETC).  At the conference, students present their work in the form of a poster and exchange ideas with the best minds in the field of engineering design. ASME provides poster space and certificates for the winners. All of the funding from this grant is used to support the student travel.

Therefore, with the agreement of our Program Director, we did not hold an essay contest for that conference.  Although this award covers only 3 years with a one-year no-cost extension, this competition has been in place since 1998. Our goals have been:  (1) Encourage students to continue their graduate studies  (2)  Encourage students to participate in the technical dialog about engineering design. Provide opportunities for the students to present their work and discuss it in an international forum of experts.  In addition to the feedback the reviewers provide on the essays, students present their work in the form of posters. Several of our winners have gone on to win Best Paper and other awards in various sub-conferences at the IDETC. In 2006, one of our essay award winners, Jiten Patel, also took the opportunity to participate in the student mechanisms competition where, as an undergraduate student, he took first place overall &ndash; both the undergraduate division and the graduate division.   (3)   Encourage students to become faculty members.  Over the years, several of those who have won the award have gone on to become tenure-track faculty members.
