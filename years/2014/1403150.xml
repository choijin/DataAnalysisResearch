<AbstractNarration>In the last decade, scientific exploration of Madagascar's remarkable biodiversity and its origin has shifted to characterizing the drivers of evolution within the island. This project will use two endemic lineages of the myrrh tree genus (50 spp., Commiphora, Burseraceae) as models to test hypotheses regarding the influence of geography on species diversification in the seasonally dry tropical forests of western Madagascar. These hypotheses predict that species have arisen as a consequence of isolation caused by 1) watershed expansion and contraction, 2) river barriers, and 3) historical climate change.  A subset of 959 nuclear genes will be sampled from all endemic species using a cost-effective high-throughput method that combines microfluidic amplification and massively-parallel sequencing. The resulting data will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these species and will be combined with specimen-based mapping to test the overarching biogeographical hypotheses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genomic markers developed as part of this research will also be evaluated for their transferability to other species across the angiosperm tree of life, which may expand the methodological toolkit for all plant systematists. This research will provide mentorship opportunities for two undergraduate students and will support their professional development, including presentation of their research at a national meeting. Additional outreach will be provided to involve K-12 and undergraduate students through ongoing mentorship activities.</AbstractNarration>

The activities completed as a result of this support included the development of new molecular resources to uncover evolutionary relationships in the myrrh genus (<em>Commiphora</em>, Burseraceae). A key broader impact of this work included successfully testing the applicability of these new molecular resources to other flowering plants besides <em>Commiphora</em>. These new resources will continue to help other researchers to understand how closely related species of plants are to one another and, as a result, test hypotheses regarding features of the plants or environment that may have played a role in resulting organismal evolution. For our project, these resources were used to understand the evolution of closely related plant species in one of the world&rsquo;s hottest biodiversity hotspots, Madagascar. Madagascar is home to hyper-diverse flora; the majority of flowering plant species found here is found nowhere else. For example, all of the Madagascar species in the myrrh genus are unique to this island. Causes for the evolution of such diversity are not well understood, however several recent hypotheses have suggested the environment and climate have played an important role in shaping the flora of this unique island. In order to test these hypotheses for the myrrh genus, we sequenced DNA from regions of plant&rsquo;s genome that have never been sampled before in order to compare species to one another and reconstruct their historical evolutionary relationships. We found that the new genomic resources we sequenced were very effective for this purpose. Using this &lsquo;map&rsquo; of evolutionary history of Commiphora, we traced the steps of its evolution to reconstruct when and where it colonized the unique habitats of Madagascar. Our results suggest that the evolution of these plants in Madagascar has resulted from four independent invasions from continental Africa followed by two rapid, near simultaneous radiations of species. The pattern of speciation is not consistent with any one individual biogeographic hypothesis, however. We have published four articles in peer-reviewed journals that discuss the results of work supported by this project and we anticipate at least two more to be published in the next two years.</p> <p>The research supported by this project resulted in the training and professional development for multiple students and numerous presentations to disseminate results to the botanical community.
