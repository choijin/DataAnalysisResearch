<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Paul Spiegel from Western Washington University and colleague John Gilbertson will acquire an X-ray diffractometer. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training not only at Western Washington University but also at neighboring institutions from the Seattle area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) determining the structure of circularly permuted hemoglobin constructs for the development of recombinant blood replacements; (b) studying the immune response to hemophilia treatment; (c) determining the structural biology of engineered protein complexes; (d) determining the structure of small molecule inorganic complexes for the application of carbon dioxide reduction; (e) structure determination of organic fluorophores with extended pi systems for use in solar energy conversion; (f) structural analysis of quantum dot ternary nanocrystals for the application of optical and electronic properties; (g) microscale X-ray diffraction analysis of core-shell nanocatalysts for hydrotreating applications to petroleum-based feedstocks; and (h) structural studies of the villin/gelsolin family of cytoskeleton regulators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The acquisition of a single crystal X-ray diffractometer through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research Instrumentation Program has been transformative for the Chemistry Department at Western Washington University.  This equipment is vital for looking at the structures of molecules, both big and small, at close enough detail to understand the relative positions of all the atoms in these complex molecules.  Small, metal containing complexes that possess reactivity to convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide have been studied in recent years with the hope of developing new molecular reagents for remediation and clean up of environmental pollutants that are toxic and negatively affect greenhouse gases and global climate change.  Larger, biological macromolecules have also been studies at, or near, atomic resolution.  The particular large proteins that have been studied are protein complexes involved in blood coagulation, and more specifically, hemophilia.  Using this instrumentation, new structures of these proteins have lead to a deeper understanding of how blood coagulation occurs at the molecular level, how hemophilia occurs genetically and why immune complications arise due to the best current treatments for hemophilia that are available.  Together, these protein structures will help to develop better therapeutics for the growing populations of severe hemophilia patients in the United States.  The presence of this instrumentation at Western Washington University has also provided an illustrative example of the importance of structure in chemistry research.  Here, the X-ray diffraction system is employed for teaching both biophysical and inorganic chemistry courses, and it has been used for demonstrations to the larger community, including fifth graders that visit campus once per year, AP biology students from a local area high school and students interested in careers in structural chemistry that commonly visit the department for a tour.  The impact of this instrumentation on undergraduate research students is also dramatic.  At Western Washington University, a predominantly undergraduate institution, our mission is intimitely tied to enhancing the undergraduate experience through research opportunities.  The X-ray diffractometer is employed for collecting critical diffraction data that leads to structure determination directly by undergraduates that work in research labs, which commonly results in peer-reviewed publications of these findings.  The research accomplishments by the PI and Co-PI with this instrument has resulted in successful procurement of external funds from the National Science Foundation to further their research efforts.  Lastly, students that participate in our NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, which brings community college students as well as students from underrepresented backgrounds to WWU from across the country for 10 weeks to get an authentic research experience typically use this instrument every summer.  In summary, the acquisition of an X-ray diffractometer at WWU has yielded an enriched research infrastructure that has benefited the department, the community, and undergraduates nationwide.
