<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 1440334&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Rogan, Elizabeth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this OSA BIOMED conference is to bring together people working in biomedical optics from academia and industry to disseminate recent technological developments and novel applications in the field, exchange and stimulate ideas, advance innovation in optics and optical technologies, and promote clinical translation of optical technology. BIOMED is a multidisciplinary conference&lt;br/&gt;aimed at not only biomedical optics researchers, but basic scientists and clinicians, who are actively developing biomedical optics technologies or utilizing optical technology to advance clinical medicine and basic research. In addition to this core of biomedical optical scientists, the organizers also hope to attract scientists with new or upcoming photonic technologies that may have practical application in biomedicine, including the field of nano-technology, optical&lt;br/&gt;probes and agent chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
