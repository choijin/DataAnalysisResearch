<AbstractNarration>This proposal uses an innovative approach to make hierarchical materials, the so-called metamaterials, which hold promise of possessing properties that do not exist in conventional materials, such as negative refractive-index materials. These negative-index materials are finding uses in the development of superlenses (to allow imaging below the diffraction limit), in optical nanolithography and in other fields, such as for making radar-microwave absorption (i.e., stealth) materials. They have been successful in developing novel ways to make the component pieces for metamaterials  and seek, in this proposal, to scale up the process and then determine, with the aid of computer simulations, how best to assemble the individual pieces into metamaterials.The PI has a strong record of outreach, developing instructional materials on cell mechanics and disseminating it via cable television and lecture series to local high schools, and including underrepresented groups in his research activities. He has already involved a promising African-American REU student in this work and will continue to recruit and train underrepresented students under the new project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An "inverse self-assembly" approach is proposed by the PI and Co-PI, whereby they start with a robustly assembled super-structure and then ask what structured smaller building blocks (clusters) should be used. This problem is more difficult than it appears because the packing of the clusters have been shown not to simply depend on the cluster shape, but is rather strongly influenced by the directional entropic interactions between the particles. The investigators will use their previously developed colloidal crystal-templating technique to custom make clusters of defined geometrical packing and will use simulations to aid in exploring the phase diagram and kinetics of assembling the clusters into super-structures or metamaterials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Future technology will rely on meta-materials&mdash;built not from crystals of atoms or molecules, but rather from ordered arrays of microscopic building blocks&mdash;yielding materials that have unique and otherwise impossible optical and thermal properties. While in principle the formation of opal-like structures from easily fabricated spherical particles provides a scalable route for forming meta-materials, few crystals having suitable structures had previously been demonstrated to form.  This project considers instead building blocks formed from small clusters of spheres having a regular arrangement, either alone or mixed with similarly-sized spheres, in both simulation and experiment. These clusters are coated with synthetic DNA to induce attractive interactions that drive them to spontaneously self-assemble into the desired metamaterial structures.  In simulation, we mapped out the crystals formed from mixtures of different regular clusters and spheres, developing a new simulation framework for doing so based upon geometrical constraints.  Notably, we identified a cubical crystal structure of potential interest for energy conversion applications, and a diamond-like structure of potential interest for optical applications.  In experiment, we improved our methods for making such cluster building blocks, which are themselves created using crystalline templates. This was achieved notably by reducing the cost of forming the DNA coated particles by close to two orders of magnitude, and by determining the optimal conditions under which such template crystals form.  We also expanded the library of cluster shapes that we could form, by discovering a large number of previously unknown crystal template structures.  One of these templates was a diamond-like crystal formed using two sizes of spherical building blocks, that may be of interest in its own right.
