<AbstractNarration>Rocky intertidal habitats in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) provide a model system to examine the structure and dynamics of natural communities. Throughout the Gulf of Maine, the same species are often found in these habitats but community structure, dynamics and productivity differ markedly among 3 distinct regions (southern, central and northern GoM). Past influential work, conducted primarily in the southern and central GoM, focused on the local processes driving intertidal community structure but produced very different conceptual models of how these communities are structured. This project examines whether regional differences in rocky shore community processes are driven by differences in recruitment that are shaped by regional variation in temperature and food availability and nearshore coastal oceanography. This project will improve the understanding of how large-scale environmental forces interact with local processes to control the distribution of species and the structure and dynamics of these communities. Understanding the interaction between processes operating at different scales is fundamentally important to developing more reliable models that can be used to predict community dynamics. In addition, data resulting from this project will have important implications for regional dynamics in commercially important species and for ecosystem and fisheries management within the GoM. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be supported and trained as part of this interdisciplinary project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching hypothesis of this project is that regional differences in community-level processes are driven by very different patterns of population connectivity and recruitment in a few key species and that these differences are ultimately caused by regional variation in temperature and food availability and mediated by physical larval transport processes. Hence, the project will test the following hypotheses with manipulative field experiments, field sampling, connectivity estimates, and integrative modeling: 1) Locally-dispersing species dominate dynamics in regions with a net export of planktonic larvae (Northern GoM), while species with planktonic larvae dominate the dynamics in regions with high settlement and extensive connectivity among populations (Southern GoM). 2) Settlement density of species with planktonic larvae increases from northern to southern regions in accord with regional variation in food availability. 3) Population connectivity varies greatly among regions, with regions differing in the degree to which they are self-seeded or serve as larval sources vs. sinks; self-seeding leads to relatively localized population dynamics in the middle portion of the GoM. 4) Patterns of population connectivity are driven by physical transport processes and can be represented by coupling basic larval behavior models with circulation models. At 18 different sites in the GoM across ~ 600 km, surveys will evaluate variation in recruitment, food availability and secondary productivity and experiments will assess community processes in wave-exposed and sheltered habitats. The project will use hydrographic, current profile, and larval vertical distribution surveys to collect data for coupled larval/circulation models. Population connectivity will be both modeled and empirically evaluated (for one species) using elemental fingerprinting. A spatially explicit metacommunity model will integrate across all project components and test the relative importance of regional and local processes in controlling community organization and dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding how populations are connected through dispersal is critical for ecology, evolution, conservation and management, and will play a crucial role in predicting how organisms might respond to contemporary anthropogenic stresses.  Many marine organisms disperse in the water column as small larvae.  Tracking minute pelagic larvae that drift with the ocean currents and potentially travel tens to hundreds of kilometers during several weeks of development is extremely difficult.   We used trace element fingerprints (TEF) derived from the chemical signatures found in calcified structures, such as shells, to quantify dispersal and population connectivity in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) throughout the Gulf of Maine over three years (2015-2017).  TEFs vary geographically, characterize different water masses, and can be used to identify the location where shell material was deposited.  Here we expanded the spatial scale of our previous NSF supported research to encompass most of the Gulf of Maine.  Our results indicate that 1) TEFs differ strongly among mussel populations throughout the Gulf of Maine, which has allowed us to assign settlers to natal sites. 2) Inter-annual differences in TEFs, dispersal and connectivity are apparent. 3) Our estimates of larval dispersal and population connectivity indicate that connectivity among populations is typically downstream (NE &ndash; SW) of the major coastal currents, although there is some dispersal against the mean flow of the coastal currents. While upstream dispersal may seem odd, it is consistent with what has emerged from preliminary runs of our numerical bio-physical model. 4) We implemented a Bayesian Infinite Mixture Model that takes into account the contribution from potential unsampled mussel populations, allowing us to compare estimates of population connectivity to results from a standard Discriminant Function Analysis. 6) We also developed a hierarchical approach to identify the natal sites of mussels based on TEFs that provides more accurate estimates of dispersal within the Gulf of Maine.     Broader Impacts  The empirical estimates of dispersal and population connectivity provide important insights into which populations are most important to maintain mussels in the Gulf of Maine and should aid in developing more efficient conservation and management strategies.  Four graduate students and ten undergraduate students were trained on a variety of techniques including estimating connectivity, trace elemental fingerprints, population genetics and the physical oceanography in the Gulf of Maine. They were also trained more generally on how to design experiments, test hypotheses and present their findings. Our students included those from various programs at UMB to maximize involvement of underrepresented groups (e.g. REU, Bridges to Baccalaureate Program, Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity, McNair program).  A postdoc was also trained in estimating population connectivity and he developed the software to use a Bayesian infinite mixture model for more accurately assigning mussels to natal sites based on TEFs.
