<AbstractNarration>The project "Microetching of the Human Brain" endeavors to create the most comprehensive illustration of the human brain that has ever existed.  Investigators will utilize reflective microetching, a process combining mathematics and optics to create an art piece that evolves based on the position of the viewer.  Microetching allows the depiction of very complex brain activity at incredibly fine detail.  The final piece will be a wall-sized piece of fine art experienced by a diverse population of thousands daily at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. Additionally, this project is an educational opportunity for undergraduate students through direct involvement in the creation of the piece. As this project spans many scientific and artistic disciplines, students will be given an opportunity to learn about fields apart from their own, to broaden their skill set, and to learn how to communicate scientific concepts effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration between neuroscientists, engineers, physicists, and artists to address the question of whether art can be used in the dissemination of scientific understanding to new audiences in a way that gives a visceral sense of the underlying concepts. The human brain is massively complex and challenging to portray clearly.  Conveying a sense of its complexity through art may inspire an interest in the brain's scientific content and inspire a new generation of neuroscientists. To produce a piece of fine art capable of sufficient detail to depict the brain at near full complexity, the piece will be executed by a technique called reflective microetching.  Microetching is a high-resolution lithographic process that patterns a microtopography of periodic ridges into the surface.  These ridges are engineered to reflect a point-source illumination toward a viewer when standing at a specific angle relative to the painting.  Similar to darkfield microscopy, this can yield incredibly fine detail.  Additionally, the angular dependence of the light adds an extra dimension that can be used to convey time, depth, or motion as the viewer walks past.  The piece will feature neurons, glia, vasculature, white and gray matter, and reflectively animated circuit dynamics between areas of the brain corresponding to neural processes involved in visual self-recognition.  This will infuse the piece with additional meaning, as the circuits activated within viewers' brains will be the same that are depicted in the artwork.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Much of science is taught through reductionism, the idea that everything is no greater than the sum of its parts and by understanding the individual components, you can understand the whole.  This is useful for many fields, but unfortunately, in a field such as neuroscience, you could understand a neuron very deeply without being much closer to understanding your own consciousness.  Our goal with this grant was to use art to convey the complexity that goes into human thought.  We developed an artistic technique known as microetching, which not only allows one to depict tiny detailed structures but also visualize their interaction in time.  We used this technique to depict the activity in 500 thousand neurons during the brief moment when one first sees art.  We called this piece Self Reflected because it is what is likely the most accurate and detailed depiction of what is happening inside the viewer's own head the moment that it is viewed.    With a team of undergraduate researchers, we extensively researched the details of each brain region including neuron morphology and connections.  Then we spoke with leading scientists to understand how each region interacts during this simple thought.  The individual neurons depicted in the piece are very close to scale relative to the brain itself.  Using algorithms, the individual neurons were connected such that we could mathematically calculate their interactions both in space and time.  However, the piece's primary intent is not to be an atlas.  Rather, it is to convey on an emotional level the sheer volume of activity and overwhelming intricacy that occurs within ourselves that makes us who we are.  This piece occupies a wall on permanent display at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.  It is brought to life a by an array of lights that provide an animated quality.    Additionally, six other smaller versions have been given to similar institutions around the country.  Following installation, we performed a study to understand how people interacted with the piece and what they took away from their experience.  Indeed, we found that people developed a deeper appreciation for their own brains.        Last Modified: 11/28/2018       Submitted by: Brian Edwards]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
