<AbstractNarration>Non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas are a new and fascinating type of a plasma that has tremendous potential in medicine and nanotechnology. Our understanding of the atmospheric microplasmas and the nature of the plasma interaction with biological matter is very limited. In this project, we will, in particular, advance the knowledge of atmospheric microplasmas relevant for medical applications. This research program will serve as a vehicle for undergraduate and graduate education in the field of plasma science.  The PIs will make a concerted effort to involve women and under-represented minority students in this project by working closely with the relevant student organizations at George Washington University. To recruit women, the Society of Women Engineers will be contacted and informed of the project activities. In addition, undergraduate students will be engaged in the research through the Work Study program or a Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement. The experience will impart them with the knowledge and the skills to excel in independent academic or industry careers they pursue after completing their education. The educational plan for this project also aims to generate interest in science and technology in the area of plasma science and bioengineering and to reach out to K-12 teachers, school children and their parents. In particular, we plan to interact with local schools in the Metropolitan DC area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central objective of this project is to understand the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas with a view towards biological applications. To this end we will develop and implement a wide range of new diagnostic methodologies and tools applicable for atmospheric microplasmas. The overall project will address the ionization mechanism, energy balance and conditions for streamer propagation as well as effects related to overvoltage. This project has both fundamental and technological significance. The fundamental significance of this project is in understanding the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas. To this end a wide spectrum of diagnostic instrumentation for atmospheric pressure microplasmas will be developed. Availability of this instrumentation has critical importance for the future progress of the field of atmospheric microplasmas. Enabled by these advances, the technological significance lies in exploring the wide range of applications of atmospheric microplasmas, such as plasma medicine and nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes of the collaborative project with George Washington University: Exploring Cold Atmospheric Plasma Physics  The specific outcomes are as follows:  Diagnostic technique for the absolute measurements of plasma density and electrton drift velocity in small-scale atmospheric plasma objeects using microwave scattering techniques was developed. It was shown that the temporal profile of average electron temperature can be estimated by solving the continuity equation with the electron density and electric field measured. This method is a general way to quantify the temperature and can be used for different types of plasmas, especially for low ionization degree ones.  Electrosurgical cutting is a well-known technique for creation incisions often used for the removal of benign and malignant tumors. A mathematical model of the elctrosurgical cutting was suggested, and it was shown that cutting occurs as a a result of the localized heating of the tissue by Joule heating mechanism.     Also, we have shown that the selective effect of a plasma jet on living cells in a physiological solution can be related to a change in the osmotic pressure difference across the cell membrane. These factors change the balance of forces acting on the membrane and the development of pores in it, which ultimately affects the viability of the cell.
