<AbstractNarration>This project provides funding for travel awards to graduate students in order to attend the 2014 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis for Systems and Software (ISPASS-2014). ISPASS is a premier forum for presenting, discussing, and debating advanced academic and industrial research work focused on performance analysis in the design of computer systems and software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused primarily on broader impacts through the education students will receive from attending the technical sessions of ISPASS, mentoring that they will receive through the interaction with senior researchers, and networking opportunities they will receive through numerous different conference activities.</AbstractNarration>

The conference will be held in Monterey,California. ISPASS is a premium conference in the field of ComputerSystems and Software.

Intellectual Merit: The IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis on Systems and Software provides a forum for sharing advanced academic and industrialresearch work focused on performance analysis in the design of computersystems and software. The Symposium covers a wide range of topics in thefield, including but not limited to:  Performance and power evaluation methodologies Performance and power analysis Power/Performance analysis of commercial and experimental hardware Power/Performance analysis of emerging workloads and software Application and system code tuning and optimization Confirmations or refutations of important prior results   Students will be able to attend all events associated with the conference, as well a rich set of workshops and a diverse tutorial program.   Broader Impact: Support from this grant will be distributed to students who may otherwise beunable to attend the ISPASS conference.

The table below shows the final list of award recipients, their universities, the amounts awarded and claimed, and demography information. The award selections were prioritized as follows:  Students      from universities that do not have a strong tradition in the ISPASS research      domain; US      students or universities;  Attendees      who belong to under-represented minorities (including women)   The award amounts from NSF were determined as follows (highlighted in the table below):  Two      students were awarded fully with the requested amount, i.e., Nazor;      Rangel. Three      students were awarded $750 each, i.e., Agarwal, Guitierrez;      Tithi. The      remaining fund from the NSF student travel grant ($660) was award to Li.   No students from institutes outside the US were funded.  A diverse set of students were supported by the ISPASS Student Travel Grant &ndash; 6 of the 13 students awarded are under-represented minorities and 5 of the 13 students are currently pursuing undergraduate degrees. Among the students supported by the NSF Student Travel Award, 6 of the 7 students supported belonged to the group of under-represented minorities and 2 of the 7 students are currently pursuing undergraduate degrees.  As shown in the table, $2500 of the funds came from IEEE TCuArch funds, $5000 of the funds from NSF, and the remaining $350 came from l...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
