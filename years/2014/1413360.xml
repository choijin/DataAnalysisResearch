<AbstractNarration>Many living organisms sense and respond to light, primarily through a large family of proteins known as photoreceptors. This Research in Undergraduate Institutions proposal will provide insights into fundamental, light-induced mechanisms in biological systems by addressing the role of photoreceptors in unique microorganisms, the myxobacteria, which are distinguished by unusual light-controlled morphogenesis of fruiting bodies.  This project will advance the understanding of microbial light perception and the evolution of photoreceptors, engaging undergraduate and Master's level students (including members of groups under-represented in science) in interdisciplinary research in microbial genetics, spectroscopy and structural biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the physiological role of red-light photoreceptors known as bacteriophytochromes in the non-photosynthetic myxobacteria Stigmatella aurantiaca and Cystobacter fuscus which form fruiting bodies under starvation conditions. Fruiting bodies are markedly stimulated by red and blue light but the exact role of the bacteriophytochromes that are encoded in the genomes of these species in controlling morphogenesis is unknown. This project will investigate the role of bacteriophytochromes through integrated studies of myxobacterial genetics, high-throughput RNA sequence analysis, time-resolved spectroscopy, and elucidation of bacteriophytochrome structures by X-ray crystallography.</AbstractNarration>

This proposal addresses the physiological role of red-light photoreceptors known as bacteriophytochromes (BphPs) in non-photosynthetic myxobacteria. Among prokaryotes, myxobacteria are distinguished by a unique multicellular stage in their life cycle in which fruiting bodies are formed. Starvation-induced fruiting bodies house desiccation-resistant spores that can germinate into a vegetative cell upon nutrient availability. Interestingly, fruiting bodies of <em>Stigmatella aurantiaca</em>, a well-characterized myxobacterium, are markedly stimulated by red and/or blue light. The <em>S. aurantiaca</em> genome annotation indicates the presence of two BphPs while the genome of closely related and less understood <em>Cystobacter fuscus</em> contains three BphPs. We successfully determined the crystal structures of two BphPs from <em>S. aurantiaca</em> and revealed unique photocycle features for each. In collaboration with Dr. Westenhoff at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, we also examined structural changes of these BphPs in solution, by conducing Small Angle X-ray Scattering Experiments (SAXS). We investigated the mechanism of fruiting body formation in myxobacteria with respect to light and published <em>S. aurantiaca</em> fruiting body formation under blue, red and far-red light. Interestingly, we were able to demonstrate that <em>S. aurantiaca</em> fruiting bodies do not form under red but readily appear under far-red light (specific wavelengths of light that BphPs respond to). We are currently developing genetic tools to knock out BphP genes in related <em>M. fulvus</em> that has only one BphP gene and is the closest relative to <em>M. xanthus</em> for which abundance of genetic tools are available.</p> <p>In the meantime, we determined the room-temperature structure of <em>S. aurantiaca</em> BphP while conducting experiments at the brightest X-ray sources mankind has ever seen, the free electron lasers (XFELs). Now, microscopically small crystals are sprayed into the ultrashort XFEL pulses. This method has been named serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). The intense X-ray beam destroys the crystals, yet a diffraction pattern is recorded before the crystals disintegrate. This is called the 'diffraction-before-destruction' principle. We joined a large team of scientists to work on time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at Stanford University, Menlo Park, CA and Spring8-Compact Free Electron Laser (SACLA) in Japan. Preliminary results from these time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallographic experiments were already published in Science Reports and are being currently drafted for another publication. More experiments are underway to push time-resolution to femtoseconds in order to capture the unique intermediates of BphP photocycle.</p> <p><em><strong>Broader Impact.</strong></em> We authored and co-authored a number of publications in highest impact journals. Among them were a publication in Science Reports and the International Union of Crystallography Journal. The PI?s tenure home, Northeastern Illinois University, became a notable center for biophysical research as more than ten of our graduate and undergraduate students were co-authors on these manuscripts. Most importantly, we were able to successfully apply for funding through an NSF EAGER award that enables us in part to continue this exciting research.
