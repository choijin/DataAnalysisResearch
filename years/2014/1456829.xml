<AbstractNarration>Heat tolerance of Salmonella enterica, a pathogen important to food safety, is dramatically enhanced by mutations that result in high-level synthesis of two proteins that transport magnesium ions across bacterial cell membranes. By determining which cellular components are protected at high temperature as a consequence of these single DNA nucleotide mutations, this project will provide a unique opportunity to identify the heat sensitive target(s) that are responsible for loss of viability at high temperature. Results obtained in this study will provide insights into the causes of thermosensitivity not only in Salmonella but also in other bacteria. Success in the construction of thermotolerant varieties of bacteria would provide a simple approach to the engineering of improved strains that can be used for the synthesis of biofuels and other chemicals whose production or isolation would be enhanced at higher temperatures. Also, because high-temperature treatment is the most widely used and cost-effective means for inactivating food pathogens, analysis of the regulation of thermotolerance could provide insights into the development of more efficient ways to ensure microbiological food safety. Funding by the NSF will also enable the PI to continue the training of scientists at all levels from high school through postdoctoral in the integration of genetics, molecular biology, and genomics to address important problems in bacterial physiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposed research are to test whether the overproduction of two Mg2+ transporters (MgtA and MgtB) will confer increased thermotolerance on other bacteria besides Salmonella and to elucidate the mechanism by which increased synthesis of MgtA and MgtB confers enhanced thermotolerance. The project has the following Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that overproduction of Mg2+ transporters provides a general method for the engineering of thermotolerant derivatives of bacteria by carrying out such constructions in 3 Gram negative species, a halophile, and in a Gram positive bacterium. 2) Test the hypothesis that the chr (constitutively heat resistant) mutations impart increased thermotolerance by protecting the stability of cellular proteins at high temperature. These experiments will also probe whether denaturation of proteins could be an important cause of cell death at high temperature. 3) Test the hypothesis that the chr mutations result in enhanced heat resistance by protecting membranes at high temperature. These experiments will determine whether the chr mutations decrease membrane leakage at high temperature or stabilize membranes by altering lipid composition. 4) Test whether the chr mutations confer enhanced heat tolerance by inducing thermoprotective genes. RNAseq will be used to probe the effect of the chr mutations on global transcriptomes. Results of these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at regional and national scientific conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Because heat treatments are the most widely used and economical methods to inactivate pathogens in food products, it is important to obtain a fuller understanding of the regulation of high temperature tolerance in the food-borne pathogen Salmonella.  In order to study the mechanisms of regulation of thermotolerance in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, our laboratory isolated mutant derivatives that were significantly more resistant to killing by high temperature than the parental wild-type strain.  The rationale for undertaking this approach was that by identifying genes in which mutations could confer increased survival at high temperature, we would be able to discern what are the causes of lethality at high temperature in the wild type.   Analysis of the above mutants revealed that their increased thermotolerance was due to mutations that resulted in high-level transcription of two genes involved in magnesium (Mg2+) homeostasis:  mgtA, which encodes an Mg2+ transport protein, and mgtC, which is a virulence determinant whose transcription is up-regulated by Mg2+ deficiency.  This is an important discovery, because Mg2+ has been known to be a regulatory signal for the transcription of a number of pathogenesis genes in Salmonella, and now, we found that this essential nutrient is also a regulator of thermotolerance.   We developed a novel technique for the quantification of loss of viability at high temperature that was based on measuring the leakage of ions from the cells by increases in the electrical conductance of the culture media.  This analysis, which made it possible to follow cell death in real time, revealed that the leakage of ions from the cells increased rapidly as the cultures were shifted from 30?C to temperatures ranging from 50? to 60?.  The culture media of the thermotolerant mutants exhibited significantly less increase in conductance, i.e. less leakage of ions, after the high temperature-challenge than the wild type.  This analysis suggests that i) the cause of lethality in wild-type Salmonella is membrane damage that results in increased loss of ions and other metabolites from the cytoplasm, and ii) the alteration in Mg2+ homeostasis in our heat tolerant mutants confers increased thermotolerance by promoting the integrity of the membranes by a mechanism that is yet to be discovered.   Intellectual merit of the project.  This research led to the discovery that Mg2+, which is a regulatory signal for virulence genes, is also involved in the regulation of thermotolerance in Salmonella.  Better understanding of the regulation of thermotolerance in bacteria has the practical application that it will provide insights into the optimization of time-honored high temperature-treatment protocols used to inactivate Salmonella and other bacterial pathogens during food preparation.  The results of this project will also facilitate the development of heat-resistant bacteria for industrial uses.  Broader impacts of the research.  This NSF-funded project enabled the Principal Investigator to train scientists at all levels, including two post-doctoral fellows, a Ph. D. and an MS student.  Furthermore, the grant gave opportunity to six high school students to work on projects related to heat tolerance and Mg2+ transport.  Most notably, one of these high school students made an initial discovery that formed the basis of a refereed publication from our laboratory and earned her the authorship on this publication.  Also, this grant provided six Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) stipends that supported Purdue University Biology majors for summer research projects related to thermotolerance and Mg2+ homeostasis.
