<AbstractNarration>Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are fine particles that arise from the oxidation of primary (volatile; VOC) organic compounds in the atmosphere. Secondary organic aerosols can have source contributions from both natural (e.g. from plants) and man-made (e.g. from unburnt hydrocarbons in automotive tailpipe emissions) sources.  Source apportionment studies benefit society by improving our understanding of the sources of fine particulate matter, which has been shown to be correlated with excess morbidity, and is present in the air we breathe &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science objectives of this research project will determine the anthropogenic SOA source characteristics, and their impact on fine particle concentrations (PM2.5; particulate matter less than 2.5microns) in urban areas relative to biogenic and other sources. A field-based approach will target ambient aerosol sampling at a number of urban locations: Houston, TX, Atlanta, GA, Milwaukee, WI. These are all sites where prior studies have established a mix of atmospheric loadings of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC) and biogenic compounds, allowing their respective contribution to SOA formation to be estimated.  Anthropogenic activities that contribute to dangerous levels of criteria pollutants such as PM2.5 need to be identified and accurately quantified to source level before they can sensibly become targets of regulation or mitigation  aimed at reducing ambient levels of fine particles. The approach used in this study centers on analysis of aromatic sulfonates, photoxidation products from aromatic VOCs, as chemical tracers of anthropogenic inputs into SOA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project overview and goals Particulate matter in the atmosphere significantly and adversely affects human health and influences the Earth?s climate. This project focuses on developing scientific tools and advancing our understanding of how humans influence the composition and concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere. Our research focuses on secondary organic aerosols (SOA) that form in the atmosphere through chemical reactions of gas-phase precursors. Our goals were to i) determine the source characteristics of anthropogenic SOA in urban aerosols, ii) to advance our ability to understand and its impact both on and relative to biogenic SOA and other sources that contribute to air pollution in urban areas, iii) train graduate and undergraduate researchers in atmospheric chemistry, and iv) build partnerships for atmospheric chemistry research.  Key findings  Our research has advanced our ability to track atmospheric particulate matter in the atmosphere, with a focus on chemicals associated with anthropogenic SOA.  We developed new quantification methods for four classes of compounds: furandiones, nitroaromatics, aromatic organosulfates, and aromatic sulfonates. Using these methods, we evaluated the efficacy of select organic species to serve as tracers of anthropogenic SOA based on their detectability, gas-particle partitioning, and source specificity. We provide specific recommendations for the species that are best suited for tracing anthropogenic SOA.

This knowledge may be used to better protect and manage air resources in the urban areas of Houston and Atlanta.  Intellectual merit  More broadly, our research has advanced our approaches to evaluating the contributions of sources to particulate matter, a technique termed source apportionment. We have demonstrated that combining multiple source apportionment techniques overcomes limitations of using receptor models in isolation. For instance, biomass burning SOA contributions to organic aerosol can be estimated through the combination of chemical mass balance and factor analysis techniques.

Improved air quality will benefit society by reduced respiratory mobility and mortality, improved visibility, and reduced damage to physical resources, like buildings.  Our results have been disseminated to the atmospheric chemistry and scientific community through four published scientific articles, two databases, and fourteen scientific presentations at local, regional, national, and international conferences. In addition, one scientific manuscript is currently under peer-review and another manuscript is in preparation.   Broader impacts of this research include the training of five graduate students pursuing doctoral degrees, one graduate student pursing a master?s degree, five undergraduate students, and one high school student in the field of atmospheric and analytical chemistry.
