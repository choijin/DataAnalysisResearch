<AbstractNarration>In many regions of the developing world millions of people live in rural environments in highly stratified societies - India, for example, is a case in point. As population size increases, pressure on the land grows and the land itself becomes degraded, how can populations adapt over the long run? Through the examination of historical cases researchers can examine such processes over the course of decades. This project gains general significance within that context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With an international team, Dr. Mark W. Hauser will conduct two field seasons of  archaeological excavations in Dominica, British West Indies. The team brings together experts in archaeology, history, and environmental research to  study slave settlements following the introduction of sugar plantation agriculture. The acquisition of new colonial territories, including Dominica, by Britain in 1763, was one moment where an entrenched population was confronted with new political and economic regimes.  Within 20 years the primary colonial economy had changed, as population increased by a magnitude of 10 and many plantations began to produce crops like sugar and coffee destined for the European markets. Changes often degraded the island environment and created a crisis in food supplies. The team hopes to understand with a rich archaeological record of finds (both important and locally made everyday objects and food remains) how enslaved Africans and their children contributed and accommodated to new economic, political and environmental regimes. Specifically the team will compare the diet, market activities, and household architecture of slaves before and after Britain took over Dominica.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The nature of the research questions requires basic data principally in residential areas that allow the identification of slave households, their diet, and the economic networks that were employed to furnish their households. Once these data are recovered, dating on the ground of the political transition into empire can be worked out by using time specific objects known from many previous studies. With the rich and specific archaeological collections, we hope to reconstruct the organization of plantation settlements in which owners, slaves, and managers each had important roles to play. Specific tasks are 1) completely survey map the region of Soufriere and the surrounding rural settlements, 2) conduct test excavations and larger excavations of house areas for a sample of houses at the settlements, 4) complete the analysis of all artifacts collected, 5) to integrate the documentary data with the survey and excavation data for academic publication and popular presentations to both American and Dominican audiences.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The colonial slave life project will provide much needed substantive information that will help investigate important theoretical topics of the colonial experience. The intellectual merit of the research will be to test social and economic theories of power and methods of identifying the material contributions of ordinary people, two issues confronting contemporary archaeology.  The broader impacts of the study are that it will produce new information about  Caribbean history. Since no project has focused solely on how environmental and economic changes associated with sugar cane production affected common people, the substantial increase in knowledge will provide the possibility major revisions in the scientific understanding of colonization and slavery. Caribbean and U.S. students will participate in the project to enhance their training and increase their knowledge of Caribbean history and the material and intellectual contributions of Africans in the Americas.</AbstractNarration>

Occupied as early as the 1740s, the settlement was home to the French Belligny family, and an unknown number of enslaved Africans who grew a combination of root crops and plantains to provision neighboring villages, towns and islands. Sometime after 1777, the lands on the plantation were altered to grow sugar for export. Between 1784 and 1817 the population of enslaved Africans and their children living in the settlement increased from 88 to 166.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The team successfully identified a rich archaeological record from seven houses representing occupations both before and after this agricultural transition (See Figure 2). Excavations recovered evidence of architecture including iron nails, postholes and foundation materials. While analysis is ongoing, we can make some preliminary statements about housing and its organization. Prior to the introduction of sugar, evidence seems to suggest that houses were fairly uniform, widely spread apart and had large attached gardens. After the agricultural transition, the size, design and construction of houses showed increased variation, and most of the houses were concentrated in an area separated from the owner&rsquo;s residence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The record also has evidence of dietary practices and changes in procuring food. The team recovered a rich collection of plant remains. This evidence was recovered from garbage middens, cooking hearths and living surfaces in the yards. Prior to the production of sugar at Morne Patate, remains indicate that households at Morne Patate were producing and consuming a few African staples alongside a largely indigenous set of foods. After the agricultural transition, we observed two trends. First, there was an expansion of localized food production. Second, enslaved Africans began experimenting with different crops and garden locations. Evidence of animal resources was more limited than plant remains. Nonetheless, analysis indicates that prior to the transition to sugar, colonists and slaves made use of protein from fish, wild game and livestock. After the agricultural transition, the range of species used by slaves and colonists increased.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, the record included evidence of economic activities. Trade goods including pottery, coins, and other small finds, recovered from the gardens and yards immediately surrounding each of the houses speak to some of the market activities in which slaves were involved. These remains indicate how slaves were integrated with global markets as consumers, but also reveal poorly documented, locally organized, informal commercial networks. While preliminary, results seem to indicate two important trends after the introduction of sugar.&nbsp; First, informal relationships with neighboring French Martinique continued and possibly intensified after annexation of the island by Britain.&nbsp; Second, research suggests increased material differences between houses on the estates.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project had several benefits to society at large. The Archaeological Survey of Colonial Dominica was a useful platform for training and education in many fields including archaeology, botany, and zoology. Participants included faculty, volunteers, graduate students and undergraduate students from Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia. It also included students and volunteers from Dominica, Jamaica, Bahamas, and Canada. Second, resources archaeologists draw on to conduct such studies are increasingly vulnerable to destruction. Increased frequency of high energy weather events in the past few years has taken a particular toll on Dominica&rsquo;s cultural patrimony.&nbsp;Through these investigation we have documented one such vulnerable resource, a site of great importance to the island&rsquo;s and the region&rsquo;s history. Finally, data generated through the Archaeological Survey of Colonial Dominica will be made publicly available through a partnership with the Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery (DAACS) housed by the Department of Archaeology at Monticello.
