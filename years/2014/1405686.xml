<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for participants in the semi-annual Wasatch Topology Conference series, held in the winter and summer in the years 2014-2016 at Park City, Utah and Salt Lake City, Utah. The Wasatch Topology conference is focused on topology and geometry, including interactions with ergodic theory and dynamical systems. Each conference presents the work of eight speakers to an audience of primarily local research mathematicians and graduate students. Funds from this award also support the participation of non-local mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wasatch Topology Conference allows mathematicians from around the United States the opportunity to gather and share their results with a larger audience of experts and junior researchers. Research opportunities will be created through interactions among the conference participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current website for the Wasatch Topology Conference is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.utah.edu/wtc/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This NSF award was used to fund six separate conferences on current and ongoing research in the field of mathematics. The conferences are named Wasatch Topology Conferences, and they were held between the dates of August 2014 and August 2017. Each of the Wasatch Topology Conferences funded by this award were held either in the summer or in the winter -- with the exclusion of the winter of 2016. The location of the Wasatch Topology Conferences alternated between the Utah cities of Midway, Park City, and Salt Lake City.   The Wasatch Topology Conferences funded by this award brought together 45 speakers who presented their ongoing mathematics research in the fields of topology, geometry, and dynamics. The audience for these talks regularly included faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students from the nearby University of Utah and Brigham Young University. The conference also funded the participation of 11 nonspeakers from outside of Utah. Most of these nonspeaker participants were in the early stages of careers in mathematics.  The purpose of the Wasatch Topology Conferences is to promote mathematics research in the fields of topology, geometry, and dynamics, including a goal of promoting research from those in the early stages of a career in mathematics research.
