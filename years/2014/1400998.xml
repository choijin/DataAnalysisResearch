<AbstractNarration>The coupling of the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field gives rise to a range of disturbance effects in Earth?s near-space environment.  Communications, navigation and energy production and distribution are significantly affected by this space weather. The ability to forecast disturbances that may impact these technologies hinges upon detailed knowledge and understanding of the connected Sun-Earth system, including complicated coupling processes between the magnetosphere and ionosphere. A particular aspect of the latter within the nightside aurora are meso-scale flow channels that have been discovered recently and are believed to play a significant role in the creation and dynamics of space weather disturbances in the ionosphere.  Determining the precise nature of the flow-channels and their relation to the large-scale dynamics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system is the main objective of this project.  It will be attempted through a comprehensive and carefully coordinated analysis of simultaneous observations of the phenomenon from a variety of sources.  The resulting understanding constitutes a critical step towards being able to include this effect in ionospheric space weather specification and forecast models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine observations from a large and diverse set of instruments and facilities across the auroral region in the North American sector, including incoherent and coherent scatter radars, spectral auroral imagers, and ground-based magnetometers, to investigate meso-scale flow channel events in the nightside auroral oval.   Specific project goals for the research effort include: 1) establishing the relative location of flow channels and auroral streamers; 2) establishing the relation between flow channel and streamer trajectories and large-scale convection; and  3) determining the connection between flow channel events and other plasma sheet disturbances, including substorms and omega bands.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The high-latitude ionosphere is electromagnetically connected to the solar wind and magnetosphere and collisionally connected to the neutral thermosphere. Plasma flows in the high-latitude ionosphere are largely driven by the solar wind and magnetosphere interactions and highly variable, frequently featuring with fast and narrow flow channels. These flow channels can form under diverse driving conditions, such as dayside reconnection and solar wind dynamic pressure variations. In this project, we have systematically studied the impact of flow channels on ionospheric density structuring using multi-instrument observations and numerical simulations.</p> <p>First, we studied the role of dayside reconnection driven flow channel in segmenting transporting the polar cap patches on the dayside [Ren et al., 2020]. Dayside solar- produced concentrated F-region plasma can be transported from the midlatitude region into the polar cap during geomagnetically disturbed period, creating plasma density irregularities like polar cap patches, which can cause scintillation and degrade performance of satellite communication and navigation at polar latitudes. During the Oct. 13, 2016 storm main phase, storm-enhanced density (SED) was formed within an extended period of strong southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz condition. Total electron content (TEC) map shows that a polar cap patch was segmented from the SED plume. The Sondrestrom Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) was right underneath the segmentation region and captured a sudden flow enhancement reaching ~2 km/s near the dayside cusp inflow region. Quantitative estimation suggests that plasma density loss due to enhanced frictional heating was insufficient for the patch segmentation because the elevated F -region density peaking at ~500 km made dissociative recombination inefficient. Instead, the patch was segmented from the SED by low- density plasma transported by the fast flow channel from earlier local time.</p> <p>Second, we also studied the subsequent transport and evolution of polar cap patches to the nightside [Lyons et al., 2015]. During the March 17, 2013 storm, polar cap patches are transported from the dayside to the nightside auroral zone. Larger patches split into smaller patches at the nightside Harang reversal region due to bifurcation of convection flows and are transported into both dusk and dawn convection cells. Clear dusk-dawn asymmetry in TEC can be seen. In addition, they are converted to boundary blobs after they enter the auroral zone. Simultaneous field-aligned current (FAC) data from AMPERE show that these boundary blobs are collocated with downward Region-2 FACs.</p> <p>Moreover, besides the well-known reconnection generated fast flow channels, we found that during solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements, the convection flows sandwiched by the upward and downward pressured-induced field-aligned currents (FACs) can exceed 1 km/s and form a frictional heat belt expanding a few hours of magnetic local time (MLT) [Zou et al., 2017]. We further studied the effect of solar wind dynamic variations using numerical models and quantified their impact in the IT system [Ozturk et al., 2018, 2019].</p> <p>The REU supplement of this grant supported two undergraduate student projects. One project was a multi-event analysis using world-wide GPS TEC data in the Southern Hemisphere together with FACs measurements from AMPERE and scintillation receivers. Large TEC gradient and enhanced scintillation are found associated with the pressured induced FACs and the fast flow channels. The second project focused on the scintillation impact of polar cap density structures associated with fast flow channels in the Northern Hemisphere.</p> <p>References:</p> <p>Lyons, L., B.
