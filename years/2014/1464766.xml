<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) are supporting Toshiko Ichiye of Georgetown University for computational studies of the aqueous solvation of proteins.  Although water is the most common liquid on this planet, the molecular bases of its unique properties as a liquid and a solvent that make it critical for life are still unclear. While it is generally accepted that the tetrahedral network of hydrogen bonds is essential, the critical features in a water molecule that lead to hydrogen bonds are just beginning to be understood. Given its unique liquid properties, this is not surprising but it makes modeling water in computer simulations difficult. However, since computer simulations using atomistic representations of biological macromolecules in aqueous solutions have become critical in understanding many biological problems, accurate representations of both the bio-macromolecule and its surrounding water are essential. Therefore, identifying these features and determining the best ways to model them will impact the understanding of structure and function of biological molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipid membranes, and their assemblies. Moreover, computer simulations are being used to understand scientific questions in many areas of chemistry and physics, and given the importance of water as a liquid and solvent; these studies will have a broad impact on other fields. In addition, the implementation into a commonly used biomolecular simulation package means that our methods will be widely available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is to develop a molecular understanding of water and aqueous solutions and, based on this, to develop new atomistic models for water and proteins in computer simulations. The approach of Ichiye and her research group is to understand water is by determining the minimal molecular features necessary to model its unique properties in molecular dynamics computer simulations, which must be its essential molecular features.  This approach has been used to understand water as a pure liquid; now the anomalous properties of aqueous ionic solutions are being studied. This approach to modeling water is also unique in that molecular multipoles centered only on the oxygen are used to represent the charge distribution due to both the nuclei and the electron density, which is especially important for reproducing the properties of water. Molecular multipoles are superior to adding dummy sites representing electron density in a site model, because electrons are not point particles. Thus, these models are more accurate than four- and five-site water models and at least two times computationally faster than even three-site models. These ideas will now be used to develop an accurate but efficient force field for ions, co-solutes, and eventually proteins. Molecular multipoles will also be used: multipoles will be placed on the heavy atoms somewhat like the traditional united atom approach, except that the electrostatics of both the hydrogens and electron density will be treated via the multipoles. The aim is to develop a force field that is more accurate than the most commonly used non-polarizable force fields for biomolecules and that is also two to three times faster computationally.</AbstractNarration>
