<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds for the acquisition of a high sensitivity/high precision gas source mass spectrometer as a foundation for our new research program involving high-spatial resolution and ultra-high precision triple oxygen isotope geochemistry. This exciting technique of measuring small variations in 17O values of geological materials is in its infancy, with many potential applications across a broad spectrum within Earth Sciences. The application of ultra-high resolution 17O measurements will be an integral part of the thesis work for three incoming graduate students (one woman) and will ultimately serve to demonstrate to the broader geological community the potential for this new technology. The facility will be available to outside users with relevant research projects. It will serve as a platform for future NSF proposals involving student research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high precision mass spectrometer is the basic platform for a number of research themes,including constraining paleoclimate variations, understanding Deep-Time climate, tracking near-surface signatures in shallow crustal and mantle rocks, measuring individual zircons extracted from lunar and Archean terrestrial rocks, meteoritic studies, and other evolving projects. This equipment will be the primary research tool of the two PIs and will compliment other advances being instituted in the newly formed University-wide Center for Stable Isotopes (CSI).</AbstractNarration>

Unlike the geothermal samples, the Chilean samples appear to be far out of equilibrium. This work will constitute her Master's thesis.   Our continued work will be centered on calcite in place of quartz. Calcite is far more difficult to measure for the triple oxygen isotope ratios, but we believe that we have developed a method that will allow for accurate measurements. This work, to be started in the summer of 2016, is the Ph.D. of Jordan Gibbons. Additional work planned for the future includes looking at manganese nodules, which have prior evidence of atmospheric water incorporated into the samples.   We have presented this work at AGU in 2015 and Jordan will present her work at the Goldschmidt Conference in Yokahama Japan in summer of 2016.
