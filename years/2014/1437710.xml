<AbstractNarration>CBET-1437710&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physical properties of suspensions such as emulsions and foams can be strongly affected by the presence of small particles that adsorb onto liquid-liquid or liquid-gas interfaces.  This project will explore how the presence of adsorbed particles, their composition, and the arrangements they can take on an interface, which is called their mesostructure, can influence the rheology of the interface.  An interfacial rheometer has been developed for this study, which will allow investigators to measure characteristics of the interface and simultaneously observe particles at the interface.  The results will be used to determine the role of mesostructures on interfacial rheology.  This relationship between structure and rheology is important, because many manufacturing chemical processes found in consumer cosmetics, food products, drug delivery applications, and enhanced oil recovery use emulsions that have particle-laden or particle-covered interfaces.  The information gathered in this project will be useful to scientists and engineers who formulate such products and design large-scale processes to manufacture them.  The investigators will use results from the project to develop a series of informative and engaging modules that can be used by instructors to teach fluid dynamics principles to university and middle-school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mesostructure in particle-laden interfaces are affected by interparticle forces, which depend on composition.  The mesostructure resists flow-induced deformation, resulting in an interfacial viscoelasticity. The nature of particle interactions on an interface differs from that in the bulk, primarily because of an anisotropic capillary attraction between interfacial particles.  Using the interfacial rheometer, investigators will characterize the role of composition on the equilibrium mesostructure of particle-laden interfaces, characterize the role of composition on the rheology and mesostructure of deforming interfaces, and relate changes in composition such as particle surface concentration, particle size and polydispersity, and surfactant concentration to interparticle forces and viscous forces.  Viscoelasticity of such interfaces affects dynamical behavior of emulsions, including drop deformation, coalescence and breakup.  Understanding the relationship between composition and rheology will allow practitioners to tailor interfaces and engineer materials with desired properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pickering emulsions are a complex fluid of a droplet phase within a continuous liquid phase.  The droplets are prevented from coalescing by particles on the drop surface, which provide mechanical protection. Such an interface is shown in Figure 1.  The strength of the mechanical protection is dependent on a number of factors including the size and shape of the particles, the addition of other chemicals to the surface (known as surfactants), and by changing the properties of the particles surface. Figure 2 displays how increasing the amount of surfactant to such a interface reduces the overall mechanical strength.  The goal of this work was to understand how the composition of the interface, meaning the types of particles used and the addition of other chemicals to the interface, affected the mechanical strength of the interface with the goal of being able to control the interface strength to control Pickering emulsions.  To do this, we did both experimental studies and computational simulations.  The experimental work focused on using a single type of particle and first examining how salt and surfactants modified the mechanical strength.  We were able to show that increasing the concentration of salt created stronger interface because it reduced repulsion between particles, whereas increasing surfactant created weaker interfaces because of reduced attraction between particles.  Furthermore, we showed how combining both salt and surfactant could be used to create a range of different types of behaviors in the interface.  Finally, we have studied how using more than one type of particle can create stronger interfaces, by creating uneven interactions between individual particles.  In simulation work, we have examined how particles that are not in contact due to repulsion form interesting flow patterns due to their desire to remain far apart from one another.  Figure 3 shows such a flow pattern.  Furthermore, we have shown how different types of particle structures can be formed on the interfaces by changing attraction and flow conditions in simulations.  The results of this work provide a set of rules that can be used to manipulate the mechanical strength of these interfaces, allowing industrial/commercial scientist to create more stable emulsions with more interesting properties.
