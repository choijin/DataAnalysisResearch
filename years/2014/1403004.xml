<AbstractNarration>This project develops a low-cost and non-invasive method that can help in assessing cardiovascular health and disease by deriving personalized cardiovascular risk predictors.  Cardiovascular disease remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States and around the world. The developed methods can be widely used to improve cardiovascular risk stratification and thereby reduce the incidence of stroke and heart disease.  This project provides new opportunities for technological advances in pervasive and personalized medicine, which can ultimately improve the quality of life of human beings. This project also impacts education by developing new multi-disciplinary course modules and encouraging minority students to participate in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research derives a methodological framework to infer cardiovascular risk predictors from the analysis of blood volume waveform signals measured by low-cost and non-invasive modalities such as oscillometric cuff oscillations.  In this framework, model-based adaptive signal processing methods analyze blood volume waveform signals measured at peripheral locations on the body to derive personalized blood pressure waveform signals.  Then, cardiovascular risk predictors are derived from a model-based analysis of these blood pressure and volume waveform signals.  The research work includes: (1) deriving mathematical models that dictate the relation between blood pressure versus volume waveform signals; (2) deriving adaptive signal processing methods that transform blood volume waveform signals to blood pressure waveform signals; and 3) deriving methods that compute cardiovascular risk predictors from blood pressure and volume waveform signals.  This project makes contributions to the derivation of a unified framework for mathematical modeling of the relation between blood pressure and volume waves.  It also contributes to the advancement of adaptive signal processing methodologies relevant to physiological system modeling and health monitoring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The broad goal of this project was to obtain superior information about a patient's cardiovascular health status from a widely used arm blood pressure cuff.  These devices measure the pressure inside the cuff during slow cuff deflation.  From the measured cuff pressure waveform. blood pressure in the arm is then conventionally estimated using an algorithm designed for an average patient.  We first developed a patient-specific algorithm to measure the arm blood pressure based on a physical model of the phenomenon.  We compared the measured arm blood pressure to invasively measured arm blood pressure in a large group of patients.  We found that this algorithm was significantly more accurate in patients, especially those with stiff arteries, than widely used office devices.  We also found that the patient-specific algorithm was more repeatable than these devices.  We then extended the algorithm to measure blood pressure near the heart ("central blood pressure"), which is clinically more significant, from the same arm cuff pressure waveform by leveraging another physical model.  We compared the measured central blood pressure to invasively measured central blood pressure in a large group of patients.  We found that the extended algorithm was signficantly more accurate than the conventional cuff-based method, which employs an extra cuff inflation period that approximately doubles the measurement time.  Hence, central blood pressure may be measured -- for the first time -- both reliably and in the exact same way as traditional arm blood pressure.  This research sheds light on the crucial facets of the physiology that determine the cuff pressure waveform and the relationship between arm and central blood pressure.  The research included the training of three doctoral students and exposed several K-12 students to physiologic modeling.  A few of these students were from underrepresented groups.  With continued efforts, the research could ultimately translate to a superior blood pressure cuff that can help physicians better manage hypertension.
