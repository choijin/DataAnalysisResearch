<AbstractNarration>Ocean waters are infiltrating and influencing freshwater-dependent coastal landscapes due to a combination of human and natural factors. By the end of this century, lower-lying parts of the outer edge of the Southern U.S. coastal plain will be largely inundated by saltwater due to gradual sea level rise. The salinization of surface waters and adjacent lands may lead to significant reductions in crop and timber yields in managed ecosystems, significant declines in ecosystem carbon sequestration in unmanaged ecosystems, and degradation of coastal water quality due to extraction of soil nutrients by seasalts.  This project will enhance understanding of the coupled human and natural processes influencing salinization of surface waters and adjacent lands. Investigators will build and engage a coalition of expert stakeholders, including members of state and local governments, regional planning groups, landowners and advocacy organizations. Partnerships with stakeholders will help investigators define the current status of coastal ecosystems, identify critical knowledge gaps, share new research findings, and develop and explore future land use and climate scenarios. This project will yield outcomes with predictive value in coastal systems that are easily understood by stakeholders while representing complex interactions between climate, hydrology, land use, and ecological processes and identify pathways by which outcomes could be used to enhance coastal sustainability.  Together, these activities will help guide sustainable management of this region and similarly affected regions over the next several decades to centuries.  Additional broader impacts include training four Ph.D. students in interdisciplinary research that spans natural and social sciences, engaging undergraduate students in mentored research experiences, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences by supporting early career investigators and working to recruit students from underrepresented groups.  This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on saltwater intrusion, the landward movement of salinity from the coast onto the coastal plain. A team of investigators representing four disciplines (hydrology, biogeochemistry, community ecology, regional planning) will integrate social, hydrological, climate and ecological data into model scenarios to examine not only how human decisions affect ecosystems but also how information about those ecological impacts in turn affect human decisions.  This project will facilitate development, validation and refinement of a saltwater intrusion vulnerability index (SIVI) for the Albemarle-Pamlico peninsula of North Carolina that accounts for physical environmental processes influencing the movement of water and solutes across the landscape as well as the extensive networks of canals, ditches, roads and pump stations that fundamentally alter the flow of water across the region.  The index will be used, along with extensive and repeated ground-based surveys of surface water, soil and vegetation conditions across a range of vulnerable landscapes within the region, to better understand ecological impacts of saltwater intrusion.  Through workshops and surveys for landowners, managers and other stakeholders in the region, the project will reveal the likely impact of land-use decisions on saltwater intrusion under scenarios of climate change.</AbstractNarration>

In the interim, however, some places are already experiencing phenomena linked to sea level rise, including ?sunny day? flooding, worsening storm surges, and transformation of freshwater-dependent landscapes by periodic exposure to salt water.&nbsp; The latter phenomenon, saltwater intrusion, is an especially complicated process that depends on more than simply rates of sea level rise. We conducted a multi-year study of landscapes and communities in a low-lying coastal area of North Carolina, the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula (APP), in order to investigate saltwater intrusion and its effects on ecosystems and people. Here are some of our key findings.</p> <p>Overall, coastal and inland waters of the APP are becoming saltier (Figure 1). In contrast to sea level rise, which is a relatively slow and gradual process, salinization trends are punctuated by episodic events associated with storm surge and with severe drought (Ard?n et al. 2016). The ?bathtub model? of sea level rise, often used to study impacts on low-lying coastal areas, is an inadequate way to assess vulnerability and forecast risk. The model fails to account for hydrologic connectivity of different parts of the landscape. Human-made structures such as drainage canals and ditches enhance hydrologic connectivity and make some coastal areas highly vulnerable to saltwater exposure (Bhattachan et al. 2018a). On the APP, drainage infrastructure has increased the amount of land that is vulnerable to impacts from both saltwater intrusion and sea level rise (SWISLR).&nbsp; In particular, ditching and draining have concentrated freshwater drainage, meaning that fewer places on the landscape benefit from freshwater flows that can flush salts away following droughts or storm surges (Bhattachan et al. 2018a). On the other hand, one-way drainage valves, berms, roadbeds, and other engineered structures protect a small fraction of the APP from exposure to saltwater (Bhattachan et al. 2018b).</p> <p>The impacts of SWISLR on ecosystems and people of the APP are already detectable. Vegetation is changing rapidly in the region, and small-scale studies reveal a loss of tree basal area in plots with elevated soil salinity (Ury et al. 2019). Student-led work in progress suggests a loss of salt intolerant taxa. At the regional scale, remote sensing data reveal large swaths of forest transitioning to scrub/shrubland habitats (Ury et al. In Press). Other recent work on the APP by collaborators suggest that these regional trends represent significant losses of biomass carbon from coastal landscapes (Smart et al. 2020), and substantial losses of a unique and already threatened habitat type (Taillie et al. 2019).</p> <p>SWISLR also has impacts for people on the APP.&nbsp; Landowners in the region are actively deciding whether to adapt or move away based on their personal experience with increased flooding on their own and neighboring properties (Schwaller et al. 2020). Landowners who believe that storms are becoming more frequent or severe are more likely to take actions to adapt or outmigrate than landowners who do not share these beliefs. For those that have not directly experienced flooding or property damage from storms, concerns about the trajectory of coastal climate change are tied to political ideology, with conservatives less likely to believe that climate is changing.&nbsp; Residents of the APP whose properties are vulnerable to SWISLR (i.e., low-lying property or property with a high density of artificial drainage) perceive greater risk of exposure to saltwater on their properties than APP residents living in less vulnerable areas (Bhattachan et al. 2019).</p> <p>The project brought together collaborators from three universities and also engaged non-university partners who live or work on the APP (e.g., government agencies, conservation organizations, landowners).
