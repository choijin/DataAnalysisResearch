<AbstractNarration>The University of Michigan and South African National Space Agency (SANSA) Space Weather International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program (UM-SANSA-IRES or MSI for short) will support 18 students (six per year) spending the northern hemisphere summer (8-weeks) at the SANSA Space Science Directorate located in Hermanus, South Africa working on a variety of space weather science and engineering projects. Space Weather is the field of space science that seeks to understand the impact of solar disturbances on the Earth's space environment especially with respect to technology.  The goals of MSI include (1) engage undergraduates in publishable research projects; (2) development of students' scientific communication skills; (3) development of culturally competent and societally aware scientists and engineers and (4) strengthening existing and developing new UM and SANSA collaborations and exchanges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will be paired with SANSA scientists, engineers and post-docs to provide one-on-one research mentoring, will participate in the annual "Space Weather Winter School" held by SANSA in June and July and attend the South African Institute of Physics (SAIP) Conference. Pre and post trip activities at the University of Michigan will provide scientific, cultural and professional development programs to enhance the impact of the international research experience. The students will also have a UM scientific mentor to engage the students prior and after the IRES experience, which will also foster scientific collaborations between UM and SANSA scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space weather is an important area of research, especially because of the implications for communications and other crucial technologies including satellite navigation and communication systems, power grids, and ground-and-aircraft-based HF radio communication. There are significant variations in space weather effects depending on latitude, local time, and longitude, as well as northern and southern hemispheric differences depending on season. The research focus of this IRES program is to understand space weather effects at mid- and low-latitudes, differences between the northern and summer hemisphere, and between the American and African sectors. The program takes advantage of the impressive facilities and expertise available at SANSA. SANSA Space Science is currently responsible for monitoring the space environment over the Southern African region, Indian and Atlantic oceans as well as the South Pole, and forms part of a global network of similar organizations throughout the world. Instruments are deployed throughout South Africa, Namibia, Antarctica, Marion Island and Gough Island. SANSA is host to the only Space Weather Regional Warning Center in Africa and therefore develops and operates space weather forecasting models for a broad region. IRES MSI students will participate in SANSA research which includes studies on the variation of the Earth's geomagnetic field and its application to navigation, the propagation of waves in the various regions of the space environment and their effects, diagnostic information on the propagation media, ionospheric characterization, basic and applied space weather, space plasmas, and radio wave propagation.</AbstractNarration>

These findings are significant for understanding equatorial ionosphere structure and dynamics that have impacts on communication, navigation and the power grid. Our broader impact was developing the global cultural competency and communication skills for 20 diverse (50% female and 35% URM) undergraduate science and engineering students.
