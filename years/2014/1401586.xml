<AbstractNarration>This work seeks to address the following basic questions. What are the forces acting in nature and what are their properties? How do systems consisting of several objects develop under the influence of these forces? The second question represents one of the most fundamental, unsolved problems in science. The motion of two objects can often be predicted with virtual certainty. For example, if the solar system consisted of only the sun and the earth, one could predict the position and the velocity of the earth relative to the sun for all times in the future. But if only one more object is added to the system (say the moon in the above example) no analytic solution (one that is given in terms of equations) within our mathematical framework exists. This dilemma is known as the few-body problem (FBP). It has very broad impacts in all of the natural sciences because most of modern research deals with systems containing more than 2 objects. The project outlined in this proposal experimentally studies the FBP for atomic systems. For such systems of microscopic scale the FBP is further complicated by the characteristics of quantum-mechanics, the theory that was designed to describe such tiny systems.  In the long term, this work may influence not only the understanding of isolated atoms, but also the interaction of beams of atoms (or ions or molecules) with surfaces, something which is a key technology underpinning the manufacturing of portable electronic devices and computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the few-body problem will be studied by performing kinematically complete experiments on ionization of simple targets by ion impact. The momentum vectors of the scattered projectiles and of the recoiling target ions are measured directly and the momentum of the ejected electron is deduced from the kinematic conservation laws. From the data, fully differential cross sections (FDCS) will be extracted. The coherence properties of the projectile can be varied by changing the geometry of a collimating slit placed before the target. Only relatively recently it was discovered that the FDCS can be sensitive to the projectile coherence length. This, in turn, can explain very puzzling discrepancies between theory and experiment, which were vividly debated for the last decade.  The proposed work aims at systematically exploring the role of the projectile coherence properties in atomic few-body systems. It is anticipated that the results from these studies will represent an important step forward towards a thorough understanding of the few-body problem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project collisions between protons and simple atoms and molecules were studied.  Using a unique apparatus the most detailed information which is theoretically achievable was extracted for a variety of processes occurring in such collisions.  The focus was on ionization of the target atom.  Here, the momenta of all collision fragments, i.e. the scattered projectile, the ejected electron, and the residual target ion were determined.  The results of this project are significant with regard to one of the most fundamentally important, and yet unsolved, problems in physics, known as the few-body problem (FBP).  The FBP can be illustrated for the example of the solar system.  If it consisted only of the sun and the earth, the position and velocity of both objects could be calcuated exactly with the classical laws of motion for any time.  However, if only one more object is added (e.g. one more planet) the equations are no longer analytically solvable.  In this case only numeric solutions can be obtained.  In the case of the solar system these numeric methods give very accurate results (NASA has no problems in guiding their rockets to a specific location e.g. on Mars).  In the case of microscopic systems of atomic sizes (or smaller) there is an additional major complication to the FBP: such particles possess wave character.  The classical laws of motion cannot be applied to such systems.  Instead the laws of quantum-mechanics (Schr&ouml;dinger equation) have to be used.  As a result, numeric solutions even for simple atomic systems containing only 3 or 4 particles (especially dynamic systems such as collisions) are often not very accurate, i.e. our understanding of the atomic FBP is to a large extent still incomplete.  This project provided very sensitive experimental tests of theoretical modelling efforts to find numeric solutions to the atomic FBP.  By analyzing discrepancies between experiment and theory, shortcomings in the models can be identified, which in turn allows theorists to improve their models.  Our studies focused on two aspects of the FBP.  The first is related to the wave nature of microscopic objects.  This can result in interference phenomena in the intensity distribution of the detected particles, similar to interfernce patterns that can be observed in water waves or to optical interference.  Such interference patterns are very sensitive to the underlying few-body dynamics and thus offer accordingly sensitive tests of theoretical models.  Furthermore, the interference patterns are sensitive to the coherence properties of the projectile waves, where coherence decribes the phase relation between various waves.  Our results showed that all theoretical models existing at the time made unrealistic assumptions about the coherence properties.  This could explain long-standing and hitherto unexplained discrepancies between theory and a large body of experimental data.  Therefore, this work can make a major contribution towards a numeric solution of the atomic few-body problem.  It has already triggered significant theoretical activities to include the projectile coherence properties more realistically.  The second aspect is related to the approach that one specific class of theories, called perturbative methods, takes to tackle the FBP.  There, the description of the scattering process is expressed as a sum over many terms.  Each term represents the scattering process as a sequence of interactions between the various particles in the collision system.  Usually, the most important contribution is the term in which only a single interaction between the projectile and a target electron occurs (called first-order term).  However, higher-order terms, i.e. those in which multiple interactions occur, can be important as well.  In such perturbative approaches understanding the few-body dynamics underlying a certain process basically means understanding the relative importance of all the terms theory is summing over.  In this project the contributions of several of these terms were experimentally studied in large detail, which resulted in a better understanding of the few-body dynamics.
