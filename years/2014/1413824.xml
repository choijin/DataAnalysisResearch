<AbstractNarration>All grasses produce spikelets, short branches bearing the florets, which produce the kernels or grain, and therefore much of the calories that feed the world. Maize, and closely related grasses, produce spikelets in pairs, doubling the number of kernels produced in contrast to other, more distantly related cereals, such as rice, wheat and barley, which produce spikelets singly. Understanding the molecular and developmental basis for paired spikelet formation is of great practical significance as this information could be used to double yield in cereals that produce single spikelets. Collaborative comparative genomic studies also provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the molecular basis for the evolution of this derived trait. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The identification of the suppressor of sessile spikelet (sos) loci in maize provides a breakthrough into the understanding of the formation of the paired spikelet. Molecular, cellular and developmental approaches will be used to dissect the function of Sos1.  Additional molecular and developmental studies of Sos2 and Sos3 will enable the identification of additional genes regulating paired spikelet formation. The paired spikelet is produced by a meristem called the spikelet pair meristem.  Meristems continually produce organs through balancing the functions of maintenance and determinacy. The Sos loci will enable the dissection of the interaction between these two fundamental developmental processes, as well as providing insight into the evolution of grass inflorescence architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves collaboration between a maize developmental geneticist and an expert in the evolution of grasses, and hence is interdisciplinary in nature. One graduate student and at least six undergraduate students will be trained in the McSteen laboratory. A summer seminar series will be developed to provide training for undergraduates in understanding the broader implications of evolutionary studies in science, education, and society. The PI will also speak to the public on the domestication of corn.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The seeds of grasses produce most of the calories that feed the world.  Grass seeds (grains or kernels) are formed in specialized structures (spikelets) that can be produced singly or in pairs. Therefore making spikelets in pairs can double the number of kernels from one plant, and hence could be used to double yield in cereals that produce single spikelets.  In the course of this project we have discovered genes that control paired spikelet formation.   As a foundation for future work, our own and others, we have described the trajectory of gene expression in the floral structures of Setaria viridis, a plant that serves as a model for the major crops.  In the process, we found which genes are used most heavily by the plant to make the inflorescence and its floral structures.   We then focused on genes that control the size of meristems, structures that give rise to all other plant parts.  We used newly developed CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knock out putative meristem control genes (known by the acronym CLE), and discovered that one CLE gene in particular controls branch and inflorescence meristems, and hence the number of spikelets, leading to grains.  This is a novel role for this particular gene, but is likely also shared with the important crop, maize (corn).  The comparable gene in rice affects only flower structure and not spikelet number so appears to be less important for seed production.    In another effort to understand the basis of crop architecture, we also discovered a mutation in Setaria that affects movement of the plant hormone auxin.  This auxin importer affects plant height and inflorescence branching, so like the CLE gene it also regulates seed production.  A similar importer had been discovered in the model plant Arabidopsis but had very little overall effect on plant structure; hence its potential importance for plant growth and development had not been appreciated.  However, we have investigated the maize gene and find that it has a function similar to that in Setaria.   The project has trained two post-docs, two graduate students, three undergraduate students, and four high school students each of whom has made material contributions to the project.  One of the high school students is a co-author on the paper on the CLE gene.  Results have been presented at local, national, and international meetings, and all project participants, including the high school students, have had the opportunity to present their research.  This early exposure to science and to public presentation is an empowering experience particularly for the youngest members of the team, as they learn to function as research scientists.  The project was conceived and carried out with collaborator Paula McSteen at the University of Missouri, Columbia.  We have had frequent joint lab meetings throughout the project, linking McSteen's expertise in maize developmental genetics with Kellogg's skill in comparative evolutionary biology.  The McSteen-Kellogg collaboration is ongoing.  Providing a secure food supply is one of the grand challenges of our world today, and meeting that challenge will require the deepest possible knowledge of plants and their biology.  Because this project focuses on meristems and their products (seeds), it provides one contribution to that knowledge.
