<AbstractNarration>This STTR project's broader/commercial impact is that it will allow researchers to learn more about the complex relationships between environmental conditions and the impact of changes over time.  The ability to convey that knowledge in an intuitive and compelling manner to students and the public globally could motivate them to influence business and political leaders to craft policies that would reduce damage to the planet.  In addition to schools and universities, there are 600 museums dedicated to science, as well as aquariums and other public venues concerned with environmental issues; in essence, these all are involved in educating people, and they all look for effective means of portraying information about the Earth.  While the sphere/flat-screen displays provide the most compelling views, adapting the methods developed in this project to laptops and tablets (owned by several hundred million people) can contribute to learning about climate for students and adults worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR project leverages a commercial/university partnership to develop a vehicle for education and public outreach on climate and climate change.  With the increasing awareness and confusion about climate change and the severity of predicted impacts, it has become critical that we educate students at all levels to give them a real understanding of climate data and climate models.  Likewise, outreach efforts are vitally needed, both to interest students in learning more about climate science and to engage the general public.  This project will provide compelling methods for educators and their students to explore deeply what the data and state of the art models tell us about climate changes, both natural and anthropogenic, as well as to illustrate climate processes with simple models that can be used for "what if" scenarios.  The goal is not a series of canned lessons, but rather an open-ended means for teaching the material with the ability to dig deeper into the information in response to student questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As anthropogenic climate change becomes one of the critical issues in the 21st century, an educated and informed populace is vital to combat it.  The iGlobe/MIT dual-display system allows researchers to convey their knowledge of the complex relationships between environmental conditions and the impact of changes to those environmental conditions to students and the public in an intuitive and compelling manner.     The iGlobe/MIT partnership developed a vehicle for education and public outreach on climate and climate change by combining geospatial displays on a 3D spherical surface with rich, explanatory material on a flat screen, and adaptable tablet-based controls.  Ultimately this system will provide real-time access to a wide variety of researcher climate data and models, including cutting edge research models such as the MIT general circulation model, and simplified models for K12 students and teachers.       We developed a network of nearly 100 "partners" from K12 schools, universities, museums, aquariums, zoos, and research centers.  We engaged them in discussion forums, surveys and demonstrations, receiving valuable feedback that we incorporated into our system design.     In Phase I we developed and demonstrated prototypes of:  Integrated sphere/flat screen dual display presentations, such as:    A time-lapse model of the distribution of Arctic ice over 26 years on the sphere, paired with a flat screen graph of the total area covered over the same timeline.  The annual change from winter to summer is clear on the sphere, but only with the graph can you see the trend towards less ice coverage over time.  Temperature at a particular level in the atmosphere on the sphere, paired with a flat screen graph of temperature at all levels of the atmosphere against latitude for a specific longitude.  Global changes in phytoplankton on the sphere with flat screen, explanatory slides showing sample organisms and methods of inferring their concentration from satellites. Hurricane activity on the sphere with a flat screen movie discussing the role of climate change in making intense storms more likely.   Real time exploration of on-line data sets and models where the users select the data to display (e.g. temperature or ocean salinity), depth ranges, time periods, etc. Visualizing datasets, whether online or user-generated.  Examples include:    The capability to convert a spreadsheet containing either a list of countries with values over time (e.g. carbon emissions) or a latitude/longitude grid of values into a color-coded map on the sphere. Collections such as the National Virtual Ocean Data System or the IRI/LDEO Climate Data Library can be used to search for and preview data with the final visualizations appearing on the sphere.
