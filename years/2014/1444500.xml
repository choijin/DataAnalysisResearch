<AbstractNarration>Cybersecurity is threatened by the zero-day exploits (software vulnerabilities that have not been previously disclosed and are therefore potential vectors for attack). The threat is serious for exploits in the hands of major cyber powers that are potentially hostile nations. Publication of a zero-day exploits can enhance the resilience of domestic cyber-infrastructure (if an adversary has discovered the same exploit), and it could give other countries the opportunity to patch their systems proactively, increasing confidence that they will not be penetrated. Communicating zero-day exploits, however, has the obvious drawback that the exploit loses value as a weapon, because countries could patch their own systems to resist it. Thus, the cost of publication is the loss of such exploits for use in deterrence and/or future offensive cyber operations. U.S. policy has recently begun to address the question of which zero-day exploits known to the government should be published, both to enhance national security and to instill confidence by others. The project analyzes various costs and benefits of publishing exploits or patches, and studies how the costs might be mitigated whether through policy or technical means. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a new collaboration, computer scientist, Stephanie Forrest, and political scientist, Robert Axelrod, are developing integrated approaches to the rapidly expanding problem of cyber conflict, combining historical analysis, technical research, strategic analysis, and computational modeling.  This project focuses on three areas where U.S.  policy could provide additional leadership in cyberspace: publication of zero-day exploits; labeling of neutral infrastructure, such as networks associated with hospitals or religious sites, and shared norms to protect neutral cyberspaces; and sustainment of Internet interoperability, which allows Internet users on different networks to communicate directly without interference. The  findings may benefit national security by giving policymakers a way of assessing the costs and benefits of publishing exploits or patches. This project injects a fresh and timely voice into debates about the cyberagenda, suggesting concrete measures for minimizing the likelihood and impacts of conflict among state actors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal is to reduce the risk of cyber conflict, including among both state and non-state actors. We are incorporating social, economic, organizational, and political considerations, which are often pursued in isolation from technical reality.  We focused on the problem of attribution of cyberattacks, where the target typically faces a strategic choice based on both its ability to attribute the attack to a specific perpetrator and whether it has an appropriate punishment. We developed a game theory model, called The Blame Game, that captures the interplay between the technical ability to trace back an attack to its orgin and broader strategic concerns. In our model, the best strategic choice for the victim depends on the vulnerability of the attacker, the knowledgabilty of the victim, as well as the payoffs for different outcomes, and Bayesian priors of each player about the other player. The resulting Blame Game allows analysis of four policy relevant questions: the conditions under which cooperation (i.e. no attacks) is stable, when attacks are tolerated, the consequences of asymmetric capabilities for technical attribution, and when a third part or an accident can undermine cooperation. In addition to developing the game, and conducting the analysis, we investigated relevant historical examples to illustrate the theory in the context of not only cyber conflict, but also kinetic conflict, and crisis management. The historical examples involve the United States, Russia, China, Japan, North Korea, Estonia, Israel, Iran, and Syria.  We identified four aspects of cyber attribution that complicate the attribution problem. (1) Technology isn't politics, (2) Attribution can be spoofed, (3) Incentive to exaggerate and (4) Lack of appropriate response.  Key outcomes or Other achievements: Published paper in PNAS describing the Blame Game and its analysis.        Last Modified: 12/11/2017       Submitted by: Robert Axelrod]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
