<AbstractNarration>Support is provided for the American Chemical Society Symposium on Advancing the Chemical Sciences Through Diversity in Participation through the Division of Chemistry (CHE), the Division of Materials Research (DMR), the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET), and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA). This symposium is to be held at 248th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, San Francisco, CA, August 10-14, 2014. It is being held in conjunction with the Award Symposium for the ACS Award for Encouraging Disadvantaged Students into Careers in the Chemical Sciences Honoring 2014 Award Recipient Professor Rigoberto Hernandez. The primary sponsor of this symposium is the American Chemical Society Committee on Minority Affairs and the symposium is co-sponsored by the ACS Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Board, the ACS Division of Analytical Chemistry, the ACS Division of Chemical Education, the ACS Division of Computers in Chemistry, the ACS Division of Physical Chemistry, the ACS Division of Polymeric Materials: Science &amp; Engineering, the ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry, the Chemist with Disabilities Committee, the Women Chemists Committee, the Young Chemists Committee, and the International Activities Committee. The featured speakers at this symposium come from Chemistry, Chemical Engineering,Psychology and the Research Corporation for Scientific Advancement. These speakers will report scholarly studies on factors influencing careers in the STEM workforce and STEM education and will share personal experiences related to both the intellectual merit of science and broader impacts. The symposium program committee consists of Drs. Larry Dalton (University of Washington), Robert Lichter (Merrimack, LLC; formerly Director of the Dreyfus Foundation), and Charles Liotta (Georgia Institute of Technology).</AbstractNarration>
