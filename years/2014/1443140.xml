<AbstractNarration>A series of laboratory and modeling studies will be conducted to study the process of new particle formation and growth (NPFG) in the atmosphere. This research will benefit society through improved air quality and climate modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory studies will focus on the reactions of methanesulfonic (MSA) acid with amines in the presence of water, a mechanism that has been shown to form new particles very efficiently. Once particles form, their growth is limited despite the presence of excess water vapor and either MSA or amine, suggesting that the growth of the seed nuclei in air requires the uptake of other organic species. Organic compounds with different structures and functional groups that are representative of atmospheric species have been carefully selected for the experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objectives are: (1) to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms and kinetics of NPFG from the reactions of gas phase acids, amines, water vapor, and a suite of representative atmospheric organic compounds; and (2) to develop a parameterization of these processes that accurately describes NPFG in complex mixtures that is appropriate for use in atmospheric models. The NPFG parameterization developed through this project will be incorporated into a regional air quality model and used to assess the impacts of new particle formation on a regional scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the research were to elucidate the mechanisms of new particle formation from the reactions of gas phase biogenically emitted precursors, and to explore the implications as fossil-fuel sulfur emissions decrease.  This is important because particles reduce visibility, lead to significant health impacts that include enhanced mortality, and are intimately involved in climate change.  When initially formed, particles consist of small clusters of relatively few molecules, and they then grow to sizes that they impact visibility, human health and serve as nuclei for the formation of liquid and ice clouds. This affects cloud properties such as light scattering and lifetimes, and hence climate.  Understanding the earliest stages of particle formation is the foundation for ultimately predicting their sizes and chemical composition in the atmosphere and hence quantifying their impacts.  This project involved experimental laboratory studies of the reactions of methanesulfonic acid (MSA) with amines as a source of new particles in air.  MSA is formed when biogenically produced organosulfur compounds such as dimethyl sulfide are oxidized in air.  These organosulfur compounds are responsible for the "rotten egg" odor in swamps and along some oceanic coastal areas.  This chemistry also generates sulfur dioxide, which forms sulfuric acid and sulfate particles in air.  However, the major source of sulfur dioxide is the combustion of sulfur-containing fossil fuels, which has been decreasing world-wide.  At some point, the anthropogenic source of particles will approach zero.  Understanding what is left to form particles at that point is very important, and this is where MSA-amines will play an important role.  Our studies explored the molecular basis for this chemistry.  Important laboratory results include (1) the finding that water was important for new particle formation in many cases; (2) different amines have dramatically different particle-forming abilities; (3) even very small amounts of ammonia greatly enhanced particle formation for some amines; and (4) the role of water and ammonia could be understood from the cluster structures predicted from quantum chemical calculations.  Using the experimental results, combined with measurements in air of the organosulfur compounds and amines, we showed that in Southern California that particles from organosulfur compounds are currently responsible for about 1% of new particle formation.  When fossil-fuel sulfur emissions (mainly from the ports) are removed, particle concentrations in air will fall by factor of about 100, and MSA will be a major contributor.  This project has provided important data on important atmospheric reactions and what the future holds as air pollution controls are effective.  These results are central to determining optimal air pollution control strategies to address particle impacts on human health, climate and visibility.  It has also provided training to many graduate students, undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows, the majority of whom belong to underrepresented groups in science, particularly women.
