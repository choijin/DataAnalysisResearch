<AbstractNarration>Integrating computer science into the high school curriculum can enhance the preparation of students interested in a broad range of careers. To accomplish this goal, it is essential that high school teachers be well prepared to teach their students and have effective tools and resources available for instruction. In this project the collaborative team, from Georgia Tech and Luther College, will adapt their existing Computer Science Principles eBook for high school teachers to become a general purpose Computer Science Principles (CSP) eBook for students. They will compare the usability of the eBook on the different populations and compare learning outcomes of students who learn at a distance to those who use the eBook in a face to face environment. Their general research question is: What can be learned about CS in a low-cognitive load, principles-based eBook format?  The long term impact of this work is to create a new model for online learning that helps adults complete computer science learning and also helps traditional students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ebook incorporates findings from educational psychology such as worked examples, multiple modality presentations, low cognitive load exercises, social supports from small group activities, and frequent testing interleaved with examples. The eBook utilizes contextualized approaches which have been successful in engaging and retaining female and under-represented minority students. The project team will conduct two studies:  Study #1: CSP face-to-face class vs eBook:  The project team will provide the CSP eBook to a face-to-face CSP class (both high school and undergraduate) and to a set of students interested in studying CSP on-line (most likely in rural Georgia). They will compare these students for learning outcomes. They are also interested in the drop-off in use of features within the book. When students stop engaging in the on-line materials, is that because of the materials, or is it because of the on-line course delivery mechanism?  Study #2: Teachers vs Students:  The project team is creating two eBooks for CSP content, one for teachers and one for students. By comparing these populations, they can develop a better understanding of how non-traditional and traditional students use e-books differently. They will do comparisons based on content knowledge (using a new validated measure they will develop as part of the project) and usability (do teachers and students use different features, or at different rates?).  They will also use interviews and surveys to understand differences in motivations to use and complete the eBook.</AbstractNarration>

An ebook for AP CSP high school teachers, with the same content plus solution and pedagogical content knowledge, such as how to teach concepts and common student misconceptions.  An ebook to support students reviewing for the AP Computer Science Level A examination (in Java).
