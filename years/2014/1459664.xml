<AbstractNarration>Melting occurs beneath the plate tectonic boundary zones as well as volcanic hotspots, such as Hawaii and Iceland. The physical and chemical interactions between the migrating melt and the surrounding rock determine how planets evolve over time. However, the means by which melt formed deep in the Earth migrates upward to the surface to either erupt or cool slowly in a crustal magma chamber are not well understood. Geologists want to know how bulk planetary composition evolves to produce crustal rocks that have fundamentally different mineralogy than the underlying mantle rock. Such information underpins knowledge about the extent of chemical exchange between the Earth's interior and surface. This study will feature an early career scientist working with established experts to implement new laboratory techniques that, for the first, should produce results that can be related to the inaccessible natural system. As the experimental procedures are honed, new undergraduate lab exercises will be developed. They will employ glass beads and salt and introduce students to techniques that make is possible to investigate complex processes where there are feedbacks between the physics and chemistry of the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melt extraction affects much of the chemical exchange between mantle, crust and the atmosphere. Geochemical, geophysical and geological evidence suggests that, at some stage of melt extraction, melt must segregate into high permeability channels. These channels must be isolated enough to preserve chemical disequilibrium and permeable enough to allow fast melt extraction in order to preserve radiogenic disequilibrium. In nature, melt segregation is inferred to occur due to an interplay between reaction and deformation. Experimental investigations provide key insights into the processes occurring during melt migration and motivate further theoretical developments. A recently developed experimental methodology has reproduced the reaction infiltration instability. Since the gradient in pore pressure can be controlled in these experiments, it is possible to independently control melt velocity and melt-solid reactivity. Thus, the evolution of permeability with time can be explored as the reaction modifies the rock microstructure, the increase in melt flux due to channelization can be quantified, and melt migration regimes can be documented as a function of physical and chemical driving forces. A first set of experiments will be conducted on dual composition samples of olivine with clinopyroxene, and with orthopyroxene at high temperature and pressure. A second set will combine olivine with both pyroxenes in a single sample. This study will also develop new methods for analyzing the resulting microstructures and test/refine parameters that allow for scaling of laboratory data to natural environments.</AbstractNarration>

Geochemical, geophysical and geological evidence indicates that, at some stage of the melt extraction process, melt must segregate into high permeability channels.  These channels are necessary to isolate the melt enough to preserve chemical disequilibrium with the surrounding rock and permeable enough to allow fast melt extraction in order to preserve the observed radiogenic disequilibrium.  In nature, rapid melt segregation is inferred to occur due to chemical reaction between the migrating melt and the host rock that results in melt-rich, finger-like pathways along which melt is transported quickly.  In this collaborative research project, we developed an experimental methodology to reproduce such finger-like reaction infiltration instabilities.  Such experimental investigations provide key insights into the processes occurring during melt migration and motivate further theoretical developments.  With our newly developed experimental design, a pressure gradient is applied to a sample composed of three parts ? a reactive melt source, a mantle rock, and a melt sink.  Since the gradient in pore pressure and the composition of the mantle rock can be controlled in these experiments, it is possible to independently control melt velocity and melt-solid reactivity.  Thus, the evolution of permeability with time has been explored as the reaction modifies the rock microstructure.  In addition, the increase in melt flux due to channelization has been quantified, and melt migration regimes have been documented as a function of physical and chemical driving forces.  In our experiments, three rock compositions (mineralogies) were investigated at high temperature and pressure - olivine with clinopyroxene, olivine with orthopyroxene, and olivine with both pyroxene phases. Furthermore, we modulated the permeability of the partially-molten rocks by adding either 0, 4, 10 or 20 vol% of basaltic melt.  To visualize in three dimensions the distribution of melt channels that extended through the sample from the melt source to the melt sink, we developed an x-ray computed tomography method in which a small amount of a heavy element such as ytterbium or</span><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;"> praseodymium </span><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">was added to the melt.  In all experiments, irrespective of the exact mineralogy and added melt fraction, a planar reaction layer composed of olivine + melt developed in which all of the pyroxene was consumed.  The melt fraction in this layer depended on the pyroxene fraction in the rock and the pyroxene type; dissolution of clinopyroxene led to more melt in the reaction layer than did dissolution of orthopyroxene.  In samples composed of olivine plus a single pyroxene phase with any melt fraction added, melt-rich finger-like channels (reaction infiltration instabilities) formed pervasively throughout the sample, while in samples composed of olivine plus two pyroxene phases with no melt fraction added, planar rather than tubular channels developed.  In both cases, channelization effectively isolated the melt from the melt-free portions of the rock.  Both types of channels resulted in very efficient extraction of melt from the reservoir.  In summary, the experiments provide a unique and rich set of benchmarks for modelers and theorists to analyze: open system design, controlled melt pressure gradients, a range of initial permeabilities and a range of degrees of reactivity produce a complex variety of structures that all bear some similarities to melt-rock reaction structures observed in natural settings. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Benjamin&nbsp;K&nbsp;Holtzman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1459664/1459664_10388575_1580581838447_reactioninfiltrationinstabilities--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1459664/1459664_10388575_1580581838447_reactioninfiltrationinstabilities--rgov-800width.jpg" title="X-ray CT image of melt channels"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1459664/1459664_10388575_1580581838447_reactioninfiltrationinstabilities--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="X-ray CT image of melt channels"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: X-ray computed tomographic reconstruction of a rock composed of olivine plus pyroxene infiltrated with apraseodymium-doped melt.
