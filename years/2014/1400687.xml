<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Education Program, the project addresses the national need for technicians in established and emerging advanced technological fields.  Aligned with the state's strategic vision for community colleges, Science Foundation of Arizona (SFAz) and eight rural community colleges will establish a Rural Community College STEM Network to enhance institutional partnerships; facilitate the adaptation, implementation, and testing of the STEM Pathway Model, a suite of effective curricular and student support activities; and accelerate the delivery and implementation of the model.  The project's objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of expanding and replicating key success factors of the STEM Pathway Model that have been piloted at one of the community colleges.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A partnership composed of members representing industry, the secondary and post-secondary education communities, and state organizations will direct the effort, which will meet the technical and engineering oriented workforce needs of the state.  The project will (1) expand awareness of STEM careers through student engagement; (2) ensure that high school students in rural school districts place in college-level mathematics courses and graduate from high school with college credits (ensuring college readiness); and (3) increase the number of students who enter and successfully complete STEM technician and engineering degree or credentialing programs at these rural community colleges, transfer to four year technical or engineering programs, and/or enter the STEM workforce.  Project deliverables will include a technology-based resource guide and information platform that will assist the participating colleges in identifying and deploying best and promising practices (e.g., suite of effective curricular and student support activities), build a network of rural community colleges to support deployment of these practices, develop comprehensive pathways from awareness of careers in STEM to completion of degrees and/or credentials, and prepare students to enter the STEM workforce.  Implementing a common suite of methods from document analysis of student records and surveys to interviews and focus groups, the  quantitative and qualitative mixed methods evaluation will assess project outcomes (e.g., college credits earned in high school, enrollment in technician progams and completion data, student experiences, and success of the SFAz+8 network). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participating rural community colleges are:&lt;br/&gt;* Arizona Western College&lt;br/&gt;* Central Arizona College&lt;br/&gt;* Cochise College&lt;br/&gt;* Coconino Community College&lt;br/&gt;* Eastern Arizona College&lt;br/&gt;* Mohave Community College&lt;br/&gt;* Northland Pioneer College&lt;br/&gt;* Yavapai College</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Across Arizona?s rural community colleges, administrators and faculty have been convening as a Rural Community College STEM Collaborative (SFAz+8) to develop and deliver programs for their STEM Pathways initiatives, increasing the number of rural students pursuing STEM in support of the local and state workforce pipeline. The collaborative of eight rural Arizona community colleges was facilitated by Science Foundation Arizona (SFAz), a non-profit 501(3)(c) whose charter includes K-Career STEM education and a team with focus on Community College STEM Pathways. At the onset of this program, funded by NSF in Fall 2014, all eight colleges were awarded a 3-yr grant totaling on average $75K per college.  Participating rural colleges included Arizona Western College (AWC), Central Arizona College (CAC), Cochise College (CC), Coconino Community College (CCC), Eastern Arizona College (EAC), Mohave Community College (MCC), Northland Pioneer College (NPC), and Yavapai College (YC). The collaborative convened regularly to share knowledge and discuss STEM Pathway gaps, outcomes, and best practices.  The SFAz+8 vision was to accelerate development and delivery of key STEM Pathway programs and activities through regular convenings and, with developing trust and recognizing common challenges, through sharing of ideas, resources and best practices.  Metrics-driven outcomes informed discussions and decisions to better prepare students with STEM certifications and degrees that support local and state workforce demands.  The SFAz+8 program achieved its three goals:  Establish and strengthen the Rural Arizona Community      College STEM Collaborative:  Through      regular, facilitated meetings a bond and a trust was established among the      deans and vice presidents representing the rural colleges that led to      sharing of resources, faculty, ideas and what were identified as common      challenges.  As a result, a unified focus developed around addressing      math as a common barrier to technicians completing their programs. Assist participating rural colleges in building their      STEM Pathway programs: A      number of programs were implemented, including outreach programs that in      three years across all the colleges impacted 28,000 students through      summer camps, Kids College, STEM clubs, community science festivals, and      engineering events; 1300 teachers and faculty through Professional      Development programs and Professional Learning Councils; 530 student      interns; 230 high school students enrolled in a CTE-focused AAS      Engineering program; 1530 students in AS Engineering programs, 7,000      students enrolled in CIP Codes 11, 14, 15 Computer and Information      Science, Engineering, and Engineering Technology AAS programs (630      completing); and 4,000 students enrolled in the certification pathway for      these programs (870 completing).  With tracking metrics in place, these      programs will continue to be improved and the recruitment and retention      efforts for these programs will be further enhanced. Increase the pipeline of rural students pursuing STEM      degrees to meet local workforce needs:       Metrics data were defined and collected by all the colleges and aggregated      to report STEM student recruitment and completion trends informing      colleges on how they performed individually and collectively and where      there were gaps and opportunities for ongoing improvement.   Collecting and analyzing data improved over the course of the 4-yr program and became a significant component of the Collaborative in better understanding their individual and collective situations.  Notably, improvements in data tracking were made for Hispanic, Native American and Female participation in three areas: (1) K-12 Outreach programs, (2) secondary students enrolled in early college programs, and (3) college students enrolled in associate and certificate programs. Hispanic participation in outreach programs increased from 4% to 13% (375 to 1063 students) of total outreach enrollment where it stayed consistent with the other two areas also at 10-13%.
