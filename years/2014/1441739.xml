<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) holds National Conferences that bring representatives from all EPSCoR jurisdictions together to discuss strategies to promote EPSCoR goals of building STEM research and education capacity to increase their national competitiveness. This biennial event is a forum for EPSCoR project directors and participants to discuss opportunities and challenges at the local, state, national, and international levels and how EPSCoR efforts can collectively contribute to the advancement of science and engineering research and education.  This meeting also showcases results from projects funded by NSF EPSCoR. The 24th National EPSCoR Conference will be held in Portsmouth, New Hampshire from November 1-4, 2015 and is expected to have about 300-400 attendees. This meeting is co-organized by New Hampshire and Maine EPSCoR with a focus on building strong collaborations and effective communications skills.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;The theme for the 24th National EPSCoR Conference is ?Collaboration: Advancing the Role of Science in the Service of Society.? The conference aims to identify effective collaboration strategies and advance the following objectives: showcase collaborative efforts in EPSCoR jurisdictions and their societal contributions; explore ways to build collaborations based on EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) projects? research themes; promote collaboration across universities and K-12 schools in EPSCoR jurisdictions to strengthen the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce continuum; build capacity among faculty, staff, students and statewide EPSCoR committees to better understand and communicate the value of research and its broader impacts to diverse audiences.  This conference will help build a strong, collaborative EPSCoR community that contributes significantly and competes well on the national arena in alignment with NSF EPSCoR goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference activities are aligned with the objectives and consist of plenary and break-out sessions.  A student poster session will run through two days of the meeting and will highlight results from the research and education facilitated by NSF EPSCoR RII awards. Unique components that will be experimented at this meeting are:  a pre-conference workshop to discuss strategies and tools for strong collaborative efforts and how to assess their success; communications workshops facilitated by Alan Alda School of Science Communication at Stoney Brook University to learn about strategies to effectively disseminate EPSCoR activities and impacts to broad range of stakeholders; science caf√©s on topics related to the power of collaboration; and an applied theater event on gender and racial biases in faculty hiring process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The  24th National EPSCoR conference, entitled "Collaboration: Advancing the Role of Science in the Service of Society" was jointly hosted by the New Hampshire and Maine EPSCoR programs in Portsmouth, NH, in November 2015.  The conference focus was to increase knowledge flow across EPSCoR institutions and build capacity for collaborative STEM research to deliver on its commitment to meet societal needs.  It was attended by 333 people.  The conference objectives were:  Showcase the broad societal contributions that EPSCoR programs make to their respective jurisdictions and the nation with a key focus on the role of collaborative efforts; Share knowledge and build collaboration within and across core EPSCoR scientific research themes; Enhance effective collaboration within and across EPSCoR jurisdictions and beyond; Advance EPSCoR programs? ability to engage in effective interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration; Promote collaboration across the workforce continuum; and Build capacity among faculty, staff, students and Statewide Committees to better understand and communicate the value of research and its broader impacts to a range of audiences, including legislators.      The conference highlighted the centrality of collaboration to EPSCoR, spawned new collaborations, and developed individual, organizational and institutional capacity and skills to collaborate effectively. Given its importance in advancing collaboration, the role of communication in building and sustaining effective partnerships was also highlighted.  Feedback from participants about the quality of the conference was overwhelmingly positive and the conference objectives were accomplished.  During the following year, a workshop was held and a study of conference outcomes was conducted to develop a comprehensive understanding of the impact of conference participation on collaboration, and to describe and share lessons learned and best practices for supporting the implementation of collaborative project ideas generated through conference activities.  Intellectual Merit  Advancing research and education to serve societal needs depends on the ability of academic institutions to collaborate and communicate effectively with each other, with government, and with the private sector. The conference program offered skill-building activities in engaged dialog and collaborative problem solving to empower attendees in creating plans for continued collaboration across jurisdictions.  The conference introduced developmental evaluation to assess the collaborative readiness of individuals and teams, providing EPSCoR jurisdictions the tools needed to develop teams and maximize their intellectual and societal impact.  A study of conference outcomes found that interpersonal dynamics are critical to successful collaboration. Results show that investing time early in the research process helps to create shared expectations and build trust among scientists. These ideas have important consequences for successfully negotiating disciplinary and institutional boundaries in collaborative science. Researchers with interdisciplinary interests can strengthen integration within collaborative research. These findings suggest that expanding networks and increasing exposure to other disciplines may have long-term impacts on collaborative science and the complex topics it addresses.  Broader Impacts  Given EPSCoR?s mission to advance all aspects of broader impacts, the purpose of the conference was to strengthen collective capacity to advance discovery; broaden the participation of underrepresented groups via partnerships and collaboration; enhance networks and partnerships; disseminate results more effectively to diverse audiences; and deliver and communicate significant benefits to society.  A study of conference outcomes suggested that future conference programs focus on integrating disciplines, building capacity during the publishing process, and recruiting collaborators. Since conferences attract attendees from diverse fields, institutions, jurisdictions, and career stages, they can greatly enrich the discourse around how to do collaborative science.
