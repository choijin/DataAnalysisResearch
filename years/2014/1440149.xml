<AbstractNarration>This award provides support from the US Global Change Research Program for the Secretariat operations of the global change SysTem for Analysis, Research, and Training (START). This organization is an essential component of the US Global Change Research Program strategic plan as it relates to international engagement. START?s mission "to increase opportunities for research, education and training that strengthen scientific capacities in developing countries to understand, communicate and motivate action on critical global change challenges" addresses all of the US Global Change Research Program strategic goals. The funding will enable START Secretariat to continue developing and implementing programs that advance ?research-driven capacity building? in Africa and Asia. This approach emphasizes experiential learning by doing, particularly for early-career scientists, in which targeted skill building and networking opportunities are integrated into research on regional impacts and risks stemming from global change. START?s work focuses on critical challenges at the intersection of global/climate change and sustainable development, including disaster risk reduction, land-use/land-cover change, biodiversity conservation, urban development, human health, water resources management, and agriculture and food security.</AbstractNarration>

Season two is in production and will launch in May 2021.</p> <p>A select few collaborative projects that START developed or contributed to include:</p> <p><em>Fellowships:</em> START initiated the PARR fellowship program on disaster risk reduction in Asia. The PARR fellowship provided a unique experience for early-career researchers and practitioners who were exposed to a range of DRR approaches encompassing state-of-the-art disaster reduction technologies through to grassroots community based DRR. The fellowship emphasized active mentorship, cross-learning between fellows, to capitalize on the fellows' diverse backgrounds, and seed funding to put new knowledge and skills into action at their home institutions. The program strengthened regional capacities for adaptation and disaster risk reduction that are key for implementing the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework and the 2030 SDGs.<strong> </strong></p> <p><em>Research/assessment skills</em>: START offered an array of research and assessment opportunities in Africa and Asia. START's two major efforts in Africa (ASSAR and FRACTAL) were conducted through large consortia initiatives featuring universities, research institutes, and NGOs. The expertise that START brought to these consortia significantly increased their respective capacity development outcomes. START developed competitive grant opportunities within the ASSAR research program to increase the quantity and quality of post-graduate level independent research and to allow early-career researchers to strengthen their scientific skills and professional networks through exposure to parallel research efforts elsewhere in Africa as well as in India. With FRACTAL, START developed a grants program to increase scientific exchange across nine Southern African cities and to increase the salience and depth of research within the nine cities. We also initiated an assessment to advance knowledge of green energy transformation in West Africa (PROGREEN project). Pulling from our vast experience in designing integrated and actionable assessments, these assessment teams feature a mix of university researchers, private sector actors, and experts from government renewable energy agencies.</p> <p><em>Transdisciplinary research skills</em>: START has significantly increased its promotion of transdisciplinary research (TDR) skill development and network building. More broadly, we deliberately design our programs to increase exposure to integrated learning across research and actions domains. Examples of that effort includes the PARR fellowship, Belomont Forum training, the PROGREEN assessment effort in West Africa and the FRACTAL program in Southern Africa.</p> <p><em>Advanced Institutes</em>: Advanced Institutes provide one-to-two-week intensive learning opportunities that bring together early- to mid-career scientists and practitioners from a specific region or thematic expertise. These training events are facilitated by regional and global experts and include educational modules, hands-on and interactive exercises, and field visits that enhance participants' understanding, skills and resources to design, organize and carry out global change related studies. START offers follow-on grants to participants that enable them to apply newly acquired knowledge to address a research or communications need at their home institutions. We deployed this approach to increase skills and knowledge related to urban disaster risk reduction in Asia through our partnership with IRDR International Centre of Excellence, Taipei.</p> <p><em>Science communication skills</em>: START strongly believes that science communication skills, in addition to informing action, are essential for building science leadership and advancing research careers. START's programs have reflected the need for communication approaches that reach broader audiences who can advocate for change. For example:</p> <ul> <li>In the PARR program, fellows      participated in a series of professional development webinars, where they      learned how to communicate science to non-technical audiences, draft      compelling blog posts, and engage stakeholders in the research process.      (<a href="https://start.org/prosus1">START      Prosus magazine, issue 1</a>.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>In the ASSAR project, diverse      communication tools including radio programs, videos, blogs, infographics      and toolkits were developed to inform broader audiences of research      results and learning than could be reached with academic publications and      reports alone. (<a href="https://start.org/prosus2">START Prosus magazine, issue 2</a>.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>In the FRACTAL project, several      written and non-written communication products were encouraged and      produced. These included blogs, think pieces, webinars, online and      magazine articles, videos, policy briefs, infographics, radio and      television interviews, and oral and poster presentations at conferences.&nbsp; (<a href="https://start.org/prosus3">START      Prosus magazine, issue 3</a>.)&nbsp;</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Video was an important tool to      reach communities and decision makers in the <a href="http://saferworld.in/project/cdkn-start/">South      Asia DRR/CCA project</a>.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/19/2021<br>      Modified by: Jon&nbsp;Padgham</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
