<AbstractNarration>Overview&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the understanding of the plasma physics of Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion sources and the complex beam transport involved in the extraction of particles from ECR ion source plasmas. ECR is a phenomenon observed in plasma physics, condensed matter physics and accelerator physics. The cyclotron is an electron particle accelerator that uses an oscillating electric field tuned to a resonance frequency of the electrons moving in a magnetic field. This resonance adds kinetic energy to the electron. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECR ion source development is a cross disciplinary research field that combines plasma physics, atomic physics, accelerator physics, magnet technology, and accelerator engineering. ECR ion sources are superior injectors for heavy ion facilities because of their versatility and reliability. Higher charge state ions allow making accelerators more compact and cost effective, which has been a major motivator for ECR ion source research. To fulfill the intensity requirements of future heavy ion facilities, the technology needs to be extended to the next level. Based on previous experience, the next technology leap will be a demanding research and development intensive task. To take advantage of the higher plasma density, new ion beam extraction systems must be developed which allow one to extract high quality ion beams from the high magnetic field. This award addresses some of the fundamental physics questions and technical challenges that need to be answered to facilitate this technology leap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This award will extend the understanding of the plasma physics of ECR ion sources and the complex beam transport of beams extracted from ECR ion source plasmas. The experimentally measured plasma properties will be combined with ion beam transport experiments to develop a realistic model of the extracted multispecies ion beam. The research will advance beam transport simulation tools by modeling the interaction of the beam with the residual gas in the beam line. This will allow the design and optimization of the beam transport line for ECR ion source injectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;ECR ion sources are state-of-the-art injector systems for heavy ion accelerators, carbon therapy accelerators and industrial applications. Thus the expertise gained through this award will be not only of academic interest, but will contribute to the development of a highly sought-after workforce for research facilities and industry alike through the training of undergraduate and graduate students in this field. The ECR ion sources at Michigan State University provide an ideal, hands-on educational experience for students and postdocs and will provide an opportunity to develop advanced simulation tools.</AbstractNarration>
