<AbstractNarration>A recent report by the Association for Computing Machinery estimates that by decade's end, half of all STEM jobs in the United States will be in computing. Yet, the participation of women and underrepresented groups in post-secondary computer science programs remains discouragingly and persistently low. One of the most important findings from research in computer science education is the degree to which informal experiences with computers (at many ages and in many settings) shape young people's trajectories through high school and into undergraduate degree programs. Just as early language and mathematics literacy begins at home and is reinforced throughout childhood through a variety of experiences both in school and out, for reasons of diversity and competency, formal experiences with computational literacy alone are insufficient for developing the next generation of scientists, engineers, and citizens. Thus, this CAREER program of research seeks to contribute to a conceptual and design framework to rethink computational literacy in informal environments in an effort to engage a broad and diverse audience. It builds on the concept of cultural forms to understand existing computational literacy practices across a variety of learning settings and to contribute innovative technology designs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning in these settings. This CAREER program of research seeks to understand the role of cultural forms in informal computational learning experiences and to develop a theoretically grounded approach for designing such experiences for youth. This work starts from the premise that new forms of computational literacy will be born from existing cultural forms of literacy and numeracy (i.e., for mathematical literacy there are forms like counting songs -- "10 little ducks went out to play"). Many of these forms play out in homes between parents and children, in schools between teachers and students, and in all sorts of other place between friends and siblings.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This program of study is a three-phased design and development effort focused on key research questions that include understanding (1) how cultural forms can help shape audience experiences in informal learning environments; (2) how different cultural forms interact with youth's identity-related needs and motivations; and (3) how new types of computational literacy experiences based on these forms can be created. Each phase includes inductive research that attempts to understand computational literacy as it exists in the world and a design phase guided by concrete learning objectives that address specific aspects of computational literacy. Data collection strategies will include naturalist observation, semi-structured, and in-depth interviews, and learning assessments; outcome measures will center on voluntary engagement, motivation, and persistence around the learning experiences. The contexts for research and design will be museums, homes, and afterschool programs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research builds on a decade of experience by the PI in designing and studying computational literacy experiences across a range of learning settings including museums, homes, out-of-school programs, and classrooms.  Engaging a broad and diverse audience in the future of STEM computing fields is an urgent priority of the US education system, both in schools and beyond. This project would complement substantial existing efforts to promote in-school computational literacy and, if successful, help bring about a more representative, computationally empowered citizenry. The integrated education plan supports the training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in emerging research methods at the intersection of the learning sciences, computer science, and human-computer interaction. This work will also develop publically available learning experiences potentially impacting thousands of youth. These experiences will be available in museums, on the Web, and through App stores.</AbstractNarration>

Through collaboration with strategic community partners, the work of this grant has focused on engaging women and students of color whose voices have been historically marginalized in computing fields. Over the past five years the Principal Investigator and his team at Northwestern University have designed and studied learning experiences in a variety of informal learning settings. In addition to engaging thousands of learners through publicly available websites, apps, and museum exhibits, the work of this grant has been disseminated through six peer-reviewed conference papers, two book chapters, and one journal article to date.</p> <p><strong>Museums:</strong> In the space of museums, we developed an interactive programming experience for the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California that was released to the public in 2017 as part of their Make Software: Change the World! exhibition. Our exhibit made use of an interactive touchscreen display and offered visitors a unique programming experience. Our team also collaborated with the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois to conduct research on interactive exhibit technology and its impact on family engagement and learning. In a paper published in the ACM Interaction Design and Children Conference in 2020, we compared visitor behavior around two versions of an interactive exhibit involving music and computer programming. Based on observations of 227 people in 82 visitor groups, we found significant differences between the exhibits in terms of engagement times, visitor behavior, and the ability of the exhibits to attract families with children.</p> <p><strong>Out-of-School Programs: </strong>This project also developed interactive computational literacy experience for out-of-school learning spaces such as summer camps, afterschool clubs, and festivals. Working with ten community partner organizations in the Chicago area, we launched a free, online learning platform called TunePad (<a href="https://tunepad.live">https://tunepad.live</a>) that allows learners to create music using the Python programming language. Since the grant began, the platform has been used by hundreds of students from middle school to college in a wide variety of out-of-school STEAM-focused learning experiences. We describe TunePad and its contributions to learners' attitudes, perceptions, and career interest in a paper published at the International Conference of the Learning Sciences in 2020. Our results show a significant increase from the pre- to post- responses for participants in summer camps organized around music and coding using the TunePad platform.</p> <p><strong>Homes: </strong>Finally, this project explored interactive technology to support the development computational literacy through games and apps targeted at children and families in homes. The project team contributed to the development of a commercial app called Osmo Coding (<a href="https://www.playosmo.com/en/coding/">https://www.playosmo.com/en/coding/</a>). This app uses physical coding blocks to control the action of an on-screen character. After the launch of the app, we conducted a research study involving 38 children ages 5-7 who played the game in pairs. For the purposes of the study, we also developed an entirely screen-based version of the game in an effort to understand whether the physical nature of the app contributed young children's collaboration, engagement, and learning. Our quantitative analysis of video recordings of 13 dyads using both versions of the interface revealed significant differences in levels of engagement, physical conflict, and collaborative construction. Our qualitative analyses, meanwhile, advanced the concept of "embodied collaboration" as a way to describe how children use their bodies to work together in joint learning activities. Taken together we see embodied collaboration as an important consideration for designers of informal learning environments (especially in informal learning contexts).</p> <p>In addition to research, this award contributed to the education of many graduate and undergraduate students at Northwestern University, including four PhD students who were directly supported by the grant as they obtained their doctoral degrees. One of the PhD students, Krystal Villanosa, completed her dissertation work on understanding issues of equity and diversity in museums. Her goal was to understand how museum professional view diversity in relation to their public-facing missions and to understand how diverse public audience perceive and experience museums. In total she conducted 26 interviews of museum professionals representing 14 institutions across 12 states.
