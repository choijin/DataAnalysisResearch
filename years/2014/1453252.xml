<AbstractNarration>This CAREER grant supports work on optics research to improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors and other precision optical measurements as well as using expertise in optics to organize and host a day of fun competition, the Optics Olympiad, for Washington DC high school students.  Gravitational waves come from Einstein's theory of gravity, and are one of the few specific predictions of Einstein's theory that can be experimentally checked against other theories of gravity (like Isaac Newton's).  Determining if Einstein's, Newton's, or perhaps some other theory of gravity correctly describes our universe is necessary to developing a complete understanding of the laws of nature.  This experiment is being performed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) with two large, four kilometer long detectors in Louisiana and Washington state.  Once gravitational waves are detected by LIGO, these detections will serve as another method of studying the universe, complementary but different from optical, radio, and other conventional telescopes.  With gravitational wave detections, we expect to learn more about black holes, neutron stars, supernova, the origins of the universe, and other high energy astronomical events.  Unfortunately, the effect of gravitational waves on the LIGO detectors is very small, and noise from other phenomenon can easily overwhelm the gravitational signal.  This grant supports work to better understand and reduce coating thermal noise, a critical noise source that limits our ability to detect gravitational waves.  The related education and outreach project is to pass on the excitement about optics we develop working on LIGO to high school students through a fun and educational competition, the Optics Olympiad.  In addition to individuals and teams competing on knowledge and understanding of optics, there will be panel discussions, a guest lecturer, and tours of science laboratories at American University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermal noise in the coatings of the LIGO optics is caused by mechanical loss, as shown by the Fluctuation Dissipation theorem.  We will reduce this thermal noise by developing Aluminum-Gallium-Arsenide (AlGaAs) crystals and silicon nitride for use as LIGO coatings.  AlGaAs has already shown lower thermal noise in other precision optics experiments under different conditions.  Preliminary results with AlGaAs under LIGO conditions indicate some improvement in mechanical loss compared to current coatings, but not as much as expected.  This may be due to surface conditions on the substrate, which will be explored using various chemical and mechanical surface treatments.  The effects of these treatments on AlGaAs mechanical loss will be explored using normal mode quality factor, or Q, measurements.  We will also better characterize and understand thermal noise from AlGaAs using the complete description of mechanical loss as the imaginary part of the stiffness tensor.  This may allow for ways to improve thermal noise through the layer design of the coating beyond improvements from better materials.  The Optic Olympiad will include a formative assessment to determine what elements of the Olympiad are helping to reach the goals of increasing students understanding of physics and optics as well as improving their impression of STEM careers.  Results of this assessment and the Olympiad in general will be presented to the physics education research community, likely as a journal article or conference presentation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was on the development of aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) as a low noise optical coating for precision measurement, and specifically for the LIGO gravitational wave detectors.  We found that AlGaAs is likely suitable for use in future gravitational wave detectors, provided that a way can be found to increase the size of AlGaAs coatings.  We made a good start on understanding the mechanical loss of AlGaAs, which is reponsbile for the thermal noise that is the most important source of noise from optical coatings in LIGO.  This is particularly complicated because AlGaAs is a crystal and has three separate mechanical loss values, unlike the glass-like substances that have been used for LIGO coating in the past.  This projuect also allowed us to share AlGaAs samples with LIGO colleagues to measure optical and other properties of AlGaAs to further confirm it meets all the LIGO specifications.  This grant also allowed the American University group to participate in the necessary organization and administration of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which consists of over a thousand scientists, engineers, and students from more than 125 research groups around the world.  We supported the functioning of the collaboration through internal paper and code reviews, serving as co-chair of the LIGO Academic Affairs Council, running for offices including the Optics Working Group chair and Technical Advisor to the LIGO Program Advisory Committee, and helping with LIGO outtreach to the public at events such as the USA Science and Engineering Festival and the annual Astronomy on the Mall.    This project also allowed us to begin the American University Optics Olympiad, a day of learning and fun with science for Washington DC middle school students.  We have now held the Optics Olympiad for four years running, and typically have more than 100 middle school students from 5 or more middle schools participate.  The day consistents of morning demonstrations on optics, lunch with professional scientists and engineers, then an afternoon science quiz competition resulting in trophies for the winners and gift bags for all participants.  More is available about the Optics Olympiad at www.opticsolympiad.org.  Around 20 different American University undergraduates were supported by the this grant in full time summer research and part-time work during the academic year.  Three of these undergradautes have gone on to graduate school within the LIGO Scienftic Collaboration to do further LIGO research, while others have gone on to graduate school to pursue other research and to employment in STEM fields.  Most students supported for longer term research have had the opportunity to present their work at scientific conference and to participate in writing a scientific paper and serve as an author.  This grant also allowed us to support around five high school students who participated in LIGO research.       Last Modified: 02/05/2021       Submitted by: Gregory M Harry]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
