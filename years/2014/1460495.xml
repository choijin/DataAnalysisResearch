<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016- 2017.  The scientific focus of the MDI Biological Laboratory REU Site is comparative approaches in cellular, molecular and environmental biology.  Students will engage in scientific research using diverse model systems under the close guidance of a research scientist. The students will have access to state of the art research facilities and the coastal ecological setting offered by MDI Biological Laboratory.  Students will have a wide range of opportunities for training in cutting edge interdisciplinary approaches to molecular, cellular, and environmental biology. Students will attend regularly scheduled seminars, which include instruction on responsible conduct of research, as well as symposia and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 20 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.  Students will be engaged in various outreach opportunities such as Family Science Night, a community-based event which draws hundreds of participants. These outreach experiences help to strengthen the ties between MDI Biological Laboratory and the local community. Through participation in these programs they will learn to discuss with lay audiences the broader impacts of their NSF-funded work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interested students are asked to apply online, and submit an application form, short answer/essay questions, two faculty recommendations, and a transcript. Applications are reviewed, scored, and ranked by a faculty committee. Applications are due in March, with offers made in April and May. A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://mdibl.org/education/hs-undergrad/undergraduate-applications/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Paulyn Cartwright at pcart@ku.edu ) or the co-PI (Dr. Robert Morris morris_robert@wheatoncollege.edu).</AbstractNarration>

We created a brochure, made it available on our website, and distributed it at conferences and other venues. We received an average of 119 applications per year. During this grant period, faculty mentors Jim Coffman and Dustin Updike met with faculty from small colleges in Maine to discuss research-training programs at MDI Biological Laboratory. Education Director, Jane Disney, attended the 4-day Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) in Tampa Bay in November 2016, and met and recruited students. Two students submitted applications and were awarded research fellowships in 2017 because of recruiting efforts at ABRCMS.</p> <p>Education staff at MDI Biological Laboratory received and provided initial review of student applications; each application was assigned to one of three tiers based on criteria including essays, letters of recommendation, GPA, minority status, and school type (Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI) or other). Multiple Tier 1 and Tier 2 applications were forwarded to appropriate scientific mentors, who chose 1-2 students to mentor in their labs. Where applications were comparable, mentors prioritized those from minority students and students from other groups that are under-represented in science in an effort to help diversify the next generation of scientists.</p> <p>MDI Biological Laboratory attracts and supports students from small colleges and universities, including historically black and predominantly minority-serving institutions. In the most recent funding period, 14 of 20 students (70%) were from PUIs; 12 fellowships (60%) were awarded to women. In the same period, 5 fellowships (25%) were awarded to underrepresented minorities in science. Of those, 4 were awarded to African Americans and 1 to a Hispanic student.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Orientation, Seminars, and Workshops.</span></strong> On orientation day, students met with representatives of the Administrative Departments and learned about campus policies and campus life. Afterwards, they received basic laboratory skills and safety training from our Environmental Health and Safely Officer. Later in the day, students attended a two-hour Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) workshop.</p> <p>Students attended weekly seminars offered by visiting scientists or MDI Biological Laboratory faculty and dozens of other seminars affiliated with a variety of course offerings that take place on our campus, including courses on Aging Biology, Comparative Regenerative Biology, and Bioinformatics. In all, students attended 26 seminars and &ldquo;Work-in-Progress&rdquo; talks in 2016 and 20 in 2017.</p> <p>&nbsp;Students attended a weekly hour-long Scientific Communications Course that improved their skills in presenting scientific data to a variety of audiences. Professional seminars provided points of discussion, as the students typically spent the beginning of each class analyzing seminars they had attended during the week.</p> <p>Students participated in a 4-hour Bioethics Workshop to further their RCR training. They also participated in a 12-hour Bioentrepreneurship Workshop, learning about the &ldquo;business of science&rdquo;.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community Outreach.</span></strong> REU students designed a display and hands-on activity for Family Science Night, an annual public program to engage children and families in the discovery process. REU students were involved in promoting the event through local television and radio stations. Over 200 people attended per year throughout the last grant period.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Activities.</span></strong> Each REU student spent 10 weeks working in the laboratory on an independent project under the personal direction of his or her mentor. Daily research activities included reading scientific literature, designing and conducting experiments, and collecting, compiling, and analyzing experimental data. Students received training in research techniques and laboratory best practices, use of research equipment, and other essential research skills. Vital to the research activities were the ongoing informal discussions with the mentor and the mentor&rsquo;s lab group regarding research progress. Students assessed the research experience using an existing survey and the SALG assessment.</p> <p>Ninety percent of students (18/20) indicated increased confidence in doing research as a result of their REU experience. Ninety-five percent of students (19/20) expressed an increase in their understanding of what everyday research is like. Ninety-percent of students (18/20) increased their ability to explain their project to people outside of their field. Comments from students about the 2016-2017 NSF REU program included: &ldquo;I began to understand exactly what went into conducting a research project. I developed the self-discipline and passion to work as hard as I could on a project I cared about.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Presentations and Publications</span></strong>. In 2004, MDI Biological Laboratory established an annual Summer Student Symposium. During the most recent grant period (2016-2017); twelve students gave oral presentations and 8 students presented posters. Students also presented their REU work at outside events, including the Montana Academy of Sciences Symposium and the National CUR REU Symposium. Students also prepared final research papers. Ten REU students from past years were authors and co-authors of 8 scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals between 2016 and 2017, including PLoS One, Methods in Cell Biology and PNAS.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/14/2017<br>      Modified by: Paulyn&nbsp;Cartwright</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1460495/1460495_10380856_1505364117866_REUstudentStephanJackson2017--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1460495/1460495_10380856_1505364117866_REUstudentStephanJackson2017--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU student Stephan Jackson 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1460495/1460495_10380856_1505364117866_REUstudentStephanJackson2017--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU student Stephan Jackson 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU student Stephan Jackson in Dr. Vicki Losick's Lab at MDI Biological Laboratory.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rogier van Bakel</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paulyn&nbsp;Cartwright</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU student Stephan Jackson 2017</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1460495/1460495_10380856_1505363513581_REUPosterImage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1460495/1460495_10380856_1505363513581_REUPosterImage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU poster for PI meeting March 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1460495/1460495_10380856_1505363513581_REUPosterImage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU poster for PI meeting March 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Poster depicting overview of 23 years of the REU program at MDI Biological Laboratory</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anna Farrell</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paulyn&nbsp;Cartwright</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU poster for PI meeting March 2017</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1460495/1460495_10380856_1505363937771_REUstudentSarahKing2017--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1460495/1460495_10380856_1505363937771_REUstudentSarahKing2017--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU student Sarah King 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1460495/1460495_10380856_1505363937771_REUstudentSarahKing2017--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU student Sarah King 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU student Sarah King at work on the MDI Biological Laboratory campus.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rogier van Bakel</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paulyn&nbsp;Cartwright</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU student Sarah King 2017</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
