<AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for 29th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to the 29th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS). The conference will be held in Hyderabad, India, in May 2015. IPDPS is an international forum for engineers and scientists to present their latest research findings in all aspects of parallel computation. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.</AbstractNarration>
