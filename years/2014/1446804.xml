<AbstractNarration>The evolution of manufacturing systems from loose collections of cyber and physical components into true cyber-physical systems has expanded the opportunities for cyber-attacks against manufacturing. To ensure the continued production of high-quality parts in this new environment requires the development of novel security tools that transcend both the cyber and physical worlds. Potential cyber-attacks can cause undetectable changes in a manufacturing system that can adversely affect the product's design intent, performance, quality, or perceived quality. The result of this could be financially devastating by delaying a product's launch, ruining equipment, increasing warranty costs, or losing customer trust. More importantly, these attacks pose a risk to human safety, as operators and consumers could be using faulty equipment/products. New methods for detecting and diagnosing cyber-physical attacks will be studied and evaluated through our established industrial partners. The expected results of this project will contribute significantly in further securing our nation's manufacturing infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes a new vision for manufacturing cyber-security based upon modeling and understanding the correlation between cyber events that occur in a product/process development-cycle and the physical data generated during manufacturing. Specifically, the proposed research will take advantage of this correlation to characterize the relationships between cyber-attacks, process data, product quality observations, and side-channel impacts for the purpose of attack detection and diagnosis. These process characterizations will be coupled with new manufacturing specific cyber-attack taxonomies to provide a comprehensive understanding of attack surfaces for advanced manufacturing systems and their cyber-physical manifestations in manufacturing processes. This is a fundamental missing element in the manufacturing cyber-security body of knowledge. Finally, new forensic techniques, based on constraint optimization and machine learning, will be researched to differentiate process changes indicative of cyber-attacks from common variations in manufacturing due to inherent system variability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cyber-security has emerged as a critical concern in nearly every domain, including manufacturing. A variety of types of manufacturing, ranging from steel production to oil refining, have been impacted by significant cyber-attacks. A key concern in the manufacturing domain is that cyber-attacks could impact the integrity of physical parts in safety-critical systems, such as planes, cars, and medical equipment.  This research has developed techniques for 1) reasoning about attacks, 2) understanding and assessing risks, and 3) detecting attacks with side-channel (e.g., power, vibration) measurements.   An important part of improving cyber-security in manufacturing is understanding and communicating cyber-security risks. A taxonomy framework has been developed for manufacturers to understand the challenges associated with cyber-attacks in manufacturing systems.  This taxonomy allows manufacturers to model their parts, physical manufacturing processes, and cyber process elements to determine risk of vulnerabilities based on the NIST vulnerability database. The taxonomy includes modeling techniques for capturing the cyber-physical impacts of an attack, the capabilities of the quality control mechanisms for detecting these cyber-physical impacts, and the ramifications of a successful attack on the various facets of a part.   A vulnerability assessment framework was created to identify cyber-physical vulnerabilities within a manufacturing environment.

This assessment was designed and implemented within a research manufacturing facility (the Virginia Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing), as a case study; where it detected the presence of cyber-physical vulnerabilities.
