<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new analytical chemistry technique for rapid quantitation of chemicals in complex mixtures.  The life science and chemical instrumentation market is $45 billion annually.  The introduction of Quality by Design manufacturing processes has increased the need for accurate, high-speed, maintenance-free techniques for chemical analysis.  The target application for this project is the detection of residual chemical solvents and genotoxic impurities in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  The new technique to be developed uses molecular rotational resonance (MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, resulting in a method with high chemical specificity.  MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, MRR-based chemical analysis instruments can provide rapid measurements of trace levels of chemicals in a manner that is compatible with real-time manufacturing processes requiring constant measurement for quality assurance.  Chemical analysis instruments using MRR spectroscopy offer lower cost of ownership through higher measurement throughput, reduced consumables cost, and maintenance-free operation.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that solves major problems in the current set of tools available to the field.  MRR spectroscopy has the highest chemical selectivity of any spectroscopy technique and can easily distinguish molecular isomers - a challenge for techniques that rely on mass to establish the chemical identity.  Compared to other spectroscopy techniques, the method has higher spectral resolution that makes it possible to accurately analyze samples that are mixtures of many compounds (with several components at trace levels).  Unlike mass spectrometry methods, the gas mixtures can be directly analyzed without the need for prior chemical separation using gas chromatography (GC).  As a spectroscopy method, quantitative chemical analysis can be performed without the labor intensive and time-consuming process of running measurement standards.  The instrument combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach. FT-MRR spectrometers reduce the measurement time by a factor of 1000 or more over existing rotational spectroscopy techniques, making the technique competitive with other high-sensitivity chemical analysis tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the technical work for this project was to investigate the feasibility for commercializing a new technology for chemical detection that uses high frequency radio wavies (or millimeter-waves) to measure chemical fingerprints of gases.  These fingerprints are a result of the discrete end-over-end free rotation energies of molecules; referred to as high resolution molecular rotational spectroscopy in the scientific literature. The new technology behind this project (Fourier Transform Molecular Rotational Resonance, FT-MRR, spectroscopy) is highly sensitive, digitally controlled and enables a brand new detection approach for analytical chemists in the chemical industry.   The particular niche where where FT-MRR has a competetive advantage over other technology is for the simultaneous detection of low level impurities that fall into a molecular mass range of 18-120 amu and that are polar.  The first technical objective was to establish the basic performance metrics of sensitivity, accuracy, and precision for quantifying components of a prepared mixture of 10 commonly used solvents used in chemical manufacturing. Pharmaceutical companies routinely screen for these "residuals" during process design and quality control. A new FT-MRR sampling module for headspace analysis of solutions was built and tested.  After vetting the FT-MRR performance results to pharmaceutical chemists, we have concluded that FT-MRR can meet the analytical requirements.  The second technical objective was to implement a hardware design that meets the needs for scalable manufacturing and routine monitoring of a known subset of chemical impurities. This extends a product segmentation for both research grade FT-MRR instruments and routine FT-MRR analyzers.  Whereas most technologies accomplish this by sacrificing performance metrics, we have developed a technique that promises the same analytical quality across both product platforms.  The results of the technical objectives were presented and published in an SPIE 2015 proceedings.    The results of this project have served as the foundation for involving early adopters in the development of the first FT-MRR products.  We have had three top 20 pharmaceutical firms send samples for FT-MRR analysis, and have another chemical manucturer lined up to trial an FT-MRR instrument.  Once adopted and proven, FT-MRR will add new capabilities for chemical manufacturers (particularly in the pharmaceutical industry) to design more efficient and safer processes for high quality production.  Furthermore, as a brand new analytical chemistry platform, FT-MRR will provide new research opportunities in molecular structure research for chiral analysis, site-specific isotopic ratio analysis, and transient (or dynamic) processes in basic science research.
