<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling: Integrative Study of Marine Ice Sheet Stability and Subglacial Habitats in West Antarctica&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Montana State University&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 06/25/2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WISSARD (Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access and Research Drilling) Project has been awarded a two-part, multi-year grant (September 2009-August 2015). The aim of the project is to drill beneath the 1000 meter thick West Antarctic ice sheet, allowing investigation of glaciological, geological, microbiological, geochemical, and oceanographic systems, with a focus on the role of subglacial liquid water including subglacial lakes. A 2007 National Research Council (NRC) report stated "It is time for scientific research on subglacial lakes to begin".  The WISSARD project is the United States contribution to subglacial lake research.  The current award is a renewal of the earlier project, and will allow completion of one component of the work (the grounding line studies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall WISSARD project continues to study the overarching hypothesis that active water drainage connects various subglacial environments and exerts major control on ice sheet flow, geochemistry, metabolic and phylogenetic diversity, and biogeochemical transformations. Global warming, melting of ice sheets, and subsequent sea-level rise are of high societal relevance, and the WISSARD project contributes significantly to our understanding of carbon cycling and ice sheet dynamics. The technological infrastructure built as part of the project will benefit the broader science community for years to come. The project has increased student&lt;br/&gt;participation in polar research, introduced new investigators to the polar sciences,&lt;br/&gt;enriched K-12 teaching and learning programs, and reached a larger public audience through such venues as popular science magazines, museum based activities and videography and documentary films. In summary, WISSARD promotes scientific exploration of Antarctica by conveying to the public the excitement of accessing and studying what may be some of the last unexplored aquatic environments on Earth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Past studies in West Antarctica have highlighted the importance of ice sheet interactions with water, either at the basal boundary where ice streams are in contact with active subglacial hydrologic systems, or at the Grounding Zone (GZ) where the ice sheet meets the ocean. Water and wet sediments can control the rate of ice stream flow and trigger changes in flow rates over short timescales. Recent biological investigations have also shown that subglacial environments are habitable. Just as streaming ice flow is dependent on availability and dynamics of bulk subglacial water and wet sediments, subglacial microbial ecosystems rely on these physical settings to supply water, nutrients, and energy sources.      The WISSARD project used an "integrated systems" approach to one region of the ice sheet that contains an intersection of the subglacial environment, the sub-ice shelf cavity and the grounding zone itself, the northern section of Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica. We studied these environments using a combination of geophysical imaging, GPS surveying, satellite data, in-situ measurements and laboratory experiments to test the overarching hypothesis: "The dynamic glaciology, sedimentological, and biochemical processes combine to stabilize the ice shelf and control the structure and function of microorganisms inhabiting the region."       GPS data revealed cascading subglacial floods and resulting ice-velocity changes. These connected subglacial hydrology events caused two years of enhanced ice flow, with three episodic velocity fluctuations of up to nearly 4% correlated to lake drainage evolution.
