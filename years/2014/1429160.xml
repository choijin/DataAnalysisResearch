<AbstractNarration>This award is co-funded by EPSCoR program.&lt;br/&gt;This MRI project is to acquire a petascale data storage system to add to the existing high-performance computing (HPC) systems at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR). The projects concern analysis of medical images, cosmological simulations, social network analyses and protein structure prediction. A number of well-developed broadening participation activities in education and research are  proposed.&lt;br/&gt;The project augments existing high performance computing capabilities, includes projects in different disciplines to be facilitated by cyber upgrades, provides integration of research and education through training opportunities for students at all levels, and has a potential for broadening participation and development of a diverse scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
