<AbstractNarration>Currently, several aspects are missing in the current polymer or polymer composites based products. The first one is mechanical strength, which can be potentially improved by nanofillers. The second one is durability. The third one is sustainability, as replacing oil based polymers with sustainable filler produced from wood can reduce the need of using oil based products. This proposal aims at developing a new generation of high performance polymer composites with properties superior to the already existing solutions. It is going to create a very exciting opportunity of having the new generation of high performance sustainable nanofillers produced in substantial quantities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addressing the challenges related to traditional nanofillers while maintaining structural integrity of nanocomposites can be achieved by using sustainable bio-based nanofillers, such as surface modified Nano-Crystalline Cellulose (NCC). A development, optimization and commercializing of a novel process of making such materials is the basis of this proposal.  Using nanocellulose as filler can be a very promising and scalable method of producing inexpensive 'green' composites. The proposed technology can be also very cost-efficient solution, given that USDA projections point out an extraordinary opportunity for this filler as nanocrystalline cellulose applications are expected to reach $600 billion mark by 2020 in the US alone.</AbstractNarration>
