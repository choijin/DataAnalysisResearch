<AbstractNarration>The IUCRC for Electromagnetic Compatibility (CEMC) proposes renewal as a two-site I/UCRC, comprising personnel and facilities at the Missouri University of Science and Technology and the University of Houston. CEMC's industry sector requires understanding of noise physics, development of innovative measurement and modeling techniques, and formulation of design methodologies. This includes immunity and electromagnetic interference (EMI), which ensures an electronic system: (1) can function in the presence of external electromagnetic noise; and, (2) its EMI does not impact the functionality of other devices. Signal and power integrity design ensures proper circuit operation at high speeds. Phase II efforts will target development of methods for higher frequencies and smaller geometry scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design for electromagnetic compatibility is critical in electronics. Good electromagnetic compatibility design is essential to successful product development, customer satisfaction and industry competitiveness. Research outcomes from CEMC in Phase I include 31 students graduated from the center and numerous hires of students by industry members. There were over 50 publications and one spin-off company during Phase I with research results incorporated into university courses, and on-site and on-line company short courses. Research outcomes in Phase II will be disseminated through the center website, publications, technical conferences, short courses, IEEE EMC Society committee activities, spin-off companies, and industry application notes. Demonstrations suitable for motivating interest in K-12 students in technical careers are planned.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CEMC has contributed to the field of EMC in a significant way.  The member companies have been benefited with better fundamental understanding, effective solutions to mitigate and prevent EMC problems, improved engineering design flow and guidelines, as well as well-trained work force.  The field of EMC as a whole has also been impacted by the disseminated research outcomes and outreach.  EMC is no more black magic but science.  We strongly believe that the CEMC as well as the Missouri S&amp;T site, with significant development in Phases I and II, has already established the necessary expertise, infrastructure, resources and a collaborative industry/university team, and is well positioned to address the growing challenges, and help industry continue to advance technology.
