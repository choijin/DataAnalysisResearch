<AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for the CGO 2015 and PPoPP 2015 Symposia &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to two co-located conferences: the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2015) and the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2015). The symposia will be held in San Francisco, California, in February 2015. These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of compilers and parallel programming. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.</AbstractNarration>

Co-location in San Francisco, CA offered unique opportunities for U.S. students to interact with international students, senior researchers, and developers in these fields. Such interactions improved mutual understanding and created opportunities for future collaborations.   All the students who applied for the travel reimbursements attended U.S. universities. Each student submitted a cover letter stating his or her reason for attending one of the symposia, a resume, a description of his or her research interests, and a letter from the student's advisor that confirmed the student's eligibility and recommended that the student attend the symposium.  The selection process by the symposia organizing committees considered each applicantÃ†s level of participation (paper author and/or presenter), how closely the student's research interests matched areas covered by the respective symposium, and the advisor's endorsement of the student's potential for research.  Following the close of the symposia, each awarded student provided a report on his or her impressions of the symposia. These reports were overwhelmingly positive. The students reported that they gained valuable insights and contacts to further their research, and they were highly appreciative that the NSF helped to enable them to attend.
