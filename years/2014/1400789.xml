<AbstractNarration>University of California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate studies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) is the host site for the 2014-2016 (Cohort IX) BD program that supports a graduate student cohort of 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM Ph.D. students from LSAMP campuses across the nation.  The BD Activity provides extensive training in specific STEM disciplines as well as professional development and guidance that promote peer mentoring and leadership in the scientific community.  Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project strengthens the connections between existing LSAMP undergraduate programs and UCLA?s STEM graduate programs with the goal of permanently increasing the number of URMs in the pipeline leading to doctoral programs at UCLA. The activity provides a robust set of graduate student development opportunities that promote mentoring and leadership in STEM communities. The BD students are engaged in mentoring CAMP undergraduates and transfer students to increase excitement and retention in URM STEM majors at UCLA.  Linkages to the NSF Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) programming and institutional resources provides support for the participants following the two-year project support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best practices for recruitment and retention of graduate student researchers are implemented and built upon lessons learned from previous LSAMP BD host sites. The UCLA BD findings, lessons learned, and impact of the activities are disseminated through publications and presentations at national meetings, and data sharing processes with NSF-affiliated initiatives and diversity consortiums.  To date, the California Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate activity has supported 93 underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students in in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics [STEM] disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce,&lt;br/&gt;both in academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing the future&lt;br/&gt;professoriate, as well as the scientific workforce, the value added is seen in the&lt;br/&gt;visibility of minorities in science and engineering, increasing representation and&lt;br/&gt;providing role models and motivation for the next generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Description: The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity had the goal of supporting 12 under-represented PhD graduate students from LSAMP campuses across the nation.  UCLA successfully recruited 12 students and the program provided the cohort with stipends and cost-of-education funds for the first two years.  The program also offered financial support from UCLA's Graduation Division, the student's home STEM department and external fellowships to ensure support of our BD students for the duration of their doctoral programs.  The BD students benefitted from UCLA's state-of-the-art research facilities and they connected with a network of their peers and nurturing faculty.  By the end of the second year, seven students completed their quaifying exams with six passing their exams and advancing to candidacy.  One student who did not pass his exam was awarded a Master's degree.  The remaining students are completing required courses and laboratory work and will take their quailfying exams in the next year.  Intellectual Merit:  The UCLA BD Activity provided extensive training in specific STEM disciplines to 12 under-represented students, half in the physical sciences and engineering disciplines, and half in the life sciences disciplines.  The BD program was committeed to training our scholars to become leaders and equipped them with the necessary skills to be innovators in their chosen fields.  Professional development modules offered individualzed development plans (IDPs) and career-buiding oportunities to prepare the BD students for successful research-intensive careers in academia, industry, government and other sectors.  We also cultivated our students' interests in the breadth of research-related careers where their respective dsiciplines met education, entrepreneurship and policy analysis. With a vision towards our students' futures, the UCLA BD program provided comprehensive career and professional development opportunities that  empower our students to explore careers that positively impact society as a whole.  BD Scholars who successful complete a PhD will be both successful scientsts and also role models who can diversify leadership ranks.  Broader Impacts: In addition to supporting the education of 12 under-represented STEM students in PhD progrmas, this project strengthened the connections between local LSAMP programs and UCLA's STEM graduate programs with the goal of permanently increasing the number of under-represented minorities in the pipeline leading to doctoral programs at UCLA.  The UCLA BD Scholars had many opportunities to mentor other underrepresented students.  They mentored the UCLA LSAMP undergraduates, interacting with them at social events and answering their questions about graduate school.  The BD students also initiaited a crosstown collaboration with the California State University Los Angeles (CSULA) LSAMP BD Program, which supports students as they achieve a MS degree. The connection between our BD program and the UCLA and CSULA LSAMP programs allowed us to clearly delineate a pathway for these LSAMP students to reach UCLA PhD programs.  The UCLA BD cohort shared their experiences in a PhD program, and since many of them were undergraduates at UC and CSU campses, the experience was directly relevant to their audience. By giving back to their community and bridging the two campuses, the UCLA BD Activity created a stronger scientific network and also a stronger scientific community in the Los Angeles area.
