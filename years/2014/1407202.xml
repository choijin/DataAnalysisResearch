<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at North Carolina State University (NCSU) entitled, "Wearable Nanodevices, Linking Health and Environment: RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site", under the direction of Dr. Veena Misra. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Nanosystems Engineering Research Center (NERC) for Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies (ASSIST), led by NCSU's College of Engineering in partnership with three local school districts and NCSU's Kenan Fellows Program, will provide a total of 42 middle and high school STEM teachers (14 per year) with a 7-week summer engineering research experience focused on developing and employing nano-enabled energy harvesting, energy storage, nanodevices and sensors to create innovative battery-free, body-powered, and wearable systems that monitor both internal health indicators and environmental conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines exceptional research experiences in NCSU's cutting-edge facilities with professional development to build teacher content knowledge and curriculum development and pedagogical skills. The program will build on the successful experiences of the ASSIST Center and individual mentors with RET teachers and the strength of the NCSU Kenan Fellows model for teacher research experiences developed through two previously funded RET Site programs. The project design includes experiences with ASSIST research mentors and will take place in exceptional nanofabrication and analytical instrumentation facilities.  It incorporates teacher leadership development activities while also developing important pedagogical and instruction design skills.  Participating teachers will create engaging and innovative activities based on wearable nanosensors to bring back to their classrooms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASSIST is developing new technologies that will lead to a paradigm shift in health informatics by allowing doctors, patients, and scientists to correlate health indicators with environmental conditions to better predict, manage, and treat diseases.  The wearable nanodevice research in this project will be exciting for K-12 STEM teachers and their students while facilitating integration of nanoscience and systems engineering concepts into their science curricula.  This RET Site will attract underrepresented students, including minorities and females, to engineering by engaging teachers and their students in exciting research experiences linked to personal health topics and global health issues. Partner school districts serve high numbers of high needs and underrepresented in STEM students; they will ensure participation of teachers serving in some of the highest needs schools.</AbstractNarration>

Consistent with the aims of the RET in Engineering and Computer Science Program the objectives of our project are to:  Provide STEM teachers with engineering research experiences in the development of nanosystems research:  the formation of an innovative battery-free, body-powered, and wearable health monitoring nano-enabled system;  Develop long term collaborative relationships between STEM teachers and engineering faculty and research team members;  Assist STEM teachers in developing engaging curriculum modules to communicate engineering concepts to 6?12th grade students.   Activities:  A 5-week summer experience was implemented including 16 teacher participants.  Activities included professional development workshops, seminars, laboratory tours, and hands-on activities.  The primary focus of the program was on understanding and using the Engineering Design Process to design and build a wearable device to address a human or animal health issue. Teachers worked in teams to develop their prototypes and each teacher also developed two lesson plans to implement in the classroom.  Classroom implementation of the project led to the annual Wearable Device Challenge (WDC), an engineering design competition for middle and high school students.  RET participants applied lessons learned from the summer program to teach the content in their classroom and engage students in designing and building wearable devices.    Major Results (Intellectual Merit):  Website was updated to house lesson plans developed by participants: https://assist.ncsu.edu/wearable-device.  Wearable device prototypes designed and build by each teacher team and presented at RET symposium. Lesson plans implemented in the classroom by each teacher. Ongoing collaboration in the form of classroom visits by ASSIST faculty/staff as well as school visits to NCSU for activities and lab tours during the academic year. Wearable Device Challenge implemented by a majority of the teachers at their schools.  Some engaged an entire class or afterschool club.  Several hundred students were impacted.  23 finalist teams (over 100 students) from both middle and high schools participated in the second annual Wearable Device Challenge on NC State?s campus on April 19th, 2017.  Lending library of supplies is in use to provide materials to support implementation of Wearable Device Challenge in schools.     The program provided teachers with a variety of professional development including:  Engineering Design Thinking Workshops Technical Skills Workshops related to circuits, sensors, working with Arduino platforms, rapid prototyping, energy harvesting, etc.  Tours of research facilities as well as industry and manufacturing facilities.  Professional development through the Kenan Institute as well as mentoring from previous RETS participants.    Teachers have shared and are continuing to share their lessons and experiences at a variety of local, regional, and national conferences. Of particular note, this past summer we received a best paper award for this work at the ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition.

They are also sharing their experiences with fellow teachers in their schools and at regional conferences. As a result, we are able to continue expanding the program by sharing the online lesson plans, lending library, and other resources with new teachers through other Center-sponsored activities and workshops.  Broader Impacts   RET K-12 educators have been able to provide new education curriculum in engineering design, wearable system design, Arduino programming, and nanotechnology to their respective classrooms.
