<AbstractNarration>An addition to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty between the United States and Mexico will allow for greater sharing of water from the Colorado River. This agreement calls for a flooding event, planned for from March 2014 to May 2014, whereby 130 million m3 of water will be released into the dry Colorado River channel in Mexico. The project will examine how rapid mobilization of carbon and greenhouse gasses in newly flooded sediments and soils, affect river-carbon composition and fluxes (land/ocean and land/atmosphere), after being isolated from an active floodplain. This is particularly important in light of possible increases in the occurrence of natural flooding events associated with climate change. It is also an important study in terms of understanding the unintended consequences of such ecosystem restoration efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is to be conducted as a cooperative venture between US academic scientists, USGS scientists and faculty/students from the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Baja California. The project will generate international experience and provide a basis for entry into a carbon cycle problem of significant scope.  This project is supported by EAR/HS, EAR/GG, EAR/GLD, DEB/ECO and ISE/GVF.</AbstractNarration>

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.     The major outcomes of this work are that we have, for the first time, examined the effects of flooding on a temporary watercourse that has been dry (with some small pooling sites) for a longer-term (decadal) and larger river than any previous work on watercourses.

We have only scratched the surface of this important topic and plan to seek other critical regions of interest to explore this theme.     This work will expand on the current knowledge of carbon cycling in floodplains and temporary waterways with an emphasis on short-term pulse flows.  This was a unique opportunity to sample during a planned flow restoration (described in Minute 319) that allowed allow us to gain a perspective on how the time interval of dry periods between flooding pulses affects carbon cycling and fluxes in the lower Colorado River.  This has important implications for understating how stored carbon in dry soils is partitioned into the flood waters over short-pulses and how this previously stored carbon becomes more activated into the global carbon cycle.  Finally, this experiment has application to other regions of the world where there are plans for controlled flooding in regions where extensive damming and diversion has also resulted in drier floodplains and eroding deltas (e.g., Yellow River, Murray-Darling River).   This work should have a significant impact in the fields of hydrology, soil sciences, limnology, ecology, and biogeochemistry.
