<AbstractNarration>DataONE will create new cyberinfrastructure (CI) that will resolve many of the key challenges that hinder the realization of more global, open, and reproducible science. We will do so through four interrelated CI activities that are supported by the DataONE team of developers and the CI Working Group. &lt;br/&gt;First, we will significantly expand the volume and diversity of data available to researchers through the DataONE Federation of repositories (i.e., Member Nodes) for large-scale scientific innovation and discovery. DataONE will create lightweight and easily deployed "Slender Node" software and develop DataONE compatibility for common repository software systems (e.g. DSpace and others) that are already deployed in hundreds of high-value repositories worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;Second, we will incorporate innovative and high-value features into the DataONE CI.  These new features include: 1) measurement search to leverage semantic technologies and enable highly precise data discovery and recall of data needed by researchers; 2) tracking the data through creation, all transformations, and analyses (provenance) to enable more reproducible science by storing and indexing provenance trace information that can be used to both reproduce scientific data processing and analysis steps and to discover specific data sources by examining the documented workflows; and 3) data extraction, sub-setting and processing services to enable researchers at any location to more easily participate in  ?big data? initiatives (e.g. working with data from large environmental observatories and participating in broad-scale synthesis and modeling endeavors). These three new sets of features will dramatically improve data discovery; further support reproducible and open science; and enable scientists from any institution, independent of networking capacity, to extract subsets of large data sets held in DataONE-affiliated repositories for processing and interpretation. &lt;br/&gt;Third, we will maintain and improve core CI software and services (e.g., Coordinating and Member Node software stacks and key components of the Investigator Toolkit) so that the user experience continues to improve, new services can be easily added over time, and the CI can be readily upgraded as operating system and other supporting software systems continue to evolve.   &lt;br/&gt;Fourth, we will increase the number of Member Nodes (size of the Federation) while maintaining cybersecurity and trust. Both of these activities respond to the need for DataONE network continuity and reliability that are critical to maintaining community trust and enabling researchers to achieve their science objectives. &lt;br/&gt;Four working groups that are each comprised of a small number of experts from computer and information sciences, domain sciences, and cyber-enabled learning will guide and contribute to DataONE CI development and usability, sustainability, and education and outreach. The CI Working Group will coordinate core CI research and development, including the addition of new services such as provenance tracking and semantically enabled measurement search. The Usability and Assessment Working Group will help DataONE understand community needs and expectations, and constantly improve the CI via feedback from usability analysis.  The Community Engagement and Outreach Working Group will ensure that community needs are met and that education activities and materials achieve optimal impact. The Sustainability and Governance Working Group will empower the community to drive the organization?s governance structure and sustainability strategies, ensuring that DataONE can sustain services and evolve to meet the needs of researchers, libraries, sponsors, and other stakeholders for decades to come.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to developing robust and powerful infrastructure, DataONE aims to change the scientific culture by promoting good data stewardship practices.  Our specific goals are to: 1) build a community of stakeholders through active engagement with data repositories and the broad community of scientists; and 2) educate scientists about good data life cycle practices through effective education, outreach and training activities and experiences.  Community engagement in the biweekly Member Node Forum and the annual meeting of the DataONE Users Group will support expansion of the data content and services provided to and needed by the research community. A new DataONE webinar series and education resources (e.g., best practices and software tools, learning modules) will enable researchers to better steward their data and take advantage of the myriad services and tools available through DataONE. The DataONE Summer Internship Program will actively involve students in CI development and related DataONE activities such as creating and providing web-based educational resources.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vast amounts of data are needed by researchers, educators, decision-makers and citizens to understand the nature and pace of change on earth and to mitigate negative impacts.  Such data are needed to understand and respond to droughts, floods, emerging diseases, land use changes, loss of biodiversity and other stressors.  DataONE (Data Observation Network for Earth) has built an organization, a community of practice, and a set of information technologies that enable researchers and others to find, access and use a broad array of biological, environmental, geophysical and social data.  DataONE has focused on four key activities: (1) expanding and improving an information system that allows one to discover and access data across a large number of national and international data repositories; (2) adding value-added services that enable data repositories to more easily join DataONE and to improve the quality of their data and metadata holdings, and that enable data contributors to track how their data are being cited and used, add high quality metadata, and capture data provenance information such as how data products were both initially derived and subsequently used in data integration and analysis; (3) engaging a community of scientists, engineers, librarians, and educators in using DataONE tools and services; and (4) teaching scientists, students and others how to better and more easily find, manage, use and interpret data for the benefit of science and society.  DataONE expanded its information infrastructure allowing one to easily search 51 data repositories worldwide and find desired data from the combined 57 TB in data resources.  An individual can go to the DataONE website (http://dataone.org), type one or more keywords into a search bar, and then be pointed to a subset of related data and documentation that helps in understanding and using the data.  Focusing on specific locations and time periods can further refine the data search.  The end result is rapid access to the data needed to answer science questions, inform decisions, and include in class exercises and teaching.  More than 1.2 million important data products from an array of environmental, earth science, scoial and other observational sciences are discoverable, and the advanced search and semantic tools make it easy to pinpoint those data that will be most useful.  The best and most useful information systems and software tools are designed with input from users.  DataONE convened four working groups and the DataONE Users Group (DUG) over the five-year period, engaging more than 650 scientists, information technologists, librarians, and educators.  The working groups and DUG focused on understanding community needs, designing and developing the information system and associated services, implementing education programs, and participating in other essential activities.  As examples,  (1) The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group added 28 data repositories to the DataONE federation and released new tools and services that: collate and expose usage and citation metrics for data objects, enhance user security, and support transparency and reproducibility in science (e.g., ProvONE, recorderR, YesWorkflow). ProvONE is an improved standard for representing provenance data and recorderR and YesWorkflow represent new tools for capturing provenance in R scripts or generically, respectively.

New, improved versions of Metacat and Ecological Metadata Language were also released, and the on-boarding process for Member Nodes was further streamlined.  (2) The Usability and Assessment Working Group surveyed and tracked the needs of hundreds of scientists, librarians and educators, and subsequently engaged small groups of users in testing and improving the usability of tools, services, documentation and marketing materials.      (3)  The Community Engagement and Outreach Working Group released 10 revised education modules, offered 44 community webinars, and offered hands-on training to more than 5300 individuals. The education resources are used for both self-paced training in various data management topics and for inclusion in academic courses.   (4)  The Sustainability and Governance Working Group developed an integrated business model, an assessment of costs for different tiers of service for member organizations, a detailed plan for diversifying revenue streams, and a new governance model that included the transition from an allied DataONE Users Group to a self-organizing DataONE Community Group.  (5) The 650-member DataONE Users Group guided development and routinely tested various tools and services ensuring that DataONE tools and services can be easily and successfully used.  DataONE also engaged undergraduate, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates in research and education activities, many of whom went on to pursue jobs and further training in STEM fields.
