<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a metal matrix composite concrete cutting diamond blade.  This project has the potential to address a distinct need in a $2 billion domestic market.  The technology for cutting concrete hasn't changed in over 20 years and the industry continues to deal with the same issues: blade overheat and warping, slow cutting speeds, multiple blade compositions, loud cutting and blade "sing", and short blade life.  The proposed technology addresses each of these issues; it will be commercialized by working with industry partners to insure a faster transition of developed technology from lab concept to industrial application. These partnerships will result in a product line that will permit new domestic manufacturing operations (a majority of current blades are imported) and a reduced environmental impact (harmful byproducts are a result of today's blade manufacturing processes).  The 200% increase in blade life and faster cutting operations enabled by this technology will reduce overall operating costs for users.  Finally, the aluminum-diamond metal matrix composite (MMC) technology to be utilized will find utility in additional applications, such as stone polishing, stone quarries, and wear and thermal management applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed aluminum MMC diamond blade will have significantly better thermal properties and longer life span compared to conventional blades. Conventional concrete blades have diamond particles embedded in segments within an iron (Fe)-cobalt (Co) matrix. The Fe-Co matrix hardness has to be changed for different concrete aggregate to enable effective cutting.  When mismatched, the blade will overheat and warp, becoming unusable. The proposed diamond MMC blade material has high thermal conductivity that rapidly draws the heat from the cutting zone, thereby avoiding these issues, while increasing the life of the blade. The cast MMC blade will include MMC diamond-containing segments attached to an MMC hub which can be tailored for stiffness, noise mitigation, and optimized thermal properties. The Phase I project will focus on design and development including 1) an optimized segment composition, 2) geometry of the segments and the hub, and 3) an MMC casting process optimized for blade efficiency and life.  Finally, field testing will be conducted to verify and optimize blade performance. Process scale-up will follow to meet specific product requirements as required by end users of the technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ REL, Inc. of Calumet, Michigan, successfully developed an Aluminum-Diamond Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) concrete cutting blade through this National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project. Utilizing REL's patented Functional Reinforcement Gradient (FRG) technology, the MMC Diamond Blade was cast as a one-piece MMC solution to produce a lightweight material with tailored mechanical and thermal properties.  The project successfully achieved a MMC Diamond Blade that significantly increased the life and cutting speed, as compared to conventional blades, over a wide range of aggregates.  The MMC Diamond Blade has a very high thermal conductivity which draws the heat from the cutting zone very quickly, thereby avoiding blade overheat issues and increasing the life of the blade.  Ceramic particulates and fibers were used as reinforcements in the aluminum MMC blades in addition to the diamond particles embedded in the cutting segments.  The MMC diamond segment composition was optimized and cast to the blade hub in one squeeze casting process.  The MMC Diamond Blade can be tailored for stiffness, noise mitigation, and optimized thermal properties.  The design and development of the optimized composition and geometry of the segments, along with the blade hub, was the focus of the Phase I effort.  The technology development work required addressing challenges related to FEA optimization of thermal management, development of tailored multiple preforms (segments and hub), squeeze casting processes, and controlling the microstructure/properties of the segments, hub and interfaces.  Understanding the structure-property correlations was paramount to deploying this technology for cutting, wear, structural and thermal applications.  A one-step squeeze casting process insured minimal contact resistance between the segments and hub to efficiently draw heat from the cutting areas to the hub to eliminate blade overheating and warping.  The optimization of cutting performance, wear, stiffness, dampening, and heat flow helped create the desired properties and interfaces to achieve optimal blade performance.  A summary of the market research performed found that blade life, cutting speed and staying true-to-line are the primary concerns for today's concrete cutting professionals.  Long life and fast cutting are universal needs.  Contractors state that "heat is the performance killer" and as soon as the blade heats up it starts to wobble and won't 'stay true'.  The industry has a number of blades and saws available, and while multi-purpose blades are improving, buyers are jaded.  There has been much "dumping" on the market, where many 'new' technologies have not panned out.  Blade performance and blade quality cannot be assessed by just looking at it, one must "prove it".  Ultimately the success of the MMC Diamond Blade will result from the overall cost of use and the resulting quality footage cut.  The development addresses each of the cutting challenges experienced by concrete cutting professionals today: Blade overheat and warping, slow cutting speeds, multiple blade compositions, loud cutting and blade 'sing', and short blade life.  The REL MMC Diamond Blade lasts twice as long, while also cutting faster, than conventional blades, a significant cost savings for consumers.  Key attributes and benefits of the Aluminum MMC Diamond Blade technology, as compared to current steel blades, are as follows: (1) Highly wear resistant MMC hub material- longer lasting blade; (2) High thermal conductivity - heat drawn from cutting segments to avoid overheating; (3) Higher damping - minimizes detrimental resonances, 'ringing', during cutting; (4) More uniform temperature distribution in blade - lower thermal stresses leading to longer life; (5) MMC blade hub acts as an excellent heat sink with high thermal conductivity; (6) Contact resistance between diamond and matrix material is minimized by squeeze cast processing - heat is take...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
