<AbstractNarration>As our social environment changes, combinations of physical, biological and social stressors are increasingly affecting human health. Using a social group of red-capped mangabeys in Nigeria naturally re-infected with environmentally transmitted pathogens, this research will take a novel and interdisciplinary approach to understanding how human societies respond to emerging environmental health threats. This study will provide data that can help inform real and lasting solutions to the great problem of health disparities in the United States today. These research activities will foster scholarly cooperation between academic institutions in the US and Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, research activities in the field will have both direct and indirect benefits to endangered species and vulnerable habitats. The dissemination of the results to diverse audiences will enhance translational value of this research and increase public scientific literacy. Finally, because primate populations make good models for social animals, including human societies, the results will benefit the well-being of humans and wildlife living in shared changing environments globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will examine how primate behavior, stress, and social and health status influence susceptibility to infection during host exposure to new pathogens. Specifically, red-capped mangabeys will be followed after a de-worming event, and patterns of re-infection with gastrointestinal parasites will be measured. Fecal samples and behavioral data will be collected using combined focal and ad libitum sampling and will be used to measure individual host characteristics influencing exposure and susceptibility to infection and ensuing reductions in fitness. Laboratory analyses of gastro-intestinal parasites and stress hormone analysis will be conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography to predict individual levels of infection and re-infection. Lastly, data from social interactions will also be analyzed using UCINET to explore social network and proximity characteristics of exposure and susceptibility. Data from parasites recovered from non-human primates will be submitted to the Global Mammal Parasite Database (http://www.mammalparasites.org/ ).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As our environment changes, combinations of physical, biological and social stressors are increasingly affecting human and animal health. This dissertation research took a novel and interdisciplinary approach to understanding how societies respond to emerging environmental health threats.  The study used primates naturally infected with environmentally transmitted pathogens as a model for human societies experiencing novel social stressors.   This NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) provided PhD candidate, Friant, with the necessary funds to conduct laboratory analyses critical to her research and to obtain her Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Outcomes:  The project generated original data through: 1) analysis of behavioral data from a successfully completed field experiment, 2) laboratory recovery and identification of pathogens, and 3) hormone assays for determination and quantification of stress hormones.  Analyses consisted of statistical models relating time to infection with multiple parasite species to behavioral and physiological correlates.   Intellectual Merit:  This funded research has furthered the field of behavioral and disease ecology through analyses of patterns of infection in a primate population naturally re-infected during a field experiment. Through incorporation of simultaneous observations of behavior, stress and infection, this research contributes to a better understanding how these factors interact during host exposure to new pathogens in wild populations. The project found that primate behavior, rather than stress or social status, influenced susceptibility to infection during host exposure to new pathogens. These results show how different life stages (e.g. early childhood, older adults) and different vulnerable groups (e.g. individuals of low social position), may be at indirect risk of infection as a result of their behavior.  Data from a formal health assessment protocol enabled Friant to infer the effect of these pathogens on individual fitness.  She found that primates are clinically affected by some infections, which helped identify potential surveillance mechanisms for important human pathogens in wildlife populations. In light of the complex nature of exposure to new pathogens in human and wildlife populations alike, this simpler-but-relevant model yields more interpretable outcomes.  Broader Impacts:  This information is highly relevant to health and disease in the United States and globally; health disparities in our own society represent an enormous social and economic drain on our health care system, causing financial and structural damage to the economy.  This study provides data that can help inform solutions to health disparities.  Furthermore, the research activities fostered scholarly cooperation between academic institutions in the USA and Sub-Saharan Africa.  This research contributed STEM training for four undergraduate students through laboratory research mentoring.  This project also contributed to the training of the co-PI, a woman in science and McNair Scholar, in areas in which women and minorities are historically under-represented. Research activities have both direct and indirect benefits to wildlife, vulnerable habitats, and human health in the USA and beyond. Because primate populations make good models for human societies, results will benefit well-being of humans in the USA and globally.
