<AbstractNarration>Science education research has revealed that students endeavoring to learn material in courses in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) generally find it difficult to understand processes they are not able to observe directly.  These challenges can be especially pronounced when students encounter concepts involving sizes, distances and time frames of very small or very large scales.   This project will conduct research and develop innovative teaching strategies and learning assessments that address challenges in scale literacy, which is a measure of an individual's ability to grasp concepts and reconcile phenomena involving widely varying scales of sizes, distances, and time frames and is an important component to one's overall science literacy.  Although the project will focus on introductory chemistry and biology courses, the insights gained from the research will be broadly applicable to STEM education in all disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will be informed by preliminary research conducted by the investigators of this project at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) that successfully demonstrated student learning gains were achieved in General Chemistry I by integrating scale as a theme into instruction.  Furthermore, the prior work led to the development of two assessment instruments, a Scale Concept Inventory (SCI) and a Scale Literacy Skills Test (SLST), which will be utilized in this project.  Through this project, scale-themed instruction at UWM will be extended to General Chemistry II and introductory biology (Anatomy and Physiology I) and will contribute to enhancing understanding of the relationship of scale literacy to student success in STEM courses.  To facilitate the adoption of effective instructional strategies developed through this project by educators in STEM disciplines other than chemistry or biology, assessment of scale literacy will distinguish domain-general from domain-specific scale conceptions.  In addition to the SCI and SLST, specific instruments and data sources that will be utilized to measure project outcomes include standardized final examinations from the American Chemical Society Examinations Institute, student interviews focused on assessing conceptions of scale, and institutional records of student performance in the targeted courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spatial scale can be defined as the ability to understand size and quantity; and, in science, the sizing of objects can be used to comprehend scientific concepts.  This project specifically targeted the understanding of objects that are smaller than what we can see without magnification (about the width of a strand of hair or smaller) and how this understanding of scale (or scale literacy) relates to students? understanding of basic scientific concepts (particularly chemistry and biology).    In this project, course materials for undergraduate general chemistry students were developed consisting of: (1) supplemental instruction, (2) laboratory experiments, and (3) active learning activities/lecture material.  In addition, assessments that were developed to measure students? ability to use various scaling skills and their perceptions or conceptions with regards to scale were further validated for the processes used by students and how this is represented on the assessments.  These studies were conducted for undergraduate students in chemistry and biology.  For General Chemistry II and Anatomy and Physiology I, models were built using these assessments as well as standardized test scores and placement test scores.  In General Chemistry I and General Chemistry II, the models were used to measure gains in student learning from the implementation of the three components of instruction, particularly active learning.  The impact of the experiments was measured by predicting the students? performance based on the various assessments and then examining the difference between this prediction and the students? actual score. When the average student score is greater than predicted, the learning gains associated with the experiment suggest that the treatment was successful.  Analysis of the data and outcomes from this project included examining the learning gains of each treatment, studying how students use and interact with active learning activities, how students in biology conceptualize scale (through one-on-one interviews), evaluating student processes and how this relates to assessments designed to measure these processes, and evaluating the efficacy of the implementation of the instructional materials using quizzes, surveys, and exams.
