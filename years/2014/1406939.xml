<AbstractNarration>Social interactions cause the spread of parasites but it is not known which behaviors are particularly important in the promotion or prevention of transmission events. To answer this question, both the behavior of the host and the spread of the pathogen must be studied. By simultaneously analyzing social data from wild ringtailed lemurs and genetic data from a common gut bacterium, the researchers aim to identify the characteristics of the host and of their relationships that tend to prevent or promote transmission events. This study will provide one of the most direct tests of socially facilitated transmission to date and in doing so, can inform predictive models for the future spread of parasites in human populations. To this end, this study will also employ novel genetic methods that can potentially be widely applied to many questions about the mechanisms of parasite spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will examine if and to what extent patterns of association explain the transmission dynamics of an actual bacterial organism by correlating the social interaction network of ringtailed lemurs with incidences of shared haplotypes of E. coli. They will collect data over the course of a year to assess how seasonal shifts in social behavior influence the pattern of shared haplotypes, and to determine the resident and transient nature of E. coli haplotypes across time. Individuals typically harbor a unique resident haplotype, which when found as a transient haplotype in a group member, can potentially inform each individual's role in transmission. The researchers will use E. coli as a model "parasite" because its ubiquity among mammals facilitates the determination of transmission dynamics among all individuals and the extensive knowledge of its genome permits the use of a novel one-locus high throughput sequencing approach that will allow rapid differentiation of many more isolates than is feasible using traditional multi-locus methods. High throughput sequencing methods that target one locus, as proposed here, are currently used in microbiome research to differentiate species or genera of bacteria, but they have not been modified to differentiate strains of a single species. The researchers propose some of the first loci to do this in E. coli. Data from this study will stored on "life.bio" server. All sequence data will be uploaded onto GenBank.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many of the pathogens that cause disease are transmitted through physical contact, which makes patterns of social behavior potential routes of transmission. Questions about the social transmission of pathogens are best addressed by combining data on the observed contacts of the host and the genetics of the pathogen because interacting individuals must harbor the same strain for transmission to be deduced. However, few studies simultaneously collect data on both the behavior of the host and the genetics of the pathogen. Those that do collect these data are limited by the use of time- and labor-intensive laboratory methods that require growing the pathogen on a culture plate. Culture-free methods (those that do not require this culturing step) can allow the rapid sequencing of many more of the strains present in a host&rsquo;s fecal sample. Such an approach is already used in microbiome research, where scientists differentiate bacteria to the level of the species or genus, but not yet to the level of the strain. Strain-level differentiation necessary to identify transmission events.</p> <p>In this project, I determined patterns of social contact in wild ringtailed lemurs and developed a culture-free method to differentiate the <em>E. coli </em>strains living in their guts in a faster and less resource-intensive manner. Although not usually pathogenic, <em>E. coli </em>is a valuable bacterial species for social transmission studies because it is a natural and ubiquitous component of the mammalian gut, which allows for the identification of transmission events among <em>all </em>members of a group at all times. Disease-causing pathogens, on the other hand, typically infect only some members of a social group and their occurrence cannot be predicted. &nbsp;</p> <p>I collected detailed social behavior data and fecal samples from 29 individually identifiable ringtailed lemurs living in three neighboring social groups in Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in south western Madagascar from March&ndash;September 2015. I found that social groups differed in how connected (through grooming and physical contact) each member was to the whole network. I also found that the most connected of the three groups lived in the most degraded habitat (group 2, figure 1). Animals living in degraded habitat are often expected to have a higher rate of infection because of their increased exposure to pathogens from humans and livestock, but this result suggests a possible amplification of these effects due to an increase in the network connectedness.</p> <p>To test hypotheses about pathogen transmission such as this, I developed the first culture-free approach to differentiate strains of <em>E. coli</em>. This method is much less time- and resource-intensive than the standard culture-based methods that are typically applied. Using this new and more efficient method, I successfully differentiated over 91% of the strains that could be identified by the traditional culture-dependent method. When applying this new method to feces collected every two weeks from the 29 lemurs, I identified huge amounts of <em>E. coli </em>strain diversity - more than 100 strains within a single lemur&rsquo;s fecal sample (see figure 2 for examples). To date, the most strains of <em>E. coli</em> found within a single mammalian host is about 13. Therefore, the culture-free method of <em>E. coli</em> differentiation developed in this study required less time, fewer resources and provided a more complete picture of <em>E. coli </em>strain diversity within a host. When coupled with detailed data on social contact patterns (the next step of this study), this new genetic method can revolutionize our ability to determine fine-scale transmission dynamics and assess <em>E. coli </em>population genetics within a wild host.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Gena&nbsp;Sbeglia</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1406939/1406939_10310410_1506650608990_NSFOutcomesFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1406939/1406939_10310410_1506650608990_NSFOutcomesFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1: Social networks for grooming behaviors in each group."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1406939/1406939_10310410_1506650608990_NSFOutcomesFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Social networks for grooming behaviors in each group."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Each node represents an individual (squares = males; circles = females).
