<AbstractNarration>Given the critical importance of undergraduate STEM education to prepare the next generation workforce, universities must continuously research and implement enhancements to the undergraduate STEM curriculum and pedagogy to meet technological and societal needs and to help faculty educate and motivate their students. This project brings together experts from different spheres to meld innovative research in wireless communications, visual analytics, and game-based learning (also known as "gamification") for authentic, transformative STEM learning. The project builds on a foundation of knowledge related to visualization, gamification, and virtual and remote laboratory experiences, and their use in achieving instructional outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will merge the ideas of radio resources and dynamic spectrum management with cutting edge visualization tools to transform the students' engagement in the learning process. The implementation will enable students in Electrical and Computer Engineering to visualize and understand radio frequency environments and behavior of spectrum managers, human operators and autonomous radios.  For example, students will be able to discover from first-hand experience the existence of the Nash equilibrium in certain scenarios involving the coexistence of multiple self-interested autonomous radios. The project will take advantage of Virginia Tech's Cognitive Radio and Network (CORNET) testbed that allows students to operate radios in a safe environment to provide a strong sense of realism, combined with space to experiment and fail. The project will contribute to the research literature on effectiveness of visualization and gamification techniques for enabling deep understanding of abstract and not normally perceptible STEM concepts and phenomena. Student learning will be assessed using both in-class measures administered by the instructors and external, qualitative evaluation using surveys, reflective essays, and focus groups.  In addition, access to a novel hands-on experimental tool will make concepts in Electrical and Computer Engineering accessible to more students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project developed tutorials or educational modules that teach undergraduate engineering students about the radio spectrum (frequencies used for voice, data, video, and radar transmissions) and ways that radios can share these frequencies better.  Radio transmitters can interfere with one another if they are too close together or use the same frequencies, but most radio frequencies are not used most of the time, even in busy areas, so it is possible to support much faster data rates or serve more users if the radios use the frequencies efficiently.  The tutorials include videos that explain the concepts and exercises that let students control real radios and observe how the radios? performance changes as the students change radio settings that they learn about in class and in the videos.    The CORNET3D open source software used in the tutorial exercises has a scoreboard feature that lets students know how fast and how accurately radios are transmitting and receiving data using shared frequencies. Students control the radios' transmitting frequencies, how many bits of data are transmitted at a time, and other settings.  The CORNET3D software lets students view the radio spectrum in three dimensions (radio signal power is shown for different frequencies and times) in real time using a standard web browser.  The tutorials were developed for undergraduate college students, but can also be adapted to help technical workers and managers become familiar with the same concepts.  We also used the software in two international challenges or competitions in which students programmed radios to share the spectrum automatically, and we plan to use the software again as part of a nationwide competition for high school students.    Students or other tutorial users can select radios to use in each tutorial exercise from the available radios in a wireless communications testbed such as Virginia Tech?s Cognitive Radio Network Testbed (CORNET), which has about 50 radios.  CORNET3D is the part of the software that controls what the students see and do using their browsers.  Meanwhile, another open source software package, the cognitive radio test system (CRTS) works behind the scenes to help enable students to select which radios in the testbed to use, control the radios they choose, and monitor performance of the radios.    Over 50 students in freshman level Introduction to Engineering classes at Virginia Tech viewed the videos and replied to survey questions about the tutorials, and the results showed that their confidence in their knowledge of the concepts that were covered increased overall, even though these classes include students who are interested in several different types of engineering and many of the students were not especially interested in wireless communications.  Some other students in junior level classes at Virginia Tech and Weber State University in Utah viewed the videos and also tried the exercises, but the testbed and software were not finished and could only support a few students at a time, so there were not enough responses to draw strong conclusions from the answers that those students gave.  We are upgrading the testbed and the software used in the tutorials and plan to try the tutorials with more students at Virginia Tech, Weber State, and other universities when the upgrades are completed.  We have added questions that the students will answer before and after the videos and exercises that will provide a better measure of the students? understanding.    Many aspects of our society rely on wireless communications, and to the extent that students who use the tutorials developed in this project are better prepared to improve future wireless communications, activities such as commerce, education, and government including public safety and defense are likely to benefit.    Major outputs of the project include the tutorial videos (to be posted on YouTube channel "VT-Spectrum-Agile Tutorials") as well as tutorial exercises, open source software used in the tutorials, and research on radio spectrum visualization techniques.  The project also provided ideas for improving the CORNET testbed that are being used in ongoing upgrades to the testbed.
