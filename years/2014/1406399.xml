<AbstractNarration>Recent research conducted in natural ecosystems has demonstrated that shorter, decadal, timescales are relevant for the study of evolutionary processes in wild populations. Such rapid evolutionary changes have been discovered in a wide range of species, many of which are of economic and ecological importance (e.g., commercially valuable fish and agricultural pests). Consequently, human-driven ecological changes such as climate change, pollution, extinction, and overexploitation are increasingly implicated as agents of evolutionary change. One emerging result of this burgeoning research direction is that animal communication systems, such as those used in mate choice, predator detection, and species identification, are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic ecosystem alterations. This study addresses how communication systems are evolving due to altered ecological conditions. Data such as those generated by this study are critical for the advancement of a more integrated understanding of wild populations on an increasingly human-dominated planet. Integrating scientific research and education is also an important component. Education programs, and the development of field-based environmental courses, will build from long-term collaborative relationships with stakeholders such as local Bahamian NGOs (e.g., Friends of the Environment) and directly supports continuation and expansion of programs dedicated to the dissemination of conservation information and science relevant for contemporary and emerging environmental management scenarios in the United States and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will address the role of terrestrial anthropogenic ecosystem changes in altering the evolution of aquatic fish communication systems in which the evolutionary interests of the signaler (typically male) and the receiver (typically female) diverge.  In these types of systems conflicting interests select for males to exploit existing female preferences by exaggerating their signals and for females to discriminate against such males. Importantly, exploitation by signalers, and the stability of the communication system, is theorized to be kept in check by high ecological costs, such as predation risk, paid by low quality males that exaggerate their signals (costs of lying).  This research will evaluate this prediction using a series of coastal wetlands in which predators have been extirpated due to habitat fragmentation. Specifically, two hypotheses are tested: 1) anthropogenic predator extirpation (and thus lower costs of dishonesty) will cause increased rates of dishonest signaling in males, and 2) the strength of female preference will be positively correlated with the degree of male dishonesty. In essence, we predict that anthropogenic predator extirpation will result in higher rates of male dishonesty and a decrease in female preference for those signals representing the erosion of a functional communication system.</AbstractNarration>

To perform this test, we used a model system of mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia</em> sp.) populations that vary in an important ecological factor, predation. Employing field and laboratory research we tested two primary hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that if this assumption is true, predation would be positively correlated with reliable male sexual signals. Second, we hypothesized that female responsiveness to male sexual signals would be also be positively correlated with predation risk because signals would reliably indicate, or predict, the health of males.</p> <p>Results from testing our first hypothesis show that ecological costs, such as predators, determine the informativeness of sexual signals. Specifically, populations that co-occur with predators exhibit signals that predict their physical condition. Populations without predators do not exhibit this relationship, meaning that their signals do not contain information about the quality or health of the signaler. Our second hypothesis, i.e., that female preferences should differ according to population-specific levels of signal reliability, is still under investigation. Early results from our experiments fail to show a coherent signature of an adaptive response to local male signals. That is, females from different populations respond differently to male signaling. However, these differences do not seem to be related to local variation in male signal reliability &ndash; our predicted female response.</p> <p>Together, our results indicate that while sexual signaling varies according to ecological heterogeneity in an acute signaling cost, predation, the receiver&rsquo;s response may not. This finding illustrates important dynamics of sexual selection, and communication in general, namely: 1) male signal reliability is reinforced by ecological costs, 2) female preferences are less variable across ecological cost regimes. In sum, these findings indicate that female preferences may be less labile than male signals. Why this is the case, and whether this fact has important implications for population-level fitness are important areas of future research.</p> <p>We have disseminated these results through leading peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and invited seminars. Products include four papers currently published, or in press, with an additional one in review, and several more in preparation. We have presented our findings at six professional conferences and have given invited seminars at three US universities.</p> <p>In conjunction with this research we participated in several outreach and educational activities. We conducted annual guest lectures on evolutionary ecology and sexual selection at Bahamian secondary schools. We also devoted time to in-depth field experiences for several Bahamian students.
