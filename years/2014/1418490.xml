<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "2014 Pingree Park Dynamical Systems School: Foundations and Frontiers of Symbolic Dynamics" held at Colorado State University on the dates of July 13-18, 2014. This conference, which is an extension of dynamical systems conferences given at the same site during the summers of 2008-2011, is dedicated to the study of classical and multidimensional symbolic dynamics.  A particular area of focus will be on recent developments in active study of Z^d-symbolic dynamics.  Three mini-courses are planned to give graduate students and junior faculty an opportunity to learn foundational material in the subject, as well as to learn of important recent developments. Plenary lectures are also to be given.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbolic dynamics is part of the mathematical subject known as dynamical systems.  In addition to its significance in mathematics, symbolic dynamics has applications in computer science and other subjects involving time evolution through discrete time steps.  The meeting provides an excellent opportunity for students and junior researchers to learn about the state of the art in this field, to interact with experts in the topic area, and to develop research collaborations.  It is planned that there will be thirty-six participants, of which a significant number will be junior faculty.  Particular emphasis is given to recruiting women and members of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: www.math.du.edu/~normes/PP2014</AbstractNarration>
