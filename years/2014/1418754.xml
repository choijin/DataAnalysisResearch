<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the development of numerical algorithms for efficiently computing eigenvalues of algebraic systems of equations derived from mathematical models of physical processes. The study and understanding of eigenvalues is of fundamental importance in numerous engineering applications. Examples include the design of buildings and bridges, for which eigenvalues correspond to resonant frequencies at which structures vibrate, and identification of qualities of flowing liquids or gases that establish whether or not the flows are turbulent. The focus of the project is on solving eigenvalue problems in cases where the underlying model is stochastic.  This scenario arises when components of the model, such as elastic properties of the materials used in structures or permeabilities of the media in which flows take place, are not known with certainty but instead are treated as random variables. The resulting eigenvalue solutions are themselves also random variables. Having such solutions will enable scientists and engineers to incorporate new probabilistic methods into design, for example, by using new mathematical techniques to analyze the likelihood that a structure will buckle and devise methods to prevent it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical approaches the PI will use in the project include the study of solutions of stochastic eigenvalue problems to develop an enhanced understanding of stability of dynamical systems and the impact of uncertainty on mathematical models.  For example, it is known that pseudospectral analysis reveals aspects of stability not shown by traditional linear stability analysis, but it is difficult to use pseudospectral  methods to make quantitative statements.  The PI expects to be able to assess the probability of a linearly stable process being unstable when pseudospectra suggest it is, and how such an assessment depends on the statistical properties of the random components of the model. He will also develop new and efficient computational algorithms for solving the eigenvalue problems, including algorithms designed for stochastic Galerkin finite element discretizations and stochastic collocation methods, and strategies for reduced-order models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project concerned the development of numerical algorithms for efficiently computing eigenvalues of algebraic systems of equations derived from mathematical models of physical processes, and for solving the parameterized systems of equations that such models generate. The study and understanding of eigenvalues is of fundamental importance in numerous engineering applications. Examples include the design of buildings and bridges, for which eigenvalues correspond to resonant frequencies at which structures vibrate, and identification of qualities of flowing liquids or gases that establish whether or not the flows are turbulent.  Our focus has been on solving such problems in cases where the underlying model is stochastic.  This scenario arises when components of the model, such as elastic properties of the materials used in structures or permeabilities of the media in which flows take place, are not known with certainty but instead are treated as random variables.  Our main results are new methods for computing parameterized solutions to eigenvalue problems and models of flows that, once computed, can be evaluated at low computational cost in terms of both computer time and computer memory.  The resulting solutions are themselves also random variables.  Having such solutions will enable scientists and engineers to efficiently incorporate new probabilistic methods into design, for example, by using new mathematical techniques to analyze the likelihood that a structure will buckle and devise methods to prevent it.  Specific technical achievements include:  New computational algorithms for solving stochastic eigenvalue problems using inverse iteration methods.  We have demonstated these computations can be done efficiently to produce accurate parameterized eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and we have demonstrated their utility in benchmark problems arising from vibration analysis.  New efficient algorithms for performing stability analysis of dynamical systems.  We have shown that in cases where linear stability analysis of systems fails to demonstrate instability of steady solutions, a new method based on stochastic collocation methods can be used to identify such instabilities in models of fluid flow, at relatively low computational cost.  We have shown that the large systems of algebraic equations arising from stochastic models of diffusion can be solved efficiently by so-called "rank-reduction methods," by which parameterized solutions are structured in a special way as low-rank objects that are less costly to compute than using traditional approaches.  We have shown that these ideas can be used to effectively reduce the costs associated with multigrid solution algorithms.  Results include rigorous bounds on convergence rates and computational costs of solution algorithms.  We have developed new computational algorithms designed to handle the nonlinear parameterized partial differential equations used to model incompressible flows (the Navier-Stokes equations) and shown that costs of solving them can be reduced using effective preconditioned iterative methods.
