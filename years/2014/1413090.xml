<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Louis Y. Kuo at Lewis and Clark College that will involve undergraduate students. Inquiry-based research will be performed in diverse fields including organic synthesis, chemical catalysis, and coordination and phosphorus chemistry. With Professor Kuo's guidance, undergraduates will actively participate in a hypothesis-based investigations driven by the collection of data and the analysis of results spanning different chemical disciplines. Written and oral dissemination of their results will be communicated at local and international venues. The PI has a proven track record of working with undergraduates on projects involving OP chemistry. In the past 20 years, the PI has mentored 37 undergraduate and high school students and has produced 21 publications with student coauthors. Another outstanding feature of this project is the outreach and involvement of high school students and a high school teacher through summer research. This collaboration will impact STEM education and potentially contribute to greater interest by students in sustainable environmental chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will examine the catalytic hydrolysis of sulfur-containing organophosphates (OP) by common, air stable and safe molybdenum oxide complexes. The OP under examination are sulfur-containing compounds that fall into two classes. The first class is the model compound O,S-diethylphenyl phosphonothioate (DEPP) in which further derivatizations are readily accomplished; DEPP also serves as a safe mimic of OP neurotoxins. The second class of compounds is "live" OP pesticides in common agricultural uses which are Phosmet, Chlorpyrifos and Malathion. This project provides mechanistic information on the hydrolytic degradation of sulfur-containing pesticides. This fundamental investigation focuses on OP hydrolysis through nucleophilic attack and phosphate activation by oxo-molybdates. It also tests how soil (i.e. clay) affects the various routes for OP hydrolysis by these new molybdenum complexes. The research results will provide fundamental understanding of soil-effects on important hydrolytic processes for pesticide degradation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organophosphates have become ubiquitous in the environment due to their extensive use as pesticides and herbicides for agricultural and residential purposes.  However, given the connection/correlation between organophosphates and key neurological ailments, there is a need to find materials that safely degrade these toxins. This goal was achieved with a series of molybdenum complexes that were easy to synthesize, air stable, relatively non-toxic, and derived from non-conflict minerals.  In addition, there is a paucity of fundamental chemistry on molybdenum complexes and their interactions with organophosphates; a key goal of this project was to delineate the basic chemistry of the organophosphate degradation.  The project targeted two types of sulfur-containing organophosphates with a subtle difference in the position of the sulfur atom.  In the first type of organophosphate toxin ("phosphonothioates"), we used water-soluble, air-stable molybdenum oxides to degrade the neurotoxin in water to environmentally safe products.  In addition to experimental results, we also used computational software to model the fundamental mechanism for this process. The results of this work were published in the peer-reviewed journal Inorganica Chimica Acta.  Another focus of this project was to use a supported form of molybdenum oxides that were activated with aqueous hydrogen peroxide.  These polymeric forms (i.e., plastic beads) of molybdenum oxides were robust catalysts that have the operational advantages of heterogeneous reactions where the product(s) is readily separated from the catalyst.  To this end, the polymeric material is applied towards the degradation of both forms of sulfur-containing organophosphates targeted in this study.  In a publication in Inorganic Chemistry we reported the first case of the application of these polymers towards degrading a phosphonothioate that is an analog of the chemical warfare agent VX.  This peer-reviewed publication delineated the fundamental chemistry of the breakdown of the VX analog into innocuous products in ethanol. A key functional group targeted by the polymeric molybdenum is the sulfur atom of the phosphonothioate that is oxidized followed by breakdown of the neurotoxin.  Extension of the polymeric molybdenum material was further accomplished through the oxidative degradation of "live" pesticides; this was the second type of targeted organophosphate toxins.  In ethanol, several sulfur-containing organophosphate pesticides ("phosphorothioates") were degraded into both toxic and non-toxic products. A particularly important finding was that some pesticides (diazinon and chloropyrifos) were converted into the commodity chemical diethyl phosphite that is used as a plasticizer and as a precursor for flame retardants.  This finding represented a form of phosphorus recovery, and it was the first case where phosphorothioate pesticides were converted primarily into a value-added product.  These findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Inorganica Chimica Acta and current efforts seek to understand the basic chemistry of this useful transformation.  Thus far we found that the reactive hydroxyl radicals found in aqueous hydrogen peroxide are not responsible for the degradation of the phosphorothioate pesticides.  An integral part of this funded work is the training of undergraduate and high school students in chemical research.  In addition to the dissemination of key findings (i.e. three peer-reviewed publications, annual presentations at the national meetings of the American Chemical Society), one filed patent and another granted patent, three high school students and six undergraduates were trained in research on this four year project.  All students are now pursuing STEM educational pathways in college or in graduate school.          Last Modified: 11/26/2018       Submitted by: Louis Y Kuo]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
