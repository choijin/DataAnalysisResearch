<AbstractNarration>Researchers wish to understand what are the basic cognitive and social adaptations which define "humanness" and which have been responsible for the success of our species. One way to address this question is through comparison with our nearest counterparts and these are "Neanderthals." Modern humans and Neanderthals met in Europe about 45,000 years ago and the result was the disappearance of Neanderthal culture and their distinct physical form. Neanderthals survived longest in Iberia and the goal of this research is to examine possible interaction between these two groups. If successful the research will shed light on those biological and cultural factors which gave modern humans their competitive edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Jonathan Haws (University of Louisville) and Dr. Michael Benedetti (University of North Carolina Wilmington) will lead a three-year study of Neanderthal extinction and replacement by anatomically modern humans in central Portugal. The project brings together an international team to recover high-resolution archaeological, geological and paleoecological records from the excavation of Lapa do Picareiro, a cave in central Portugal. The research is designed to test three possible scenarios: 1) southern Iberia was abandoned by both Neanderthals and modern humans; 2) Neanderthals existed in southern Iberia; and 3) modern humans were present, spreading into the region soon after they arrived in northern Iberia. The ultimate goal is to test replacement models based on human responses to climate and environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lapa do Picareiro is a unique site, with about 10m of sediments spanning 50,000 years. The sequence includes almost 2m of deposits dated between 30-42 ka cal BP, making it an ideal locale to track changes in paleoenvironments and human ecodynamics across the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition. The proposed methodology uses radiocarbon dating to establish age control for the sedimentary sequence and the archaeological materials, stone tool analyses for both relative dating and means for understanding the human decision-making of Middle and Upper Paleolithic humans, animal bone assemblages to reconstruct paleoenvironments and understand Neanderthal and modern human diets. Sediment analyses are key to understanding the site formation processes and environmental context of human occupation. Taken together, the work will establish a complete paleoenvironmental and geoarchaeological chronology for the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition at Lapa do Picareiro, providing critical context that is missing from many other sites in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contributes to theories about a major development in human evolution. It offers a unique opportunity to resolve long-standing debates about the last Neanderthals and earliest modern humans in Southern Iberia. Broadly, this work will contribute to a greater understanding of the timing and nature of the transition by analyzing the role that environmental change, technology and diet choice played in human evolution. Data from the proposed excavation could potentially uncover new archaeological evidence that would transform understanding of this period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also offers scientific engagement and cultural enrichment for student participants who will join an interdisciplinary research team in an international setting. The PIs have demonstrated success in mentoring student research during previous NSF projects. Many of the students involved in this project over the past 5 years have been first-generation college students from under-represented and rural demographic groups. Recruiting these students has the dual benefits of diversifying the field crew and enriching the educational experience for students who may not otherwise have opportunities for international travel or study. This project will generate partnerships among American, Portuguese and Czech universities, creating new collaborative learning and research opportunities for students and scientists alike.</AbstractNarration>

Several significant discoveries  resulted from the research and the researchers were able to reject at  least one hypothesis and lend support to another. Most significant was  the confirmation of exclusive Neandertal artifacts in level FF, which  now has four radiocarbon dates placing the occupation at 36-38,000 years  ago. This is significant because a comprehensive review of the dates  for the end of the Neanderthals published in 2014 claimed it to have  ended by 40,000 years ago in most of Europe including the Iberian  Peninsula. This region is still in doubt due to late dates that could  not be rejected by the authors and were thus ignored. The radiocarbon  dates from Lapa do Picareiro provide new data to demonstrate a late  Neanderthal survival. In addition, the project was able to fill in  several gaps in the cultural sequence of the cave, identified several  previously unknown archaeological levels, and discovered new parts of  the cave that had been sealed off for over 15,000 years. The  archaeological sequence begins at least by 45,000 years ago and  continued with short interruptions throughout the subsequent 35,000  years.
