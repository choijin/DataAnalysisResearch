<AbstractNarration>A planar graph is a network drawn on the plane so that no edges cross. Planar and near-planar graphs have been fertile ground for algorithms research since the mid-1950s, both because they naturally model many classes of networks that arise in practice, and because they admit simpler and faster algorithms than more general graphs.  Algorithms for such graphs find numerous applications in geographic information systems, computer graphics, solid modeling, computer vision, VLSI design, information visualization, finite-element mesh generation, computational geometry, and other areas.  New techniques introduced in the last ten years have led to an explosion of new optimization algorithms for planar graphs and their generalizations, as well as the emergence of a small but growing research community that draws on and contributes to this pool of techniques; however, we are coming up against limitations of these techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop efficient algorithms for several fundamental optimization problems in planar graphs and related graph families.  Working on problems just outside the range of existing tools will lead the PIs toward developing the next batch of techniques that will maintain momentum in the field.  Specific targets include faster and simpler exact algorithms for variants of shortest paths, maximum flows, minimum cuts, and minimum-cost flows, as well as new polynomial-time approximation schemes for several network design, clustering, and facility location problems for which no such schemes are currently known.  The PIs will also implement and experimentally evaluate some algorithms that appear particularly promising, and make the resulting software publicly available, to support the efforts of students, researchers, and professionals in many different areas of computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the development of efficient algorithms for problems involving networks that can be drawn without crossings on the plane or other surfaces, and for other closely related geometric and topological problems.  The project advanced knowledge and understanding across multiple research areas, by developing novel connections between graph algorithms, optimization, computational geometry, and computational topology. Research fundind by this award led to simpler and faster algorithms for basic optimization problems, extended the reach of existing algorithm design techniques and developed new techniques, and settled long-standing open algorithmic questions. Results from the project have led to significant followup work, both by project particpants after the award period and by other researchers.  Specific technical outcomes include the following:  The first efficient algorithm to determine whether a given polygon in the plane is weakly simple, meaning it can be changed into a simple polygon by moving its vertices an arbitrarily small amount. Efficient algorithms for simplifying self-intersecting closed curves using elementary homotopy moves. As a direct result of the previous outcome, efficient algorithms to simplify electrical networks drawn on any surface, with any number of terminals, using standard series-parallel reductions and &Delta;Y-transformations. Efficient algorithms for computing disjoint paths and maximum flows in planar networks with vertex capacities and multiple sources and sinks. A new deterministic method to enforce uniqueness of shortest paths and minimum-cost flows in directed surface graphs. A natural generalization of the classical Maxwell-Cremona correspondence from straight-line planar graphs to geodesic graphs on the flat torus.   Results from the project have been published in high-quality mathematics and computer science journals and conference proceedings, with parallel web  dissemination and numerous conference, workshop, tutorial, and seminar presentations.  Results from the project have been incorporated into publicly available teaching materials.  The investigators also organized several international research workshops on topics directly related to the project.  A significant majorty of the project budget supported the research training, mentoring, and professional development of four PhD students, especially during the beginning of their graduate careers.  In particular, results from this project are the focus of three of these students' dissertations.       Last Modified: 05/26/2021       Submitted by: Jeff G Erickson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
