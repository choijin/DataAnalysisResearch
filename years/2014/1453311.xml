<AbstractNarration>The project will use NOAA/HRD-derived aircraft data, including dual-Doppler winds and reflectivity, plus numerous additional sources of data, to evaluate existing theories of vertical wind shear effects on tropical cyclones.  The focus will be on the "low-level pathway" in which low equivalent potential temperature air produced by downdrafts into the boundary layer reaches the eyewall and reduces storm intensity.  Case studies will be conducted for varying intensity changes in the presence of moderate to large vertical wind shear.  The goal is to understand every aspect of the low-level pathway, including the roles of cold downdrafts, boundary layer recovery, and stratiform and convective precipitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The questions that are addressed here are fundamental to predicting tropical cyclone intensity change.   The understanding of key processes in tropical cyclone intensity change constitutes a direly needed scientific endeavor, which would lead to improvement of hurricane forecasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;These include the education of graduate students and the use of an outstanding database collected by HRD/NOAA. These valuable taxpayer-funded data have not been fully utilized.  The graduate student education includes guidance with the writing of theses and papers and development of presentation skills. Additional educational experience for graduate students and postdocs is produced by co-sponsoring the Northeast Tropical Conference every two years.  Work is disseminated through articles in top professional journals and via numerous presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vertical wind shear is a known negative factor for tropical cyclone intensification. In recent years, however, my students and I have uncovered several examples of storms that "broke the rules" by intensifying in the presence of large shear. These studies have broadened our view of vertical wind shear impacts. In the funded work, we identified how a storm intensified even when vertical wind shear was large: the eye reformed on the favorable side of the storm for strong precipitation, and the new center intensified within the precipitation and took over for the old center. The storm was able to resist the negative impact of the vertical wind shear with this process.  In the funded work we expanded into "eyewall replacement cycles", which are the other most common mechanism that causes intensity change in tropical cyclones. These cycles evolve as follows: a primary eyewall develops as a storm intensifies; over time, particularly in strong storms, a second concentric eyewall is created, typically about three times as far from the center as the primary eyewall. Over time this outer eyewall takes over for the inner; initially the storms weaken, but then re-strengthen. Eyewall replacement cycles occur with low vertical wind shear.
