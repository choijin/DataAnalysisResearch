<AbstractNarration>This project is a thorough study of the impact of supplemental instruction (SI) across four broad undergraduate STEM disciplines in an institution that has fully institutionalized it as part of their instructional methods.  Although the PIs believe that SI is both effective and an efficient adjunct to regular classroom instruction, there is still much that is not understood about how it works. The challenge being addressed in this project is to develop increased understanding of the mechanisms by which SI improves students' performance in content understanding and their attitudes and beliefs about learning in science and math courses. Improved understanding is the precursor to improved designs for SI. The project would approach this through a comprehensive, cross-disciplinary program of study of the impact of SI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will document the extent to which SI impacts student conceptual understanding in 8 target courses across 4 departments: biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics.   Surveys will be conducted in each course administered over 4 semesters.  Measures employed are student grades, changes in conceptual understanding using already developed concept inventories, and changes in students' beliefs and attitudes towards science and mathematics. The affective realm of SI will also be investigated by interviewing SI leaders, analyzing their recorded interviews using hermeneutics.  The host university is a nationally recognized leader in the development and use of Supplemental Instruction. Consequently, the results of this work will serve to further inform or enlighten the many other faculty instructions in numerous institutions that use SI or are in the process of instituting SI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "Interdisciplinary Assessment of Supplemental Instruction and Attitudes in STEM" examined the effectiveness of the implementations of Supplemental Instruction programs in STEM disciplines at a large public university. Supplemental Instruction ("SI") programs recruit strong, experienced students (known as "SI leaders") to lead workshops targeting "bottleneck" classes, which can pose a barrier to graduation for some students. The SI leaders create learning activities designed to have students work together to develop the skills and understanding needed to pass these bottleneck classes. Students enrolled in the associated courses have the option to attend these workshops regularly; prior research has shown that workshop participation correlated with higher course grades. The goal of this project is to examine possible mechanisms through which students participating in the SI workshops had improved student grades. This work represents a unique opportunity to compare the implementation of Supplemental Instruction across departments, and to investigate the relationships among participation in SI, grades, conceptual knowledge, and attitudes towards the discipline. Further, this project also examines the intellectual and social impact on the SI leaders as a result of being part of the program.  Intellectual Merit:  Many previous studies have shown that SI programs are beneficial to the students who attend the workshops by raising grades and passing rates. This project sought to confirm and understand the underlying causes for those results by examining the conceptual understanding, attitudes about learning, and perceptions of students in order to better understand the specific ways in which SI workshops benefit students. Finally, this project examined the impact of participating in the SI program on the SI leaders; specifically, we probed the potential benefits for conceptual understanding and attitudes about course content and about teaching and learning that come with leading an SI workshop.  Our project was at a larger scale than previous studies: our study included over 2000 students across four disciplines (biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics) over five semesters (Spring 2015-Spring 2017). Students? demographics and data including grades, SI workshop attendance and others were collected. Conceptual understanding and learning attitudes were measured using research-validated survey instruments. We found that the students who attend SI workshops have (in some cases) greater conceptual understanding and more expert-like attitudes in certain areas than their peers who do not attend SI workshops. These results offer greater understanding of how SI workshops help students to achieve better grades. The findings in this study did not show the same trends across each semester or between departments; this suggested that there may be multiple mechanisms for learning improvement at work.  Broader Impact:  This project details differences in the SI implementations across STEM departments, and offers some insight into how SI might be implemented at similar large universities and how these choices may impact program goals for students enrolled in SI courses and the student leaders who conduct the workshops.  This project demonstrates that stronger conceptual understanding and more expert-like attitudes can be affected by programs like SI, although the mileage does vary.
