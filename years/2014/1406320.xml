<AbstractNarration>South Seattle Community College, Washington State University, and Edmonds Community College are working with industry partners to prepare technicians for the sustainable building science technology workforce.  Due to the effects of the Baby Boom bubble, retirements in the energy efficiency industry are estimated to reach 23 percent of building energy managers in the next five years. As these skilled and experienced employees prepare for retirement, the market for an even more advanced workforce is expected to grow. More complex building codes and ever emerging technologies create increased demand for increasingly skilled labor. The institutions are addressing industry needs by implementing career and education pathways at all levels of the skill continuum. The potential societal benefits include producing a stable supply of highly skilled and diverse graduates to serve as managers of sustainable buildings into the future.  Further, outreach activities for area high school students are laying the groundwork for creating an ample supply of high school graduates into sustainable building management on a continual basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of the project are to (1) design a Baccalaureate of Applied Science (BAS) curriculum that meets the needs of both employers and targeted populations (i.e. students from groups that are typically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines); (2) incorporate curricular innovations such as industry-recognized certifications and building benchmarking skills into the curriculum; (3) enhance recruiting and retention of students from targeted populations; and (4) create summer workshop programs for high school teachers resulting in curricular materials that they can use with their students. This program is advancing knowledge in two ways. First, it is enabling the development of a curriculum that is one of the first of its kind in the country. Specifically, it is incorporating emerging scientific, policy, technical, and managerial skills required of operators of sustainable buildings in the coming years. This program also includes innovative components, for example a course that teaches students how to benchmark building energy use and use that skill to inform building maintenance schedules and upgrades. Second, the program brings together several cutting-edge pedagogical and student services strategies to ensure that the diverse populations targeted for this program graduate. These strategies include the use of competency-based instruction as well as an early warning system to identify students at risk of attrition, coupled with intrusive advising to ensure they get the services they need.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Context, Input, Process and Product (CIPP) model is being used to evaluate the project.  Outcomes from program assessment and evaluation are informing the broader STEM education community of the impact of various program elements on the enrollment and retention of students from underrepresented groups in STEM programs focused on sustainable buildings and the quality and significance of that impact, effectiveness of incorporating industry certifications into curricula, and gains in overall student participation, enrollment and employment in the sustainable building industry resulting from secondary to post-secondary pathways.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><span>Curriculum:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>South Seattle College and partner, Washington State University-Energy Program, created 16 open-source courses forming a new Sustainable Building Science Technology Bachelor's of Applied Science (SBST) degree offered through South Seattle College. This innovative curriculum includes 9 credits of internship and 10 credits of work experience practicum, providing students with ample opportunity to gain more experience in the field. The program also integrates the opportunity for students to earn credit for prior learning through work experience, shortening the time to completion and lowering the total cost. In addition, the program is offered in a hybrid mode, a combination of face-to-face, online education, and team projects, making this program accessible to working adults throughout the region. Lastly, the program is supported by a Program Manager who provides high-touch advising to the students, tracking and communicating with students often throughout the program.</span></p> <p><span>The grant project worked with New Buildings Institute to integrate emerging skills such as benchmarking building performance and using energy tracking and analysis software such as ENERGY STAR? Portfolio Manager? and FirstView? into the curriculum. The program is now integrating requirements of the City of Seattle's new Building Tune-Up Ordinance as well, and graduates of the program (with 7 years of work experience) are named as qualified to be a Tune-Up Specialist and able to sign off on the work of building tune-up compliance.</span></p> <p><strong><span>Industry Support:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The program is supported by a Technical Advisory Board, industry stakeholders, who guide the refinement of the curriculum as well as interact with students in many ways. The program also employs a unique model of using existing buildings within the community as labs for learning instead of building expensive labs. Hermanson Company, LLP donated a $200,000 endowment to the program. All of this involvement indicates strong industry support for the program.</span></p> <p><strong><span>Recruitment &amp; Retention:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>South Seattle College worked with partners, Pacific Northwest Center of Excellence for Clean Energy, King County Department of Community and Human Services, and ANEW (Apprenticeship &amp; Nontraditional Employment for Women), for the recruitment of women, veterans, and people of color into the program. In addition to targeted marketing materials and staffing at targeted events, the partners made referrals into the program from their caseloads. Students stay in the program because of the continued accessibility due to its hybrid format, the integration of real-world activities through projects/labs, and continual advising. In addition, the cohort model is important; students enter, continue, and complete the program together with once a year entry in fall quarter. The opportunity to share experiences with other adult students who are also juggling family, work, finances, and college is invaluable. </span></p> <p><strong><span>High School Institutes:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>South Seattle College worked with partners, Cascadia College, Cleveland High School, and Washington State University-Energy Program to offer Summer Teacher Institutes, 30-hour professional development institutes on SBST for teachers in 2016 and 2017, expanding the educational pathway into the high schools. In both years, some of the participating teachers subsequently offered an 80-hour, .5 credit, Summer Learning Opportunity based on the Institute curriculum at Cleveland High School. </span></p> <p><strong><span>Impacts:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Construction of commercial and multi-family buildings is continuing to increase in the Puget Sound area. The need for skilled technicians/managers who can manage and operate these buildings for maximum comfort and efficiency has never been greater. Prior to this degree, there were few options in this field for bachelor's degrees. The field of building science/engineering has long been capped in terms of field-specific education at the associate degree level, so many incumbent workers find themselves locked out of higher positions due to a lack of a bachelor's degree. Our students have expressed being in this position, and many are now breaking through that ceiling in new positions and promotions in the field. Students/faculty from other institutions are benefiting with 14 articulations in place into the degree.</span></p> <p><span>Building operations make up the bulk of our energy consumed in the U.S., and thus carbon output with the combustion of fossil fuels making up the majority of our energy production. The institutions involved in this project are working to provide industry-relevant programs that graduate students who will work directly with facilities management, building science, energy efficiency, and conservation.
