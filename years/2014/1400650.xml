<AbstractNarration>Mt. San Antonio College (Mt. SAC) is a federally-designated Hispanic-Serving Institution, and is the largest single campus of California's 112 community colleges. The campus is located about 30 miles east of Los Angeles.  Two factors speak to the need for the preparation of more and better science and mathematics teachers in this area:  student mathematics and science test scores for several of Mt. SAC's top feeder high schools are in need of improvement and there is a predicted dramatic attrition among the population of middle-school and high school teachers.  To address the need for more and better science and mathematics teachers, Mt. SAC is developing a sustainable multidimensional program to recruit, counsel, and direct likely students that have the desire and potential to become highly-qualified middle school and high school mathematics and science teachers. The project, titled Mt. SAC STEM Teacher Preparation Program (STEM TP2), is providing the students with (1) a cluster of academic support, (2) enrichment activities, (3) teaching opportunities, and (4) authentic research experiences designed to promote student success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to develop a sustainable, multidimensional program that will recruit and retain students with the potential and desire to teach.  The PI team is working with the existing Mt. SAC Teacher Preparation Institute to develop the process through which students will be recruited.  The project is also articulating with the teacher preparation programs at the California State University, Fullerton and the University of California, Irvine so that Mt. SAC students can transfer seamlessly into a baccalaureate teacher preparation program.   Student participants are selected from among students majoring in science and mathematics areas and particular emphasis is focused on recruiting students of color, females, Hispanics, veterans and first-generation college students that have a desire to teach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The original three year project, The Mt. San Antonio College STEM Teacher Preparation Program, proposed recruiting and training two student cohorts, for a total of 30 STEM major students to become secondary STEM teachers. However, with two no-cost extensions (five years total), and additional corporate donations, five student cohorts, 63 students, participated in the program.  All 63 cohort students participated in the annual Summer Science Exploration Experience (S2E2), the first part of the program, where the cohort gained experience instructing classroom sized groups of Middle School students.  Through each of the five summers, cohort students prepared teaching demonstrations, delivered lessons, supervised hands-on activities and chaperoned middle school students on STEM-focused field trips.  For the second part of the program, 72% (36/50) of the first four student cohorts enrolled and successfully completed the University of California, Irvine (UCI), Cal Teach course, "Introduction to Math and Science Teaching (PS5)".  This one quarter course required 20-25 field-work hours at an elementary school which included observing, assisting the mentor teacher and delivering lessons to students in the classroom.  Of the 50 cohort students that completed PS5, 48% (24/50) went on to successfully complete the UCI, "Research Methods" course, the third part of the program.  This Research Methods course, introduced our students to reading peer reviewed journal articles, planning/designing experiments and an introduction to proposal writing.  Of those completers, 48% (14/24) participated in a summer STEM research project, the capstone component of the program.  These 14 students, conducted original research under the direction of a lab supervisor or Post-Doctoral student either at UCI or at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.  The PIs participated at four ATE PI meetings over the lifetime of the grant and presented the project to other attendees. Six of our cohort students, two each year, received two of the fifty NSF annual scholarships, for three consecutive years to attend and represent the program at the ATE PI meetings.   With funding from the NSF, Pellet Production produced a promotional video highlighting our program (available at http://atetv.org/video/mt-san-antonio-college-stem-tp2-program/). In recognition of the program, we also received the "Partner for Progress &amp; Prosperity (P3)" award from the Western Regional Meeting of American Chemical Society (ACS) in 2018. In addition, the program was highlighted in the ATE IMPACTS publication, Twenty-Five Years of Advancing Technician Education, in 2018 and is also weblogged on the ATE Central website.  Overall, the Mt. SAC STEM Teacher Preparation program trained 63 students across five cohorts.   (The fifth cohort has recently completed the S2E2 portion and will be enrolling in the fall quarter 2019 PS5 course.)   With the addition of two no-cost extensions, the program trained more than 200% of the original proposed 30 students.  As of the data currently available, 25 cohort students have transferred to a 4-year universities and are continuing working toward becoming a secondary STEM teacher.  Our cohort students were largely underrepresented in STEM programs. Of the 63 total students, 30 were female (47.6%), at least 28 were Hispanic/Latinos (44.4%) and 39 were First-Generation college students (61.9%).
