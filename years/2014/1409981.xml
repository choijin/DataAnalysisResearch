<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to construct a new class of materials, "roto-electrics", in which crystalline materials, normally thought of as composed of rigidly bound atoms, also contain molecular components that are free to rotate.  Of particular interest are cases where the rotating components carry a permanent electric dipole moment.  These materials have long been predicted but appear not to exist in nature and provide an opportunity to learn how to build new and potentially useful materials by design.  Roto-electric phases are special examples of ferroelectric phases and ferroelectrics find application in such areas as memory sticks, high frequency filters in cell phones, and for controlling light polarization in displays.  Roto-electrics offer the opportunity to miniaturize such components and to make them operate faster.  The project supports the education of a graduate student, who receives Ph.D.-level training in the design of dipolar materials, in a wide variety of experimental spectroscopy techniques, and in the underlying materials theory. The project looks to involve under-represented minorities in nano-engineering research. It further leverages the training of future engineers in both nano-scale modeling and experiment, by the integrating the research results into materials science and engineering curricula. Project results and materials design insights are further distributed through physics, engineering, and educational websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team builds crystalline arrays of nearly-freely rotating dipolar molecules with a host / guest molecular-engineering approach.  The present host systems are crystals, thin-films, and crystalline powders of the well-documented tris (o-phenylenedioxy) cyclotriphosphazene (TPP) material, which forms a hexagonal structure with open channels directed along the hexagonal c-axis.  The channels are known to accept a large variety of guest molecules.  The team investigates the dielectric phases that result from placing specially synthesized dipolar molecules, specifically designed to allow for nearly free rotation of the dipolar components, in the bulk of the TPP channels (3-dimensional materials) or at TPP surfaces (2-dimensional materials).  These compounds are studied using a combination of radio-frequency dielectric spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, bulk and micro-Raman spectroscopy, and, for surface-localized and thin-film materials, with atomic force microscopy.  Other probes, especially neutron diffraction and tip-enhanced Raman are investigated via collaborations.  The new roto-electric materials are predicted to have ferroelectric waves that propagate at speeds far below those of traditional ferroelectrics, allowing e.g., for miniaturized surface acoustic wave devices.  This research makes contributions to the assembly of molecular systems of nearly-freely rotating molecular components, and in demonstrating ordered dielectric phases in such materials.  The project works to provide new insights into the construction of dipolar phases of matter, and has the potential to provide new useful materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF support allowed an interdisciplinary team of experimental physicists lead by PI Prof. Charles Rogers, theoretical physicists lead by co-PI Prof. Paul Beale, and synthetic and physical chemists from several different groups to collaborate on a project to create new dielectric materials.  The project aimed to build systems of nearly freely rotating electric dipole moments, with moments located on 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional lattices, and to observe ordered alignment of the electric dipoles due to dipole-dipole interactions.  We refer to such hypothetical phases as roto-electrics.  We particular hope to find a long-range ordered ferroelectric phase that is predicted for electric dipoles on triangular lattices.  The project succeeded in building and studying nearly a dozen different crystalline materials based on guest molecules that contained either a single or a pair of pyridazine moieties, so-called mono-pyridazines and dipyridazines, and by putting these guest molecules into a host material, tris (o-phenylene) cyclotriphosphazene (TPP).  TPP is a hexagonal material with long channels in the c-axis direction (Figure 1).  TPP has a long history of use for inclusion of small molecules into the long channels.  We used it as the host and filled the channels with specially synthesized guest molecules.  The TPP forces the guests into a triangular array of long channels, where the distance from one channel to the neighboring channels is roughly 1.16 nanometers.  Spacing between dipoles along the channels is set by the density of guest molecules for the mono-pyridazines and by the molecular density for inter-molecule spacing and molecular design for intra-molecular spacing for the dipyridazines.  Figure 2a (top view) and Figure 2b (side view) show a pictorial view of the quantum chemistry minimum energy structure done by the laboratory of our collaborator, Prof. Josef Michl, of how one of our mono-pyridazine guests is included into a TPP channel.  The electric dipole moments of pyridazine moieties are all close to 4 Debyes.  They are constrained to point in a plane perpendicular to the channel long axis.  The dipole-dipole interaction energies for 4 Debye dipoles separated by 1.2 nanometers is on the order of 100 K.  The project theory effort confirmed that this energy scale is also the temperature range below which ordered phases are expected.  A high-temperature para-electric phase is also predicted.  We studied all of these inclusion materials differential scanning calorimetry for thermal properties  All were studied by collaborators using solid-state NMR to demonstrate that the rotor molecules are included into the TPP host.  We verified the hexagonal structure of all the inclusion compounds x-ray powder diffraction.  We studied the dielectric properties of all the materials by placing powder samples onto thin-film interdigital capacitor structures.  The complex dielectric response function of the powder materials was then measured versus temperature from roughly 10K to 400K and versus frequency from 100Hz to 20kHz. These measurements allow us to study the rotary motion of the electric dipoles versus temperature and frequency.  Measuring the dielectric loss tangent allows the extraction of energy barriers to rotation.  We also compare the observed response function to models created by our theory effort for systems of dipoles.  These comparisons provide estimates of dipole-dipole interaction strengths, and show the influence of internal rotational energy potentials on the net dipole alignments.  We find that the predicted high temperature para-electric behavior is in good agreement with measurements.  It is useful in studying how the dipole-dipole interactions differ for various inclusions.  We have successfully measured dipole rotation energy landscape and have extracted the internal energy barriers between wells.  Quantum chemical calculations and the dielectric measurements all confirm that the individual electric dipoles find themselves in three-fold rotation potentials.  We have extracted and reported energy barrier heights between the wells as ranging from 1 to 4 kcal/mol for these inclusions.  We confirm that the dipole-dipole interactions are of order 100K.  We found no ordered dipole phases.  Instead, the dipole system freezes into a dipole glass.  Rotational barriers prevent thermal motion of the dipoles at temperatures higher than the transition temperature for the ordered phase.  Modeling (Figure 3) suggests that the very small size of the powder particulates is suppressing the transition, by favoring vortex phases over the ferroelectric phase.  In the last year of the project, we have succeeded in growing thin-films of these TPP guest/host materials (Figure 4).  The films have the hexagonal c-axis of the TPP, the direction of the long channels and the direction of the dipole rotation axis, perpendicular to silicon dioxide substrates.  Figure 5 shows a grazing incidence wide angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) diagram from one of our films, demonstrating the alignment.  These thin-film materials have larger grains than the powder materials, are favorably aligned for many measurements, and may allow the engineering of ordered dipole roto-electric phases with the materials that are already discovered.
