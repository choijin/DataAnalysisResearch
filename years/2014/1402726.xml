<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The discovery and development of new metals is critical for technical applications where high strength and ductility are necessary.  In this program, we explore a new class of bulk nanostructured metals made by an advanced processing method called liquid metal dealloying, in which an alloy of a refractory metal such as tungsten and titanium is immersed into molten copper under conditions in which the titanium is dissolved away and the refractory metal re-organizes itself into a nanoscale network, a kind of truss network whose ligaments are only a few hundred atoms across.  Upon cooling, the composite material is bicontinuous, i.e. comprised of two interpenetrating networks of distinct materials, a hard refractory phase and a ductile copper phase, combining the best attributes of each metal to make a novel strong and ductile material.  In this program, we will explore processing methods to make these new materials and test their properties in systematic ways so as to understand the fundamental materials physics that govern their behavior.  We will disseminate this understanding via student participation and the development of classroom resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the structure/processing/property relationship of a new class of nanostructured metals, which possess a bicontinuous ?spinodal decomposition?-like microstructure, but where one phase is a hard refractory metal such as tungsten and the other phase is a ductile metal such as copper.  These materials are made using a new method we call liquid metal dealloying (LMD), in which titanium/refractory alloys are immersed in copper alloy melts at elevated temperatures.  Whereas titanium dissolves out into the copper, the refractory is immiscible in the melt so during immersion it reorganizes via interface diffusion into a highly porous structure (were the copper phase to be removed), with a tunable lengthscale from approximately 50 nm to 5000 nm.  The process is akin to electrochemical dealloying, such as is used to create nanoporous gold, except that dissolution in LMD is driven by thermodynamic phase behavior, and not electrochemical dissolution.  Our focus here is on the kinetics of formation and the mechanical properties of non-porous composites fabricated by this method, which have potential utility in the diverse number of applications for ultra-strong materials with high toughness.  More generally and fundamentally, the spontaneous formation of the bicontinuous microstructure during LMD is a platform on which to examine phase transformations, kinetics, and mechanical of metallic materials at the nanoscale.  In addition to the scientific technology drivers, this program will involve students in the development and dissemination of kinetic Monte Carlo simulation code for the simulation and study of the kinetics of morphological evolution in nanostructured materials that will complement the development of a new undergraduate textbook on Kinetics and Phase Transformations for Materials Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  In "Bicontinuous Nanocomposite Refractories", we studied the materials science underlying a new processing method caled Liquid Metal Dealloying (LMD).  In LMD, a two-component alloy is immersed into a bath of molten metall, in a system designed so that one of the alloy components dissolves, but the other doesn't.  But one also designs the system so that the remaining component can move along the interface betweeen the remaining metal and the melt, and re-organize in a three-dimensional porous ("bicontinuous") microstructure.  In this work, we primarily focused on Ti-Ta alloys in which Ti is dissolved in molten copper.  Students and collaborators working on this project thoroughly examined the kinetics of LMD in this system, discovering and clarifying how the beautiful microstructures of this system grow.  We also were able to identify the critical differences between how microstructure evolves in LMD compared to the more common electrochemical method of dealloying (ECD), in which the one component is dissolved into an electrolyte.  We found LMD has certain advantages over ECD - first, the range of elements accessible to become porous in LMD is much wider than ECD; so, for instance, we were able to use LMD to make materials based on refractory elements such as Ta and Nb, that had never been made before.  Second, once an LMD processing run is finished, one needs only cool the system to form a bicontinuous composite metal - one phase being Ta, the other phase being Cu.  These composite metals were found to have superlative mechanical properties, with high hardnesses that became even higher as the size of the ligaments in the porous backbane became smaller.  These resutls point to a novel and facile route to the synthesis and utilization of nanostructured, high strength metals.  Broader Impacts:  The results from this program will have immediate impact in the use of advanced materials across a variety of technologies, as well as expand our knowledge about processing and the fundamental physics and chemistry that govern the formation of metals and metallic nanostructures generally.  Overall, this program generated 8 publications in peer-reviewed journals and was used to fund two graduate students for work toward their thesis and included undergraduates in the research activites.  In addition, significant progress was made toward a new modern textbook in Kinetics and Phase Transformations in Materials Science.
