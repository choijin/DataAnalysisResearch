<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the relation between brain rhythms during sleep and memory.  The question of whether sleep serves a critical function in learning and memory remains strongly debated.  There are two stages of sleep, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS), and these different sleep stages may play unique roles in memory functions.  This project tests the novel hypothesis that different types of brain waves, slow and fast gamma rhythms, occur during SWS and REM, respectively, and differentially regulate memory processing during these states. The project employs a state-of-the art approach that involves recording electrical signals from the brains of live animals and decoding the messages transmitted by these signals during wakeful learning and subsequent sleep.  The studies are expected to reveal major insights about how memories may be strengthened during sleep.  The results will also make progress toward successful decoding of conscious and unconscious brain activity.  This is expected to promote the development of devices that advance human intelligence through brain signal translation.  This project will also provide scientific training to students at various levels, from junior high to graduate school, and impart knowledge about brain signals to the general public.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test whether distinct fast (~80 Hz) and slow (~40 Hz) gamma rhythms serve unique memory functions in the entorhinal-hippocampal network during different stages of sleep.  The work has two objectives: 1) Test the hypothesis that slow gamma facilitates hippocampal output to the entorhinal cortex during SWS as part of the memory consolidation process, and 2) Test the hypothesis that fast gamma coordinates entorhinal input to the hippocampus during REM as a different step in the memory consolidation process.  The proposal employs an innovative multi-technique approach combining single cell recordings, neuronal ensemble coding, network rhythms, and animal behavior. The proposed work has the potential to transform theories of memory processing during sleep.  An influential theory of memory consolidation posits that memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex during sleep. Yet, it is unknown whether neurons in the entorhinal cortex, the gateway between the hippocampus and neocortex, respond to inputs from the hippocampus during sleep. If, instead, the hippocampus responds to inputs from the entorhinal cortex during sleep, conventional theories of memory consolidation during sleep would have to be revised.</AbstractNarration>
