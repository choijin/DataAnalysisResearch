<AbstractNarration>Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are common components in critical infrastructure systems such as the smart power grid, smart buildings, oil and gas pipelines, chemical processing plants and water distribution systems.  Securing these systems requires a skilled and knowledgeable workforce with expertise in several engineering disciplines.  This project will develop new interdisciplinary courses, and modules that will be incorporated into existing courses, to enhance cybersecurity education.  The development of the curriculum will be guided by an advisory board consisting of industrial experts.  The graduates from these programs will possess the skills required to secure and maintain these critical systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are (i) the training of future engineers/scientists to design, build and maintain secure industrial control systems, (ii) the development of new courses on security issues, (ii) the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups, (iii) the involvement of undergraduate/ graduate students for conducting design/ thesis projects in the secure industrial control systems ,(iv) the dissemination of the results through, web-based curriculum dissemination, and journal publications, and (v) outreach activities to community college and high school students.  Formative evaluations will continuously improve the curricula of the courses and a summative evaluation at the end of the grant period will evaluate the level to which the goals and objectives of the project have been met.  The data collected through the evaluation process will be use to improve program delivery as well as evaluate project success.</AbstractNarration>

The integration of advanced communication and computations with the legacy industrial systems leads to various vulnerabilities for cyber- attacks.
