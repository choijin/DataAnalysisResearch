<AbstractNarration>Random processes  play an important role in many aspects of science and other human activities. The study of card shuffling  procedures provides an entertaining yet complex and mathematically interesting example. It also serves as a model for the many important mixing phenomena. We use randomness to understand complex phenomena, from the behavior of polymer molecules and DNA analysis, to image restoration and recognition, communication and social networks, and the behavior of financial markets. Random processes are also used as important tools for efficient computations. In all these cases, there are strong structural constraints underlying the behavior of the relevant random process. These constraints are expressed in terms of the environment of the process which often has a complex combinatorial or geometric  structure. This proposal focuses on the study of the fundamental properties of such stochastic processes and on how they relate to the global structure of their environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many basic Markov processes evolve on a state space carrying a related geometric structure. Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold,  random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups and  finite Markov chains on complex combinatorial structures such as trees or matchings are significant examples. This proposal focuses on the relationships between the behavior of such  processes and the properties of the underlying geometric structure. It involves problems at the interface between analysis, geometry and probability with a major role played by groups and their actions. Potential theory, i.e., the study of harmonic functions and, more generally, of solutions of the heat equation, is also at the center of many of these considerations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award led to the study of problems concerning basic stochastic processes defined by a geometric environment. Random walks and  Brownian motion are examples of such processes. Graphs and manifolds are examples of geometric environments that support such stochastic processes.  The basic question considered in this project is to understand the random position of a stochastic  process at  time t given the location of the process at time 0. This random position is described by the density of a probability distribution which is often denoted by  h(t,x,y) where t is the time, x is the starting point and y is the potential location at time t.  For Brownian motion on the real line the function h(t,x,y) is well-known and described by the bell-curve (Gaussian density).  This project develops techniques that are suitable  to understand the function h(t,x,y) in complex situation. A major result of the project is to provide the behavior of h(t,x,x) for random walks on free solvable groups, an important class of finitely generated groups.  Another major result is a description of h(t,x,y) (uniformly for all t, x, y) in the case of  connected sums of recurrent Riemannian manifolds. Assorted related problems were studied.   Participation to these research projects provided training for students who pursue careers in sciences and stem fields.  Two graduate students received their Ph.D. and are pursuing career in academia.  The stochastic processes considered in this project are basic building blocks and examples for models and  stochastic algorithms that  are widely used in other sciences to understand and simulate complex systems.
