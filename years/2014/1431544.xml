<AbstractNarration>For engineering undergraduates, mastering and retaining the material taught in the introductory mathematics sequence is essential to successful completion of their baccalaureates in engineering. "Spaced retrieval" is one factor that cognitive scientists have shown to affect mastery and retention of a subject. In spaced retrieval, once a concept is introduced, students practice the concept in multiple sessions distributed across the semester rather than massed in a single session at the time the concept is taught. Research in cognitive psychology has established that the act of retrieving a piece of information from memory increases the likelihood that the information will be retained at a later date, this is referred to as the retrieval practice effect. Moreover, any given number of retrievals will have greater impact if they occur non-consecutively versus consecutively (the spacing effect). This project will study the effect of spaced versus massed practice in two introductory engineering mathematics courses at the University of Louisville.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In many mathematics classes, practice problems are massed (the opposite of spaced); that is, all of the problems related to a specific learning objective are assigned consecutively, and students complete all the problems over a fairly short period of time. For many engineering students, retaining mathematical knowledge from one course to the next is a requirement for success. The transfer of knowledge from one course to the next is an area faculty and researchers regularly identify as problematic. This project will use the online homework and tutorial system MyMathLab, to manipulate spacing of practice problems covering a subset of objectives in a sequence of two math courses: "Introduction to Calculus for Engineers" and "Engineering Analysis I." The students will be pseudo-randomly assigned to treatment and control groups to ensure comparable distribution of student characteristics across groups, including race, gender, high school GPA, and ACT math score. The study's research questions are:  1) Is overall performance in the second course better for students for whom some practice problems in the first course were spaced than for students for whom all practice problems were massed?;  and 2) Is objective-specific mathematical knowledge better retained when accompanying practice problems are spaced versus massed? If results indicate positive effects from spacing, the findings could motivate the use of spacing in foundational mathematics courses to reduce the number of students transferring out of STEM majors due to inadequate mathematical knowledge. Since the analysis will include demographic data, the project has the potential to identify whether spacing retrieval has a different impact on students from a number of diverse groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research grant was to examine the effect of spaced retrieval practice on the short- and long-term retention of mathematical knowledge.  Spaced retrieval practice refers to temporally distributing (or spacing out) instances in which studied information is retrieved from memory.  Cognitive psychologists have demonstrated that repeatedly retrieving information from memory with spacing between retrievals is a potent means of increasing the informationÆs retention.  Retrieval practice is more effective for increasing retention than is restudying information and spaced retrieval practice increases retention more than does massed retrieval practice, in which multiple retrievals occur consecutively with little or no spacing between them.  The potency of spaced retrieval practice is well established in laboratory settings, but empirical evidence from classroom applications is sparse.  To our knowledge there has been only one similar study, and that study manipulated factors other than the spacing of retrieval practice, making conclusions specific to spacing difficult to draw.  Additionally, laboratory benefits of spaced retrieval practice have usually been demonstrated using verbal stimuli and only rarely with mathematical knowledge.  In this study we manipulated whether quiz questions covering learning objectives in Introductory Calculus for Engineers were massed or spaced.  If massed, three questions covering the same objective appeared on a single quiz.  If spaced, the same three questions were distributed across three different quizzes administered in different weeks.  In this way, we manipulated whether retrieval practice of objective-specific information was massed or spaced.    We then examined performance (proportion correct) on final-exam questions covering massed versus spaced objectives.  This constituted our measure of short-term retention of the mathematical information learned in Introductory Calculus for Engineers.  Students in an experimental group performed significantly better on final-exam questions covering objectives for which retrieval practice was spaced versus massed.  Furthermore, performance on spaced objectives in the experimental group was significantly better than performance on massed objectives in a control group.  Hence, the potency of spaced retrieval practice for enhancing short-term retention of mathematical knowledge was demonstrated both within- and between-subjects.   To assess longer-term retention, we also examined performance in the next math course&mdash;Engineering Analysis I&mdash;for those study participants who advanced into it.  We specifically examined performance on the first and third semester exams and on the final exam.  Students who had been in the experimental group in Introductory Calculus for Engineers and therefore had experienced spaced retrieval practice scored higher on the first semester exam than did students who had been in the control group and experienced no spaced practice, although this difference only approached statistical significance.  Performance on the cumulative final exam revealed a statistically significant advantage for students who had experienced spacing in Introductory Calculus for Engineers.  In marked contrast, former experimental and control group members performed nearly identically on the third semester exam, which covered material that was independent of any objectives that received spacing in Introductory Calculus for Engineers.  This links group differences specifically to the manipulation of spacing versus massing.    These findings strongly suggest that mathematics education could benefit from implementation of spaced retrieval practice.  Our experimental design suggests one particular way to implement spaced retrieval practice&mdash;through spacing of quiz questions&mdash;but other methods are easily conceivable, could be tailored to the needs of individual instructors, and need not require the use of online tools such as M...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
