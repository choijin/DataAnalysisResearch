<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Robert Corn and his research group at the University of California, Irvine are developing novel optical sensors for the simultaneous detection of multiple DNA, RNA and protein molecules at extremely low concentrations that can be used for the early identification and diagnosis of cancers, heart attacks, and other diseases.  The development of low-cost, easy-to-use biosensors that can be used for early disease detection, patient status monitoring, and DNA diagnostics has been identified as essential for the improvement of the health of the general population, especially for those who currently do not have access to health care. Additionally, some of the novel materials and sub-microscopic surface structures created in this project exhibit special optical and wetting properties that are similar to those found in biological systems; potentially, these "bio-inspired" surfaces can be used to create inexpensive anti-reflective and self-cleaning surfaces over large areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Two major research efforts are being undertaken in this project: (i) ultrasensitive biosensing via the detection of single biofunctionalized nanoparticles with near infrared surface plasmon resonance microscopy and (ii) the fabrication and application of ordered arrays of gold nanorings, nanowires and nanocones with unique plasmonic, optical and surface properties. The biosensing methods developed in these two projects will incorporate a variety of biomolecular functionalization and surface enzymatic detection chemistries developed previously for planar interfaces. In addition to biosensing applications, novel nanostructured interfaces for applications in near infrared optical metamaterials and biomimetic interfaces including broadband anti-reflective, super hydrophobic and bactericidal surfaces will be developed. The broader impacts of this work include: (i) potential societal benefits from the development of ultra-sensitive multiplexed detection of cancer, cardiac and other disease biomarkers at femtomolar concentrations, and also the development of low cost nanostructured surfaces with unique optical and chemical properties, (ii) the training of students with combined backgrounds in enzymatic bioanalysis, surface biomaterials and surface spectroscopy requisite for jobs in modern biotechnological and next-gen DNA sequencing companies and (iii) the exposure of undergraduates both to the importance of early detection diagnostics and also to possibility of careers in scientific research and biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The use of nanoparticles and nanostructured surfaces to enhance chemical reactivity, improve the detection of biomolecules such as DNA and proteins, and create unique optical materials has become a major theme of modern chemical research.  In this NSF project we have developed a novel method for detecting and characterizing the binding of single metal, oxide and polymeric nanoparticles onto surfaces in real time.  We have also fabricated novel polymeric nanoparticles that can potentially be used for the identification of biological markers and the targeted delivery of therapeutics.  This new optical method is a microscopy based on the refractive index of single nanoparticles.  We employ light waves that have been trapped onto a thin gold film attached to a glass slide; these waves are called surface plasmons, and they are very sensitive to the refractive index of any adsorbed molecules or particles.  Our surface plasmon imaging microscopy can measure in real time the specific binding of gold, oxide or polymer nanoparticles coated with biomolecules such as DNA or proteins to a chemically modified gold surface.  By controlling the surface chemistry, we can measure specific types of nanoparticles that have captured various biomarkers in solution.  Moreover, the intensity of the optical response of a single nanoparticle is indicative of its size and content.  By measuring the distribution of single nanoparticle optical responses, we can obtain unique quantitative information on the ability of the nanoparticles to uptake biologically active molecules for drug delivery and other applications.  In addition to the single nanoparticle microscopy, in this NSF project we have also developed methods for the fabrication of nanostructured surfaces are comprised of ordered arrays of metal or oxide nanorings or nanocones.  These methods employ a combination of colloidal lithography and electrodeposition that can be implemented over relatively large areas (square inches). The resultant nanostructured surfaces exhibit unique optical and catalytic properties.  For example, arrays of gold nanorings are found to strongly absorb light at a particular resonant wavelength that can be varied by adjusting the size and spacing of the nanorings.  These surfaces can be used as sensors for biomolecules, which shift the resonant wavelength upon binding to the nanorings.  Additionally, surfaces that are covered with arrays of gold or zinc oxide nanocones were found to be highly anti-reflective throughout the entire visible region.  These nanocone array surfaces are created on flexible polymer films and can be potentially be used as broadband anti-reflective coatings for windows and solar panels.
