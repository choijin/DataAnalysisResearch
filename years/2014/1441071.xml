<AbstractNarration>The National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) at the University or Colorado will investigate the characteristics and external factors influencing young women's interest in and pursuit of computing during and after high school. Current research provides much evidence about what inhibits female participation in computing, but only piecemeal insights into why, and how, some women persist in the face of many challenges. NCWIT's Aspirations in Computing (AiC) program has attracted thousands of female applicants since 2007. The project team will conduct surveys, interviews and focus groups with AiC applicants. Analyses of the resulting dataset will enable the computing community to learn more about what circumstances encourage or hinder young women's pursuit of computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCWIT will analyze data from the AiC application portal and program to create a dataset on women's pathways in computing from high school to college and early career. This unique, large, national dataset will be built upon through surveys, interviews and focus groups. This project will use a quasi-experimental research design to conduct a longitudinal, mixed methods study to answer the following research questions: 1) What factors support young women's pursuit of computing, and how do these influence their interest, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, perceived social supports/barriers, and intent to persist in computing over time? 2) What challenges do young women encounter in the field of computing, and how do these influence their interest, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, perceived social supports/barriers, and intent to persist in computing over time? 3) What factors contribute to why, and how, some women pursuing computing activities, study or careers, persist despite many challenges to their inclusion in the field?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Learning from Young Women study was a longitudinal mixed methods research project that followed participants from high school to college and, for some, into the workforce.  The longitudinal nature of this study allowed us to study a large sample of women who spanned the pipeline from high school through college through workforce over a period of six years total. An online survey was administered at three points in time, 89 in-depth interviews were conducted, and more than 13,000 posts in an online social media group were analyzed over the course of the six-year study (2012-2019).  From this study, research scientists were able to confirm prior research findings about: the importance of access to computing classes and knowledge about computing careers, the critical role adult influencers play in providing encouragement, and the many obstacles women face in their journey to be a part of the field of computing.  The study broke new ground as well. Results from the survey--administered at three points in time--showed that:  an expressed intent while in high school to study computing actually predicts future pursuit of computing for women in our sample. This has implications for K-12-serving programs who nearly always lack the ability to track their participants over time to see what field they end up pursuing. prior experience with computer programming (i.e., coding) is the most important predictor of pursuit of computer science or computer engineering in later years. In other words, experience with game design, web design, or hardware, while touted as a great introduction to computing, do not on their own seem to have the desired effect of directing women into the field. being an NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Award winner in high school resulted in a much greater than expected number of women who worked or majored in computer science or computer engineering. Being an Award winner also correlated highly with other technology majors, such as information technology or other engineering fields. a sense of belonging in the field of computing was a predictor of working or majoring in computer science or computer engineering. women from races and ethnicities historically underrepresented in computing (e.g., Black Hispanic, Native American) were much less likely to end up majoring or working in computer science or computer engineering, regardless of whether or not they had won an Aspirations in Computing award or had prior experience with computer programming. This suggests that there are greater environmental hurdles for these women than for White or Asian women in the field of computing.   The qualitative components of the study included: (1) 89 interviews with two groups--Awardees of the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Program as well as women who had never applied or won an award and (2) big data analysis of over 13,000 posts in a closed online group for Aspirations Award winners.  The interviews surfaced barriers to pursuit of computing, such as overt and covert discouragement, facing stereotypes about race/ethnicity and gender, and the importance of adult influencers in young women's choices.  The belief in meritocracy in the computing field (i.e., work hard and you will succeed) is interwoven through many of the narratives, and across race/ethnicity. This is both notable and somewhat alarming in that embracing this myth of meritocracy shifts the onus of social change onto the individual. It focuses on individual strengths and shortcomings and thus results in less attention to structural and institutional factors that reinforce racism and sexism. The content analysis of the online group conversations revealed the importance of women having a safe space within which to construct an oppositional discourse that could counter the narrative of exclusion many encountered in computing from high school through college.
