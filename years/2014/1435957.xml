<AbstractNarration>1435957&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland College Park&lt;br/&gt;Payne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to integrate advances in biotechnology and microelectronics by developing generic, biologically-based thin film fabrication methods to incorporate biological function into electronics.  Thin hydrogel films will be triggered to self-assemble in response to locally-imposed electrical signals.  The PIs propose methods to incorporate small molecules, proteins, and cells into the hydrogel films, and will focus on understanding how fabrication conditions control the structure-property-function relations. A multilayer thin film system is proposed that will allow communication between the biology and the electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is potentially transformative in four ways. First, the PIs will apply the advances in biology as an underpinning for materials science. Second, theory and experiments will be coupled to characterize the mesoscale self-assembly of soft matter. Third, the spatial, temporal and quantitative precision of electrical signals will be used to create structure, confer properties and perform functions. Finally, the biotechnology and electronics will be integrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong international collaborations are proposed which will provide students with opportunities to participate in projects that span continents and cultures.  The proposed collaboration with industrial partners will accelerate the incorporation of biology into materials science. The PIs also propose to integrate the activities within existing University partnerships with Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Science and Technology. Because they provide the metrology and regulatory guidelines, these agencies will be integral to the speed that biologically-based materials are introduced into the marketplace. These partnerships will assist in accelerating translation and also in providing meaningful externships for students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thin Film Biofabrication for Integrated Bio-electronics, DMREF-1435957  Gregory F. Payne, William E. Bentley and Jana Shen  Project Goal.  Develop the thin film fabrication knowledge to build integrated circuits for redox-linked bioelectronics  Why Redox-Linked Bioelectronics?  Many of today bioelectronic devices communicatewith biology through biology ionic electrical modality. This ionic electrical modality is integral to biological signaling in the brain, and throughout the nervous and neuromuscular systems. The most common examples of such bioelectronic devices that communicate through this ionic electrical modality are the electrocardiograms and defibrillator which allows the functioning of a complex biological system (i.e., cardiovascular system) to be observed or corrected. Emerging research in biology has revealed that biology also communicates through a different electrical modality based on the flow of electrons. This electron-based redox modality is integral to immune responses and biological signaling in the gut between host cells and their microbiomes. The overarching hypothesis of this proposed research is that if it were possible for electronic devices to communicate with biology through this redox modality, then bioelectronics could be expanded to a broader range of important life science applications in medicine, pharmacy and environmental sciences.  What are Integrated Bioelectronic Circuits?  Advances in microelectronics were enabled by thin film fabrication methods that allowed inorganic materials to be precisely organized to exert exquisite control of the flow of electrons. We envision that integrated bioelectronic circuits could be fabricated through a series of thin film additive manufacturing methods capable of interfacing organic/biological components with conventional electronic circuits. These bioelectronic circuits would control the exchange of electrons and information between electronics and biology.  How to Build Integrated Bioelectronic Circuits?  Compared to conventional electronics, biological components tend to be less stable and thus the materials and methods for fabricating integrated bioelectronic circuits must be biologically-compatible. We reasoned that biology is expert at the biocompatible construction of high-performance material systems and thus we developed bio-based fabrication approaches to create our integrated bioelectronic circuits. Specifically, we: integrated methods from biology, chemistry and engineering; coupled experiment with molecular modeling to accelerate understanding; developed new materials characterization methods to reveal redox-activities; and created a network of researchers from around the world to provide a rich materials science ecosystem.  What Was Accomplished?  There were three broad foci for this project.  Electrobiofabrication. To create a physical interface between electronics and biology we created methods that span electrochemistry and biochemistry. Specifically, we used stimuli-responsive biological polymers (e.g., the polysaccharide chitosan) that could be induced to self-assemble in response to device-imposed electrical signals. Novel experimental and molecular modeling methods were coupled to understand the mechanisms that governed the emergence of hierarchical structure. We envision that because these electro-bio-fabrication methods are simple and safe, they will provide a novel additive manufacturing approach for both factories and maker spaces. Mediated Electrochemical Probing. In traditional microfabrication, conducting and semi-conducting materials are organized into circuits capable of controlling the flow of electrons. Since free electrons do not generally exist in the aqueous environments, biology uses an entirely different approach to control the flow of electrons through reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions in which electrons are carried by individual molecules (e.g., diffusible mediators). We developed an experimental approach based on mediated electrochemical probing (MEP) to observe such redox activities and this method has been extended from building bioelectronic circuits to understanding the redox properties of natural materials (e.g., the pigment melanin) and to creating redox-active medical materials (e.g., antimicrobial bandages). We envision, that MEP will emerge as a routine characterization method both for materials science and also redox biology. Redox Toolbox for Synthetic Biology.

Here, we created a bio-based redox toolbox: (i) to allow components to be engineered with redox-based mechanisms for their controlled integration into our bioelectronic circuits; and (ii) to enable synthetic biology information processors to be wired into the electronic circuitry through redox-based electron flow. We envision, this redox toolbox will enable the creation of bioelectronic circuits that fuse the information processing strengths of electronics with the molecular-based communication capabilities of biology. Creating a Materials Science Ecosystem.  Throughout this project, research was performed by graduate and undergraduate students along with high school interns. These researchers worked on independent projects that were embedded into a larger team that: coupled the expertise of theorists and experimentalists; spanned disciplines and continents; and integrated personnel from academia, government labs, and the private section. This team approach provided a rich training environment and, in some cases, provided opportunities for junior researchers to perform research in labs of our local and international partners.
