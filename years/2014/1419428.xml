<AbstractNarration>The Midwest Women in Mathematics Symposium (Midwest WIMS) will be held at Notre Dame on April 5, 2014.  The goals of this symposium are to highlight women's contributions to the mathematical community, strengthen the network of female mathematicians in the Midwest, encourage new collaborations, and facilitate mentoring among graduate students, postdocs, and professors to help women stay active in research. The symposium will include several mathematical talks, including a keynote address given by Lenore Blum of Carnegie Mellon University. There will be parallel sessions in algebra, dynamical systems, geometry and topology, logic, mathematical biology, partial differential equations, and statistics. In addition, there will be a problem session to encourage new collaborations; problems that cut across disciplines are particularly encouraged. The symposium encourages participation of women in various stages of their academic careers, ranging from graduate students to full faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not uncommon for women with research talent to drop out of the research community. The talks and the problem session will lead women to new and exciting projects. An extended lunch and other breaks will give participants at various stages in their careers the opportunity discuss mathematical problems, or simply exchange stories. The PI expects that some participants will, in discussions that are not strictly mathematical, learn strategies for staying active in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is at http://www3.nd.edu/~wims/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Women mathematicians drop out of research for a variety of reasons.  We know some young women who are trying to stay active in research.  They have gone from a big university, with a group in their research area, to a small college where the teaching load is high, and there is no colleague in their research area.  Many research projects get started at meetings.  However, for women with small children, traveling to a meeting may be difficult.  The idea behind the Midwest Women in Mathematics Symposium (WIMS) is that a one-day meeting close to home might be more manageable.  The organizers hoped that the participants might would have the usual benefits of going to a meeting:  hearing about exciting new developments, exchanging ideas with other mathematicians, and possibly starting new projects.  We also hoped that women at different career stages might share with each other strategies for staying active in research.     In 2013, there was a Women in Mathematics Symposium (WIMS) at the University of Illinois-Chicago.  The meeting included talks in a variety of areas of mathematics.  There was also time for the participants to get acquainted, in particular, over lunch.  The meeting was small, but the participants, women graduate students and faculty from several research universities in the midwest, were enthusiastic.  In 2014, there was a second Midwest WIMS, at Notre Dame.  While the UIC meeting was advertised only at a handful of research universities, the organizers of the Notre Dame meeting contacted people from all colleges and universities in the Midwest.  As a result, more than 100 people registered.     Among the participants were women with small children. There was a lactation room, which was in use a good part of the day.             Like the UIC Meeting, the Notre Dame meeting included talks in a variety of areas in mathematics:  mathematical biology, commutative algebra, statistics, topology, PDE, etc.  The meeting included a problem session, followed by an extended lunch.  At lunch, some tables were marked for discussion of specific issues (e.g., the two-body problem), while other tables were for discussion of mathematical problems.  As an experiment, the organizers set aside some funds to allow participants who found an interesting problem and a collaborator at the meeting.  The idea behind this was that \$200 in outside support is quite different from \$0.  The experiment did produce some new collaborations. In 2015, there was a third Midwest WIMS, at Dominican University.  In addition to NSF funding, the Notre Dame Meeting had significant funding from several sources internal to Notre Dame.  Thus, there were NSF funds remaining.  With the approval of the program director, these were to help pay for the meeting at Dominican.  There will be a 2016 meeting, at UIUC.  This meeting also has NSF funding.  There is a newinnovation---participants may apply for funds to help with childcare.  The Midwest WIMS has become established as an annual event, with the goal of bringing women mathematicians in the Midwest together, so that they can share their mathematics and also encourage each other to stay active in research.
