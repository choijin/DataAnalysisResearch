<AbstractNarration>Acute Renal Failure complicates 5% of all medical and surgical hospital admissions in the United States, but not all hospitals provide acute dialysis. Low cost portable systems will allow more hospitals to provide these emergency treatments.  The proposed project aims to develop a portable hemodialysis system for acute renal replacement therapy that clears toxins at rates required for human treatments. The team intends to enter the market place by introducing a small format portable dialysis enabled by highly efficient silicon nanomembranes applied to ambulatory dialysis and mobile home dialysis analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High membrane permeability is the key to creating a small-format hemodialysis device. Simply, the greater the efficiency of a membrane in clearing toxins, the less membrane area is necessary to achieve a given clearance and the smaller the device format required for clearance. The team has introduced a new class of membrane - ultrathin porous nanocrystalline silicon (pnc-Si). This membrane material is highly manufacturable with pore size control (5 nm to 100 nm), molecular scale thinness (&lt;50 nm), and enough strength to support an atmosphere or more of differential pressure. Because of the molecular-scale thinness, both small molecule diffusion and hydraulic permeability are 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher with pnc-Si than conventional dialysis membranes. The proposed membranes are also orders of magnitude more permeable than 'nanoslot' membranes reported in the literature as having benefit for an implantable hemodialysis system. The team has also shown that the silicon nanomembranes have the ability to separate species that differ by only a few nanometers in size and specifically separate molecules middle weight protein toxins from serum albumin as required in hemodialysis.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this iCorps project was to investigate the commercial marketplace for highly portable hemodialysis made possible by a breakthrough nanomembrane technology developed with the help of prior NSF funding. We began with the assumption that highly portabile dialysis would be useful to emergency responders and intensive care doctors. Folowing the iCorps program we conducted 93 interviews with first respondors, administrators, nephrologists, patients, caregivers and more.

Indeed only 1.4% hemodialysis patients opt for home hemodialysis despite the estimates of nephrologists that 30% of their patients would qualify for and benefit from home hemodialysis. The value proposition that emerged from the iCorp program was that our material could hasten the adoption of home hemodialysis by enabling systems that were safe and simple to operate. Our membrane technology is not sufficient to make the device without being integrated with other key technologies that we identified. Because of the need for this additional development, our team made the decision not to commercialize immediately. The impact of the iCorps program however has been significant. We now have a clear vision of a needed revolution in hemodialysis treatment for the 500,000 Americans currently suffering from end-stage renal disease and an understanding of our role in bringing that revolution about. Our ability to clearly state this vision has led to a successful NSF STTR and a 12<sup>th</sup> percentile on an NIH R21.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/24/2015<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;L&nbsp;Mcgrath</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1445393/1445393_10307687_1435170773448_ScreenShot2015-06-24at2.18.43PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1445393/1445393_10307687_1435170773448_ScreenShot2015-06-24at2.18.43PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Revolutionary Hemodialysis"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1445393/1445393_10307687_1435170773448_ScreenShot2015-06-24at2.18.43PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Revolutionary Hemodialysis"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our concept for a compact, discreet, low flow rate hemodialysis system.</div> <div class="imageCredit">James McGrath</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;L&nbsp;Mcgrath</div> <div class="imageTitle">Revolutionary Hemodialysis</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
