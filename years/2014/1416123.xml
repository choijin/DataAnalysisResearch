<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Naculich at Bowdoin College, an undergraduate institution located in Brunswick, Maine.  This research is part of an on-going effort by the worldwide community of theoretical elementary particle physicists to develop mathematical models to explain the nature and behavior of the smallest constituents of matter (elementary particles).  More specifically, this research aims at developing more efficient mathematical tools for calculating the predictions of existing models of quarks and gluons called "gauge theories".  A second goal of this research is to explore links between gauge theories on the one hand, and theories (such as supergravity and  string theory) that describe the behavior of gravitons, the particles responsible for the force of gravity, on the other. The insights gained through this research will be disseminated through journal publications, seminars, and conference proceedings.  This research also integrally involves participation by undergraduates, and will therefore contribute to their education by providing hands-on training in research methods in theoretical physics, as well as exposure to quantum mechanics, group theory, and quantum field theory.  Such involvement will encourage and prepare highly-talented students for graduate study and careers in scientific fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more technical terms, this project focuses on both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of supersymmetric gauge theory and supergravity theory, as illuminated by their connection to string theory.  In particular, this research will explore constraints among tree-level and loop-level gauge theory scattering amplitudes that are generic to gauge theory, independent of the matter content of the theory.  These include both constraints that depend only on the gauge group, as well as Bern-Carrasco-Johansson type relations.  The research will further investigate the structure of loop-level SU(N) gauge theory amplitudes that are subleading in the 1/N expansion, their infrared divergences, and potential iterative structures among these amplitudes.  Finally, the project will study the structure of the amplitudes of supergravity, their infrared divergences, and potential relations between supergravity and supersymmetric Yang-Mills amplitudes at the loop level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant has supported research that is part of an on-going effort by the world-wide community of theoretical elementary particle physicists to develop mathematical models to explain the nature and behavior of the smallest constituents of matter (elementary particles).  More specifically, this research has aimed at achieving a deeper understanding of, and at developing more efficient mathematical tools for calculating the predictions of, existing models of quarks and gluons called "gauge theories."  A second goal of this research has been to demonstrate the existence of heretofore unexpected links between gauge theories on the one hand, and theories that describe the behavior of gravitons, the particles responsible for the force of gravity, on the other.  One of the goals in studying these models is to calculate "scattering amplitudes" which are used to find the probabilities of various events that can occur in an experiment.    The calculation of amplitudes is traditionally done using a tool called a "Feynman diagram", and can be extremely complicated, if not prohibitively difficult.  Over the last couple of decades, alternative approaches for calculating amplitudes have been explored, one of the most recent being the "scattering equation" approach of Cachazo, He, and Yuan.  Dispensing altogether with Feynman diagrams, this approach presents expressions for the scattering amplitude in terms of matrix expressions evaluated at solutions of a set of equations known as the scattering equations.  Their approach was applied to scattering amplitudes containing only massless particles.  Two of the papers resulting from this grant have extended the scattering equation approach to amplitudes involving massive particles, showing that this approach is useful beyond its initial application.  This required a modification of the both scattering equations as well as the matrix expressions that are evaluated.  Another outcome from this grant was the discovery of a new property of gauge theory amplitudes, called "color factor symmetry".  This symmetry, which was shown to be a property of gauge theory amplitudes involving both gluons and quarks, leads to the conclusion that there are algebraic relations among various types of scattering amplitudes.   These relations, known as Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations, were previously known to be valid, but the underlying reason for them remained mysterious.  In the work resulting from this grant, they were seen to arise at least partially from the underlying symmetries of the theory.  The behavior of scattering amplitudes in the regime where the momenta of some of the particles is much smaller than the others (called the soft limit) has long been of interest to physicists.   Recently there has been much attention to corrections to the amplitudes in the soft limit (called subleading soft limit, or next-to-soft).  Two of the papers resulting from this grant explored the structure and implications of subleading soft behavior in both gauge theories and theories of gravity.  All of the findings of this project have been communicated to the larger particle theory community in the form of papers published in refereed journals and seminars delivered at other universities and at international workshops and conferences.
