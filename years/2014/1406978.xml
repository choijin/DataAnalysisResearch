<AbstractNarration>Hydrogen embrittlement, a sudden and catastrophic failure, of metallic structures, accounts for losses equal to 3 percent of the gross domestic product.  This enhanced failure mechanism presents a significant challenge to transitioning from a fossil fuel powered transportation system to one powered by hydrogen.  For this to occur, the mechanisms by which hydrogen enhances the failure must be discovered.  This advance will enable design of alloys for use in hydrogen environments as well as development of models to predict component lifetime. This experimental collaborative effort between UW-Madison and Cornell University seeks to identify the fundamental mechanisms driving the hydrogen-enhanced failure.   Students educated in this effort will gain international experience through collaboration with faculty at Kyushu University in Japan and their International Institute for Carbon Neutral Energy Research.  In addition, the PIs will develop and distribute engineering based in-class activities that emphasize mechanical properties of metallic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deleterious impact of a hydrogen environment on the mechanical properties of metallic structures is well-documented and yet the fundamental mechanisms driving the enhanced sudden failure remain elusive.  This collaborative effort will employ a multi-scale experimental approach designed to test the premise that solute hydrogen can accelerate the evolution of the microstructure (strain) and it, along with attendant high hydrogen concentration, establishes the local conditions that determine the fracture path and mechanism. The influence of hydrogen on the evolution of microscale lattice strains and orientations will be probed dynamically using high energy x-ray diffraction and in-situ mechanical loading at Cornell High-energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). This effort will be coupled with post-loading microstructure characterization in the TEM of materials loaded to varying degrees of strain under different conditions, including those used in the in-situ testing.  Confirmation of the premise will provide a basis for design of hydrogen tolerant microstructures as well as for physically-based predictive models.</AbstractNarration>

and can break quickly and without warning.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called hydrogen embrittlement, and it is a significant problem for the steel industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;A major example of hydrogen embrittlement was the steel safety rods in California&rsquo;s replacement Bay Bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydrogen caused one third of the rods cracked during construction in 2013 and more rods cracked in

understood.&nbsp;&nbsp;The many experiments over the years have produced seemingly contradictory results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many different models have been developed to try and explain hydrogen embrittlement.&nbsp;&nbsp;This project studied one model, the Hydrogen Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP) model.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plasticity is the process plastic deformation occurs by.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plastic deformation is defined as a permanent change in the shape of an object.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day examples of plastic deformation are bending paperclips and wrinkling aluminum foil.&nbsp;Plastic deformation happens in many materials, including metals.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an important part of manufacturing and used to make many metal objects, from wires to I-beams.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The HELP model says that when hydrogen enters a metal, it changes the plasticity inside the metal at a nearly atomic level.&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes cause the metal to lose toughness and be more brittle at the large scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;The small-scale predictions of the HELP model have been seen using powerful electron microscopes.&nbsp;&nbsp;One missing piece of the HELP model is how these atomic scale measurements add up to the large-scale changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all metals are made up of crystals, periodic arrays of atoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystals are a hundred thousand to a million times larger than an atom, but still thousands of times smaller than the object they make up.&nbsp;This makes the crystal scale a useful stepping stone between the atomic scale and the scale of everyday objects.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project was a collaboration with researchers at the University of Wisconsin Madison, JFE Steel Corporation, and Kyushu University.&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project was to study how hydrogen changed the plasticity of metals at the crystal scale by comparing the plastic deformation of pure nickel with and without hydrogen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure nickel was used as a stand in for stainless steel.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tool used in this project was high energy x-ray diffraction, abbreviated HEXD.&nbsp;&nbsp;Diffraction is caused by x-rays interacting with a crystal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The periodic arrangement of atoms in the crystal acts like a set of mirrors, scattering the x-rays in very precise ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattered x-rays hit are measured and the properties of the crystal that scattered them can be calculated.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Four diffraction experiments were carried out at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) as part of this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of the experiments were in-situ experiments, meaning force was applied to the samples while the x-ray measurements were being made.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth experiment looked at samples that had been deformed by high pressure torsion (HPT) beforehand.&nbsp;&nbsp;A diagram of the experiment set up is shown in Figure 1 and a detector image from the HPT samples is shown in Figure 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The data from all the experiments was difficult to process, so new data processing methods were developed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The new method was applied to the HPT samples and was able to separate out the signals from individual crystals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The signals from each crystal were characterized using statistical measurements: the variance, skewness, and kurtosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 3 shows the meaning of these values in 1D.&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystals were then clustered using a simple machine learning technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;The results, plotted in Figure 4, showed there was a single type of crystal in the no hydrogen samples, but two types of crystals in the hydrogen-charged samples.&nbsp;These two types of grains were called the high cluster and low cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;One out of six hydrogen charged crystals were in the high cluster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A simple model of plastic deformation was created and used to further understand the results from the HPT samples.&nbsp;&nbsp;The model revealed the crystals in the high cluster had their deformation concentrated into a small space, or localized.&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystals in the low cluster were like the no hydrogen crystals.&nbsp;This result means hydrogen does not affect all locations in a material equally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, some spots are unaffected by hydrogen while others are strong affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;This suggests the impact of hydrogen measured by an experiment will depend on how large of a volume is measure, which may help explain the results of previous experiments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The results from the HPT samples are being written up for publication and the data from the latest in-situ experiment is being processed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>
