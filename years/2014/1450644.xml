<AbstractNarration>The I-Corps for Learning project addresses the problem of developing a well-prepared STEM workforce that is crucial to the Nation's health and economy, by laying the foundation for broad implementation of effective instructional practices and advances in education. I-Corps for Learning provides support for teams of educational innovators to accelerate and scale-up novel effective practices in a sustainable manner. Help for teams takes the form of workshops, mentoring, and participation in a cohort of like-minded educational innovators. The I-Corps-L approach attempts to utilize insights gained from bringing product discoveries to market to create an entrepreneurial approach to bringing learning innovations into situations where they can benefit society.  Educational innovations in this case applies to developments that address K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research, as well as learning in informal science education environments.  In providing organizational and logistical support, the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is collaborating with the I-Corps-L Instructional Team led by Dr. Karl Smith. This project has the potential of helping to achieve the goal of educational transformation through propagation and scale-up of educational innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps for Learning model is centered around participating three-person teams.  Team composition includes a principal investigator who has developed an education innovation through prior support from the National Science Foundation, an entrepreneurial lead who is committed to leading the team through the investigation, and a mentor who understands the nature of successful education-focused innovations.  Training includes an introductory three-day training session, five online sessions, and a closing two-day training session.  This project is designed to fill the gap between educational innovations of proven effectiveness in enhancing student learning and the widespread use of such practices. I-Corps L, is based on a process of hypothesis testing and investigation along with clarification of user needs. This approach can benefit education researchers by helping them to develop ways to broaden the impact of innovations in teaching and learning science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In tandem with its logistical and organizational services ASEE is conducting an evaluation to assess individual sessions within the face-to-face meetings, overall elements of the multi-day training workshops, and handling of meeting logistics. In addition, the participants will answer formative questions throughout the effort to ensure success in meeting workshop objectives, and properly accommodate all aspects associated with the virtual sessions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Because education and research are the primary roles of faculty, entrepreneurship and outward-looking business mindset are often not the focus of many college faculty and academic departments. Thus, new ideas for improved instruction and student performance may not get properly tested, refined, and retooled. In addition, they often do not go beyond the doors of a particular university or even a particular department within that university.     This award supported the first full cohort of Innovation Corps for Learning (I-Corps L), a spin-off of the signature National Science Foundation I-Corpsprogram.  I-Corps L is designed specifically for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educators with innovative teaching strategies, technologies, or set of curriculum materials. I-Corps L aims to foster an entrepreneurial mindset within the education community and to impact the way innovations are designed and implemented. It provides real world, hands-on training and a model approach to assess the potential for sustainable scalability of education innovations.     Twenty-four teams of 3-4 people participated in the eight-week program that immersed them in experimentation, customer discovery, and iterative design. Each team included the project PI, an Entrepreneurial Leader (EL) and a Mentor.  In I-Corps L participating teams did go through a hypothesis-testing, scientific method of discovery to gather important insights and identify issues associated with their projects. Teams were required to go "out of the classroom" to conduct interviews, study customer needs, collect feedback, and find partnership opportunities.     Participants rated "customer discovery", where they interviewed at least 100 potential customers about their innovation, as the most valuable facet of the program.  In most instances participants left the program with an expanded skillset and tools to evaluate and translate their research into applicable methods for educational transformation. One participant noted, "I-Corps L has opened up a new knowledge-base for me to understand how lab research or special educational programs can be scaled up to take them out to the real world."     Addressing the needs of diverse participant profiles and motivations, key recommendations from the external evaluation included incorporating business models that accommodate a broader range of cost and benefit structures reflecting metrics beyond revenue, and including instructors who have experience with revenue-generating innovations while assessing social impacts.     Overall, the program not only met but exceeded expectations for nine out of ten participants, with over two thirds suggesting they would recommend the program to their colleagues. One participant noted, "[the course is] incredibly effective at challenging educators to approach their work from a new angle.  I think the long term effects of I-Corp L will be quite impressive at improving our national education landscape." Another participant emphasized that "every large educational project that is funded should go through this course or at least a shortened version of it."
