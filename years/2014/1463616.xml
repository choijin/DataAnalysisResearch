<AbstractNarration>The safety of lithium ion batteries has seen an increased concern with respect to the customers' usage, ground shipment and air transportation. Therefore, the next generation of these batteries must be safer in addition to high performance. The electrolyte is one of the key components in a battery. It plays a very important role for battery safety and performance. Currently, liquid electrolytes generally possess high ionic conductivity and good interfacial properties but come with safety issues. Solid polymer or inorganic solid electrolytes are essentially safe and show excellent mechanical properties. However, they have low ionic conductivity in comparison and poor interfacial contact/adhesion with electrodes, which limits their broad practical applications. Gel electrolytes are usually a combination of liquid and solid showing a promising type of high-performance electrolyte. However, several critical issues including safety concern and inferior mechanical performance still exist. Therefore, this study on a high performance electrolyte that will combine safety and beneficial properties of various electrolytes is significant and important for broad industry sectors, as well as further benefit the clean energy driven market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to create a novel composite, gum-like (or gummy) material for electrolytes with the desired performance for next-generation energy storage devices including various lithium ion batteries. This gummy material possesses the following critical properties for electrolytes; high ionic conductivity at the liquid electrolyte level, strong adhesion to maintain good/stable contact with solid electrodes, good mechanical properties and the safety of solid material level. The design is based on a three-phase network composed or liquid component, (i.e. organic liquid electrolyte), solid particle component of thermally sensitive particles and soft matrix polar polymer. The optimized network formation will lead to the desired multi-functionalities for the gummy composite. The scope of the research includes: (1) investigation of the roles of the individual component in controlling the critical properties (conductivity, mechanical properties, adhesion etc.); (2) establishment of structure-property relationships for the gummy composite materials; (3) optimization of the compositions, structures and properties of the gummy composite for high performance electrolyte application. The intellectual merits of this project include: solving critical safety and interfacial problems for the electrolyte, introducing a new strategy for safety improvements in batteries especially thermal-protection capability; leading to a new approach to fabricate functional composite materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1. Studies on solid phase affecting the fabrication of gum-like electrolytes  Effects of solid phase on the morphological structure, ionic conductivity, mechanical properties (modulus) and adhesion property were studied firstly. These three factors: (1) partcle surface charateristics that are affected by surfactants, (2) size of wax particules and (3) particle loading, which play important role in controlling the significant properties of the gum-like electrolytes, were investigated.  Outcomes:  1)    The solid phase, that is, wax particles, plays a critical role in controlling the significant properties of the gum-like electrolytes, including the ion-conductivity and mechanical properites.  2)    Surfactants provide an effective way to control the surface properties of the wax particles, which can adjust the interactions among polymer matrix, wax particles and plasticizer and finally the electrolyte properties.  3)    The size of the wax particles can notably change the ion-conductivity and mechanical properties due to its ability to adjust the distance/pathway for ion-conduction. A larger particle can improve the ion conductivity as it gives rise to a more "straight" pathway along the interface for ion-conduction.  4)    There is no obvious contribution from the wax particles to the adhesion properties, including the surfacatant on the wax particles and the size of the wax particles. This indicates that the strong adhesion properties are mainly contributed by the polymer matrix, that is, an amorphous polymer-Li+ complex as will be introduced in Part II.     2. Effects of lithium salt loading on the structures and properties  Another important component that controls the gummy structure and properties of the gum-like electrolyte is the lithium salt loading.   Outcomes:  1)    Appropriate loading of lithium salt is the key to achieve an amorphous polymer-Li+ complex. The unique interactions between the polymer matrix and lithium salt can finally result in the dissolution of lithium salt in electrolyte. Although the polymer-Li system has been studied for almost half century, to the knowledge of the PI, this is the first time to report amorphous polymer-Li as a material for solid electrolytes.  2)    The amorphous polymer-Li+ complex shows much higher ion-conductivity and good adhesion properties as compared with traditional solid polymeric electrolyte or polymeric electrolyte with extra lithium salt. This finding also supports reported studies with conclusion that the ion-conduction in conventional solid electrolytes is dominated by the amorphous phase of the material.     3. Stability and thermal protection capability studies of the gum-like electrolyte  The stablity of electrolyte-electrode interfacical adhesion was studied and thermal-protection capability via melting of solid particles (wax particles was selected in this study.  Outcomes:  1)    The performance stability of the gum-like electrolytes is demonstrated to be exceptional. After the electrolytes are bent for the first 300 cycles, the interfacial resistances keeps very stable.  2)    The wax particles endow the gum-like electrolytes with on-and-off function, which significantly improves the safety. When the wax particles are melted, they form an non-conductive wax layer on the electrode/electrolyte interface, and then the ion-conduction pathways are blocked and shuts down.     4. Further improving performance of the gummy electrolyte and simulation studies  Outcomes:  1)    By manipulating the protein structures by ceramic nanoparticles, the ion-conduction can be promoted. When the protein/ceramic hybrid nanoparticles are introduced to the gum-like electrolyte matrix, the overal electrolyte performance (e.g. ionic conductivity, mechaincal properties, adhesion property, etc.) is notably enhanced.  2)    Introducing ceramic nanoparticles together with the protein denaturation, the protein structure can be substantially expanded and opened up. Thus, the more open-up structure of protein leads to promoted ion-conduction due to the unique protein-ion interactions.  3)    Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies confirmed that the protein/cermic hybrid that was preppred appropriately further improved performance of the gummy electrolytes.     5. Studies of battery performance with the gum-like electrolytes  To solve the electrolyte-electrode contact issues, we further developed a gum-like electrode matrix to fabricate non-porous electrodes. This gum-like nanocomposite as learning from polymer nanocomposites integrates the critical properties/functions.  Outcomes:  1)    The non-porous electrode matrix concept realized by an gum-like binder propses an attractive solution for stabilizing electrode structures especially high-capacity electrodes.  2)    The gum-like binder present good rhelogical properties, good performance stability and self-healing behavior, which is a good material for flexible electronic devices.  3)    The gum-like binder with dual conductivities (i.e. e-conductivity and i-conductivity) can provide excellent electrode performance. Compared with conventional porous electrodes, the non-porous gummy electrodes deliver much higher electrocheimcal performance.     6. Fabrication of gum-like binder for improving battery performance  Inspired by the study of gum-like electrolytes above, we extended the invention of the gum-like electrolytes to polymer alloy as binder materials via making gum-like binders for achieving high performance batteries.  Outcomes:  1)    The gum-like binder is modified and sucessfully improves the mechaincal properties and stability of the conventional binder.  2)    The modified gum-like binder notably improves the structure uniformity, interface quality, adhesion strength, mechanical flexibility and electrochemical performance of the resulting electrodes.
