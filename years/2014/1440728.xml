<AbstractNarration>Multi-institutional distributed scientific research collaborations involving the sharing of resources are challenging and fraught with a lot of effort in obtaining and managing multiple identities. Secure Access for Everyone (SAFE) creates an Identity and Access Management (IAM) infrastructure that facilitates easy access to campus Cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources for local, state, regional and national researchers. SAFE will achieve this by implementing the following three-part strategy: (1) Integrating CI resources with opensource IAM software; (2) Facilitating collaboration and coordination of multi-institutional resources; and (3) Leveraging custom gateways using InCommon for federated access. The gateways to these resources are enhanced to include multiple access methods, including web and command line and integrate the use of HPC schedulers and access from the Open Science Grid. The SAFE architecture initially provides federated access to library databases, High Performance Computing resources, Virtual Computing Lab (a cloud based compute reservation environment), and the Sunshine State Educational and Research Computing Alliance?s (SSERCA) collaborative storage ecosystem. CI resources such as these perform a key role in supporting scientific collaborations across campuses, regional, national, international and virtual organizations, and spanning scientific communities. These multi-institutional science research collaborations involving the sharing of resources are challenging and fraught with a lot of effort in obtaining and managing multiple identities. SAFE solves this by allowing researchers to login to CI resources with their local institutions credentials for trusted access. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secure Access for Everyone (SAFE) is a well coordinated usable federated identity and access management system that leverages and enhances campus CI in order to support trusted collaboration and sharing of compute and data resources that is now essential to facilitate multi-institutional scientific research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
