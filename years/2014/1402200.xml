<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided support to the PI for postdoctoral research with Dr. Clifford Taubes, of Harvard University.  This research was about systems that evolve in time, called dynamical systems.  While such systems are of fundamental importance in many fields, for example in physics and economics, they are very difficult to understand, and new mathematical ideas are needed for this.  During the tenure of the grant, the PI applied ideas from geometry and mathematical physics to better understand certain particularly important dynamical systems, called Hamiltonian systems.  Dr. Taubes is one of the leading figures in the world in this kind of work, and provided invaluable mentorship.    Many of the PI?s research results during the period of the grant improved our understanding of the basic geometry of "phase spaces"; a phase space is a geometric object which keeps track of the states of the system.   For systems with many parameters, the phase space will have high dimension, and the PI proved a landmark result in this setting.  The PI also established new links between the geometry of phase spaces, and a different branch of mathematics concerned with finite structures and counting, called combinatorics.  Using this connection, the PI made new contributions to the field of combinatorics in joint work with Li and Stanley; Stanley is one of the world leaders in the field of combinatorics.  The PI also developed new techniques for understanding the combinatorics that arise in certain problems about the geometry of phase spaces.  The PI also launched several new collaborations during the tenure of this grant.  Perhaps the highlight is a new collaboration with Hutchings and Pomerleano, which is expected to show that many Hamiltonian systems have infinitely many periodic configurations.  Periodic configurations are configurations of the system which recur infinitely often, and are crucial for understanding the system.    Concerning educational development, the PI supervised or co-supervised three undergraduate theses during the grant, organized a seminar at Harvard that was synergistic with the material mentioned above, coorganized a summer school for early-career researchers, coorganized a special session of an American Mathematical Society workshop, and lectured widely, for example giving a minicourse in Spain.  The PI also continued longstanding efforts to promote undergraduate research in mathematics.  The PI disseminated research results widely, for example through uploading monographs to the mathematical community?s "arxiv" preprint server, and by submitting research products for publication in highly-regarded peer-reviewed journals; many of these articles have by now been accepted.
