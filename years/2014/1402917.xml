<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jeffrey S. Johnson of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill examines novel and selective methods for carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond constructions with a focus on stereoselective variants that can be achieved with earth-abundant catalysts or with organic small molecule catalysts.  New strategies and catalysts for the redox functionalization of carbon frameworks that take advantage of reactions that only use dioxygen (O2) for oxidation or dihydrogen (H2) for reduction are also under investigation.  Again, a fundamental consideration in these studies is the identification of useful, highly active catalysts that are abundant, nontoxic and readily available and thus, this project focuses on sustainable chemistries.  The efficient preparation of small molecule building blocks directly impinges on diverse and crucial areas such as human health (through the preparation of small molecule therapeutics) and technology (via the creation of novel materials). The advances made by this research play a fundamental role in providing sustainable access to these valuable building blocks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is performed in collaboration with Professor Shuli You of Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry in China and Professor Luiz Dias of the Instituto de Quimica - UNICAMP in Brazil. Together, these groups combine their separate areas of expertise to convert readily-available feedstocks into value-added complex products useful to the chemical industry.  Other broader impacts of this work include the training of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students and an international exchange of ideas and expertise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Small organic molecules are the building blocks for most clinical therapeutics and the creation of new chemical matter is central to the exploration of new chemical space.  In many circumstances this endeavor requires recourse to reagents that are costly, toxic, or non-renewable.  The focus of this program has been to develop reaction chemistry that permits the exploration of new chemical space under the umbrella of sustainable synthesis.  We have successfully developed multiple reaction platforms that convert feedstock chemicals into value-added chiral small molecule building blocks that should serve as useful platforms exploring chemical space.  A particular focus of our work has been on what we termed complexity-building redox reactions.  Many redox reactions, particularly oxidation reactions, are "concession steps" and utilize nonideal oxidants from the standpoint of molecular weight and/or toxicity.  Molecular oxygen (O2) represents a near-ideal oxidant and we have developed new controlled autooxidation reactions that are exquisitely chemoselective and directly deliver useful functionality that can be manipulated in novel ways.  These new autooxidation reactions are catalyzed by an earth-abundant metal catalyst.  Our method takes a gestalt view of the reaction sequences and focuses not just on green reactions, but green series of reactions.  As illustrated in the accompanying image, the building blocks that go into our sequences are simple, abundant, and commercially available.  Two of the redox reactions are mediated by the cleanest redox reagents: molecular hydrogen and molecular oxygen.  The sequences deliver completely new heterocyclic structures with complete control of the relative three dimensional relationships for groups emanating from the ring.
