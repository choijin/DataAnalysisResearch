<AbstractNarration>The Asian Monsoon system is an important component of the global climate system that plays a major role in the transport of heat and moisture from the tropics to higher latitudes.  Even small variations in the strength and/or timing of seasonal rainfall can have significant impacts on the billions of people living within the Asian monsoon domain, yet climate model projections of future monsoon changes still remain uncertain.  While paleoclimate records have significantly advanced our understanding of summer monsoon variability in some regions, we still know very little about the range and mechanisms of monsoon variability in Southeast Asia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, a collaborative effort between scientists from the University of California, Irvine and William Patterson College of New Jersey, will generate high-resolution speleothem (cave calcite deposit) records of past hydroclimate variability over the last 20,000 years from Laos, a key site at the interface between the Indian and East Asian monsoon systems.  The new oxygen isotope records will document changes in Southeast Asian monsoon strength on sub-decadal to orbital timescales, filling in a key spatial and temporal gap in the paleoclimate record of the tropics. Through integrating paleoclimate proxy data, instrumental climate data, and climate model analyses, the project will address three main questions:  (1) How has Southeast Asian monsoon intensity varied over the past 20,000 years in response to orbital forcing, millennial-scale abrupt climate events, and interannual to multi-decadal climate modes?; (2) What are the mechanisms that control precipitation and speleothem oxygen isotopes on interannual to orbital timescales in Laos?; and (3) How do the Laos speleothem records relate to broader spatial and temporal patterns of past climate variability in the tropical Indo-Pacific, the Asian monsoon region, and high latitudes?  In addition to the scientific outcomes, this project will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and will be incorporated in outreach efforts aimed at improving the participation of underrepresented groups in the geosciences.   For instance, a hands-on field and laboratory exercise on paleoclimate, climate change, and native culture will be developed for the NSF funded American Indian Summer Institute in Earth System Science held at the University of California, Irvine each summer.</AbstractNarration>

Results from our analysis of the IsoGSM model simulated precipitation &delta;18O and instrument climate data (Yang et al., 2016) have advanced our understanding of the controls on isotopic variability in SEAM precipitation and paleoclimate archives.  A primary outcome from this work is that variations in monsoon intensity and upstream rainout, which have been recently invoked to explain coherent speleothem &delta;18O variability on orbital and millennial timescales, also operate over shorter, interannual timescales.

Finally, results from our work provide the first evidence for a centennial-scale drying event during the late Holocene, coincident with the so-called ?4.2 ka event?, which was characterized by extreme drought conditions in eastern Africa and Eurasia. The nature and geographical extent of this climate event has been a topic of great interest because of its potential connections with societal upheavals in western Asia and northeastern Africa. However, while paleoclimate data from India and southern China show evidence for a large-scale ?megadrought? during this period, there have hitherto been no high-resolution and well-dated records from mainland southeast Asia (MSEA) to document the regional footprint of this event. This is somewhat surprising because, whilst Archaeological research in mainland Southeast Asia is still a relatively recent endeavor, a gap in evidence called the "missing millennia" has emerged. The gap falls during the middle Holocene ca. 6000-4000 years BP when few sites have dated deposits. A suite of three Holocene &delta;18O and &delta;13C speleothem records from TM cave document one of, if not the, largest droughts of the Holocene between ~5 ka and ~3.5 ka, consistent in timing with the "missing millennia"; this suggests that this event may have had a significant impact on the human populations of the region at this time.
