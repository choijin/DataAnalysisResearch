<AbstractNarration>Systems engineering addresses the way the design and development of complex products like aircraft, automobiles, rockets or ships are technically coordinated.  Better systems engineering will improve these products and allow them to be developed faster and for less money.  To improve systems engineering, it needs to be built onto a scientific foundation.  This project will conduct a workshop bringing together the leading minds in systems engineering theory from academics and from government and plan future research that can put a scientific foundation under systems engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together approximately 35 researchers from universities around the US and beyond to assess where the next steps will lie in developing theoretical underpinnings for the practice of systems engineering.  The workshop will address four areas:  System Architecting and Conceptual Design; Guidance; Models; and Measurements.  Current practice in systems engineering will be discussed, existing theoretical foundations will be noted, and the group of participants will assess needs and opportunities for deeper understanding and more rigorous practice.  Results of the workshop will be disseminated through a web site, conference presentation, and archival publication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project conducted a workshop to develop foundational theories of systems engineering, then disseminated the results in panel discussions at four conferences during the year after the workshop.    The overall purpose was to make systems engineering into more of a science and less of an art.  Systems engineering is the way we technically coordinate the design and development of complex products like aircraft, automobiles, rockets or ships.  Better systems engineering will improve these products and allow them to be developed faster for less cost.  To improve systems engineering, it needs to be put onto a scientific foundation like mechanical or electrical engineering.  This scientific foundation is essential to be able to distinguish better methods, processes and tools from inferior methods, processes and tools.  Only by identifying better methods can systems engineering be improved.  This workshop brought together 50 researchers from universities in the US and Europe to assess where the next steps lie in developing theoretical underpinnings for the practice of systems engineering.  The workshop addressed four areas:  System Architecting and Conceptual Design; Guidance; Models; and Measurement.  Current practice in systems engineering was discussed, existing theoretical foundations were noted, and  the group assessed needs and opportunities for deeper understanding and more rigorous practice.
