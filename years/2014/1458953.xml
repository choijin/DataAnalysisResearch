<AbstractNarration>People's sociopolitical and cultural views change as a result of their experience. An important component of this experience is the outbreak of major events in their lives. These events may be personal, like getting married or divorce, the birth of one's child or the loss of a loved one, starting a new career or losing a job. Life-changing events may also happen at a broader societal level, including a sudden shift in the economic conditions, a major societal upheaval or revolutionary development, sudden changes in the government through a military coup, or political repression by the government or an act of violence perpetrated by terror groups. Such events may reinforce or challenge cherished beliefs, causing a shift in people's orientation toward either conservatism or liberalism. In the contemporary Middle East, comparative historical studies of ideological production and cross-national values surveys have shown associations between changes in social conditions and changes in the dominant sociopolitical discourses and people?s value orientations It is, however, unclear how changes in these conditions explain changes in discourses and values. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In prior research comparative surveys were carried out in Egypt in 2011 and Turkey in 2013, using a nationally representative sample of more than 3,000 adults in each country. This project will re-interview the same respondents in order to assess how changes in their life conditions and the outbreak of events that transpired since the last surveys affected their values and political behavior. This project will contribute to a mechanismic explanation of change in values and political engagement by launching a panel study in Egypt and Turkey, where adequate infrastructure for survey research is available. This panel study will (1) explain changes in sociopolitical and cultural values; (2) examine how variation in participation in such activities as peaceful demonstrations, political protests, and political violence is linked to changes in (a) inter-group relations, (b) identity and framing, (c) attitudes toward the West and liberal values, (d) religious fundamentalism, (e) dysphoric emotions or personal efficacy, and (f) sources of news information (the Internet, satellite TV, mobiles); (3) assess how people's perceptions of corruption and trustworthiness of public officials are linked to political action and conflict; and (4) evaluate the implications of this study for peace and national security. This project will also contribute to survey methodology by (1) including a new Event History Calendar in the questionnaire, and (2) assessing the effects of privacy during the interview and interviewer characteristics on respondents.</AbstractNarration>

The Data  In Egypt, of the nationally representative sample of 3,496 adults interviewed in 2011, 2,430 were re-interviewed in 2016, a response rate of 70%. To replenish sample attrition, 1,428 additional respondents were interviewed, bringing the total to 3,858. In Turkey, of the nationally representative sample of 3,019 respondents in 2013, 1,682 respondents were re-interviewed in 2016, a response rate of 56%. There was an additional 1,077 interviews to replenish respondents, bringing the total to 2,759.  Findings  Between the two waves, the respondents displayed greater support for secular politics, religious tolerance, gender equality, and national identity. Indices of these constructs are constructed to more effectively assess these changes.  Secular Politics  This index is the average of responses to four questions: Do you (4) strongly agree, (3) agree, (2) disagree, or (1) strongly disagree that your country would be a better place (i) If religion and politics were separated, and (ii) If its government were similar to Western [American or European] governments. (iii) Is it (1) very good, (2) fairly good, (3) fairly bad, or (4) very bad to have an Islamic government where religious authorities have absolute power; and (iv) Is it (1) very important, (2) somewhat important, (3) least important, or  (4) not at all important for a good government to implement only the sharia.  This index increased in Egypt from 2.34 in 2011 to 2.72 in 2016, and in Turkey from 2.83 in 2013 to 2.93 in 2016 (p &lt; .001).  Religious Tolerance  This index is based on averaging responses to four questions: Do you (1) strongly agree, (2) agree, (3) disagree, or (4) strongly disagree that (i) ?Our children should not be allowed to learn about other religions,? (ii) ?The followers of other religions should not have the same rights as mine,? (iii) ?Criticism of religion should not be tolerated,? and (iv) ?Criticism of religious leaders should not be tolerated.? This also increased in Egypt from 2.25 in 2011 to 2.60 in 2016, and in Turkey from 2.43 in 2013 to 2.70 in 2016 (p &lt; .001).  Gender Equality  This index is the average of responses to five questions: Do you (1) strongly agree, (2) agree, (3) disagree, or (4) strongly disagree that: (i) It is acceptable for a man to have more than one wife, (ii) A wife must always obey her husband, (iii) Men make better political leaders, (iv) University education is more important for a boy than it is for a girl, and (v) Men should have more right to a job than women.  The value of this index increased in Egypt from 2.08 in 2011 to 2.18 in 2016, and in Turkey from 2.71 in 2013 to 2.77 in 2016 (p &lt; .01).     National Identity  Respondents were asked if they were primarily (1) Egyptians or Turkish citizens; (2) Muslims; (3) Arabs, Kurds, or Turks; or (4) other. The available longitudinal data provide a better picture of the change in identity. In 2001 and 2007 Egypt, 9% and 12% defined themselves as Egyptians, compared to 78% and 84% who defined themselves as Muslims, respectively. Following the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, these figures changed dramatically. Identification with Egypt jumped to 52% in summer 2011, 56% in fall 2011, 61% in 2014, and then dropped to 43% in 2016 (after the military coup), and those identifying themselves as Muslims dropped to 45%, 46%, 37%, and then increased to 54%. In Turkey, those who defined themselves as Turkish citizens went up from 34% in 2001 to 44% in 2013, and to 53% in 2016, while those defining as Muslims declined from 64% to 39%, and then to 36%.  Publications and Paper Presentations at Conferences  An analysis of these findings are presented in Mansoor Moaddel, Clash of Values in the Middle East and North Africa: Islamic Fundamentalism versus Liberal Nationalism (Columbia University Press, forthcoming), ?The Tenacity of the Arab Spring in People?s Perceptions: Trends in Values among Egyptians,? Working Paper Series, Economic Research Forum, Giza, Egypt, pp. 1-66, 2018, and findings presented to public officials at the State Department and the meetings of European Consortium for Political Research in Hamburg, Germany, August 2018; and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion in Los Vegas, Nevada, October 2018.
