<AbstractNarration>The proposed team introduces a new paradigm for the design and manufacture of pharmaceutical dosage forms. The new platform technology, 3D Integrated Pharmaceuticals (3D IP), is inspired after the impressive progress realized by the 3D IC (3D Integrated Circuits) model. The underlying concept of the proposed approach, novel to the pharmaceutical industry, consists in looking at pharmaceutical products as integrated systems. With 3D IP, dosage forms are assembled from pre-fabricated working components, according to a pre-established blueprint instead of by blending and compressing powders. The result is a comparatively simple means of making pharmaceutical products with customized shape, physical dimensions, and most importantly, drug release profile. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3D IP is a novel platform that has focused on producing pharmaceutical oral dosage forms.   Analogous to the design of 3D integrated circuits, built by the 3D layer stacking of multiple functional components, 3D IP dosage forms are assembled by stacking pre-fabricated functional components such as active ingredient carrier, solubilizing function, ID/anti-counterfeiting, and tamper prevention. The 3D IP technology has applications in areas where customizable release for a target or active compound is needed, which extend beyond oral pharmaceuticals, into transdermal markets, smart patches, agrochemicals, nutraceuticals and personal care products.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A new technology for the design and manufacture of next generation pharmaceuticals is being introduced with focus on commercialization. The technology aims at bridging the widening gap between pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, which are aimed at obtaining a highly consistent product (one-dose-fits-all) and the recent advances in the understanding on drug therapy, which increasingly recognize the need for factoring-in the unavoidable and often high variability among individual patients. This gap leads to a needed shift in focus in pharmaceutical manufacturing, from that of making a consistent product, toward that of making an adjustable product, such that a consistent therapeutic outcome is obtained with a variable patient population, i.e., shifting pharmaceutical manufacturing from its current process-centered focus toward patient-centered one. &nbsp;The approach of this project is a technological departure from the concept of compressed-powder pharmaceuticals. Instead, the pharmaceutical product is conceived as an integrated system, analogous to the 3D integrated circuit concept of the electronics industry. In the 3D Integrated Pharmaceuticals (3D IP) technology, the &ldquo;pill&rdquo; is made via 3D stacking of prefabricated components, assembled according to an <em>a priori</em> design. Such components are precision made functional film layers, each carrying a specific pharmaceutical performance function (solubilizer, taste masking, antioxidant, local pH control, absorption promoter, slow/fast drug release, low/high dose, etc.). The end product of the 3D IP technology is a patient-tailored precision medicine. The path toward commercialization of the 3D IP technology has been elucidated through implementation of the Business Model Canvass. The Customer Discovery process revealed that the niche market of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) presents the most viable market segment toward initial commercialization of the technology. The Customer Segment identified for initial deployment consists of businesses that provide patient-tailored HRT medicines to the public, such as compounding pharmacies. The Value Proposition is four-fold: a) built-in high content uniformity, b) built-in, readily adjustable precision dosing, c) 30% to 50% reduction in time/cost in skilled labor involved in compounding, and d) increased medication affordability to the end-user, the patient. The Key Partners in this business model include physicians providing personalized HRT treatment to patients and suppliers of materials used by compounding pharmacies engaged in filling HRT patient-tailored prescriptions. Initial commercialization involves a small group of HRT patients receiving a personalized prescription to be filled by a compounding pharmacy.&nbsp; The prescriptions will be filled using the 3D IP technology instead of the traditional compounding methods. The acceptance of the 3D IP medication and response by the patients will be closely monitored by the physician and the pharmacist.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/14/2015<br>      Modified by: Rodolfo&nbsp;Pinal</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
