<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide antibody engineers with a user-friendly computational platform to assist in the design and engineering of therapeutic antibodies. Antibody-based drugs are becoming the treatment of choice for diverse diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and several types of cancers. The success of therapeutic antibodies with over forty approved or in review in the United States and Europe is due to their exquisite specificity, high potency, stability, solubility, clinical tolerability and relatively inexpensive manufacturing process in comparison with other biologic drugs. Thus, with a market forecast of over $50 billion in sales for 2015, the interest in developing faster and more efficient methods for discovering and optimizing antibodies for therapeutic applications has been gaining momentum. A user-friendly computational platform that generates more predictable and robust antibody designs should significantly reduce the attrition rate in late development, and result in significant cost savings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes the development of an automated antibody humanization platform. Humanization methods are key to engineering nonhuman antibodies for human therapy, and their development has been driven by three main goals: (1) Increase human content to minimize immunogenic reactions; (2) preserve binding profile to retain potency and minimize costs in further engineering processes, e.g., affinity maturation; and (3) secure intellectual property. The proposed platform aims to maximize all three of these goals as follows.  First, knowledge-based rules will be used to select human germline genes as framework region (FR) donors for nonhuman Complementary-Determining Regions (CDRs) grafting. It is expected that the selected FRs preserve binding and facilitate further development of the therapeutic antibody. Second, the CDRs will be humanized. CDR grafting protocols typically do not modify the CDRs; however, based on work published by the PI, it is anticipated that the number of nonhuman residues in the CDRs can be reduced significantly without impacting binding.  If so, the final product will be indistinguishable from human antibodies isolated from transgenic mice or phage display libraries.  As proof of concept, the biochemical and biophysical profiles of designs generated by our computational platform will be assessed experimentally.</AbstractNarration>

The success of therapeutic antibodies with over forty approved or in review in the United States and/or Europe is due to their exquisite specificity, high potency, stability, solubility, clinical tolerability, and relatively inexpensive manufacturing process in comparison with other biologic drugs. Thus, with a market forecast of over $120Bn in sales for 2019, the interest in developing faster and more efficient methods for discovering and optimizing antibodies for therapeutic settings has been gaining momentum. A user-friendly computational platform that generates more predictable and robust antibody designs should significantly reduce the attrition rate in late development, with consequent cost saving. Hence, we expect high demand from the Pharma/Biotech organizations developing antibody-based drugs for the platform we are developing. This SBIR phase I project proposed the implementation of a fully automated antibody humanization platform, called Humanization at GlobalBio (H-GB). Humanization methods are key to engineering nonhuman antibodies for human therapy, and their development has been driven by three main goals: (1) increase human content to minimize immunogenic reactions; (2) preserve binding profile to retain potency and minimize costs in further engineering processes, e.g., affinity maturation; and (3) secure intellectual property. The platform we have developed aims to maximize all three of these goals as follows. First, knowledge-based rules (e.g. canonical structures, V/J region homology and expression index of a curated database of human germline genes) were used to select human germline genes as framework region (FR) donors for nonhuman Complementary-Determining Regions (CDRs) grafting. As shown by one Proof of Concept (POC) &ndash; the well-known mouse antibody HyHEL-10 - the selected FRs preserved binding and produced humanized antibodies that express well, have &gt; 95% monomeric content after a single Protein-A purification step, and display a Tm value close to 80oC, well above the stability threshold of the CH2 domain. This developability profile should facilitate further development of the humanized antibodies. Importantly, no back mutations were needed in the FR to accommodate the CDRs, maximizing the human content in the FR. Second, H-GB has the choice of CDR humanization. CDR grafting protocols typically do not modify the CDRs. However, based on work published by the PI, as many as five mouse residues in the CDRs of HyHEL-10 were replaced by human germline residues. The resultant CDR-humanized variant retained binding and has a similar developability profile than the FR-replaced variant, but it is closer to human germline genes than the FR humanized variant, thus increasing the human content of the final product even further. Screen captures of H-GB web app are provided in Figures 1 &ndash; 4. The first section (Figure 1) or input interface is designed to enter the sequences to be humanized and select the parameters to be used for the humanization. The second section (Figure 2) shows the output of the FR humanization. The information is shown in a window for VL and another for VH, displaying alignments of the sequences to humanize, the germline genes and CDR-grafted sequences. Parameters such as the canonical structure class of the parental nonhuman antibody, the germline genes used as FR donors and the percentage of homology in FRs and CDRs are also shown.
