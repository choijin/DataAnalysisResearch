<AbstractNarration>This project conducts research on small unmanned aerial systems while protecting the safety of recovery workers who will be working at the 2014 SR530 mudslide near Oso, Washington, for at least the next year to remediate the site and repair the road. The flights also help increase the safety of residents along other portions of the Stillaguamish River.  A small fixed-wing and a rotorcraft unmanned aerial system are used to conduct longitudinal surveys of the inaccessible region of the mudslide and river.  The surveys in August and November, combined with earlier flights during the immediate response, capture the evolving state of the mudslide and river over time, validate the models of how the river and mudslide are expected to change over the seasons, refine new geological and hydrological models, and predict the potential for continuing sloughing and flooding that will impact residents and other sections of SR530 in the spring of 2015. The research is providing the robotics and cyber-physical systems communities with small unmanned aerial systems performance data under uncontrolled weather conditions, the human-robot interaction community with how users from different agencies interact with the robot data, and Big Data with datasets to explore how to best archive, curate, and visualize data over time.  The research is guiding the design of new small unmanned aerial systems to support applications where rapid or cost-effective geospatial reconstruction of the situation is important, such as emergency response and critical infrastructure inspection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This participatory research project advanced artificial intelligence for unmanned aerial systems and the science of Big Data while actively helping Snohomish County Department of Public Works understand the geology and hydrology of the 2014 SR530 Mudslide near Oso, Washington.  A PrecisionHawk Lancaster fixed wing UAS and a AirRobot 180 quadrotor UAS  were deployed to survey the complex topology at the toe of the mudslide and river, which was extremely dangerous to survey with a manned helicopter. The lessons learned from the project were incorporated into best practices now used by the United Nations and were applied to the 2015 Texas Memorial Day floods.

However, UAS path planners assume the ground is flat and do not support elevation changes.       the support for privacy and the appearance of privacy: the fixed wing sometimes had to fly over roads and beyond property lines in order to turn to come back for sensing, while the quadrotor could stay within a prescribed area and collect data.      The five days of field work produced nearly 1TB of data, much of the data was imagery and video collected over several days with different UAVs and supplemented with context photos, as well as field notes and robot performance log files.
