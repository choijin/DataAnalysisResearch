<AbstractNarration>This project examines the effects of climate change on biodiversity and the spread of exotic species, two of the greatest environmental problems that the nation and the planet face.  New mathematical models will be developed to predict how temperature effects on the biochemistry and physiology of individual organisms translate into species interactions that in turn generate the large-scale of patterns of biodiversity that we observe in nature. The resulting intellectual challenge requires integration across several subfields within biology and across biology and mathematics. At the same time, the research has tremendous societal consequences.  Results will inform the biological control of pests and pathogens, which, either in isolation or combined with an integrated pest management scheme, reduces pesticide use and minimizes pollution of water sources and associated health risks to humans and livestock.  Equally important is the project's contribution to education.  It will train students and postdoctoral researchers to develop rigorous, quantitative approaches to address environmental problems and, in so doing, to advance the conceptual boundaries of ecology and evolutionary biology significantly.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;A sophisticated approach will be used to tackle these intellectual and societal challenges. Four innovative components will be integrated to investigate the mechanisms by which temperature affects both the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species interactions.  First, new theory will build on the first principles of thermodynamics to predict temperature effects on biochemical processes, such as reaction kinetics, that underlie important life history traits. These predictions will then be incorporated into delay-differential population models that realistically capture the key characteristics of ectotherm life cycles.  Second, models for both population dynamics and species interactions will be parameterized with experimental data generated by laboratory manipulations. Third, models and their  predictions will be validated by comparing outputs to abundance data collected over time in natural populations. The final component will use quantitative genetics methods to determine how temperature effects on ecological traits, measured as reaction norms, influence the evolution of thermal responses.  These individual components will be integrated, via eco-evolutionary models, to predict how perturbations to the thermal environment (e.g., climate change) influence population persistence and species coexistence under ecological dynamics alone (the case if species are unable to adapt to changes in the thermal environment or cannot do so fast enough) and under eco-evolutionary dynamics (the case when perturbations lead to rapid evolution of thermal responses of key life history and interaction traits). Results will significantly advance general understanding of organisms' abilities to respond adaptively to rapid environmental change.</AbstractNarration>

Our findings have been disseminated through publications in premier scientific journals and plenary addresses at prestigious venues, and presentations at international conferences and workshops.   This project has also provided training and mentoring to undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows.  A key aspect of this training involvee combining controlled experiments with mathematical theory to address questions of ecological and environmental importance.  Promoting undergraduate research, particularly to under-represented groups, has been a strong emphasis of this research program.  To date, the project has trained over 30 undergraduates more than half of whom conducted Honors research projects.  Several students won prestigious research awards at UCLA and ten students are authors of papers published in top-tier journals.
