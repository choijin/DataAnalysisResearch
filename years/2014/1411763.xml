<AbstractNarration>This award funds work to obtain and analyze X-ray, optical, infrared, millimeter and radio wavelength observations to study the explosion properties of short-lived Gamma Ray Burst emission (GRBs).  GRBs are mysterious, transient highly energetic phenomena (significantly brighter than supernova explosions) that may be caused by the merger of binaries composed of neutron stars and/or a black hole.  The investigators also plan to use the GRBs from very distant sources as 'flashlights' to illuminate foreground galaxies and intergalactic medium.  The measurements will be used to measure the chemical enrichment of galaxies, and to constrain models of the Epoch of Re-ionization (EoR), which plays a dominant role in cosmological models.  The EoR occurred when the universe was only a few hundred million years old, and marks the transition from when the universe's gaseous component changed from mostly neutral to mostly ionized.  The researchers will integrate astronomy research into undergraduate courses, train and mentor students and post-doctoral fellows, and conduct public outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will be accomplished by focusing on three main goals using a variety of telescopes, including the JVLA, CARMA, ALMA, Magellan, Chandra and Gemini.  The investigators will: 1) determine the composition of the GRB ejecta (baryonic vs. magnetic) in the first few hours to days after a burst is detected; 2) measure the jet opening angles of short GRBs to determine the energy scale and rate, search for r-process powered counterparts to test models that predict that GRBs are generated from compact object binaries; and 3) use GRB emission to measure galaxy metallicities and reionization at redshifts that are inaccessible to direct observations, and to study the mass-metallicity relation at z = 2 - 5.</AbstractNarration>

With these activities we covered all of the primary goals in our original proposal.  The main results from our program have spanned the full range of scientific objectives and the most high-impact aspect of gamma-ray burst science:  [1] A large study of the process of energy injection in long GRBs utilizing bursts with detailed radio observations from our VLA Large Program.  This study showed for the first time that in some long GRBs the bulk of the kinetic energy (up to ~90%) is injected over a timescale of up to several hours, indicating that the ejecta structure is more complex than the simple model assumption of a single decelerating shell with a fixed kinetic energy.  Such information is only accessible through joint modeling of radio, optical, and X-ray data.  [2] The first comprehensive study of short GRB afterglows, combining all of the available data from radio, optical, and X-ray observations.  This study showed that the typical energy scale of short GRBs (corrected for beaming) is a few x 10^49 erg (a factor of 100 times lower than in long GRBs), that the typical circumburst density scale is ~0.01 cm^-3, and the typical jet opening angles are ~10 deg.  This information not only settles the issue of the properties of short GRBs, but it has also been utilized to explore the expected electromagnetic counterparts of LIGO gravitational wave sources.  We are in the process of updating the predictions for LIGO electromagnetic counterparts using these new results.  [3] We carried out a study of the location of 100 Swift long GRBs using a combination of ground-based, Swift, and HST data.  This study triples the size of previous samples, and it demonstrated for the first time that long GRBs are clustered near the centers of their host galaxies to a much larger extent than star formation as well as other types of transients (e.g., core-collapse supernovae).  This result provides a direct indication that long GRB progenitors are not only subject to low metallicity, but that they are likely to be present preferentially in dense stellar system (likely pointing to binarity).  [4] We achieved multiple detections of reverse shocks in long GRBs, utilizing rapid observations with the Very Large Array (and in one case with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array).  These studies represent the first detailed detections of reverse shocks, and point to baryonic ejecta with Lorentz factors of 100-200.  We also generally find larger magnetization in the ejecta than in the shock circumburst medium, pointing to the potential that strong fields are carried out by the outflow from the central engine.  [5] We placed constraints on the formation of long-lived millisecond magnetars in short GRBs through radio observations on a timescale of few years post-burst.  The limits indicate that in most short GRBs &lt;1e52 erg of energy may be injected into mildly-relativistic ejecta by a survining magnetar.  These constraints allow us to make predictions for long-term radio emission from binary neutron star mergers discovered by Advanced LIGO/Virgo (e.g. GW170817).
