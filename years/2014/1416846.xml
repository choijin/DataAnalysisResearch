<AbstractNarration>Levels of CO2 in the air are now about 40% higher than they were 200 years ago at the start of the Industrial Revolution.  At least 1/3 of excess CO2 production has been absorbed by the ocean, making it more acidic as the CO2 forms carbonic acid.  Understanding the likely impact of this increasing ocean acidification (OA) on marine animals and ecosystems is complicated by the fact that other features of the environment are also expected to change appreciably  (e.g., seawater temperatures will increase and food availability and nutritional value may decline), by the fact that stresses experienced in early development can have lasting effects, and because the molecular mechanisms of the responses are poorly understood.  This study examines how OA under different environmental conditions will impact the development, dispersal, and metamorphosis of the marine snail Crepidula fornicata, a common species native to the eastern U.S. that has now become established in the Pacific Northwest, Europe, and elsewhere.  This study will include:  1) the impact of OA on relative rates of tissue and shell growth in larvae; 2) long-term impact of larval exposure to OA on the survival and growth of juveniles; 3) influence of OA on gene expression patterns in both larvae and juveniles; 4) impact of OA on time until metamorphosis and on the ability to metamorphose in response to environmental inducers; 5) effect of elevated temperature on responses to OA; 6) impact of larval diet on vulnerability to OA; and 7) impact of OA on larval swimming ability and settlement behavior.  The study species is native to the East coast of the United States but has now become an important invasive in many other parts of the world. The results will have important implications for understanding the continued spread of this species. In addition, the work includes opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student training, outreach to high school teachers and development of new classroom exercises. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molluscan larvae are expected to be especially susceptible to the effects of ocean acidification (OA) in the coming years, due to their thinly calcified shells.  In addition, water temperatures are expected to amplify some impacts of OA.  Some effects, such as potentially reduced growth rates, reduced shell thickness, and altered dispersal capability are likely to be immediate, while others (latent effects) may appear only later in development, well after metamorphosis has taken place.  In addition, OA--with or without ocean warming--may alter larval behavior and physiology in ways that affect the timing of metamorphosis and the fitness of juveniles,thus altering dispersal potential and vulnerability to predators.  OA may also alter the abundance and nutritional quality of phytoplankton.   We will investigate the consequences of OA under different environmental scenarios for larvae of the marine gastropod Crepidula fornicata, an easily cultured species that is receiving increasing attention both as a general model for lophotrochozoan development and as an ecologically significant invader in benthic subtidal communities.   Our study will include: 1) impact of OA on rates of larval tissue and shell growth; 2) latent effects of larval exposure to OA on juvenile survival and growth; 3) effect of elevated temperature on responses to OA; 4) influence of elevated OA on larval and juvenile gene expression; 5) impact of OA on the development of competence for metamorphosis; 6) impact of OA on the response of competent larvae to a variety of metamorphic inducers; 7) impact of larval diet quality on vulnerability to OA, both in the larval stages and following metamorphosis (latent effects);  and 8) impact of OA on larval swimming and settlement behaviors, and the neural correlates of those behaviors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this study were to document the combined impact of elevated temperature, nutritional stress, and ocean acidification (OA) on the development and metamorphosis of the ubiquitous marine gastropod Crepidula fornicata.  We have studied the impact of OA on 1) larval survival; 2) relative rates of larval tissue growth and calcareous shell growth; 3) ability of competent larvae to respond to cues for metamorphosis; 4) latent effects of larval exposure to OA on the survival and growth of juveniles after metamorphosis; 5) impact of OA on duration of the pre-competent larval swimming period, during which time larvae are not yet capable of metamorphosing; 6) influence of elevated OA on gene expression patterns in larvae; and 7) influence of OA exposure in the larval stage on gene expression patterns in juveniles.  Most larvae and juveniles survived even the most acidic conditions tested, at a pH of 7.5.   Although shell growth rates were generally not affected at pH 7.6, both larvae and juveniles grew more slowly when pH level was reduced even further. Moreover, rearing the larvae at pH 7.5 reduced subsequent juvenile growth rates even when the juveniles were reared under control conditions after metamorphosing (pH 8.0); thus, we documented a subtle but potentially important "carry-over effect" resulting from larval experience at the low pH.  Rearing larvae at pH 7.6 also reduced subsequent juvenile growth at the control pH, even when larval growth rates were not significantly affected.  Larvae reared under reduced pH generally took significantly longer to become competent to metamorphose, even under high food conditions, something that would alter dispersal patterns in the field and increase vulnerability to planktonic predators.  Remarkably, rearing larvae at the low pH of 7.5 did not affect their ability to perceive and metamorphose in response to chemical cues released by adults.       When larvae were reared at lower pH levels, shell weights were relatively high and tissue weights were relatively low.  It appears that with the increasing acidity, more energy was dedicated to building up the shell mass.  However, the shells of individuals reared at the lower pH levels were often relatively frail and easily cracked, despite their greater weight.    Larvae reared at reduced pH for 4 days showed substantial shifts in patterns of gene expression, predominantly involving the downregulation of genes related to growth and metabolism. Relative to larvae reared under control conditions (pH 8.0), C. fornicata larvae reared at pH 7.6 upregulated 38 genes and downregulated 257 genes, while larvae reared at pH 7.5 differentially expressed only 55 genes (19 were upregulated, and only 36 were downregulated). Notably, most differentially expressed genes at both pH levels (pH 7.5, 65.5%; pH 7.6, 87.1%) were underrepresented relative to those seen in larvae reared under control conditions (pH 8.0).  Larvae reared at pH 7.6 mounted a much stronger overall transcriptomic response when compared to those that had been reared at the even more acidic pH of 7.5.  We are currently analyzing data for larvae that were exposed to reduced pH for shorter periods of time, to determine how long it takes to see these shifts in gene expression patterns, and which shifts are the first to appear. We are also currently analyzing gene expression data for juveniles reared under the different pH conditions.     A particularly unexpected finding was seen when larvae were reared in seawater with a pH of 7.5.   Most of those larvae grew slowly and had poor-quality, misshapen shells, but about 10% of the larvae grew at normal rates with healthy shells.  Looking at patterns of gene expression, we found that 3204 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed between the two larval phenotypes; 2251 of those transcripts were expressed at higher levels in the unhealthy phenotype larvae while 953 genes were expressed at higher levels in the healthy phenotype larvae. Based on which genes were being upregulated and which were being downregulated, it appears that the poor-quality larvae were experiencing more oxidative stress than the healthy phenotype.  Unhealthy larvae may also have been expending more energy attempting to mitigate stressor impact, as shown by increased hexokinase-2 expression.  These data indicate that there are clear genetic differences determining tolerance to reduced pH among larvae of this species, suggesting that C. fornicata may be able to evolve a greater tolerance to low pH conditions over time.      During the course of this project, I trained two graduate students and three undergraduates.  I also created a 4-week section of our Experiments in Ecology course at Tufts, in which undergraduate students conducted experiments with our experimental marine animal, Crepidula fornicata.
