<AbstractNarration>The Data Cubed project will prepare students for the challenges posed by the analysis of large datasets. As governmental, scientific, and business enterprises collect, store, and process more data, many technological challenges are encountered. The analysis of big datasets requires a collaborative effort between mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and domain experts. Computation (including algorithmic development), modeling (including dimensionality/complexity reduction), and visualization are all needed.  The Data Cubed project will identify talented students early in their academic career and give them appropriate mentoring and increasingly advanced statistical and computational coursework.  The students will proceed to data discovery research under the guidance of faculty members and partner scientists.  The ultimate goal of the Data Cubed project is to increase the number of highly qualified undergraduate students who are able to apply their skills as they enter the scientific workforce and data analytics careers and to share the results of this project with the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will learn mathematical and statistical techniques and software systems to collect, generate, store, analyze and visualize large amounts of data. In the Data Cubed project, several new courses will be created to train students in the core computational and statistical areas that underpin the analysis of large datasets; the students will be provided with significant research opportunities in the areas of geophysical modeling, analysis of unstructured social media data, and dimensional reduction techniques and modeling.  One of the research projects will use large geophysical datasets from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and will involve modeling heat stress in urban environments and its relationship to public health.  Another will examine the role of oceans as a primary reservoir of heat for our planet, which plays a significant role in the dynamics of climate change.  Yet another project will combine heuristics of social media data (e.g., tweets) during times of mass emergency with a user's social graph to develop a more comprehensive picture of the situation.  These and other projects all require fundamental knowledge and understanding of how to analyze large datasets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The EXTREEMS-QED: Directions in Data Discovery project has been a tremendous benefit to students and faculty interested in statistics and data science at the University of Colorado Boulder.  During its five years (2014-2019) the  project has supported forty-seven undergraduate research projects. These students worked with twelve CU faculty and several graduate students.  Some collaborated with researchers at NCAR.  The projects resulted in several journal papers and almost every student made at least one conference presentation.  Students were able to delve into significant research projects in areas ranging from the movement of heat and salt in ocean models to weather forecasting, from machine learning to bioinformatics. All of these projects were related by their dependence on the statistical analysis of large data sets.  Students learned advanced techniques and improved their computational and analytical skills. At least ten of these students continued to graduate programs for their Ph.D. in an area related to statistical science.  This project also supported the development, or redevelopment, of seven courses in statistics and data science. Additionally, the EXTREEMS grant hastened the development of both a major and a minor in Statistics and Data Science.  The Statistics and Data Science major welcomed its first cohort in August of 2018 and there are currently over seventy students in this major.  Further, many CU students pursue the minor to enhance their statistical analysis skills in their own major.  The ability to understand, visualize, and analyze data is becoming an increasingly important skill in many disparate fields. Thanks to support from the EXTREEMS grant, many students will be able to improve their knowledge in statistics and data science and enhance their future careers.
