<AbstractNarration>CBET-1402702&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High heat flux removal is of critical importance in a number of key applications such as electronic cooling or data center cooling (where heat generated by electronic processors or components have to be rapidly dissipated to keep them working reliably). One of the most effective ways of removing heat is through a phase change process such as boiling in cooling channels integrated on the back side of the heat-generating device. In electronic applications, the heat is typically generated at the chip-level, and due to the small sizes, significant functionality and boiling efficiency problems arise due to the vapor blocking the channel, and instabilities in the channel. The proposed research will focus on methods that will overcome the efficiency issues by ensuring a thin continuously evaporating film on the heated surface. Successful development of these methods will ensure improved reliability of computer and electronic devices and enable denser packaging and smaller footprint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the proposed study, high heat-flux capabilities are expected under externally imposed pulsations in the two phases (liquid and vapor). Thin and wavy boiling liquid films arise as a result of the pulsations, and cover the entire heat-exchange surface. Investigations will confirm if one can achieve high heat-flux values along the length of the flow boiler by a suitable adjustment of the mean quasi-steady film thickness profile (in the absence of pulsations) along with amplitude control of superposed waves (by controlling the amplitude of imposed pulsations). This is expected because the liquid film flow dynamics near the wave-troughs are dominated by the  contact-line flow physics which causes the wave-troughs to "stick/dwell?" near the heat exchange surface. Therefore, under the proposed pulsatile operations, at most locations, the mean liquid film thickness will be significantly reduced and convection effects (in the liquid flow between the heat-exchange surface and the liquid-vapor interface) will be concurrently increased.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The principal goal of this project was to complete the assessment of the results-based hypothesis that were proposed for realizing high heat-flux shear driven annular flow-boiling in milli-meter scale hydraulic diameter ducts. These were to be realized through innovative steady and pulsatile operations that were also proposed. The assessment of the hypothesis and operations were carried out by a synthesis of experiments with modeling and simulations. With regard to the earlier observed enhanced heat-flux pulsatile flow-boiling operations that motivated this project, the primary focus of this research has been development of scientific insights that would enable effective engineering approaches for cooling high heat-flux electronics (e.g. CPU heat-sinks). For enabling such applications, millimeter-scale flow-boilers with FC-72 like fluids (such as HFE-7100) are essential for attaining requisite values of <em>heat transfer efficiency ratio</em> &ndash; defined to be the ratio of "total heat transfer rate (heat removed)" to "pumping power" &ndash; over the range of imposed heat-flux and enabling mass-flux of interest.</p> <p>The experimental investigations (with FC-72 as a working fluid) for steady annular flow-boiling were carried out within a horizontal test-section (Fig. 1) of 50 cm length and rectangular cross-section (depth = 15 mm and height = 2 mm). Temperature controlled heating (by using reversed and controllable thermo-electric coolers) at low heat-fluxes (in the range of 0.1 &ndash; 1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) were used. Research results established that <em>invisible</em> micro nucleation rates play a very big role in thin liquid film (400 &ndash; 40 &micro;m thick) steady annular flow-boiling &ndash; the so called <em>convective</em> regime - and is responsible, typically, for removing about 70 to 90% of the total heat-flux at each location. Subsequently steady annular flow-boiling operations were also successfully carried out at higher heat-flux (10 &ndash; 80 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and mass-flux (100-200 kg/(m<sup>2</sup>.s)) values &ndash; with water as a working fluid - in a new test-section (Fig. 2) placed in a new flow-loop. These newer experiments in conjunction with reported modeling/simulations provide a new and uniquely accurate/superior way of obtaining experiments-consistent values of local heat-transfer coefficients (HTC) for the desired annular flow-boiling regimes &ndash; regimes with thick liquid films (thickness &gt; 50 micrometers), where dominant contributions to heat transfer come from often invisible (to naked eye) micron-scale nucleating bubbles.</p> <p>A set of representative results for the above FC-72 experiments establish that enhancements between pulsatile (steady-in-the-mean) and corresponding steady cases were about 110% for local heat-flux measurements (at 40 cm location) and only about 18.3% for the overall heat-flux. It is concluded that, based on a hypothesis that explains all of our observations, introducing flow-rate pulsations at the inlet may not be the best engineering approach for realizing highly efficient flow-boiling. Consider the case of high local heat-flux enhancement levels observed in Fig. 3c, unlike the one in Fig. 3d. Such high enhancements are likely due to the fact that the local film thickness at the heat-flux measurements locations are thin enough (see &ldquo;x<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; locations in Fig. 4) &ndash; relative to the amplitude of interfacial standing-waves. This allows the &ldquo;wave troughs&rdquo; to come close enough to the wetting boiling-surface, and the waves are able to beneficially impact the bubble-ebullition mechanisms associated with the micro-scale sized nucleating bubbles (see Fig. 5). The local conditions in Fig. 3c or x<sub>2</sub> region in Fig. 4 do not represent the case for other film thickness values &ndash; which are, on average, much larger throughout the channel and wave troughs do not affect bubble ebullition mechanisms but continue to enhance interfacial shear.</p> <p>Because of the results and hypothesis presented above, it was decided to not conduct pulsatile water flow experiments. Instead, an alternative enhancement hypothesis/approach has been developed - which has the potential to favorably affect nucleation mechanisms at all the nucleation sites spread throughout the boiling surface. In the absence of NSF funds, a small private funding is being used to further develop the hypothesis/approach and related science and technology. The new experiments involve active acoustic excitation of the bubbles&rsquo; micro layers by piezo sensors.</p> <p>The technology enabling aspect of this research has been designed to address the flow-boiling based cooling needs of next-generation heat-sinks for CPUs and other electronics in server racks of data-centers. In parallel, the PI is engaged in a thermal systems research which leverages a dedicated power-supply approach to data-centers along with this research&rsquo;s flow-boiling approach for electronic cooling &ndash; and, together, the two systems lead to significant amounts of waste heat recovery in the form of electricity and show numerous economic and environmental advantages.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Amitabh&nbsp;Narain</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402702/1402702_10307837_1535593662884_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402702/1402702_10307837_1535593662884_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="FC-72 Flow Boiler Schematic"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402702/1402702_10307837_1535593662884_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="FC-72 Flow Boiler Schematic"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A side view schematic of an instrumented FC-72 test-section which has a 15 mm width (in direction out of the figure plane).</div> <div class="imageCredit">MTU Research Group</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amitabh&nbsp;Narain</div> <div class="imageTitle">FC-72 Flow Boiler Schematic</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402702/1402702_10307837_1535593862021_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402702/1402702_10307837_1535593862021_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Water Flow Boiler Schematic"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402702/1402702_10307837_1535593862021_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Water Flow Boiler Schematic"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A lateral section schematic of the experimental flow channel for flow-boiling of water is shown.</div> <div class="imageCredit">MTU Research Group</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amitabh&nbsp;Narain</div> <div class="imageTitle">Water Flow Boiler Schematic</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402702/1402702_10307837_1535593924658_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402702/1402702_10307837_1535593924658_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pulsatile Flow Enhancement Results"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402702/1402702_10307837_1535593924658_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pulsatile Flow Enhancement Results"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) Time-averaged heat-flux values for steady and pulsatile flow-boiling of FC-72.
