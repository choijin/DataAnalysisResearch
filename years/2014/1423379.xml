<AbstractNarration>Time synchronization allows devices in a network to have a common notion of time and thus to operate in a precisely coordinated manner that is essential for the correctness, efficiency, throughput, and security of the entire system. Despite efforts in the past for achieving accurate timing in traditional networks, synchronization remains an open problem for the emerging sustainable wireless networks which are envisioned to play a key role in many future applications such as time-driven smart manufacturing, transportation cyber-physical systems, smart power grids, high-confidence medical systems, etc., due to a wide range of new features and requirements. To support truly sustainable operations, this project will carry out systematic research to revisit the clockwork by carefully identifying constraints from different aspects of such networks. The outcome of this project will constitute a significant advance in the design and development of theoretical foundations and practical algorithms to enable a highly effective synchronization service in sustainable wireless networks. Broader impacts of this project shall be magnified by (i) cultivating collaboration within the computer network community and interdisciplinary cooperation with field experts, (ii) improving curriculum development with hands-on training, (iii) disseminating research results via high-quality publications and open-source websites, (iv) raising interest in science and technology among K-12 students, female, and underrepresented groups through seminars and open house events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will enable reactive, efficient, scalable, and configurable time synchronization for sustainable wireless networks deployed in highly dynamic physical environments. The project will build a sustainable computing hardware prototype with modularized structure that accommodates various solutions for energy harvesting, wireless communication, on-board sensing and processing. New designs will be implemented with a combination of different hardware platforms and the project will deliver reusable system designs, firmware packages, algorithm and protocol libraries to the research community. In addition to academic papers and technical reports, this work is expected to contribute to the system development in broader application communities across multiple disciplines, such as health care and assisted living, urban safety and security, human behavior study, cyber-physical system research, and so forth.</AbstractNarration>

The project has supported 3 graduate students in this investigation period from Computer Science and Engineering department. The graduate students have been involved in design, implementation, and experimentation of embedded system solutions in interdisciplinary settings. The collaborations have provided significant research opportunities for interdisciplinary research and expands the impacts of the project. We developed a theoretical framework for optimizing synchronization scheduling based on stochastic network optimization theory. This is the first work that utilizes age on information metrics in synchronization and synchronization scheduling. Through extensive experiments, we showed empirical evidence in impacts of spatial correlation in temeparture on clock skew and accordingly designed the first correlation based time sychronization solution that takes link-level synchronization solutions to a network-level application domain in a systematic way.       The impacts of synchronization errors on the new age of information error have been shown experimentally for the first time. The theoretical analysis on age-theoretical synchronization scheduling is one of the first approaches on taking synchronization solutions from the physical layer to the network later. Moreover, impacts of spatio temporal correlation of temperature on clock skew and both empirically and theoreticall shown. Accordingly, the network-level synchronization solution is developed. Synchronization solutions are integrated with real-world crash test experiments to accurately analyze vehicle to barrier communications, which has the potential to impact driver safety and minimize fatalities in traffic crashes.
