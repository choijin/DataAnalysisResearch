<AbstractNarration>This award funds the acquisition of geochemical instrumentation that will be used by faculty members across four departments (chemistry, biology, geology, environmental science) at Westminster College to substantially expand undergraduate opportunities to conduct novel research on topics that are currently beyond in-house instrumental capabilities. This research will be highly interdisciplinary, collaborative, integrate research with education, and involve the biogeochemical cycling of elements in natural systems, including the Great Salt Lake.  The researchers will develop new curriculum and lab activities around the new instrument in multiple courses that will provide students with hands-on experience in the use of modern instruments and mass spectrometry.  These unique labs will use real world applications to infuse education with the excitement of discovery and move students beyond simply following a list of protocols to measure metal concentrations, and will focus on interdisciplinary approaches and the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills. The instrumentation will improve the researchers' ability to use project-based learning for training in courses across multiple disciplines, create new opportunities for research collaborations and cooperation on interdisciplinary research  with partners at other educational, public, and private institutions in the region that lack this instrumentation, provide one of the cornerstones and core facilities of a new geology department at Westminster, and  support and expand outreach that promotes science and environmental education of K-12 students and actively links researchers with public outreach.  Some of these effective and proven activities at Westminster are coordinated through the Great Salt Lake Institute, which facilitates collaborations between undergraduate researchers and faculty at Westminster with several K-12 schools and their teachers and students to conduct research projects that involve the Great Salt Lake.  With these outreach activities, this instrumentation will support ongoing efforts to improve student retention in STEM disciplines, especially women and students from diverse backgrounds.  Among others, the McNair Scholars program, a federally funded effort to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who go on to graduate school and will increasingly recruit and target students in STEM disciplines.  The new instrument will enrich their classroom experience by introducing more inquiry-based labs and incorporating research as a learning tool early in the curriculum.  The instrumentation will also expand undergraduate research opportunities for these students outside the classroom to further integrate research into their education and training.  &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this award funds the acquisition of a quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) for simultaneously measuring concentrations of a wide range of trace metals and other elements at the parts per billion and parts per trillion levels typically required for environmental research.  A hydride generator sample introduction system that couples directly to the ICP-MS will allow for the analysis of the elements Selenium, Arsenic, Tin, and Mercury in high salinity matrices, such as in the Great Salt Lake, which is the focus of research by multiple faculty and their students at Westminster.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded the purchase of multiple new instruments, including an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) used to measure heavy metal and trace element concentrations in water, sediment, and organisms.  The interdisciplinary research that is now possible is conducted across multiple departments (chemistry, biology, geology, and environmental science) at Westminster College and has provided the basis for new research collaborations with partners at other institutions.  This award has substantially expanded undergraduate opportunities in a number of areas and enabled students and faculty members to conduct novel research on new topics not previously possible.  New methods have been developed using these new instruments that have enabled interdisciplinary research on the biogeochemical cycling of trace elements in natural systems, including the Great Salt Lake.  This includes undergraduate research by multiple women and students from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  The research conducted thus far has resulted in multiple products, including presentations by undergraduate students at regional and national conferences and a research article with five undergraduates as co-authors.  The new instruments have also enabled the better integration of research with education, with new curriculum and multiple new lab exercises having been created around the ICP-MS in multiple science courses.  The award has also improved our ability to train future scientists by increasing our capacity to use project-based learning in courses across multiple disciplines and provide greater flexibility as students design and carry out independent projects in multiple science courses.  The award has also increased our ability to connect undergraduate learning to community based projects and outreach efforts in Utah, and to involve our students in measurements involved in environmental monitoring and regulatory efforts.
