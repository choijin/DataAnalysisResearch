<AbstractNarration>Hybrid polymers that exhibit regions of contrasting solubility (e.g. water-soluble versus oil-soluble) are termed "amphiphilic polymers".  Amphiphilic polymers are potentially useful in a range of applications including detergents, emulsifying agents, etc.  Some of them have already been utilized commercially in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.  The majority of previous research on amphiphilic polymers has focused on polymeric components that are simple linear strands.  Drs. Scott Grayson, Alina Alb, and Henry Ashbaugh at Tulane University explore the synthesis of various "non-linear" architectures and study their properties using both computer modeling and physical analysis to identify unique and useful materials.  As an integral component, undergraduate and graduate students are trained in state-of-the-art laboratory techniques to provide them with a technical foundation for careers in the polymer industry.  In addition, this project supports ongoing outreach efforts in New Orleans public school chemistry classes to demonstrate to the high school students the connections between textbook chemistry and its real-world applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses specifically on two classes of polymer architecture:  non-linear amphiphilic homopolymers (AHPs) and "dendrimer-like" star polymers.  This research effort simultaneously investigates the synthesis of new monomers that better address the need for uncharged amphiphiles, while exploring novel cyclic, star, and caged architectures.  The second class of polymers, dendrimer-like star polymers, enables the incorporation of branching not only at the core (like traditional star polymers) but also at the interface between the polar and non-polar blocks.  This project develops modular synthetic approaches to star-dendritic-linear and graft-dendritic-linear polymers, which allow the length of the linear blocks and dendron generation to be independently tuned.  The synthesis of these unique architectures is complemented by detailed theoretical modeling (Replica Exchange dynamics) and state of the art physical characterization (e.g., light scattering couple with automatic continuous mixing).  The relationship between the structural parameters, the resultant self-assembly behavior, and polymer properties are explored in detail.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was to deepen our understanding of how branching in polymeric materials affects their properties, particularly how they encapsulate drugs and deliver them into the skin.  We are looking at a series of well-defined branching architectures within hyperbranched polymers.  First of all, there are two layers which are considered to be branched, the core (the center) and the periphery (between the water-soluble and lipid-soluble groups).  The core exhibits one, two, or four branches which are water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains.  The interface between the water-soluble arm and the lipid-soluble, laurylated ester groups also exhibits a branching point, and once again can be one, two, or four branches.  This leads us to everything from one PEG chain with one laurylated ester group (the lowest possible) to a four-armed core with four more laurylated ester groups for each arm (for a total of sixteen laurylated groups all around the core).  The significance of these is that despite the fact they are all polymers, each one is 1.04 dispersity or below, and all have complete peripheral functionality.  For the primary results, we determined to what extent these architectures revealed how they self-assembled into reverse micelles, and what effect these have on drug delivery to the skin.  Regarding size, it appears that its major effect is the branching number. It does not matter whether it is core or peripheral branching; the greatest concentration leads to the smallest size.  Regarding critical micelle concentration, the major factor appears to be the balance between the core and peripheral branching, such that about 50% at the core and 50% at the periphery reveals the smallest critical micelle size.  Finally, for the encapsulation capacity it appears that diffusion into the stratum corneum was best achieved by the carrier with all core branching, but no peripheral branching.  These lead to significant amounts of drug encapsulated into the first layer of the skin.  However, the most effective at getting deeper into the skin appears to be the exact opposite, all branching at the periphery.  Using a carrier with all peripheral branching shows the highest capacity to reach the deeper underlying dermis.  There is a tremendous amount of data involved with these characterization studies, and the basic steps for these have been completed and were recently published.  Karolina Kosakowksa?s graduate thesis included two significant chapters, ?Synthesis and self-assembly of amphiphilic star/linear-dendritic polymers: effect of core-vs-peripheral branching on reverse micelle aggregation? and ?Evaluation of amphiphilic star/linear-dendritic polymer reverse micelles for transdermal drug delivery: directing carrier properties by tailoring core-vs-peripheral branching.?  Both were published in Biomacromolecules in 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.8b00679 and 8b00680).  A number of additional publications by multiple coauthors were enabled by this work over the last 5 years.  This NSF award has provided research opportunities for two graduate students? doctoral theses, as well as two post-doctoral advisers, six graduate student mentees, and two undergraduate student trainees.  This collaboration produced a number of design modifications to yield the best defined systems.  Many of these students have gone on to a range of industrial and academic careers.
