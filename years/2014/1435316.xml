<AbstractNarration>SES-1435316&lt;br/&gt;Fred Pampel&lt;br/&gt;Elizabeth M. Lawrence&lt;br/&gt;University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among U.S. adults, college degree earners live much healthier lives than those with less education, but we know little about why. Further, recent trends show that health and social disparities across educational levels are widening. Determining how and why educational attainment influences health behaviors, such as smoking, exercising, maintenance of healthy weight status, and heavy drinking, can help us understand how inequality emerges in our society. Health behaviors are important because they signify social class and shape the health and longevity of individuals. This project will determine how the effects of college degrees differ across groups for multiple health behavior outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three research questions characterize the study's objectives: (1) What are the average causal effects of college degrees on multiple indicators of health behaviors? (2) How do the effects of college degrees on the different health behavior outcomes differ across the likelihood of achieving the degree, a person?s race, or a person's gender? (3) What are the mechanisms for the college degree-health behavior relationship and are they different across groups? To answer these questions, this study draws on quantitative methods analyzing survey data from a recent, nationally representative sample. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) provides longitudinal data on education and health behaviors across adolescence and young adulthood for a cohort of individuals born 1977-1984. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will indicate who benefits most from college degrees, whether these degrees serve to moderate or strengthen existing social inequalities, and what accounts for the college degree-health behavior relationship overall and within different subgroups. By revealing the conditions of education's benefits for health behaviors, this project has the potential to promote the well-being of individuals nationwide. Tobacco use, poor diet and physical activity, and alcohol consumption are leading causes of death and improving these behaviors would enhance the health of U.S. adults. In drawing broad conclusions as to the source of educational advantages for health, this study will provide useful information to policymakers interested in reducing social inequality. For example, by distinguishing the populations that are most and least responsive to college educations, the project results can be used to identify targets for intervention.</AbstractNarration>
