<AbstractNarration>STEM Career Clubs builds on a successful and research-based Strategic Teaming Model to increase the likelihood that participating students will pursue STEM majors and careers. The project is driven by three key objectives: 1) Facilitate students' and parents' identification with the STEM community by increasing their awareness of, interest in, and positive perceptions of STEM fields and careers; 2) Increase students' and teachers' STEM content knowledge and skills; and 3) Enhance the impact of the Strategic Teaming Model on leader, teacher, parent, &amp; student perceptions of STEM Career Clubs innovation.  STEM Career Clubs is a partnership between North Carolina State University's College of Sciences (The Science House), the Departments of Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Mathematics (STEM) Education, and Curriculum, Instruction, &amp; Counselor Education (CICE) in the College of Education, and four high poverty school districts in northeast North Carolina: Northampton, Vance, Nash-Rocky Mount and Warren Counties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STEM Career Clubs will allow students to explore project-based learning activities in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and entrepreneurship that will extend the curriculum taught in the classroom and build student competency in STEM workforce skills, tools, and technology. In the Strategic Teaming Model, school administrators and teacher-coaches will work in teams and will attend professional development to collaboratively develop plans to support and sustain the innovation of the STEM Career Clubs. University team members will engage Club student teams with STEM professionals, mentoring opportunities, and activities emphasizing STEM workforce-relevant experience. The researchers will employ a mixed-methods approach to address eight research questions, exploring whether student participation in STEM Career Clubs enhances student (1)  awareness of, interest in, positive perceptions of, and identification with STEM careers; (2) learning in mathematics and science; and (3) enrollment in advanced courses.  The project will contribute to fundamental research in STEM education by highlighting individual and joint effects of peers, parents, teachers, and university partners on students' motivation and performance in STEM areas, using potentially transformative social media component (i.e., Twitter), project-based learning, a residential university experience, and explicit career links. STEM Career Clubs will directly serve 120 or more student Club members and their parents, 24 STEM Teacher-Coaches, and 40 leadership personnel in 4 middle schools in 4 school districts, each academic year.</AbstractNarration>

Each STEM Career club session (12 per year) averaged 30-40 participants during each school year over the four project years (including the extension year). Collectively, over all years of the project, students who participated in the clubs were 57% female, 56% African American, 22% White (Non-Hispanic), 7% Hispanic, and greater than 85% were classified as economically disadvantaged. The average percentages of underrepresented groups that participated in clubs were higher than in the schools, overall. The STEM Career Clubs project successfully engaged over 600 students, giving them exposure to STEM activities, career fields, and residential experiences on a university campus along with engagement with college undergraduate and graduate students, university researchers and professors, and industry professionals. Involving the parents in the clubs and university experiences also proved beneficial for gaining support of the students to pursue a STEM career and to have their parents support in doing so.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Intellectual Merit</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Research and evaluation results from this project found:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Sending activities home to be done with parents provided opportunities for students to re-learn skills and content knowledge and provided a shared benefit of increased enjoyment for parents and students.</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Families in rural, high-poverty communities were eager to learn with and from their children about controversial topics like climate change and most students and parents found these topics to be novel.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader Impact  The STEM Career Clubs project established after-school clubs at four rural middle schools in northeastern North Carolina. Each STEM Career club session (12 per year) averaged 30-40 participants during each school year over the four project years (including the extension year). Collectively, over all years of the project, students who participated in the clubs were 57% female, 56% African American, 22% White (Non-Hispanic), 7% Hispanic, and greater than 85% were classified as economically disadvantaged. The average percentages of underrepresented groups that participated in clubs were higher than in the schools, overall. The STEM Career Clubs project successfully engaged over 600 students, giving them exposure to STEM activities, career fields, and residential experiences on a university campus along with engagement with college undergraduate and graduate students, university researchers and professors, and industry professionals. Involving the parents in the clubs and university experiences also proved beneficial for gaining support of the students to pursue a STEM career and to have their parents support in doing so.   Intellectual Merit   Research and evaluation results from this project found:  Sending activities home to be done with parents provided opportunities for students to re-learn skills and content knowledge and provided a shared benefit of increased enjoyment for parents and students. Families in rural, high-poverty communities were eager to learn with and from their children about controversial topics like climate change and most students and parents found these topics to be novel. Most families were not ready to take action or change behaviors, but rather, to appraise the situation and respond to what they learned. Post-club content assessments suggest that after-school clubs can be a productive environment for student learning in low performing middle schools. Attendance at teacher professional development sessions was critical to club success. The best predictor of club success was preparation. Pre-planning sessions following professional development were critical to club success. Identifying a Lead Teacher was critical for club success. A team of teachers should work together, but there must be a designated leader or "head coach." Participating students had very few, if any, out-of-school STEM experiences prior to STEM Career clubs; Participating students had few, if any, STEM role models and most had unclear goals for college attendance or potential major ideas.  Leadership professional development, which teaches teachers and other leadership personnel to analyze and address their organizational culture through data, can help to reduce the systemic barriers to innovation.    Sustainability  Several features of the project will be sustained such as all curriculum materials and supplies were left for the schools and uploaded to the university website; the developed relationship between the schools and the university can be maintained via field trips, guest speakers, and voluntary mentoring; and we have continued to find other funding sources to support schools in sustaining the STEM Career Clubs, which are currently funded through 2021 from private funds.  Manuscripts and presentations will continue to be produced from the project, and will serve as the basis of future proposals to continue increased awareness and recruitment of underrepresented minorities and female students into STEM and ICT career fields. Finally, we are working with the Center for Inquiry Based Learning to develop semester kits that can be check-out or purchased by schools in NC and across the nation. We expect to roll out the first semester kit in Fall 2019 and to have 3 years of activities available for loan or purchase by Fall of 2020.  Conclusion  The STEM Career Clubs project successfully engaged over 800 students in STEM activities, career fields, and exposure to the university campus and engagement with college students and university and industry researchers and scientists. Students thoroughly enjoyed the university experiences, the activities, the interactions with real researchers and scientists and enjoyed having parents involved in the club activities and the university weekend residential experiences. The combined impact of all these supports and experiences proved beneficial for engaging student in STEM and encouraging them to pursue a STEM career and to have their parents support them in doing so.
