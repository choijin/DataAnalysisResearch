<AbstractNarration>The IUCRC for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) site at the University of Washington (UW) proposes renewal for Phase II operation. CAFS and its sites address the problems and opportunities facing forestry that bridge disciplinary and regional boundaries, and require a broader and interdisciplinary approach that is the hallmark of universities. The center and its sites approach research questions on multiple spatial and temporal scales, including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem levels. The UW site will advance research in Phase II consistent with member needs such as it has done in Phase I in areas including 1) regional fertilization response of Douglas-fir, 2) growth and yield of improved Douglas-fir stock, and 3) use remote sensing to describe leaf area and root biomass of Douglas-fir plantations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forests are vital to global ecological, social, and economic health. The research conducted by CAFS increases the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems on multiple temporal and spatial scales and determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries. Student training continues to be an important feature in Center research and technology transfer. These students are unique in the forestry sciences because of their problem-solving skills using interdisciplinary techniques across multiple scales. Recruiting for students among under-represented groups will be conducted, increasing the diversity of the workforce for both academia and industry in this traditionally diversity-deficient discipline.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the University of Washington’s participation in Phase II of the NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS). The collaborative research focuses on optimizing the silvicultural and nutritional systems needed to produce high quality, raw materials to meet the economic demands of the nation’s forest products industry in the 21st century.  Forests are globally important to human health and well-being through the oxygen they create, their moderation of temperature at a local scale, their sequestration of carbon, and their ability to provide ideal environments for many people to rest, relax, and recreate. Forests are important for providing clean water and wildlife habitat, as well.  Forests face a number of threats including land use changes (for example conversion to other uses as human populations grow and demand more developed areas), modifications in land owner structures, and climate uncertainty- either regionally increasing or decreasing variation in weather patterns, or general warming, or even cooling in certain areas.  To this end, though not the primary focus of this research, a ‘water deficit’ and ‘aridity index’ database for Douglas-fir has been compiled for further testing of weather and climate effects on individual tree diameter growth and mortality.   Competition between trees is a crucial interaction process influencing important components of forest development and change, such as new tree (seedling / sapling) recruitment, growth and mortality, which in turn determine forest stand dynamics. Improving the quantification of competition effects in forest models thus will also result in greater ability to evaluate the under-researched and often unknown mechanisms that drive competition (and other tree interactions, e.g. facilitation) as studied in fields such as forest and plant ecology. It is extremely important to understand these tree interaction phenomena in order to better predict the impacts that external forces may have on forest stand dynamics. Having this information is key to assessing how forests would adapt to changing long-term forces of humans and nature.  The research conducted with this project provides information that will help forecast long-term changes in forest structure and composition, which will foster better management practices &ndash; tenets that are critical to sustaining forest ecosystems, as well as for efficient and sustainable forest operations.  Finally, this research helped illustrate the core issues facing forests and demonstrated the true value of long-term research into forested systems, achieved through a more complete understanding of and better quantitative expressions for competition effects on tree and stand growth and survival.  Our specific objectives were: i) Determine the average, area-based volume response to late-rotation fertilization in stands being considered by landowners for fertilization, ii) to assess how well spatially explicit competition indices reduce residual variation in predictions beyond what spatially implicit measures provide, iii) quantify the stand-level and dominant tree response to various thinning treatments in terms of relative and cumulative volume growth, while evaluating the effects of stand conditions, timing/intensity of thinning, and key stand-level biotic factors, and iv) examine organic matter removal and vegetation control treatment effects on aboveground and belowground biomass and nutrients on four LTSP sites.  Intellectual merit: These projects collected data from research installations representing the culminating outcomes of silvicultural and fertilization treatments and years of monitoring their impacts. These projects provided actual data (rather than from models) to assist member companies in making land management decisions. These projects have improved the understanding of competitive effects on tree and stand growth and survival and has yielded better quantitative expressions for them. Further by examining these effects over various forest types and management intensities has enhanced the applicability of quantitative expressions of competition. This will lead to increased reliability of models for predicting growth and yield.  Ten peer-reviewed publications were published and another manuscript is in review. An IUCRC Phase III award will support continuation of research in three primary focal areas (forest silviculture, forest nutrition, and decision-support tools) and the additional of remote sensing as a fourth focal area.  Broader impact: This project strengthened links between universities and the forest products industry in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia by supporting research driven by interactions with cooperators and their needs, with a focus on managed forests. Cooperators included 13 industrial firms, three government agencies, and one tribal nation.  We provided significant training opportunities for 10 undergraduate students, 12 master’s students, three Ph.D students, and 2 post-doctoral researchers. This has ranged from learning basic field skills and acquiring technical skills like data management and analysis to professional opportunities such as participation in regional and national meetings.
