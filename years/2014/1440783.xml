<AbstractNarration>This proposal describes facilitation activities for a Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Engineer at the University of Oklahoma (OU). Building on the success of recent leadership activities at OU in CI and leveraging related activities elsewhere in the country in research and educational facilitation in campus-based computational research support, this project addresses: Data-Intensive Research Facilitation, including utilizing Software Defined Networking across OU's research network;  leading and facilitating adoption of a campus level engineering engagement model and approach across Oklahoma; a national training regime, providing a "virtual residency" program for campus CI engineers and facilitators; and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), fostering undergraduate research at OU by integrating REU sites and supplements into STEM research, including by all research teams on this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has been designed to enable transformative research across STEM disciplines, including weather prediction (real time forecasting, warn on-forecast and data mining of forecasts), high energy physics, weather radar, ecological informatics, and research on advanced networking, supporting over 200 researchers (undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, staff and faculty).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ (1) Intellectual Merit  An Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Research &amp; Education Facilitator (ACI-REF) position was funded at the University of Oklahoma (OU), specifically a Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Engineer, to implement the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN), a friction free and Software Defined Network not just at OU but shared with and located at Oklahoma State University, Langston University (Oklahoma's only Historically Black College/University), the Oklahoma Innovation Institute (a nonprofit in Tulsa), the University of Tulsa, and the University of Central Oklahoma.  (2) Broader Impact  The ACI-REF Virtual Residency Program was implemented, teaching pre-service and in-service research computing professionals how to provide, or better provide, CI facilitation and CI engineering services.  The impact went far beyond the originally proposed three dozen or so institutions; the final tally was actually over 300 people from 181 institutions in 49 US states and 2 US territories, plus 5 other countries. Over the 3 years the grant was active, the team conducted 3 weeklong intensive "boot camp" workshops, and helped a statewide university system (in a much larger state) to conduct a mini-workshop of their own.  In addition, as an offshoot of (2), this project's Principal Investigator established a new activity, not in the original proposal, to teach CI facilitators how to write grant proposals, by writing a grant proposal together, on the understanding that the best mechanism for learning how to write grant proposals is to participate in writing a grant proposal. This activity has had 62 participants from over 50 institutions, and is poised to submit a major grant proposal in early 2018.  Thus, a project intended to have its greatest impact at the home institution is proving to have even greater impact nationally and internationally, helping to shape the Cyberinfrastructure workforce for years to come.
