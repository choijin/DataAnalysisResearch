<AbstractNarration>Like engineering systems, population systems often involve nonlinear feedback loops, parameter uncertainty, and external (often persistent) disturbances. For instance, in plant populations, seedling recruitment is often a nonlinear feedback of the structured population. As another example, populations coupled via dispersal are naturally described by a closed-loop feedback system. This project will develop techniques for the analysis and control of a class of nonlinear structured population models with uncertainties and disturbances. Any ecological system is subject to a wide range of natural disturbances and parameters uncertainties, and in population management it is critical to do a robustness analysis of the effect of these disturbances and uncertainties on the population. This research project aims to obtain new mathematical results about stability analysis, tracking controllers, and observers and observer-based controllers, and robustness for these systems. Optimal control, where a cost function is to be minimized, has also been used frequently in ecology. Proportional-integral-derivative controllers are feedbacks of observed measurements, and are known to have good robustness properties. This work introduces ideas from robust feedback control theory into management of plant and animal populations, with a particular emphasis on endangered plants. The results of this research project will have potential impact in environmental, economic, and social policy areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concepts of robustness of feedback loops, small gains, absolute stability, and input-to-state stability are well suited to modeling and analysis of uncertain, structured, nonlinear population dynamics. Feedback control can be applied robustly without knowledge of the probability distributions of the uncertainties and disturbances, so that it can be applied to some models for which a stochastic analysis is not possible. We study the class of Lure systems, which can be described as a feedback interconnection between a linear system and a nonlinearity. We consider these systems in either discrete time or continuous time, and with either a finite dimensional state space or an infinite dimensional state space. We include uncertainties and disturbances in the model. We propose to develop mathematics that will extend systems theory techniques and concepts to Lure systems that describe structured populations. A key feature is the interplay between the linear part and nonlinear part, and will require a combination of classical engineering input-output techniques and mathematical state space analysis. Our key goals are: to determine the asymptotic stability structure of the uncontrolled continuous time system; to study the effect of a tracking controllers, which are feedback controllers that uses an observation of the system (instead of the whole state) as their input; and to construct and analyze an observer and observer-based controller for Lure systems. An observer is a dynamical system that takes the observation of the original system as its input, and asymptotically reconstructs the whole state of the original system. We will apply these results and techniques to population management problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we developed techniques for the analysis and control of nonlinear discrete-time structured population models with uncertainties and disturbances.  We mostly studied invasive species, although we also did some work with endangered species. Much of our work started with an invasive weevil species which is destroying citrus crops in locations such as Florida and California.  We used a mathematical model which describes the 4 or 6 developmental stages of the weevil, and is general enough to modify for other invasive species.  We studied the question of how to apply biological control (in this case nematodes) to manage the weevils, and this could be modified for the use of pesticides.  We studied how to use, and modify, a type of feedback control called high-gain adaptive control to this system.  This type of control does not require a precise knowledge of the model, and is robust to uncertainties and disturbances in the model.  We also studied how to use optimal control on this system, minimizing a cost functional, which balances the cost of applying control with the cost of the damage done by the weevils.  This type of control is very cost-effective if we have precise knowledge of the model, but is not robust to uncertainties and disturbances.  We also compared the cost-effectiveness and robustness of these two approaches under a range of perturbations of the system.   We studied length-based models for invasive fish. In these models, the probability of a fish growing is a nonlinear decreasing function of the total biomass of community, leading to populations which are dominated by smaller members. We did an analysis of the asymptotic behavior predicted by these models, giving conditions under which the population goes extinct, conditions under which the population increases without bound, and conditions under which the biomass has a globally stable asymptotic limit. Our results are consistent with data provided by fisheries colleagues for an invasive, stunted white perch population.  We have done research on Lur?e systems, which can be described as a feedback interconnection between a linear system and a nonlinearity, and can be used for species where the stability and growth are linear and the reproduction is dependent on population density.  In particular, we have designed low gain tracking for Lur?e systems, which is a feedback control which asymptotically steers an output of the system to a desired value.  We have also studied sensitivities and elasticities for the asymptotic dynamics of (uncontrolled) Lur?e systems, which are important for both robustness analysis and for population management  In many cases population models can only be partially observed.  For instance, some developmental stages for some species occur away from monitoring.  An observer is a dynamical system that is used to asymptotically determine the entire state of the system.  We have shown that such an observer is easy to find for a wide range of population systems, including Lur?e systems.
