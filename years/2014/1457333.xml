<AbstractNarration>Changes to predator communities are occurring on a global scale. Because top predators can exert strong pressures on other species in a community, it is important to understand the consequences of their losses or gains. Will re-introduction of wolves alter current elk or moose populations? Will the loss of marine predators cause fish communities to collapse? These expectations often generate controversy. This project tests how evolutionary responses of prey to their predators might alter commonly-expected results of cascading effects within food chains. Predation, trophic cascades, and evolution are features of all natural ecosystems. Understanding how these processes interact is fundamental to interpreting past ecosystem changes and to predicting future changes. The results from this study will directly inform many of the controversies attending management of large predators. High school teachers and undergraduate students with teaching aspirations will be introduced to the ecological relevance of evolution through hands-on involvement in the research. This teacher training program will target teachers and students from traditionally underrepresented groups who work, or plan to work, in high needs schools with diverse and underprivileged students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of eco-evolutionary dynamics considers how ongoing evolution interacts with ecological interactions to shape population, community and ecosystem processes. Intriguing case studies suggest the effects of contemporary evolution on ecology can be large, but this area of research lacks theory that would extend its general importance. This research serves as a potential general application of the broader synthetic theory of eco-evolutionary dynamics through study of trophic cascades. It will provide an initial test of the requisite conditions of eco-evolutionary trophic cascades and quantitatively compare the magnitude and pattern of their effects to those of classical density- and behaviorally-mediated trophic cascades to understand their importance. Field surveys, manipulative experiments, and common garden experiments will be integrated to test the following predictions: 1) prey feeding traits in wild populations differ predictably in response to predator presence or absence, 2) feeding trait differences are heritable, 3) heritable differences in prey traits affect the density and species composition of prey resources, and 4) effects on prey resources cascade down food chains to influence  primary producers. These conditions will be tested using recently introduced populations of Western mosquitofish inhabiting ponds with or without predatory largemouth bass. Mosquitofish are a classic system for studying both trophic cascades and contemporary evolution, and preliminary evidence supports evolutionary trade-offs between predator avoidance and resource competition. Numerous wild populations, small body size, short life span, and easy husbandry make this species well suited for the combined field and laboratory assays required for this research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Eco-evolutionary dynamics describe the reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution occurring in contemporary time. Trophic cascades are one specific context where contemporary evolution may change ecological dynamics. Trophic cascades occur when predators change prey traits or reduce prey density in ways that increase the abundance of the prey&rsquo;s own resource. For example, largemouth bass predators can change the behavior or density of their mosquitofish prey in ways that increase zooplankton abundance. The relative strength of trait-mediated versus density-mediated trophic cascades has been the subject of much debate in ecology. Yet, the effects of predators on prey traits and density are intrinsically linked, as traits that increase prey survival in the presence of predators also decrease prey feeding rates.</p> <p>This project combined surveys of largemouth bass and mosquitofish in natural ponds with trait assays and mesocosm experiments to determine the extent to which evolutionary dynamics shape the strength of trophic cascades. Results show that wild mosquitofish populations display consistent adaptations to largemouth bass predators, including smaller body size and lower activity levels. Behavioral trials revealed that mosquitofish reduce feeding rates in the presence of largemouth bass, and that the effects of evolution on reduced feeding rate are stronger than the effects of phenotypic plasticity. Mesocosm experiments revealed a bass-mosquitofish-zooplankton trophic cascade. The strength of the cascade was about equal for predator-na&iuml;ve and predator-experienced mosquitofish populations, but the dominant cascade mechanism differed. In the presence of bass, predator-na&iuml;ve mosquitofish fed at high rates but were reduced in density due to bass consumption, causing a strong density-mediated cascade. In contrast, predator-experienced mosquitofish did not feed much but survived better, causing a strong trait-mediated cascade. Thus, contemporary evolution tends to maintain the strength of trophic cascades while shifting the dominant mechanism from prey density to prey traits. A final experiment revealed that this change in prey traits feeds back to shape predator growth. Largemouth bass consumed more mosquitofish and grew more quickly when in the presence of predator-na&iuml;ve versus predator-experienced mosquitofish. The effects of mosquitofish adaptation on bass growth were similar to the effects of mosquitofish density, further illustrating the importance of prey evolution for shaping ecological dynamics.</p> <p>In terms of intellectual merit, this project provides new evidence that traits and density are not alternative trophic cascade mechanisms, but rather two sides of the same coin &ndash; traits that increase prey feeding rates tend to reduce prey survival (as seen in predator-na&iuml;ve populations) and traits that decrease prey feeding rates tend to increase prey survival (as seen in predator-experienced populations). This result supports the emerging theme in eco-evolutionary research that ongoing evolution often serves to stabilize ecological dynamics. In terms of broader impacts, results reveal the importance of evolution for shaping the outcomes of predator invasions. Upon initial invasion into predator-na&iuml;ve communities, predators are expected to show explosive individual growth and drive strong density-mediated trophic cascades. However, prey evolution may occur relatively quickly, decreasing predator growth, increasing prey survival, and shifting cascades to trait-mediated. These insights can be used to manage invasive predators, for example by introducing predator-experienced prey. They can also contribute to the management of fisheries by revealing how fisheries harvest can impact the traits and abundances of non-target species.</p> <p>The UC Santa Cruz component of this project contributed to the training of three graduate students, one postdoctoral researcher, fifteen undergraduate students, and two RET teachers.
