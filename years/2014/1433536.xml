<AbstractNarration>This award supports the PI as a postdoctoral researcher at Boston University under the supervision of Dr. Meers Oppenheim. The objective of this project is to improve understanding of turbulent processes in the E-region ionosphere through simulation. This work will produce 3-D kinetic simulations of plasma turbulence in the E-region. Turbulence affects trans-ionospheric communication and over-the-horizon radars. Models of space weather will be improved using the project results.&lt;br/&gt;Based on earlier work by both the host and the PI, a new code will be developed to simulate the coupling of Farley-Buneman and gradient drift waves in the E-region. The simulation of coupled Farley-Buneman/gradient drift waves will determine the spectrum and mechanism associated with the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales, will test if this coupling explains "squared-off" electric field measurements by rockets, will determine how E-region turbulence changes from the equatorial region to the enormously varying auroral region, will see if there are any fundamental E-region instability processes that have been overlooked, particularly in the "medium-scale", and will determine how anomalous electron heating associated with fully 3-D turbulence changes with altitude and latitude. Simulation results will be directly comparable to observations by radars, rockets, and spacecraft and the results will also guide future experiments. Another goal is to use these simulations to determine a physical mechanism responsible for the 150 km echoes that have been observed by radars for decades.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the project is to improve understanding of turbulent processes in the E-region ionosphere through simulation. This work improves large scale models of the ionosphere, allows accurate interpretations of the underlying physics responsible for remote and in-situ measurements, and attempts to answer a number of longstanding questions concerning E-region physics.  Specifically, it studies how large and small scales are coupled as well as the origin of unexplained artifacts in radar data known as 150 km echoes.  A mechanism for 150 km echoes involving injection of photoelectrons was shown to be plausible and deserving of further study.  A number of improvements in kinetic plasma simulations were realized, specifically in including high-order accuracy in these simulations &ndash; something that has eluded computational physicists due to interpolation steps of the particle-in-cell method.  This will improve computational research in other areas of ionospheric plasma physics.  Much of the near-Earth space environment is coupled in some manner to the ionosphere, and thus E-region irregularities can affect other parts of the atmosphere. This means a proper understanding of turbulence and large-scale structuring of the E-region is crucial for predicting space weather affecting satellites and manned spacecraft in any near-Earth orbit.  Commercialized spaceflights fly primarily in the ionosphere and thermosphere. As this new industry grows, an in depth understanding of the near-Earth space environment will become even more critical. Better understanding of ionospheric turbulence will lead to more accurate prediction of space weather.  Accurate prediction of space weather has far reaching consequences: satellite drag is more predictable, satellites are easier to track and thus lost less frequently, GPS positioning is more reliable, and even electric power grids on the ground are more protected.
