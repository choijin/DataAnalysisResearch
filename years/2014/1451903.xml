<AbstractNarration>PI:  Payne, Christine K.    &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1451903&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in neuroscience and neuroengineering require new tools. Of specific need is the ability to interface electrical devices with the brain. The challenge is coupling hard metal surfaces to the soft environment of the brain. To address this problem, the investigators will pursue a novel direction, using soft, flexible, biocompatible conducting polymers to form nanowires within individual cells. These conducting polymer nanowires will provide a new tool for neural probes, bionic implants, regenerative medicine, and the treatment of neurological disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will address two specific goals; intracellular delivery of a foreign material into cells and electrochemical polymerization in a protein-rich, high salt, environment. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) will be used as a representative conducting polymer.  Aim 1 will focus on delivery of the monomer into the cell using the cell's own pinocytic machinery. Experiments will use PC-12 model neurons. Aim 2 will electrochemically polymerize the monomer to form a nanowire within the cell, establishing contacts between external electrodes and the cell.  Each Aim is accompanied by extensive cytotoxicity assays to ensure the cells remain healthy during the process. In addition to the biomedical applications enabled by a hybrid conducting polymer-cell, this research will provide interdisciplinary training at the interface of engineering and life sciences for a diverse group of students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate level.</AbstractNarration>

The challenge is coupling conducting materials to the soft environment of the cell. For biological applications, conducting polymers have great potential due to both their flexibility and biocompatibility. The goal of this research is to embed a conducting polymer within live cells to create a cell that maintains its normal cellular functions while serving as its own electrically active material. It is expected that these hybrid conducting polymer-cells will be unique tools for the neural engineering community.     Water-soluble poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is used as a representative conducting polymer. Experiments during the last two years focused on delivery of the polymer into the cell using the cell?s own pinocytic machinery.
