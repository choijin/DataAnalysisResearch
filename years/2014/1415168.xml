<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was used to provide travel allowances to support student attendance at the 29th IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC), which took place from June 10 to June 13, 2014 in Vancouver, British Columbia.  CCC is the primary conference for research in computational complexity, which studies the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. This study includes many fundamental problems, e.g., the feasibility of cryptography, the so-called P versus NP problem, and what could be achieved with quantum computers.  The conference's technical content and professional networking opportunities are particularly valuable to students.  This award provided support to fourteen student attendees to defray costs of registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.  Students from across the country were supported, including many who would not otherwise have been able to attend.  In addition to paper presentations for the papers accepted to the conference, two invited talks were given.  A rump session was held with short, informal presentations of work in progress.  The conference's annual business meeting was held.  The recipients of the travel allowances supported by this grant were able to participate in all of these activities.  Due to the exposure to the latest research and networking possibilities, attendance at the conference benefits the research education of the students awarded funding.  Supporting an active pool of student researchers provides for the health of the computational complexity research community.
