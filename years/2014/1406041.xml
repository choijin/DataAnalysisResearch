<AbstractNarration>This project will provide the computing equipment through an infrastructure grant that will enable greater capability for analysis of empirical social and economic phenomena, mediated in cyberspace such as, for example, massive online social networks, malicious web content, and underground cybercrime markets. The popular online sites like Facebook and Twitter connect literally billions of people; however, entirely new threats to such sites have emerged driven by cybercrime. In the absence of effective defenses, online social ecosystems today suffer. The empirical study of these threats and mitigating strategies in today's enormous web infrastructure requires a highly scalable and capable cyber infrastructure.  Better understanding these complex cyber ecosystems, made possible through this equipment grant, will lead to new insights for making cyberspace safer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Measuring and analyzing security threats provides an evidence-based approach towards uncovering the fundamental nature of Internet attacks and to assess the efficacy of defenses and intervention strategies.  This infrastructure project aimed to provide the necessary computing resources to support such investigations.   The infrastructure supported a wide range of research projects, leading to the publication of 13 papers and theses.  These included:   - Ingestion of "threat intelligence" feeds (security-related data streams of varying types and of varying curation and richness, shared among a set of parties to facilitate stronger security practices) from more than 300 sources, spanning 10.1 billion "indicators" (IP addresses, urls, domains, credentials, email addresses, etc.) and 315 million malware hashes from 14 million families.   - Generating a novel dataset of web browser feature usage under interactive workloads, spanning nearly all of the sites in the top 10,000 Alexa list, and including data about over 21 billion JavaScript feature invocations across visits to over 2.2 million web pages.   - Analysis more than 3 years of SMTP and network traffic logs (372 million email log entries, 93 million correlations between those and HTTP traffic), from a large enterprise to detect spear phishing attacks.  This work was awarded Facebook's $100,000 Internet Defense Prize.   - Developed IP address "Target Generation Algorithms" in support of efficient Internet-scale measurements of the IPv6 address space.   - Performed extensive analyses relating to performing third-party measurement of network-layer Internet censorship by leveraging IP header side-channels to infer whether a remote client in an arbitrary country A experiences blockage if attempting to contact a remote server in an arbitrary country B.   - Performed extensive analyses relating to performing third-party measurement of DNS-based Internet censorship, measuring whether remote clients in an arbitrary country A receive incorrect responses when attempting to look up domains associated with a remote server in an arbitrary country B.   - Analyzed a number of data sources to assess the nature and dynamics of blocking of access by the Tor anonymity system to various remote services.  Such blocking erodes the utility of Tor, making it more difficult to grow the system to scales that enable it to robustly facilitate censorship evasion.  - Collected and analyzed the effects of "doxing", the unauthorized investigation and discovery of a victim's identifying information like home address, work information, and OSN handles.  - Undertook an analysis of the evolution of dynamic behavior (system call) evolution in several hundreds of thousands of malware samples, attempting to identify whether and how malware authors modify their samples' dynamic behavior to evade detection.
