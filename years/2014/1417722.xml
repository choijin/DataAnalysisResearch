<AbstractNarration>This project will develop curricula for environmental/geoscience disciplines for high-school classrooms.   It will teach a systems approach to problem solving through hands-on activities based on local data and issues. This will provide an opportunity for students to act in their communities while engaging in solving problems they find interesting, and require synthesis of prior learning.  The Model My Watershed (MMW) v2 app will bring new environmental datasets and geospatial capabilities into the classroom, to provide a cloud-based learning and analysis platform accessible from a web browser on any computer or mobile device, thus overcoming the cost and technical obstacles to integrating Geographic Information System technology in secondary education.  It will also integrate new low-cost environmental sensors that allow students to collect and upload their own data and compare them to data visualized on the new MMW v2.  This project will transform the ability of teachers throughout the nation to introduce hands-on geospatial analysis activities in the classroom, to explore a wide range of geographic, social, political and environmental concepts and problems beyond the project's specific curricular focus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Next Generation Science Standards state that authentic research experiences are necessary to enhance STEM learning. A combination of computational modeling and data collection and analysis will be integrated into this project to address this need. Placing STEM content within a place- and problem-based framework enhances STEM learning. Students, working in groups, will not only design solutions, they will be required to defend them within the application portal through the creation of multimedia products such as videos, articles and web 2.0 presentations.  The research plan tests the overall hypothesis that students are much more likely to develop an interest in careers that require systems thinking and/or spatial thinking, such as environmental sciences, if they are provided with problem-based, place-based, hands-on learning experiences using real data, authentic geospatial analysis tools and models, and opportunities to collect their own supporting data. The MMW v2 web app will include a data visualization tool that streams data related to the modeling application. This database will be modified to integrate student data so teachers and students can easily compare their data to data collected by other students and the government and research data. All data will be easily downloadable so that students can increase the use of real data to support the educational exercises. As a complement to the model-based activities, the project partners will design, manufacture, and distribute a low-cost environmental monitoring device, called the Watershed Tracker.  This device will allow students to collect real-world data to enhance their understanding of watershed dynamics. Featuring temperature, light, humidity, and soil moisture sensors, the Watershed Tracker will be designed to connect to tablets and smartphones through the audio jack common to all of these devices.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In today's technologically rich world, students have the ability to collect data from their surroundings and the ability to explore large national datasets. This project investigated whether curriculum that is purposefully designed to provide students with meaningful opportunities to connect conceptual understanding of watersheds to authentic real-world data in scientific-grade resources, models, and tools (RMTs) supports students? watershed knowledge, interest, and action. The Teaching Environmental Sustainability - Model My Watershed (TES-MMW) curriculum and RMTs situate student learning in the exploration and evaluation of the conditions of their local watershed using field experimentation with probeware, national datasets and a scientifically valid watershed modeling application.</p> <p>The curriculum was implemented by 38 teachers in 8 states with data collected from 1,533 students during the final year. The instruments used in this study include a watershed content assessment and portions of the NOAA B-WET Secondary Science Self Report (knowledge of action, intent to act, and locus of control) and a semi-structured Critical Incident Technique interview protocol to assess students' engagement and action. In order to better understand which of the TES-MMW?s RMTs were most influential to students? engagement in watershed actions, students were asked to reflect on their experience with the TES-MMW curriculum and to describe which activities were most impactful and motivated them to care about their local watershed. Four RMT's were frequently reported by students as most influential: Model My Watershed (MMW) GIS application (69%), probeware and outdoor data collection (35%), the online learning portal (33%), and the guided tour of the schoolyard watershed (25%). The data indicates that a data-driven watershed modeling curriculum with scientific-grade RMTs, particularly a geographic information systems (GIS) watershed modeling software (MMW), is an effective tool for increasing students? abilities in two of the environmental stewardship characteristics. Students? content understanding and knowledge of action increased while their locus of control and intent to act remained unchanged.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the five years of the project, versions of the TES-MMW curriculum were implemented by 117 teachers in 8 different states across the U.S. during the past four years. Many other teachers and students have been and are able to use this free curriculum, which is accessible online through the ITSI Portal (<a href="https://itsi.portal.concord.org/">https://itsi.portal.concord.org/</a>) and the WikiWatershed Toolkit (<a href="https://wikiwatershed.org/">https://wikiwatershed.org/</a>), and as a result of dissemination efforts to audiences beyond the project teachers. About 165 presentations, workshops, webinars, newsletters, and other dissemination products and efforts were completed during the life of the project. The Model My Watershed online GIS is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze various geospatial phenomena and to investigate changes to land use or implementation of conservation practices. Use of this application has expanded beyond STEM education and watershed science to other areas, such as robust watershed research and restoration monitoring, public health, and socioeconomic analyses. Over 60 watershed associations and citizen monitoring groups, mainly in the Delaware River Basin and also across the country, are using MMW for modeling and planning of watershed improvement projects and monitoring. A 2019 WikiWatershed Toolkit User Survey shows continued excitement about the tools from a spectrum of types of users. The WikiWatershed Toolkit includes Model My Watershed, Runoff Simulation, Monitor My Watershed, EnviroDIY, Leaf Pack Network, Water Quality Mobile App, and Macroinvertebrates.org.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/17/2019<br>      Modified by: Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Staudt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322650910_MasterTeacherPD--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322650910_MasterTeacherPD--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Advanced Training for Master Teachers"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322650910_MasterTeacherPD--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Advanced Training for Master Teachers"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Master Teachers participated in advanced training in the curriculum, resources, models, and tools of the TES-MMW curriculum and training in unit extensions including use of the Leaf Pack kit for collection and identification of macroinvertebrates as a bioassessment of stream health shown in here.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Concord Consortium</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Staudt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Advanced Training for Master Teachers</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322359065_ModelMyWatershed--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322359065_ModelMyWatershed--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Model My Watershed"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322359065_ModelMyWatershed--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Model My Watershed"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">his screen capture of the Model My Watershed software shows how users can model different scenarios in changes to land cover and conservation practices to improve watersheds.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stroud Water Research Center</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Staudt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Model My Watershed</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322283627_RunoffSimulation--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322283627_RunoffSimulation--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Runoff Simulation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322283627_RunoffSimulation--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Runoff Simulation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This Runoff Simulation is a scaffolding learning tool for users to become familiar with the Site Storm Model (24-hour storm event) in the full-scale Model My Watershed application.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stroud Water Research Center</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Staudt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Runoff Simulation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322757001_MMWClassroom--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322757001_MMWClassroom--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Model My Watershed in the Classroom"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417722/1417722_10336024_1571322757001_MMWClassroom--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Model My Watershed in the Classroom"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In the culminating lesson of the Teaching Environmental Sustainability-Model My Watershed curriculum students use the Model My Watershed online GIS to create scenarios of changes in land use and conservation practices to improve their local watershed.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stroud Water Research Center</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Staudt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Model My Watershed in the Classroom</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
