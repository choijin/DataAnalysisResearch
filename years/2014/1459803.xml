<AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel support for students wishing to attend the 2014 Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) conference, which is to be held in Broomfield, Colorado, from Oct 6-8, 2014.  OSDI is the leading international conference on both research and industrial innovations in the field of computer systems, which includes operating systems, mobile computing, distributed systems, file systems, computer security and reliability, and the management and debugging of complex computer systems.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports up to 30 US-based graduate students to attend and participate in the conference, to learn about the latest research directions, and to meet and discuss their research with leading experts in the field. Students have an opportunity to participate in workshops on special topics or on workshops intended to support students with diverse backgrounds, to present research posters and/or talks, and to volunteer as scribes for the conference sessions.  This grant support enables attendance of students who would not otherwise have been able to attend.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Description  The 11th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 2014) brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software.  The OSDI 2014 technical program included 42 technical papers carefully selected from over 226 submissions by a refereed committee.  The conference also hosted two poster sessions.  The papers represent some of the outstanding work in the area, with topics including big data, distributed systems and networking, security, virtualization, and mobility. The conference was held in Broomfield, CO, October 6&ndash;8, 2014.     Activities and Findings  USENIX received 166 grant applications from students, and 107 were funded.  Some of the funds were covered by the $25,000 from the travel grant, and all NSF grant recipients were enrolled at U.S. universities.  USENIX appreciates the financial support of the NSF, which allowed us to grant awards to many more qualified applicants than we would have been able to otherwise.  There were 610 total attendees at OSDI 2014, with 256 total student attendees.  We saw many countries in attendance: 422 were from the U.S. Non-U.S. attendees came from:  Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, India, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.
