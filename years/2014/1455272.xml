<AbstractNarration>Landslides, earthquakes, avalanches, wildfires, and financial crises are examples of disaster events in complex systems. The aim of this research is to prove theorems about mathematical models of these systems, with three particular goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Quantify the dependence of large-scale observations on small details. Which details actually matter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Develop efficient algorithms to determine whether a given system will stabilize and how long it will take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Examine the threshold state that precedes a large disaster event, and what triggers the disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While simulation is an important tool for modeling complex systems, the focus of this research is on mathematical proof. A simulation reveals how a system behaves, but a proof reveals why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many interacting particle systems have a phase transition between a state that eventually stabilizes and a state in which activity persists forever. These systems have a second level of dynamics, operating on a slower time scale and driving the system toward greater instability, leading ultimately to a threshold state in which activity persists forever. Until recently this threshold state remained beyond the realm of rigorous proof, but it is now understood in a particular case, the abelian sandpile in the limit as the initial condition tends to negative infinity. Dr. Levine will leverage this understanding to locate the activity phase transition in a wider class of models. This project also has an educational component, whose goal is to encourage and enable bright young people to pursue science and technology careers by providing them with the working knowledge of probability they will need to succeed in those careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Nature is full of complex systems: the development of an egg cell into a living embryo; the firings of neurons inside the brain that somehow enable us to think; the air, water, and life that influence Earth's climate.  Improved understanding of complex systems is a pressing need. Abelian Networks are mathematical models of certain complex systems. They are inspired by the Abelian Sandpile Model, which is a mathematical model of sand cascading down a pile. Even a seemingly simple process like the formation of sand dunes by wind, is actually a complex system!  Abelian Networks are both simple and deep: Their rules are simple, but their behavior is complex. Just like the laws of nature themselves (Newton laws, for example, or Einstein's theory of relativity) they demonstrate that simple rules can lead to amazing consequences. Those consequences are beautiful and mysterious and they lead us to wonder: Why is the world the way it is, and why is it not the way it isn?t?  The research funded by this award led to a better understanding of complex systems: In particular, our investigation of scaling limits clarifies how and why small details of a complex system can often affect its large-scale behavior.  These research advances improve our knowledge about the world. They stand on their own merits as basic science. In the future, basic science can inform our efforts to engineer or influence complex systems for the betterment of humanity.
