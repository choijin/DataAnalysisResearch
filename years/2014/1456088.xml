<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from lowering the barrier to entry for, and simplifying the use of, cloud computing systems via a novel, open source, cloud platform.  The proposed advances have the potential to facilitate and expedite innovation and technological progress by a diverse software and global developer community, enabling more people to tackle the important yet increasingly challenging and data-intensive computing problems facing businesses today. The company's technologies address directly the key pain points of this explosively growing platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and cloud-based application development market - namely privacy, lock-in, and control.  Unique to the company's approach is compatibility with a leading, proprietary, public cloud PaaS standard (Google App Engine).  As such, the company's solutions have significant commercial potential because they are directly applicable to businesses that employ App Engine today (there are currently over 4.5 million active applications), and they lay the groundwork for addressing the larger PaaS market in the long term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is based on a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) via automation, thereby relieving developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so.  The proposed technology advances address the issue of vendor lock-in - i.e. the use of proprietary technologies, services, and systems that effectively prevent users from switching to alternative vendors.  In the cloud space, lock-in is proliferated through the use of (i) proprietary interfaces and tools, (ii) complex pricing models, and (iii) the lack of interoperability across vendors.  The proposed technology disrupts lock-in by public cloud vendors by automating software deployment and management across clouds, and by making it easy to move applications and data between vendor offerings and on-premise clusters. In particular, the company's technologies abstract away the complexities of cloud use, and provide monitoring, backup/restoration, and migration of applications and data across clouds at the push of a button.  By providing features that are currently unavailable today, the proposed technologies have significant potential for reducing the cost, risk, and learning curve associated with cloud-based development, deployment, disaster recovery, and migration for the next generation of cloud applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This SBIR project has facilitated the productization of the AppScale cloud platform, a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) to relieve developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so, via automation.  AppScale simplifies expedites development and deployment of apps, enabling developers to innovate faster and to execute their apps everywhere.  Key to the company's commercialization potential is in the AppScale design which mirrors the successful, "de facto" standard, in public cloud platforms: Google App Engine.  In this project, the team designed and developed support for the next generation in disaster recovery, migration, and customizable portability for code and data that comprise interactive cloud apps.   The intellectual merit of this work include novel platform optimizations that improve the scale and performance of cloud deployments for interactive apps and multi-player gaming apps, extensions that more tightly integrate with cloud-enable data centers in China, and new mechanisms that facilitate fault tolerance and self-management of the platform to ease the IT management burden for on-premises AppScale deployments.  Each advance provides a key platform service that is required for broad commercialization and growth of our company.  The result, we believe is a solid foundation of the computer scientific and engineering knowledge and understanding base, for facilitating successful commercialization and sales growth for our products and services.   The broader impacts of this effort include a clear path to commercialization based upon significant and long-term market validation and customer discovery, a commercialization plan that is focused and targeted to an emerging and significant market vertical, and a strategy for developing and growing our current customer  base to bridge the gap between research, technology transfer, and commercial success.  The AppScale platform and the enhancements that this SBIR has enabled are unique and position us to take advantage of a growing customer segment with significant growth potential.  Finally, our advances give our customers control over their apps and data, the ability to move between and among cloud vendors (i.e. pursue multi-cloud deployment), precluding lock-in and facilitating choice and competitiveness.
