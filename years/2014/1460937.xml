<AbstractNarration>The REU program on Inverse Problems for Electrical Networks will bring eight undergraduates to the University of Washington in each of the summers of 2015-2017 to work on inverse problems for electrical networks and related problems on graphs. The students will also investigate problems in combinatorics and special topics in number theory.  The simplest inverse problem for an electrical network is to determine the conductance of each of the conductors in an electrical network when the boundary current response of the network to boundary voltages is known, but no interior knowledge is available. Imagine a box in which there is an unknown electric circuit with leads protruding from the box at which current and voltage can be measured.  The solution of the problem can be interpreted as providing an electrical version of an x-ray.  A simplified version of the inverse problem is the problem of mine detection with an electrical field.  The intent of the program is to guide students into independent research projects which can be completed in the eight week period.  The students will be given reading material before the program starts and introduce them to research problems in the first week.  Students will learn how to formulate and attack research problems in a supportive, collaborative atmosphere.  An emphasis will be placed on communicating results.  Prior students will work as  TAs and mentor current students.  Alumni of the program will be frequent visitors and provide additional help. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are difficult technical questions that students have asked and answered. In recent years students have discovered exotic electrical networks that cannot be recovered by boundary data but are almost uniquely determined. In other words there are only a finite number of possibilities for networks compatible with the given boundary measurements. These are called networks n-to-1 networks.  Students in the program invented these networks and discovered their properties.  New examples are constructed by gluing certain "four-star" graphs in a pattern that looks something like a cactus or shoelace graph.  There are now many different families of such graphs, which will be investigated.  Another topic is properties of permutations, especially peak points of permutations. Students have recently found interesting properties of peak polynomials, for instance that all peaks in a peak set are zeros of its corresponding peak polynomial. These and other topics will be the building blocks of this program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The students and advisors for this program met at the University of Washington for eight weeks in the summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017.  Some of their work was on inverse probems for electrical networks, random walks on graphs, stochastic music, partially ordered sets, sandpile models, chip firing on graphs, graph embeddings, and electrical Lie algebras. Approximate solutions to inverse problems have potential applications to designing medical instruments, detecting sources of circuit problems, and locating underground minerals.   There were a total of thirty-one undergraduates, which included eleven women and twenty men.   The home institutions of these students were public and private universities as well as small colleges with no advanced degrees. They were from all regions of the United States. They are representative of a broad sample of mathematical talent.   Each day a student met with one of the facultyor teaching assistants. Students and faculty worked together on the problems.This typically consisted of working on details of computations,testing conjectures with examples, or working on details of proofs.  Each student made several oral presentations to the whole group.  Their work has reasulted in several journal publications.  More papers are in preparation and will appear.   Many of the students have been accepted to graduate programs at prominent research universities.  Among these institutions are  Harvard, MIT, UC Berkeley, UW, UCLA, Yale,  University of Michigan, University of Arizona, NYU, Georgia Tech,  and UT Austin.    The students are recipients of many awards, such as NSF Graduate Fellowship, Dean's Medal, Goldwater Fellowship, Outstanding Senior Math Major, and graduate fellowships at their institutions.    REU site director, Jim Morrow, was named Vaho Rebassoo TermProfessor of Mathematics for 2018-20.  He was in the inaugural 2018 class of AWM Fellows. He was also awarded grants by Boeing and Wells Fargo to support Mathday, an event for 1600 high school students at the University of Washington.
