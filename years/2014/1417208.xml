<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide a new tool revealing important information regarding skeletal muscle strength and health. Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non--?]intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle--?]by--?]muscle basis. The initial targeted customers are athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to both inform training of athletes to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return--?]to--?]sport decisions. However, following penetration into the athlete sector, the ultimate goal is to advance the technology to the point where it can more broadly to used clinically as a diagnostic tool to be used in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have wide spanning overall societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image--?]based modeling tools in order to allow high--?]throughput imaging and segmentation of muscles of the entire lower limb of athletes. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning couches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?fs strength. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. Similarly, because the tools have been very blunt, it is currently unknown what the optimal muscle characteristics of an athlete would be. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image--?]to--?]model pipeline to quantify muscle size across in the entire lower extremity. Preliminary evidence demonstrates that these new measurements provide entirely new metrics for phenotyping athletes, identifying which muscle profiles result in maximal performance (e.g., speed, jump height, agility). The current technology developed in the academic environment is limited in its potential to market translation because: (i) it requires a very specialized magnetic resonance imaging protocol, and (ii) segmentation time is prohibitive for commercial viability. The proposed activities have high intellectual merit in developing innovative approaches to solve both problems, ultimately transforming this from a research tool to a commercially viable service.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the STTR Phase I award, extensive research and technical development was performed focusing on solving the two major difficulties preventing the MRI muscle analysis tool originally developed in the research labs at the University of Virginia (UVA) from wide adoption and commercialization. The first difficulty was the reliance on a research-only MRI protocol to get high-resolution lower limb muscle MR images in a short time (~30 min), so that the images could only be acquired on the Siemens 3T scanner at UVA in which the research protocol was installed. During the award period, a new generic protocol was developed and tested on different types of scanners from different manufacturers. &nbsp;The image quality and scan time were comparable to the research-only protocol. Furthermore, the generic protocol can be easily ported to most commercially available scanners, so that reliance on a specific scanner and protocol was removed. The second difficulty was the lengthy segmentation process to get individual muscle information from the acquired MR images. Due to the low image contrast and complexity of muscle boundaries, automatic segmentation is very challenging and often leads to inaccurate results. Initially, a complete manual segmentation method that can take as long as 40 hours per subject was used, which greatly limited the throughput of the muscle analysis tool. During the award period, several methods aiming to reduce the time were developed and tested. One method was to reduce the number of segmented image slices by using an optimal interpolation algorithm. It was shown that the interpolation algorithm reduced muscle measurement accuracy by less than 5%, which was within the inter-observer variability. The second method was to use a previous dataset to initialize the segmentation of the new dataset through image processing techniques. The method worked very well for certain muscles and can greatly reduce the time for further adjustments. Furthermore, the two methods can be optimally combined to reduce the overall segmentation time without sacrificing the measurement accuracy for advanced analysis. With the two major difficulties completely or partially solved during the award period, the wide adoption and commercialization of the proposed muscle analysis tool is very promising. Continued research and technical development to reduce segmentation time, enhance data security and integrate advanced analysis will be performed to further increase the product value and reduce the cost. Marketing studies and other commercialization efforts will also be performed to benefit the muscle health of the general public.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/24/2016<br>      Modified by: Xue&nbsp;Feng</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
