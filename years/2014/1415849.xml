<AbstractNarration>The SBIR project aims is to excite high school and middle school children about the possibility of working in a STEM-related career. According to the National Center for Education Statistics there are 47 million students enrolled in K-12, with 29 million in middle or high school (6-12). Inspiring and engaging these students in STEM is a key component of the President?s ?Educate to Innovate Initiative?. This project will produce a low-cost computer game designed to heighten interest in STEM-related careers among these students by engaging them in game play and interactive design of robotic controllers and robot body-parts while they apply principles of mathematics, biomechanics, neuroscience and computer science. With distribution through direct internet download and through major app stores, this product taps into the commercial gaming industry with revenues of over $14B annually according to the NDP Group. Partnering with local high schools and university researchers, the project will advance our understanding of how to balance the challenge of gaming with the rewards of learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR project proposes to deliver a software game product for Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) education in the area of evolutionary robotics. The project will explore the use of Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms (IEAs) to evolve the behavior of simulated robots. In collaboration with experts in evolutionary robotics and evolutionary algorithms, the project team will measure the effectiveness of using IEAs as compared to non-interactive simple genetic algorithms and direct controller programming. With an IEA the user influences the direction of evolution through user demonstration. This method can significantly reduce evolutionary time through the search space and provides a more hands-on approach to evolutionary robotics, continually engaging the student user during the design and simulation process. The project will also investigate the use of scaffolding to physically support the robot during the evolutionary process. The physical supports are removed over evolutionary time, gradually increasing the difficulty of the task as the robot evolves, until the robot can walk or run unassisted.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the award period, we successfully tackled three technical objectives:  1) Product a game prototype using a commercial game engine which is used to evolved walking virual robots  2) Implement the robot brain controllers and neural networks and use an evolution approach to optimize the brains for activities like standing, walking and jumping  3) test the prototype software in two high schools with teenage students to mesure their engagement and whether they can recall what they learn during the game.  The research team completed all of these objectives and went further.  A full eleven game levels were developed for the first objective using the Unity 3D game engine, completed with six different virtual robot designs.  For the second objective, we compared performance of four different evolutionary algorithms to create neural network controllers. We were able to embed the evolutionary algorithm into the game and evolve robots to stand, walk, run and jump under the evolved neural network control.  For the third objective, we brought the pilot game software to four schools (two middle schools in addition to the proposed two high schools). Sixty five students played the game for a period of five weeks. We measured how often they played, what levels they enjoyed most. We compared methods used to present educational content, and interviewed students afterwards.  Our results shows that two evolutionary algorithms stood out among others: Differential Evolution (DE) and CMAES (an abbreviation for Covariance Matrix Adpatation Evolution Strategy). The CMAES algorithm produces a neural network controller for a walking robot fastest, but only succeeds 60% of the time. The DE algorithm take longer (about 1.5 times as long) and succeeds 100% of the time during our tests.  Among students tested, we found a strong preference for receiving educational matieral only after they had attempted a game level and became stuck. They objected to presentation of relevant material before it was actually needed to progress in the game.  Two weeks after game completion, we tested the students recall of specific terms and concepts used in the game. We found that 100% of the high school students and 84% of the middle school students recalled the correct name for the abbreviated PID controller used to control the robot motors.  90% of the high school students correctly answered a question about the purpose of  PID controller in the steerable robots.  In conclusion, the research team met all of the specific aims of the Phase I proposal and outlined a plan to complete a Phase II project that would deliver a completed game.
