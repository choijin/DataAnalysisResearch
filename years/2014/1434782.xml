<AbstractNarration>This project will test hypotheses related to the response of stream organisms (insects) to the extreme, rare flood disturbance of September 2013 in Colorado's Front Range.  Genetic and species composition data were collected from these streams prior to the disturbance as part of a previously funded NSF research project.  These pre-event data allow the testing of specific evolutionary and ecological hypotheses about how extreme and non-seasonal disturbance acts to selectively remove maladapted genotypes, to modify genetic variation and gene frequencies, and to re-shape biological organization of insect communities through differential species survival and associated transformation of stream food webs. Fourteen headwater streams that span an elevation gradient of over 2,000 meters and that experienced different degrees of flood disturbance will be re-sampled in late Spring 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extreme flooding in Colorado received national media attention and continues to be a topic of scientific and public discussion, so this study will likely be of broad scientific and public interest. The research represents an unprecedented opportunity to discover broad, new insights into the integrated genetic and ecological response of aquatic insects to discrete, extreme disturbance. Findings from this project will be disseminated not only through professional meetings and journals, but also via the popular press and online venues, in order to help advance public understanding the vulnerability and risks of natural systems to unusually large disturbances of the kind predicted to become increasingly more common under rapid climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Record-breaking rain fell across northern Colorado in September 2013.&nbsp; Widely reported for its loss of human life and damage to infrastructure, these torrential rains significantly modified streams through massive flooding and physical disturbance of stream channels. Populations of organisms living in some of these streams experienced a disturbance event that was, arguably, outside the range of historical variation in terms of disturbance <em>magnitude</em> and <em>timing</em> (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). Such rare events have the potential to dramatically reorganize biological systems from genes to ecosystems. These events provided genuinely unique opportunities to test theoretical expectations of biological change, but only if pre-event data could be marshaled to allow for rigorous hypothesis testing.&nbsp; Fortuitously, as part of our current Dimensions of Biodiversity research project (DEB-1046408), we had collected extensive data on genomic and community composition for stream-dwelling insects in 2011-2013 prior to this extreme event.</p> <p>The rainfall epicenter was squarely over our three focal <em>EVOTRAC </em>watersheds, where we had a total of 29 sampled streams distributed across almost 2,000 m elevation from plains to alpine (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>).<strong> </strong>A gradient of precipitation intensity occurred along both latitude (south-north) and altitude (east-west). We calculated the watershed-specific runoff for each sampling location to reveal a dramatic flood disturbance gradient (see below). We sampled 16 of the 29 previously-sample streams that occurred along a precipitation-disturbance and elevation gradients to ask how <em>extreme and non-seasonal disturbance </em>and 2) modify genetic variation and gene frequencies of resident insect populations.</p> <p>From a community ecology perspective, elevation was a primary predictor in observed differences (pre- vs post=flood) in our 16 streams. For example, significantly more species were removed on average at low (&lt;2500 m) than at high (&gt;3000 m) elevation sites and these differential removals cause the low-elevation communities to become more &lsquo;functionally&rsquo; similar to each other after the flood (i.e., in terms of multiple species traits assigned <em>a priori</em> to each species).&nbsp; These differences between low and high elevation responses were not explained by our field-based measures of in-channel disturbance experienced by the streams during the flood<strong> </strong>(<strong>Fig. 3</strong>).&nbsp; However, our measure of disturbance requires some further calibration to account for local environmental features not incorporated into standard metrics (i.e., large boulders and wood in the floodway that can modify effective disturbance from flood flows).&nbsp; A major finding is that species vulnerability to the flood appeared to be mediated by the presence of adult, terrestrial life stages of aquatic insects at the specific time of the flood.&nbsp; At low elevation sites, 6 of the 7 eliminated species were present only in the juvenile life stage and were therefore in the stream at the time of the extreme flooding. At the higher elevation sites, no taxa were eliminated and all those that persisted during the flood were present as sexually mature adults in the winged terrestrial life stage, such that these individuals did not experience the force of the flood and presumably could lay eggs in the stream as the floodwaters receded.&nbsp; This is illustrated in <strong>Fig. 4 and Fig. 5</strong>. &nbsp;</p> <p>From a genomics perspective, we did not observe strong patterns of change following the flood in the 7 aquatic insect species we were able to study. All but one of these species had adult life stages present during the floods (and thus quickly recolonized). We expected that perhaps the adult individuals present during the extreme event might provide a subset of the population gene pool and thus the after-flood cohort would be differentiated from the pre-flood genome. However, there were not consistent changes in the genetic composition of populations and individuals pre and post flood across geography (<strong>Fig. 6</strong>), suggesting a moderate degree of resilience of the species chosen. One species did show substantial changes, and it likely experienced localized bottlenecks during the flood, which reduced heterozygosity, changed allelic representation (<strong>Fig. &nbsp;6D</strong>), and potentially increased inbreeding. We plan to conduct some additional analysis to further explore some of the nuances of the data.</p> <p>Ours is the first study of its kind that has sampled a set of sites across a natural disturbance gradient with pre- and post-disturbance samples that looks at both community level responses and population level responses to disturbance intensity.&nbsp; This project tested hypotheses about how aquatic insects at these two levels of biological organization would change in response to extreme natural flooding of 16 streams distributed across a ca. 2000 m elevation range in northern Colorado. Our main findings were that species residing in low elevation streams were more vulnerable to this extreme event than those at higher elevations, and that the resilience of species genetic characteristics and insect community composition was primarily determined by the presence of adult, terrestrial life stages of the aquatic insects.&nbsp; Had this flood occurred at a different time when no adults were present, very different results could be expected.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/23/2016<br>      Modified by: N.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Record-breaking rain fell across northern Colorado in September 2013.  Widely reported for its loss of human life and damage to infrastructure, these torrential rains significantly modified streams through massive flooding and physical disturbance of stream channels. Populations of organisms living in some of these streams experienced a disturbance event that was, arguably, outside the range of historical variation in terms of disturbance magnitude and timing (Fig. 1). Such rare events have the potential to dramatically reorganize biological systems from genes to ecosystems. These events provided genuinely unique opportunities to test theoretical expectations of biological change, but only if pre-event data could be marshaled to allow for rigorous hypothesis testing.  Fortuitously, as part of our current Dimensions of Biodiversity research project (DEB-1046408), we had collected extensive data on genomic and community composition for stream-dwelling insects in 2011-2013 prior to this extreme event.  The rainfall epicenter was squarely over our three focal EVOTRAC watersheds, where we had a total of 29 sampled streams distributed across almost 2,000 m elevation from plains to alpine (Fig. 2). A gradient of precipitation intensity occurred along both latitude (south-north) and altitude (east-west). We calculated the watershed-specific runoff for each sampling location to reveal a dramatic flood disturbance gradient (see below). We sampled 16 of the 29 previously-sample streams that occurred along a precipitation-disturbance and elevation gradients to ask how extreme and non-seasonal disturbance and 2) modify genetic variation and gene frequencies of resident insect populations.  From a community ecology perspective, elevation was a primary predictor in observed differences (pre- vs post=flood) in our 16 streams. For example, significantly more species were removed on average at low (&lt;2500 m) than at high (&gt;3000 m) elevation sites and these differential removals cause the low-elevation communities to become more ?functionally? similar to each other after the flood (i.e., in terms of multiple species traits assigned a priori to each species).  These differences between low and high elevation responses were not explained by our field-based measures of in-channel disturbance experienced by the streams during the flood (Fig. 3).  However, our measure of disturbance requires some further calibration to account for local environmental features not incorporated into standard metrics (i.e., large boulders and wood in the floodway that can modify effective disturbance from flood flows).  A major finding is that species vulnerability to the flood appeared to be mediated by the presence of adult, terrestrial life stages of aquatic insects at the specific time of the flood.  At low elevation sites, 6 of the 7 eliminated species were present only in the juvenile life stage and were therefore in the stream at the time of the extreme flooding. At the higher elevation sites, no taxa were eliminated and all those that persisted during the flood were present as sexually mature adults in the winged terrestrial life stage, such that these individuals did not experience the force of the flood and presumably could lay eggs in the stream as the floodwaters receded.  This is illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.    From a genomics perspective, we did not observe strong patterns of change following the flood in the 7 aquatic insect species we were able to study. All but one of these species had adult life stages present during the floods (and thus quickly recolonized). We expected that perhaps the adult individuals present during the extreme event might provide a subset of the population gene pool and thus the after-flood cohort would be differentiated from the pre-flood genome. However, there were not consistent changes in the genetic composition of populations and individuals pre and post flood across geography (Fig. 6), suggesting a moderate degree of resilience of the species chosen. One species did show substantial changes, and it likely experienced localized bottlenecks during the flood, which reduced heterozygosity, changed allelic representation (Fig.  6D), and potentially increased inbreeding. We plan to conduct some additional analysis to further explore some of the nuances of the data.  Ours is the first study of its kind that has sampled a set of sites across a natural disturbance gradient with pre- and post-disturbance samples that looks at both community level responses and population level responses to disturbance intensity.  This project tested hypotheses about how aquatic insects at these two levels of biological organization would change in response to extreme natural flooding of 16 streams distributed across a ca. 2000 m elevation range in northern Colorado. Our main findings were that species residing in low elevation streams were more vulnerable to this extreme event than those at higher elevations, and that the resilience of species genetic characteristics and insect community composition was primarily determined by the presence of adult, terrestrial life stages of the aquatic insects.  Had this flood occurred at a different time when no adults were present, very different results could be expected.                Last Modified: 08/23/2016       Submitted by: N.
