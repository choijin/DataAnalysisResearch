<AbstractNarration>Tropical forests are famous for their high diversity, as well as the large number of rare species they harbor. Recent studies have found that, compared to common species, rare tropical tree species suffer more from pathogens that are specialized to a single host species that then spread rapidly through dense patches of seedlings of that single host. This research will test the novel hypothesis that rare species are more strongly impacted by host-specific pathogens because they have lower diversity of resistance genes at the population level, such that all their seedlings will be susceptible to the same suite of pathogens, promoting rapid pathogen spread and increasing mortality rates. This hypothesis will be tested using experimental greenhouse and field studies, combined with genetic analyses that will quantify the diversity of resistance genes for rare and common tree species in lowland tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Computer simulations will also be used to examine whether the measured differences in resistance gene diversity would impact infection levels, mortality rates and local abundance of tree species. Results of this study will improve understanding of plant-pathogen interactions, with potential applications for agriculture and horticulture (e.g. increasing pathogen resistance in crops). Hands-on training in cutting-edge genetic techniques would be provided to a wider audience through a summer workshop for students and faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will be the first to obtain large transcriptome datasets from a tree community and will provide gene sequence data that will be informative for future studies of genetic diversity in tropical forests. Examination of the effects of resistance gene diversity on forest dynamics will bridge the gap between molecular evolution studies that indicate ongoing selection for multiple resistance genes at many loci, and how this diversity functions in nature. Furthermore, this study is likely to bridge competing theories for tropical plant diversity by providing a genetic explanation for why rare tree species are more strongly controlled by their species-specific enemies, while simultaneously supporting dispersal limitation as a feature determining which species are locally dominant. Ultimately, the study should elucidate whether local rarity restricts local genetic diversity, which in turn reinforces local rarity, a cycle that can be escaped only by recruitment of new alleles via long-distance pollen or seed movement. Demonstrating such a coupling between the ecological and genetic features of populations would bring new perspectives and avenues for theoretical advances in evolution and ecology. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project set out to determine why less common tree species in a tropical rainforest, one of the most biologically diverse communities known, are more negatively affected by growing near others of their own species.  We found that more common species have more diversity (polymorphism) in genes that determine resistance to pathogenic soil microbes (fungi, bacteria, viruses), which causes them to be less negatively affected by growing near each other.  Resistance genes in plants are like antibodies in humans; they detect pathogen attacks and activate defense responses, but they are effective only against certain genotypes (strains) of pathogens. Different versions of resistance genes allow a plant to detect and repel different strains of pathogens, and for that reason it is beneficial for the gene pool of a population of trees to contain more diversity in resistance genes.  Reductions in population size cause a loss of genetic diversity, and hence our results show a mechanistic link between rarity and transmission of pathogens between trees of the same species.  In one portion of our study, we focused on a particular tropical tree species to identify a gene and its variants that determine pathogen transmission. We found that seedlings carrying a particular resistance gene variant grew substantially better when exposed to microbes from trees that carry different variants of this gene. This is a rare example in which a process called diversifying selection has been caught in action, that is, an immediate beneficial outcome of an encounter between organisms of the same species carrying different varieties of a gene.  These new results and insights allowed us to generate, with our collaborators, a mathematical model showing conditions that should permit or not permit rare species to continue to co-exist with more common species in a forest community.  "How many species co-exist and why?" is a central and still poorly understood question in ecology. By integrating large-scale features of populations (local abundance and genome-wide diversity in resistance genes) with specific information (how genes and their variants affect disease transmission between neighboring plants), and incorporating it into a mathematical description, our results provide significant new insights and predictive power about factors that affect the co-existence of species in a forest.  Our results have had a number of broader impacts. We joined forces with other colleagues on a new project to characterize genetic bases of disease resistance in cacao, the source of chocolate.  Tree crops present a special challenge for identifying and using resistance genes for crop improvement because they take decades to mature, making conventional breeding and gene identification approaches impractical.  By developing an approach that allows us to discover important resistance genes by experimental and bioinformatic methods, we are now making headway toward discoveries that can be used to improve cacao and help keep chocolate plentiful and affordable.  Our project on wild tropical trees also contributed to the formation of a biotech startup company that is developing new mode-of-action antifungal compounds for uses in agriculture.  This company attracted significant venture capital funding and presently employs 17 people.  We engaged in outreach efforts through the GCAT-SEEK network (https://gcat-seek.weebly.com) to teach modern genomic methods to faculty at undergraduate colleges so they can incorporate this knowledge into courses they teach. Workshops in which we participated served 210 participants who teach courses that we estimate have impacted about 5,000 college students.
