<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Summary&lt;br/&gt;Most of the materials today are made from polymers constituting a multi-billion-dollar industry. Whether we think about plastic cups, packaging materials, high-performance nano- and micro-devices, clothing materials, or aircraft parts, these are fabricated through polymeric chains. An understanding of how to control organization of polymers into desirable structures under a variety of externally imposed conditions is currently missing. However, such an understanding is vital to promulgate design rules for making new materials as well as for improving the performance of the materials available today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will contribute to the understanding of polymer crystallization in terms of both kinetic pathways and the emergence of the ordered structures. This proposal is aimed at building new conceptual models and discovering new laws of polymer crystallization. In addition, the proposed theoretical work complements many experimental efforts being actively pursued worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed research will have impact in numerous applied areas such as polymer processing, and fabrication of polymeric nanomaterials. Training of graduate students in this challenging research area is the strong educational component of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;Crystallization of polymers is full of intrigue and a fundamental understanding of how polymer chains organize into hierarchical structures continues to be elusive. Using advanced theoretical and computational tools to account for the unique attribute of the conformational entropy and topological defects in cooperation with enthalpic driving forces for assembly this proposal addresses (a) single crystal morphology and relative stabilities of flat lamellae, hollow pyramids, bowls, scrolls, and twisted lamellae, (b) kinetics of melting, and (c) origin of melt-memory. This proposal is aimed at building new conceptual models and discovering new laws of polymer crystallization. In addition, the proposed theoretical work complements many experimental efforts being actively pursued worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed research will have impact in numerous applied areas such as polymer processing, and fabrication of polymeric nanomaterials. Most of the materials today are made by processing semicrystalline polymers. These materials constitute a multi-billion-dollar industry. A fundamental understanding of the behavior of this important class of polymeric materials will help to design and process novel polymeric materials with enhanced benefits to our society. Training of graduate students in this challenging research area is strong educational component of this proposal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Polymer crystallization is one of the most important phenemena in the science of polymeric materials relevant to the plastics industry with billions of dollars of annual revenue. Yet, this phenomenon is not understood at all, despite efforts over the past seven decades, thus prohibiting opportunities to design better polymer-based materials. Our research has contributed to fresh understanding of several key issues, summarized below.     1. Stability of sectored morphologies of polymer single crystals: When an entangled interpenetrating collection of long flexible polymer chains dispersed in a suitable solvent is cooled to low enough temperatures, thin lamellar crystals form. Remarkably, these lamellae are sectored, with several growth sectors that have differing melting temperatures and growth kinetics, eluding so far an understanding of their origins, despite the knowledge of their existence for six decades. We have derived a theory to explain this six-decade old challenge by addressing the elasticity of fold surfaces of finite-sized lamella in the presence of disclination-type topological defects arising from anisotropic line tension.   2. Melt memory: When a polymer is cooled from a molten state to form crystals, the crystallization process remembers the melt state, although the melt is prepared by erasing any remnants of crystallinity. This surprising phenomenon, known as the melt-memory, has been known since 1960?s and still is a hot topic in the area of polymer crystallization. An explanation of this phenomenon has eluded so far. In addressing this five-decade old puzzle of melt-memory in polymer crystallization, we have derived a theory to describe melt-memory effects, by invoking an intermediate inhomogeneous melt state in the pathway between the melt and crystalline states.    3. Statistics of loops and ties in amorphous regions of melt-grown polymer crystals: Polymer crystals grown from a melt consist of alternating lamellar crystalline regions and amorphousregions. For a polymer of finite length, the statistics of loops - those chain parts which comeout of one lamella and go back to the same lamella and ties - those which connect the two lamellaeare of crucial importance in determining the mechanical properties of semicrystalline polymers. The polymer length dependence on the probability of formation of ties shows that thedecrease in probability with the thickness of amorphous region is faster for a shorter chain than for a longer one. In the limit of infinite length of the polymer chain, the probability of ties is inversely proportional to the thickness of amorphous region.   4. Anomalous crystallization behavior of ring polymers: The topology of ring polymers is different from that of linear polymers by lacking the two chain ends. The role of this topological constraint in the crystallization behavior has recently attracted experimental research with conflicting conclusions.

Broad Impacts:  Results from all of the above efforts are published in peer-reviewed journals and three Ph.D. students were trained. One Ph.D. student went to a national laboratory (NIST) as a postdoc and another Ph.D. student went to industry (ExxonMobil) as a staff scientist.
