<AbstractNarration>Getting robots to perform useful work in uncertain environments is still a grand challenge in robotics. One of the biggest possible impacts of this ability would be to enable the development of new co-robots that are nurses, handymen, and butlers for the elderly and infirm.  Other important applications would be co-robots that can help find and evacuate the injured during first responses to disasters, improvements in design and control of active prosthetic devices and exoskeletons, and locomotion and manipulation behaviors for collaborative human-robot work. This proposal requests funds to organize a workshop focused on developing new planning and control methods to extend robots? abilities to transport themselves to work sites and then to perform useful physical work.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-day workshop is proposed to encourage collaboration between the research communities of robotic manipulation and locomotion, both in academia and industry. The workshop is motivated by the fact that, although the underlying physical principles driving locomotion and manipulation are similar, the techniques developed by the two communities are not. The workshop will analyze the reasons for these differences and explore ideas to bring them closer, with the goal of cross-pollinating advances in both fields. In addition, the workshop will consider the impact of industrial efforts to address these problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  This workshop was motivated by the great divide between the fields of locomotion and manipulation, in terms of the methods used in these two fields for planning, control, perception, and design.  The goal of the workshop was to foster collaboration between the locomotion and manipulation communities and identify common tools, formulations, approaches, and algorithms from the field of locomotion with potential application in manipulation and vice versa.  To facilitate this and to enhance creative and effective discussions, the workshop was categorized into six separate sessions: (1) Grand Unifications in Locomotion and Manipulation; (2) High Dimensional Locomotion and Manipulation; (3) Disrupting Sensor Technologies; (4) Whole-body Manipulation with Error Handling and Recovery; (5) Contact-Rich Interactions and Contact Awareness; and (6) Mechanical Intelligence vs Control Authority.     Main Outcomes: The following outcomes resulted from the workshop. The workshop brought together two diverse set of communities working in locomotion and manipulation from academia, industry, and the government.  Both the workshop presentations and discussions demonstrated the existing duality between locomotion and manipulation.  The workshop helped identify the interplay, the similarities, and the key differences between locomotion and manipulation.  The workshop helped identify the current approaches and research challenges for the six central themes of the workshop.  Finally, the workshop helped identify future directions and opportunities for each of these central themes.     Recomendations for Future Research: A few identified future directions include, creating system-theoretic views of robustness in manipulation; achieving locomotion in the presence of contact uncertainty; developing algorithms to achieve bump-and-go locomotion strategies; testing locomotion and manipulation strategies on martial art tasks involving adversarial attacks; developing strategies to manipulate high-dimensional materials such as liquids, granular media, and cloth; scaling up general approaches and creating new task-agnostic algorithms to handle multiple tasks; contact-aware state estimation that makes and uses contacts to reduce the uncertainty of manipulated object state; develop strategies to assess quality of contacts; enable error-handling and recovery through robust behaviors and using rich context;understand and plan contact-rich behaviors that involve bumping, sliding, rolling, and deforming the environment; develop models with distributed contact; create and develop algorithms to use distributed vision sensors for full-body vision; and develop metrics for robustness, agility, and efficiency.
