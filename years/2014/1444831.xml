<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, the nation's program of scientific research on the southernmost continent. This project has the potential to create an appreciation in a wide audience of the ways in which research supported by the U.S. Antarctic Program uses the unique features of Antarctica as a "global natural laboratory" for a wide variety of sciences to benefit all of humanity. It also will illustrate in non-technical media how researchers use the unique features of the landscape to better understand the physical processes at work in Antarctica and how those processes affect the ecosystems of the continent, as well as Antarctica's role in the global ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artist's works--photographs and three-dimensional sculptures--are designed to show interactions between the ice and the landscape, and how each shapes the other. These are interactions that are generally otherwise unobserved by lay people. She will also make innovative use of digital technologies, such as 3-D printing, to capture aspects of the experience. The overall thrust of the project will focus on these landscape interactions as well as, to a lesser extent, on the role of the Antarctic in the global climate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only are the media in which the artist works at the cutting edge of new technologies, but she actively engages them to cultivate in a wide range of audiences, including traditionally under-served audiences such as students in the Baltimore City Schools, a very large urban district, an appreciation of the value of both science and art and how those disciplines can share intellectual intersections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation provides access to US Antarctic Program activities in Antarctica but does not provide funding for this work.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this project was to photograph the wide variety of ice formations as the basis for a series of hand-colored photographs and three-dimensional relief sculptures that offer dynamic and tactile portrayals of the ice-covered continent of Antarctica. These artworks are informed by scientific understanding of the interactions of water, atmosphere, geology and, in some places, organisms and wildlife. During seven weeks in November-December 2015, I worked out of three field camps that together represent a variety of topographical features: the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Explorers Cove, and the Ad&eacute;lie penguin habitat at Cape Royds. In between field camp trips, I also made day trips from McMurdo to sites of interest such as the Scott Base pressure ridges, the Erebus Glacier Ice Tongue cave, and Cape Evans, site of the Terra Nova historic hut. I returned with over 5,200 photographs, including numerous series of photos to be processed into 3D scans of landscape features such as icebergs, glaciers, and wind-eroded boulders via photogrammetry software. The resulting 3D files will eventually be carved in high-density urethane foam on a CNC router, cast in a more permanent material, and painted. The finished prints and sculptures are intended to convey how physical forces sculpt the ice at the surface, within and beneath it, through cycles of compression, freezing, and melting. At all three sites, the landscape is also to some extent shaped and colored by organisms living on land, in freshwater inland lakes and in the sea, mainly algae, penguins, skuas and Weddell seals. In addition to what I had anticipated photographing while planning this trip were many marvelous features I had not known about, that I also visited and photographed, for example, the crystalline interior of the Erebus Glacier Ice Tongue cave, the glacier stained red and orange ice at Blood Falls, the wind-eroded ventifacts of the Dry Valleys, the graceful and varied designs in the lake ice at Cape Royds and Lake Hoare, and the sculptural forms of pressure ridges and multi-year sea ice.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To me, part of the pleasure of creating art is conveying the surprise of discovery: beauty in an unexpected place, complexity and layers of experience in aspects of our surroundings that we thought we already knew, or conversely an underlying order in what at first glance seems hopelessly complex. Not easily accessible and only inhabited in the last few decades &mdash; and then chiefly by scientists &mdash; Antarctica also occupies the unusual position of being both environmentally and culturally pristine. In that way it is profoundly disconnected from human history and human experience &mdash; which is probably how most people feel about it. However, Antarctica is also a place where vitally important research is being conducted about the role of polar ice in regulating the world&rsquo;s climate. Biological research offers clues to the origins of early life forms within its icy environment, and environments where life has adapted to extreme conditions are bellwethers of climate change. We now understand the fate of this remote place to be profoundly&nbsp;<em>connected</em>&nbsp;to sustaining human life on our planet. I am already working to make this point to the public by presenting a close-up look at the natural wonders I found there via the photographs and the 3D works, the latter of which add a tactile dimension to the experience. &nbsp;</p> <p>To this end, I have posted a blog with photos and narrative documenting my experiences in Antarctica at blog.helenglazer.com. I have also posted photographs from the project at bit.ly/antarcticaphotos.</p> <p>Within six months of my return from Antarctica, photographs from this project have already been featured on the web sites The Cloud Appreciation Society, the travel and discovery site Atlas Obscura, and The Creators Project, an online art news site, which featured me and my work in an article about the Antarctic Artists and Writers Program. A solo exhibition is planned at Goucher College, Baltimore, Maryland, in fall 2017. Six large-format photographs and a sculpture from this project were exhibited in a group show at the annual Artscape arts festival in Baltimore during July 2016.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Helen&nbsp;Glazer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1444831/1444831_10403262_1469033069606_CanadaGlacierSculpture-7--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1444831/1444831_10403262_1469033069606_CanadaGlacierSculpture-7--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Canada Glacier from Lake Fryxell"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1444831/1444831_10403262_1469033069606_CanadaGlacierSculpture-7--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Canada Glacier from Lake Fryxell"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Acrylic on high density urethane, 15.5 x 60 x 17 inches.
