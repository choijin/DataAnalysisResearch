<AbstractNarration>In March of 2015 the 5th Infinite Possibilities Conference (IPC) will be held at the Oregon State University (OSU) in Corvallis, OR. This conference, which will be jointly sponsored by OSU and the non-profit organization Building Diversity in Science, is the only such national meeting to focus specifically on issues related to educating, encouraging and supporting minority women interested in mathematics and statistics.  African-American, Hispanic/Latina, and Native American women have been historically underrepresented in mathematics.  In 2012, less than 2% of the doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences were awarded to American women from underrepresented minority groups.  Responding to this issue, the conference provides students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels an opportunity to interact with peers and more established women mathematicians in a supportive and collegial atmosphere that is unique for a professional conference.  One of the major goals of IPC is to establish connections between mentors and mentees and to provide role models for junior women mathematicians seeking to enter the field but concerned about the differences they see between themselves and traditional mathematicians. The IPC seeks to make participants aware of the many ways in which mathematicians and statisticians can make valuable contributions to society at large (the importance of mathematics) and to build networks and provide resources for junior women mathematicians to encourage and support their aspirations towards such a career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Infinite Possibilities Conference provides a supportive environment in which minority women mathematicians can learn about the possible career paths available to them in the mathematical sciences and aims to counteract the pervasive sense of isolation that accompanies anyone seeking to enter a predominantly male scientific field such as mathematics.  As in past IPCs, there will be plenary research talks by established mathematicians as well as shorter research presentations and posters presented by more junior mathematicians. These presentations provide a forum for dissemination of new mathematical ideas at all levels and in all areas of mathematics, as well as a way for junior mathematicians to receive feedback on their work and their method of presentation in a supportive environment. Workshops and panel discussions at the conference will support participants' success in navigating their education and careers in the mathematical sciences. Such sessions will include information on acquiring the necessary skills for graduate school; tools for professional development; information on career options in mathematics; and awareness of resources and organizations that are supportive of minority and/or women mathematicians. Prior to the general conference will be a one-day short course on biostatistics, organized in partnership with the Mathematical Biosciences Institute.
