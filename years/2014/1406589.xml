<AbstractNarration>Baja California is one of North America?s last biological frontiers. Over the past six million years, this peninsula rifted apart from mainland Mexico along the San Andreas Fault system. Due to this complex geological history, Baja California is an ideal location to study the evolution of new species. However, the chief difficulty lies in disentangling the complex interactions of geology and ecology, and their effect on speciation. We are taking an integrative approach to this problem by studying a diverse family of lizards that is widely distributed throughout the peninsula. By analyzing genomic data, we will shed new light on the origin of species in this unique region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a high-biodiversity wilderness area, Baja California is a top priority for global conservation efforts. Our research will shed light on patterns of genetic diversity of lizard species in Baja California and southern California. These patterns are an important tool for government land managers interested in documenting and conserving as much biodiversity as possible with limited resources. This research also necessitates meaningful international collaboration involving researchers from San Diego State University, University of California, Riverside, Universidad Nacional Auto&amp;#769;noma de Me&amp;#769;xico, San Diego Natural History Museum, and the U.S. Geological Survey.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this study, we addressed questions related to the evolutionary and biogeographic history of different groups of lizards of the aridlands of the southwestern US and Baja California, Mexico using nuclear DNA sequence data (generated using traditional and next-generation seqeuncing methods). Specifically, we investigated the evolution and species diversity of fringe-toed lizards of the <em>Uma notata</em> complex of North America&rsquo;s southwestern deserts. We validated five species-level lineages within this species complex, three of which were previously described as full species, one originally described as a subspecies but later synonymized, and one previously documented yet undescribed species from Mohawk Dunes, Arizona, USA. The results support the hypothesis that Pleistocene glacial cycles promoted allopatric speciation via dispersal across a complex landscape shaped by older geological events, but we also recovered evidence for a diversifying role of the Colorado River during the Pleistocene. The results of this research are important for conservation purposes because these lizard species are the fundamental unit for protection under the endangered species act. We also studied the comparative phylogeography of several species of widespread lizards of the Baja California Peninsula, including the genera <em>Callisaurus </em>(zebra-tailed lizards), <em>Petrosaurus </em>(rock lizards), <em>Urosaurus </em>(tree and brush lizards), and <em>Sceloporus </em>(spiny lizards). We collected a large amount of genomic data (RADseq) from 228 individual lizards from the peninsula and eight islands. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that plate tectonic events, and possibly mid-peninsular seaways, established a complex landscape with numerous barriers to historical dispersal that ultimately facilitated speciation and diversification, generating the idiosyncratic patterns observed among co-distributed lineages.
