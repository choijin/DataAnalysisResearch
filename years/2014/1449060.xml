<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is far-reaching.    A preliminary market study indicates that 1.5% to 2.5% of the developed world?s population suffers from heart arrhythmias while the WHO reports ~0.5% of the global population.  For Atrial fibrillation, in the USA alone this disease will afflict  ~7.7 million people by 2015, afflicts ~460,000 new patients every year and the patient load is projected to grow to 12.1 million by 2050 (CDC).  Atrial fibrillation and its complications (stroke, congestive heart failure, seizures, death, etc.) add $26B to the nation?s annual healthcare costs and kill nearly 80,000 people/yr. The global load of Atrial fibrillation patients is a staggering 33.5 million with 4 million newly diagnosed every year which equates to ~$100B to treat the disease and its complications worldwide. Fully 25% of these patients have paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation so their % burden needs to be diagnosed in order to guide and monitor therapy. Together with reducing the economic impacts, it would also be enormous benefit to human health to create an easy-to-wear for long-periods device that guides individual therapy, thus substantially improving the quality of life and medical outcomes for arrhythmia patients. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has the following intellectual merits: A detailed model and validation methods will be developed to understand how ultra wideband (UWB) radar signals interact with human tissue; a prototype UWB radar sensor will be developed to validate the modeling effort; an optimization of the UWB radar sensor will be carried out to improve the operational characteristics of the radar motion detection system in order to enable robust heart motion monitoring; This project is expected to enable the development of a radar-based, non-invasive, low-power, long-duration-wearable, heart motion monitor that can sensitively diagnose and detect intermittent arrhythmias including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter as well as numerous other arrhythmogenic heart motions; This will provide an alternative and much desired means to monitor patients for extended periods of time (&gt; 2 weeks and up to 1 year), something not feasible or practical to accomplish with existing electrical or EKG monitoring systems like the Holter or other externally-mounted cardiac event monitors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our NSF Phase I/IB STTR has allowed us to explore the feasibility of using a portable, low- power, broadband, radar-based motion sensor to monitor arrhythmias in ambulatory patients over long periods of time. To meet the challenge of accurately diagnosing episodic or paroxysmal arrhythmias our company is developing Cardiascan&trade;. This radar plus EKG-based technology provides an alternate and much needed means of monitoring ambulatory patients for long durations in order to determine what percentage of time their heart rhythm is compromised. Existing EKG monitoring systems like the Holter or other portable, externally-mounted cardiac event monitors can be susceptible to missing the arrhythmias due to motion induced artifacts and/or other sources of electrical noise. They are also inherently dependent on the inferred correlation between electrical current flowing through the heart (measured by EKG) and heart muscle contracting. However, our technology measures the actual motion of the heart.  We believe this will provide physicians with a more sensitive and specific means to monitor and diagnose heart arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular as well ventricular tachycardias.  Some highlights of our Phase I/IB Technical and Commercialization Accomplishments:  We developed a generation I prototype which combines both radar motion monitoring and EKG. With this device we were able to clearly observe heart motion and show that it?s time-correlated with the gold standard of EKG. We discovered that the best signal comes from placing the radar antenna directly on the skin and just above the thoracic cavity (on the sternum) such that it has an anterior view of the patient?s heart. We were able to study both normal volunteers (female, male) and one person who has been diagnosed with chronic A-fib. The signals we observed are clearly different between the normal and chronic patients. This provided the proof of feasibility of our device concept, the primary goal of our Phase I grant.  We developed some other prototypes that provide lower noise and signals that more readily correlate to the linear proportion and direction of heart motion. We filed a non-provisional patent on our device concept including another embodiment of it that will enable ambulatory, non-invasive cardiac output monitoring. We pursued some further market evaluations/definitions/business canvass development as part of the NSF boot camp experience.  We put together a newer draft commercialization plan and were able to use it to obtain private investor funding match which led to a Phase IB supplement. We have developed a long term funding plan which combines NSF PhaseI/IB/II funding with private investment in order to get our technology into the marketplace within 42-48 months. We have begun to explore a more technically sophisticated application of our device to the monitoring of ambulatory heart failure patients.  The Broader impacts of our work:  Impact on other disciplines: The medical device being developed in this project will make a dramatic change in how cardiac arrhythmias are discovered, treated and monitored.  This will save lives, improve the quality of life for those affected and ultimately the cost of providing healthcare by more accurately diagnosing and treating dangerous arrhythmias and their likelihood to turn into stroke and death.  The impact on the development of human resources: The project will eventually lead to employment of grad students and postdocs in the STTR funded company.  Fundamentally, this project helps engage electrical engineering students/postdocs/professors in the field of medical device research, development and commercialization.   The impact on technology transfer: This STTR project is done in full collaboration with a university partner.  As such, skills, technologies and infrastructure from the university in partnership with a private company are being used to commercialize a new medical device that can improve health quality and save lives of the public.  The impact on society beyond science and technology: The medical device(s) being developed in this project will make a dramatic change in how cardiac arrhythmias are discovered, treated and monitored.  This will save lives, improve the quality of life for those affected and ultimately the cost of providing healthcare by more accurately diagnosing and treating dangerous arrhythmias and their likelihood to turn into stroke or even death.
