<AbstractNarration>This team is developing an optical switch for optical data communication based on holographic patterns loaded onto Micro Opto Electro Mechanical Systems (MOMES). At the nodes of a fiber optic network, and increasingly appearing in massive data centers, optical switches dynamically redirect the output beam of one fiber to the input of another one, establishing a communication link between two points. The current technology for optical switches (3D MOEMS) employs an array of millimeter size mirrors on gimbal supports to steer the light beam from one fiber to another. The principal barriers to the deployment of these optical switches have been their cost, inadequate switching speeds, insufficient number of ports, and reliability. In the switch developed by this team, the light is not reflected but diffracted toward a predefined direction. This principle of diffraction allows the interconnection of any of the input fiber ports to any of the output fiber ports, making the switch truly non-blocking. This also allows for a faster reconfiguration speed, about 100 times faster than the current technology, enhanced robustness and scalability to a large number of ports. Due to the nature of the diffractive technology, the proposed switch has the added benefits of lower power consumption and price per port than commercially available alternatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the introduction of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet PCs the need for new connections has increased dramatically. Applications such as cloud computing, videoconferencing, social media, online gaming, and video-on-demand rely on high bandwidth to provide content from the data center to the end user. Any device that can assist in increasing available bandwidth and lowering costs has a strong chance to be commercially successful. Current switch technology is not sufficiently matching the growth rate due to their speed, power consumption, and scalability limitations. In order to meet the challenge of a faster and more cost effective Internet, the team has demonstrated a new type of optical switch that can perform 100 times faster than the current state of the art technologies. The system they propose will also offer improved reliability and scalability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ he major activity undertaken during the I-Corps program was the exploration of the market for our optical switch. We met with 100 potential customers to determine their pain point and understand the difficulties they are facing in their industry on a daily basis.   The specific objectives of the I-Corps program is to follow a entrepreneurial formation based on the lean launchpad developed by Steve Blank, as well as to meet with 100 potential customers to validate the market hypothesis specific to the discovery/prototype the team is presenting.   The key outcomes of the program was to discover that the telecommunication segment is not very responsive to innovation. A new device should be extensively tested over a long period of time before being adopted by any customer. Reliability over a long period of time need to be garantie in any and every configuration. The architecture of the network is not flexible and the reconfiguration time are still in the order of days and certainly not in real time and on demand. Althoud software define network is a real goal for the industry, it is still very far from being implemented on the terrain and we are years ahead of the game with our optical switch. Consequently, or team redirected its attention (pivot) to the datacommunication market better known as datacenter. We found that this segment is much more dynamic with a very short turnaround time of the technology. Most of the actors from all tiers are really innovative and willing to pay premium to gain fractional advantage over the competitors. Our device (the optical switch) was better adapted to this market and we are still interacting with major companies in the field (Fujitsu/Microsoft) to develop a entire system. Indeed, our device need to be integrated into a component (top of the rack switch) and then into a system (hybrid data center) to be effective.   The entrepreneurial training that the team followed was highly effective and all the team members have gained extensive understanding of major start up concepts and requirements.   Although this was not a requirement for the I-Corps program, our team has participated to conferences and published about the optical switch:    A.

This project has had two main impacts. The first is scientific with the development of an holographic optical switch that is a 1000 times faster than the actual state of the art 3D MEMS switch. the second impact is pedagogical with the entrepreneurship training of both a graduate student (lead) and the faculty PI.
