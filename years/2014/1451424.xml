<AbstractNarration>Even with years of practice, adult learners have trouble perceiving and producing sounds in a second language (L2). Adults tend to need more focused and targeted input to achieve native-like perception and production of L2 sounds than do children. The work proposed here aims to clarify the mechanisms through which L2 perception is influenced by first language (L1) sounds, the neural basis of this perception, how learner differences can influence learning, and how different training paradigms modulate both the neural and behavioral basis of L2 sound perception. This work has the potential to clarify specifically what mechanisms affect L2 sound perception and how different types of feedback and instruction can help learners perceive differences better, allowing for better L2 instruction in the classroom and immersion settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will have participants from two native speaker groups, English and Spanish, participate in a five-day training paradigm during which they will learn to discriminate Hindi sounds that do not belong to their L1 sound categories. During the five days, participants will come in to complete electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from the scalp, baseline discrimination tasks, training, and several memory and attention individual measures. The researchers expect that the L1 will modulate the EEG waveform known as the mismatch negativity (MMN) at approximately 150-200ms after sound onset. This measure indexes early phonetic learning and previous research has shown that the waveform's amplitude can change or shift with new phonetic learning, indicating a reorganization of early acoustic and phonetic processing with new input. Furthermore, the researchers will examine how the L1 and different training and feedback paradigms influence this MMN change. The analyses will highlight previously unexplored differences in L2 behavioral and neural processing that arise from prior L1 knowledge and representations. Furthermore, final analyses will link behavioral and neural measures by correlating performance during behavioral training with neural responses to investigate the time course of adult L2 phonetic acquisition. By using both behavioral and neural methods to explore the effects of L1 influence on nonnative phonetic perception (in the first such training paradigm to examine and clarify the time course of phonetic acquisition), this work will contribute valuable information for models of L2 perception and acquisition, and relevant data for the instruction and teaching of L2 sound contrasts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This work examined how the sounds of a speakers&rsquo; native language can affect perception and learning of second language sounds. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral tasks, we measured how native Spanish and native English speakers learned native Hindi sounds over five days. We examined the mismatch negativity (MMN) response, which has been shown to be sensitive to learning of new second language sounds. Our results showed that both native Spanish and native English listeners were able to learn the sounds, but native Spanish speakers had more sensitive (larger) responses. This may be because Spanish sounds do not have the feature that was being learned, but English does. Therefore, the native Spanish speakers did not have to reconcile pre-existing sound categories with the new sounds they were learning, but native English speakers did. We also varied the type of input and the type of feedback. Feedback type did not show any effect on learning, which suggests that it may not be as necessary during phoneme learning in a new language. However, when we varied the input, native Spanish speakers did not show the same sensitivity to the new sounds as before, suggesting that too much variability may be a hindrance when learning the sounds of a new language. Overall, our work has impacts for educational disciplines such as second language acquisition (SLA) courses and in Teaching of English as a Second Language (TESOL) and English as a Second Language (ESL) courses &ndash; namely, depending on the background of the students, it may not be as important to spend time on the correct sounds of the language because they will learn to perceive it in relation to their native language sounds. Variability has been shown to be useful in other scenarios, and SLA courses could provide more varied input (e.g., more speakers, different genders, accents). Additionally, our results provide evidence that examining perception at the neural level can provide information above and beyond that collected behaviorally, and suggests that adaptation and learning of second language sounds can happen over the course of a few days and impact underlying neural connections. The outcomes of this award include a dissertation thesis, a peer-reviewed journal publication, and two international conference presentations, as well as the mentoring of various research assistants through the research process and their own presentations.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/13/2018<br>      Modified by: Natasha&nbsp;Tokowicz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
