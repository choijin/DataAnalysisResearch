<AbstractNarration>Driven to Discover: Citizen Science Inspires Classroom Investigation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Citizen science refers to partnerships between volunteers and scientists that answer real world questions. The target audiences in this project are middle and high school teachers and their students in a broad range of settings: two urban districts, an inner-ring suburb, and three rural districts. The project utilizes existing citizen science programs as springboards for professional development for teachers during an intensive summer workshop. The project curriculum helps teachers use student participation in citizen science to engage them in the full complement of science practices; from asking questions, to conducting independent research, to sharing findings. Through district professional learning communities (PLCs), teachers work with district and project staff to support and demonstrate project implementation. As students and their teachers engage in project activities, the project team is addressing two key research questions: 1) What is the nature of instructional practices that promote student engagement in the process of science?, and 2) How does this engagement influence student learning, with special attention to the benefits of engaging in research presentations in public, high profile venues? Key contributions of the project are stronger connections between a) ecology-based citizen science programs, STEM curriculum, and students' lives and b) science learning and disciplinary literacy in reading, writing and math.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research design and analysis are focused on understanding how professional development that involves citizen science and independent investigations influences teachers' classroom practices and student learning. The research utilizes existing instruments to investigate teachers' classroom practices, and student engagement and cognitive activity: the Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher Preparation and Classroom Observation Protocol, and Inquiring into Science Instruction Observation Protocol. These instruments are used in classroom observations of a stratified sample of classes whose students represent the diversity of the participating districts. Curriculum resources for each citizen science topic, cross-referenced to disciplinary content and practices of the NGSS, include 1) a bibliography (books, web links, relevant research articles); 2) lesson plans and student science journals addressing relevant science content and background on the project; and 3) short videos that help teachers introduce the projects and anchor a digital library to facilitate dissemination. Impacts beyond both the timeframe of the project and the approximately 160 teachers who will participate are supported by curriculum units that address NGSS life science topics, and wide dissemination of these materials in a variety of venues. The evaluation focuses on outcomes of and satisfaction with the summer workshop, classroom incorporation, PLCs, and student learning. It provides formative and summative findings based on qualitative and quantitative instruments, which, like those used for the research, have well-documented reliability and validity. These include the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument to assess teacher beliefs; the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol to assess teacher practices; the Standards Assessment Inventory to assess PLC quality; and the Scientific Attitude Inventory to assess student attitudes towards science. Project deliverables include 1) curriculum resources that will support engagement in five existing citizen science projects that incorporate standards-based science content; 2) venues for student research presentations that can be duplicated in other settings; and 3) a compilation of teacher-adapted primary scientific research articles that will provide a model for promoting disciplinary literacy. The project engages 40 teachers per year and their students.</AbstractNarration>

These curricula align with four citizen-science programs: eBird (birds), Odonata Central (dragonflies), Project Sunflower (pollinators), and the National Phenology Network (phenology). Additionally, we developed a fifth, universal, curriculum that can be used to guide students through this process with any citizen-science project. To accompany these curricula, we developed a series of videos to introduce the students to the processes of science and the individual citizen-science projects. The curricula and videos are available free for download at extension.umn.edu/citizen-science/driven-discover.</p> <p>Paired with these materials was a year-long professional development experience for middle- and high-school teachers. The teachers participated in a two-week-long summer institute where they spent one week immersed in the citizen-science project -- conducting their own investigation based on that project -- and one week planning on the implementation of citizen science and the curricula in their classroom. Over the school year, the teachers participated in three day-long workshops where they reunited with their cohort, discussed implementation challenges, and shared student achievements.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these day-long workshops, the teachers met after school, four times across the year, in smaller, locally-based groups so that they could plan and discuss implementation in their specific schools and districts.</p> <p>The culmination of the experiences for both the teachers and the students was participation in an annual Ecology Science Fair where the students presented their research and findings to their peers and scientists based at the University of Minnesota.</p> <p>Teachers and students who participated in <em>Driven to Discover</em> came from a variety of school districts representing a wide-range of socioeconomic backgrounds.

These findings begin to close the gap in the research literature regarding how teachers might foster higher sense-making skills.&nbsp;</p> <p>Three of our studies focused on student-driven independent research projects. The first study focused on the ways that the NGSS Science &amp; Engineering Practices (SEP) and Nature of Science (NOS) were embedded within a seventh-grade citizen-science unit focused on monarch butterflies. That unit led to the development of independent science-fair projects where students applied the SEP and NOS to solve problems and understand how authentic science is done.</p> <p>The second study analyzed 114 science fair presentations to understand how middle-school students engaged in SEP and constructed scientific explanations.&nbsp;The&nbsp;findings indicate independent research projects support all students, including those marginalized in science, to use the SEP and construct scientific explanations, particularly when teachers support students in identifying and investigating topics of personal interest.</p> <p class="Normal1">The third study examined the role of participation in science and engineering fairs (SEFs) on youth's STEM educational and career choices. Findings describe how teachers build student self-efficacy, develop a culture of mentorship, remove barriers for student participation, and connect Native American and mixed SES students to opportunities within science fairs.&nbsp;For students, it was a life-changing opportunity to identify their passion for science and increase their scholarship opportunities.

We developed four curricula that lead students through an introduction to citizen science, offer them the background knowledge necessary to complete a specific citizen-science project, build their science skills by contributing to that project, and then have them complete an independent investigation based on a question they develop. These curricula align with four citizen-science programs: eBird (birds), Odonata Central (dragonflies), Project Sunflower (pollinators), and the National Phenology Network (phenology). Additionally, we developed a fifth, universal, curriculum that can be used to guide students through this process with any citizen-science project. To accompany these curricula, we developed a series of videos to introduce the students to the processes of science and the individual citizen-science projects. The curricula and videos are available free for download at extension.umn.edu/citizen-science/driven-discover.  Paired with these materials was a year-long professional development experience for middle- and high-school teachers. The teachers participated in a two-week-long summer institute where they spent one week immersed in the citizen-science project -- conducting their own investigation based on that project -- and one week planning on the implementation of citizen science and the curricula in their classroom. Over the school year, the teachers participated in three day-long workshops where they reunited with their cohort, discussed implementation challenges, and shared student achievements.  In addition to these day-long workshops, the teachers met after school, four times across the year, in smaller, locally-based groups so that they could plan and discuss implementation in their specific schools and districts.  The culmination of the experiences for both the teachers and the students was participation in an annual Ecology Science Fair where the students presented their research and findings to their peers and scientists based at the University of Minnesota.  Teachers and students who participated in Driven to Discover came from a variety of school districts representing a wide-range of socioeconomic backgrounds. These included the urban districts of Saint Paul and Minneapolis; the first-ring suburban district, which is also the largest district in the state, Anoka-Hennepin; and a collection of small, rural districts in SE Minnesota.  The project contributed important findings to secondary-science education research with outcomes related to implementing citizen-science projects in secondary classrooms, how the Science &amp; Engineering Practices and Nature of Science of the Next Generation Science Standards are embedded within students’ independent research projects, and how citizen science inspired youth to pursue STEM education and careers.  In our first research study, we followed two middle-school science teachers as they implemented in their classrooms a citizen-science project based on birds. We found considerable evidence for teaching that was focused on elements of scientific practices including the higher sense-making skills of data analysis, interpretation, and drawing conclusions. These findings begin to close the gap in the research literature regarding how teachers might foster higher sense-making skills.   Three of our studies focused on student-driven independent research projects. The first study focused on the ways that the NGSS Science &amp; Engineering Practices (SEP) and Nature of Science (NOS) were embedded within a seventh-grade citizen-science unit focused on monarch butterflies. That unit led to the development of independent science-fair projects where students applied the SEP and NOS to solve problems and understand how authentic science is done.  The second study analyzed 114 science fair presentations to understand how middle-school students engaged in SEP and constructed scientific explanations. The findings indicate independent research projects support all students, including those marginalized in science, to use the SEP and construct scientific explanations, particularly when teachers support students in identifying and investigating topics of personal interest. The third study examined the role of participation in science and engineering fairs (SEFs) on youth's STEM educational and career choices. Findings describe how teachers build student self-efficacy, develop a culture of mentorship, remove barriers for student participation, and connect Native American and mixed SES students to opportunities within science fairs. For students, it was a life-changing opportunity to identify their passion for science and increase their scholarship opportunities. Students gained self-awareness, professional presentation skills, STEM content knowledge, and an understanding of STEM careers.

Through participation in citizen science, students experienced the relevance of contributing to an authentic science investigation, the rigor of citizen-science protocols, and relationships with teacher mentors. These outcomes inspired them to follow STEM educational choices and careers.       Last Modified: 12/05/2019       Submitted by: Robert B Blair]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
