<AbstractNarration>The project will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental nature of the computational process.  It will further integrate certain areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science, specifically group theory and the theory of highly symmetrical combinatorial structures in mathematics, with the theory of algorithms for graphs and the theory of Boolean functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main targets of the project is the Graph Isomorphism (GI) Problem: to decide whether or not two graphs are the same. This is a fundamental problem in the classification of objects both in mathematics and in science (such as chemistry); it is also an ingredient in so-called "SAT solvers," a generic approach to optimization problems. GI represents one of the great challenges in the theory of computing because of its fundamental nature and of its notorious unresolved complexity status.  The problem is intimately linked to the study of symmetries of graphs, and therefore to structural and algorithmic problems in finite groups.  The PI and his collaborators have recently overcome several decades-old barriers in connection with this problem; building on this momentum, the PI expects further significant progress in this direction, using a combination of group theoretic and combinatorial techniques to be developed. One of the lines of attack to be pursued in this project is a generalization of these methods to so-called "primitive coherent configurations," an intermediate class between strongly regular graphs and the general case.  Another line of attack will study the structure of certain types of permutation groups referred to as "giant action on blocks" that represent the principal barrier to the classical group-theoretic approach to the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue to mentor both graduate and undergraduate students on this research topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merits Since the early 1970s, the study of the class NP of decision problems has been central to the Theory of Computing.  NP-problems are at the heart of many areas of both theoretical and practical significance, including discrete optimization, machine learning, signal processing, cryptography.   Most NP-problems have been classified as either NP-complete and therefore presumed intractable, or polynomial-time solvable,  meeting a theoretical benchmark of efficient computability.   A small number of classical problems have resisted such classification; they are said to have NP-intermediate status.  One of the notorious problems with this status is Graph Isomorphism (GI), the problem to decide whether a pair of given graphs (interconnection diagrams) are actually the same, under appropriate renumbering of the nodes. The focus of the PI's activity under the present grant was to address a 32-year-old barrier to progress on the asymptotic complexity of this fundamental algorithmic problem.  Techniques of group theory (the mathematical theory of symmetry) were brought to bear on GI in 1979-80, initiated by the PI and greatly advanced by Eugene Luks.  As a result, in 1983 the complexity of the problem went down from simply exponential to moderately exponential, specifically, exponential in the square root of the number of nodes.  In spite of much effort, no further reduction was achieved for more than three decades.  The PI set as the central goal of the project to gain a better understanding of the obstacles to progress on this problem.  The project turned out to be successful beyond the PI's wildest hopes.  The obstacles were not only "better understood" but actually broken, and the efficiency of the algorithm for very large graphs dramatically improved, from moderately exponential to quasipolynomial, meaning exponential in a fixed power of the logarithm of the number of nodes.  In the words of distinguished complexity theorist and blogger Scott Aaronson, this result brought the problem into the "suburbs of polynomial time" (down from the "suburbs of exponential time").  Along the way, new links have been established between the theory of algorithms and the mathematical disciplines of group theory and combinatorics. The PI adopted the basic framework built by Luks long ago and attacked the bottleneck of that framework simultaneously from multiple angles. At the heart of the new algorithm designed by the PI is the Local certificates procedure that expresses a surprising local-global interaction, building global symmetry from local information.  This subroutine is based on the PI's new result in group theory, the Unaffected stabilizers theorem.  The local certificates in turn create a combinatorial structure and the goal becomes to effectively break the symmetry of that structure.  This will significantly reduce the size of the problem, permitting efficient recurrence.   The question is, what to do if such symmetry breaking is impossible.  One of the major combinatorial results of the project addresses this situation by discovering, in this case, a hidden Johnson graph, canonically embedded in the structure  (Split-or-Johnson routine).  Johnson graphs are highly resistant to symmetry breaking, but once a hidden copy has been identified, it becomes an effective tool in reducing the problem size, so again, efficient recurrence is possible.  The Split-or-Johnson routine is based on an analysis of highly regular combinatorial structures called coherent configurations.  In summary, the project achieved major progress in the theory of algorithms, reducing the complexity of the Graph Isomorphism problem from moderately exponential to quasipolynomial, breaking a 3-decades-old barrier.  This progress required the conceptualization of the new notion of local certificates (an algorithmic concept), hand in hand with coordinated simultaneous advances in the mathematical disciplines of group theory and combinatorics. Broader impacts The outcome, an unanticipated and definitive result on a major algorithmic problem, was greeted as a breakthrough by the research community and beyond.
