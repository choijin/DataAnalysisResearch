<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are strongly aligned with the statewide plans for development in science and technology for both Louisiana and Mississippi.  Both states have significant research talent in chemistry, materials, and computations which are synergistic with the significant economic impact of the polymer industry of the region.  The development of computer software to monitor and control polymer synthesis has the potential to impact the Gulf region and national polymer industry by advancing the capabilities for materials synthesis.  Software development will be used to offer polymer characterization workshops and catalyze the development of new patents in materials synthesis.  Regional manufacturers will play a role in using the results from computational and materials research and will participate by providing internships for participating graduate students.  Advancing polymer manufacture and control will increase efficiency in the use of energy, non-renewable feedstocks, and plant and labor time, while reducing emissions and increasing safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is aligned with the Materials Genome Initiative?s goals of accelerating advanced materials development, with computational research serving as a key component for discovery and processing guidance.  With its scientific focus on developing and proving the next-generation polymerization monitoring platform, the research promises to overcome barriers in bringing stimuli responsive polymers (SRPs) to market and strengthen regional economic competitiveness.  Research activities are aligned along the materials design and process design paths to develop new experimental and computational tools for accelerating materials development and bridging polymer synthesis to manufacture.  New SRP materials will be designed using polymer synthesis, molecular modeling, and computational control.  Outcomes will include: self-assembled polymers for drug delivery and environmental remediation, self-healing polymer networks, and smart nano-composites using SRP-modified nanoparticles as building blocks.  The results have the potential to transform medical and sustainable materials applications.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Motivated by the significant economic foot print of the chemical and polymer industry in the Gulf Region and the projected growth of stimuli responsive polymer manufacturing, Louisiana and Mississippi assembled a team of researchers, the Smart MATerials Design, Analysis, and Processing consortium (SMATDP), from eight institutions evenly distributed across the states to address challenges in bringing these materials to market. SMATDAP focused on the development of the Smart Material - Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization reactions (SM-ACOMP) instrument platform to monitor the onset of stimuli responsiveness during polymerization and enable the control of properties during synthesis to ensure uniform manufacture of these &ldquo;smart&rdquo; materials.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The SM-ACOMP prototype (Figure 1) is a unique instrument that has the ability to monitor polymer molecular weights, composition, sizes, and viscosities at up to 7 different solvent compositions or 7 different temperatures during the polymerization process, allowing scientists to determine the polymer response over a range of conditions as the polymer is being synthesized. To demonstrate the capabilities of the SM-ACOMP instrument, SMATDAP researchers examined two distinct smart polymer systems. The first system studied was thermally responsive random polymers of AMPS (2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid, a negatively charged monomer) with NIPAM (N-isopropyl acrylamide, a neutral monomer). It was shown these polymers undergo reversible micellization in water with temperature changes, allowing them to either sequester or release oily cargo molecules in response to changes in temperature. The second system examined was PEG (polyethylene glycol) oligomers conjugated with bowl-shaped supramolecular host species that selectively bind oily guest species. These conjugated oligomers reversibly assemble in water to form self-healing linear supramolecular polymers that resist damage due to mechanical strain. Additional candidate polymers synthesized for analysis included responsive dendrimers, polymeric nanoparticles for stimulated drug delivery, and synthetic polymers designed to mimic the behavior of biological macromolecules, like peptides and polysaccharides. These synthetic efforts were supported by computational scientists who served to model polymer responses to guide design.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The results of synthetic and analysis efforts provided results that could be used to design a control interface, allowing the direct control of reaction conditions during polymerization to tailor the final material properties and achieve consistent production of polymers. The control interface was incorporated into the ACOMP platform and used to control the concentration of specified monomers during the copolymerization of styrene sulfonate and NIPAM (Figure 2), and to directly control the molecular weight of polyacrylamide during polymerization (Figure 3). These strategies subsequently allow direct control of the thermal response of a smart polymer and achieve a desired polymer size that ultimately dictates its material properties, both of which are difficult to control during uncontrolled batch processes that are typically used in industrial practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The SM-ACOMP remains as a unique instrument available to researchers across the country interested in studying the onset of polymer responses during their synthesis in unparalleled detail. In addition, the intellectual property developed over the award lifetime has been patented, and discussions are ongoing with companies regarding utilization of the technologies developed. It is anticipated that the work performed here will be of increasing industrial interest as stimuli responsive polymers make up an increasing fraction of polymer manufacturing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Beyond its research mission, SMATDAP sought to train future researchers in the disciplines associated with the design, analysis, and manufacture of next-generation smart materials. To this end, SMATDAP supported the research efforts of 18 professors in Louisiana and Mississippi over the project lifetime. Those faculty in turn trained/supported approximately 6 post-doctoral fellows, 47 PhD students, and 65 undergraduate students. Outside the university, SMATDAP faculty actively sought to engage the public, providing lectures and demonstrations to K-12 audiences on smart materials and polymers. Over the course of the project lifetime, the associated faculty engaged over 3000 members of the public in activities that include: Girls in Science and Technology at Tulane, the SOAR summer program at Xavier, the Mississippi State Fair, Science Cafe&rsquo;s, and a wide range of high school class demonstrations. In addition to engaging K-12 audiences, SMATDAP sponsored twice yearly workshops at Tulane University open to SMATDAP researchers and industrial scientists across the country, educating scientists on modern polymer characterization techniques. The relationships developed putting together outreach events as well as the polymer characterization workshop will continue beyond the project lifetime, leaving a lasting public educational legacy on polymers and smart materials.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In summary, SMATDAP brought together researchers across Louisiana and Mississippi working in the field of stimuli responsive material synthesis, characterization, and control to develop a unique enabling technology, SM-ACOMP, to promote the industrial manufacture of smart materials. Over the project lifetime, new relationships between faculty across the jurisdictions were established. In addition, SMATDAP engaged STEM students, members of industry, and members of the public on multiple levels to educate them on next-generation smart materials.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/08/2018<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hamilton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430364/1430364_10328368_1536452763804_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430364/1430364_10328368_1536452763804_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SM-ACOMP prototype"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430364/1430364_10328368_1536452763804_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SM-ACOMP prototype"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photo of the SM-ACOMP prototype with labels for its components.
