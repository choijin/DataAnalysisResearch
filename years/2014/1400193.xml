<AbstractNarration>Several real social, biological, and technological systems can be described as sets of individual components or nodes coupled by connections to form a "network." These networks are denoted as heterogeneous if they are characterized by nodes and connections with different individual properties. Heterogeneity is typical of many natural networks; for example, neuronal networks are characterized by different types of neurons and connections between them.  Understanding how heterogeneity affects the network functions may enhance our ability to design and interact with complex dynamical systems that can be described as networks as found in various technological applications. These include swarms of vehicles, robots, smart grids among others. A large body of literature has studied how the structure of these networks affects their dynamic behavior. However, the role of heterogeneous nodes and connections has not been fully investigated.  In this project, the PI will investigate synchronization as a dynamic process where the nodes of heterogeneous networks converge on a common time evolution. The dynamic behavior of heterogeneous networks will also be considered in other contexts, including the study of robotic networks composed of ground and aerial vehicles, as well as smart grids and evolutionary game theory for agents interacting over a network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will impact the current knowledge and understanding of complex systems by explicitly taking into account their heterogeneous features, which in turn will provide a more detailed characterization of these systems and a better insight into their potential applications. A low dimensional approach to the characterization of the dynamics of these systems will consist of a reduced number of equations that describe the overall dynamics of the network and its stability. Tools from the theory of nonlinear dynamics will be employed to analyze the conditions for the emergence of fixed points, limit cycles and chaotic dynamics in the networks under consideration. In addition, a simple and intuitive online applet will be developed that will allow users to upload a given heterogeneous network and will output an analysis of its dynamical features in real time. This will provide a valuable tool to other researchers who work with social, technological, physical, and biological networks of the kind investigated herein. The applet will also be used to expose a broader audience to the fascinating dynamical properties of the complex heterogeneous networks examined in this study, to their unique characteristics, and to the exciting implications of the findings discussed herein for a number of scientific and engineering fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award has investigated theoretically, numerically, and experimentally the emergence of several patterns of synchronization in populations of coupled heterogeneous oscillators. We have focused on both the cases of undriven and driven (externally forced) oscillators.  The project has involved, besides the PI, several undergraduate, master, and Ph.D. students.  Funding was used to construct an experimental apparatus with three platforms, each of which supports a population of (heterogeneous) mechanical oscillators with the goal of investigating the effects of a network symmetry on naturally arising chimera states.  This experimental setup has led us to introduce a completely new concept in the study of synchronization of complex systems, i.e., the concept of targeted synchronization, in which the appropriate choice of driving causes some parts of a population to synchronize while not synchronizing other parts of the population that receive the same driving. The targeted control of elements within a population appears to be of broad interest in a variety of disciplines; however, little theoretical and experimental work has been performed in this direction. We have explored this problem experimentally and developed strategies to enforce targeted synchronization, where certain oscillators synchronize and others do not. In particular, we have designed an external driving signal that causes selective patterns of synchronization.  We also investigated theoretically the control of networks of coupled (heterogeneous) systems. Our approach uses a control strategy based on a general cost function, which is defined for dynamical complex networks that is optimal in terms of the magnitudes of the input, the state, and their time derivatives. Here we show that by controlling a limited number of "target nodes" rather than the state of every node, the required energy to control the network can be reduced substantially. In particular, as the number of target nodes decreases, the energy requirements decay exponentially. We showed that the solution of the minimum energy control problem well approximates the energy required for a large family of cost objectives so that the benefits of target control extend beyond the minimum energy control scheme considered in previous work. We validated our conclusions in model and real networks to arrive at an energy scaling law to better design control objectives regardless of system size, energy restrictions, state restrictions, driver node choices and target node choices.  The potential applications for developing target controls are numerous, from local jobs among networked robots to economic policies designed to affect only specific sectors. We see that datasets from the literature in many fields also experience the reduced energy benefits from target control. The networks that describe metabolic interactions and protein structures are those for which the energy reduction is highest.
