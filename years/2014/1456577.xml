<AbstractNarration>Puberty is a significant stage of development marked by transitions in both physiological and neural function.  Though most people appreciate the hormonal changes that occur during this period, the types of experiences that an adolescent encounters also change dramatically.  These experiences can result in increased exposure to stressors in the environment.  A growing body of research indicates that how an individual responds to stress changes substantially during this stage, but we know little about the biological mechanisms that underlie these shifts.  It is important to address these gaps in our understanding, because stress can disrupt body and brain systems that are developing into their adult-like patterns during this time.  Using an experimental animal model that combines studies at the neuroanatomcial and biochemical levels, these experiments will begin to reveal the neural mechanisms that mediate the pubertal changes in stress responsiveness.  The results of these studies will extend our understanding of how puberty and stress interact to affect both the brain and body.  Importantly, these studies will be undertaken at Barnard College, an all women's liberal arts college.  Thus, in addition to leading to advances in our understanding of neurodevelopment, support of this proposal will provide many female undergraduates with educational opportunities to take part in all aspects of experimental research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) plays a pivotal role in integrating information from brain areas that coordinate the stress response.  Greater levels of neural activation have been found in the PVN of prepubertal compared to adult animals in response to stress, leading to the hypothesis that developmental changes in the connectivity and/or function of the PVN contribute to pubertal alterations in stress reactivity.  This project will test this hypothesis by assessing pubertal differences in the connectivity, phenotype, and activation of brain areas that project to the PVN.  Specifically, neural tract tracing combined with immunohistochemical markers of excitatory or inhibitory neurons will be used in prepubertal and adult rats exposed to stress.  This project will also examine pubertal changes in excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the PVN by assessing receptor expression and measuring hormone levels following site-directed delivery of excitatory or inhibitory receptor modulators in the PVN of prepubertal and adult rats exposed to stress.  These studies will probe neural mechanisms responsible for the pubertal transitions in stress reactivity, and provide information on how the adolescent and adult nervous systems differentially process stressful stimuli.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Adolescent development is associated with major gains in physiological and neurobehavioral function.  However, it is also a significant period of developmental vulnerabilities, marked by substantial increases in various disorders, such as obesity, drug abuse, and mood disorders.  Though the mechanisms mediating the increase in these dysfunctions during adolescence are not well understood, exposure to stress during this stage of life may be a particularly relevant environmental factor that contributes to these vulnerabilities. Interestingly, hormonal stress reactivity changes dramatically during adolescence.  Specifically, adolescent individuals exhibit significantly prolonged stress-induced hormonal responses compared to adults.  Moreover, one?s experience with stress further alters these developmental differences, such that while adults repeatedly exposed to the same stressor show substantially reduced hormonal reactivity to that stressor, adolescents fail to show this reduced responsiveness.  Despite these differences, we still know very little about the mechanisms that mediate adolescent-related shifts in stress reactivity or the short- and long-term physiological and psychological consequences of exposure to stress during adolescence.  The experiments in this project began to determine the contribution of developmental changes in areas of the brain that control hormonal stress reactivity.  For instance, we have shown that despite similar amounts of connections between brain areas that mediate hormonal stress responses, the activity of these brain regions is different in adolescent and adult individuals after exposure to stress.  More specifically, those areas that activate the stress response show greater activation following a stressor during adolescence, while those areas that reduce the stress response show greater activation in adulthood. Though far from a clear understanding of exactly how these changes in the brain control the adolescent-related changes in hormonal stress reactivity, these studies contribute to our basic understanding of how brain development and hormonal systems interact and how they might influence the various dysfunction often associated with a stressful adolescence.
