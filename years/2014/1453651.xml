<AbstractNarration>The goal of deep learning is to learn an abstract representation of data with a hierarchical and compositional structure. Deep learning methods can effectively learn discriminative features from high-dimensional input data (e.g., for classification), and have been successfully applied to many real-world problems, such as image classification, speech recognition, and text modeling. Despite these successes, there still remains a challenging open question: how can we learn a robust deep representation that allows for holistic understanding and high-level reasoning from complex data?  This CAREER project aims to address this question and is expected to result in novel deep architectures, graphical models, and algorithmic advances for inference, learning, and optimization in deep representation learning.  The research outcomes will be disseminated through publications, talks, and tutorials. In addition to advancing the state of the art in deep learning and the many applications it entails, the project will integrate research and education through 1) developing courses in machine learning that include deep learning as a key topic; 2) mentoring significant graduate and undergraduate research activities; and 3) reaching out to K-12 students via hosting demo sessions and mentoring for science fair/research projects. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the following closely interrelated and complementary thrusts:  First, it develops deep learning algorithms to disentangle factors of variation from complex data. This is done by modeling higher-order interactions between multiple groups of latent variables with a deep generative model (e.g., modeling face images via interaction of latent factors that correspond to identity, viewpoint, and emotion). In addition to better generalization, this approach is amenable to high-level reasoning, such as making analogies. Modeling higher-order interaction will be approached by learning a sub-manifold for each factor of variation, where correspondence information is used for regularizing the latent representation. The project will also develop weakly-supervised and semi-supervised disentangling algorithms that automatically establish correspondences without manual supervision. Second, the project develops deep representation learning methods for structured prediction problems. Specifically, it will develop a graphical model with deep representations that can model complex dependencies between output variables. This framework can be also viewed as data-driven modeling of higher-order prior on structured data, and can be used for modeling higher-order conditional random fields that permit efficient inference and learning. In addition, the project develops stochastic conditional generative models for structured prediction problems that involve uncertainty (i.e., one-to-many mappings).  Third, the project develops novel deep learning algorithms for constructing shared representations from multiple heterogeneous input modalities, such as image and text, audio and video, and multiple sensor streams. The main idea is to separately model conditional distribution of each input modality given other modalities. This approach addresses the well-known difficulty of modeling a joint distribution across heterogeneous multimodal input, and provides a theoretical analysis on conditions under which the approach can recover a consistent generative model. This formulation allows for robust recognition and high-level reasoning from heterogeneous multimodal data. Overall, these three thrusts are complementary and are expected to play synergistic roles in tackling a broader range of AI problems and moving beyond the current state-of-the-art in deep learning.</AbstractNarration>
