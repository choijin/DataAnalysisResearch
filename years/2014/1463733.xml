<AbstractNarration>The interplay between number theory and algebraic geometry has been a source of inspiration in modern mathematics. Having led to the solution of a number of outstanding conjectures, such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Mordell Conjecture, it continues to give rise to deep and important problems in algebra. Local-global principles are a central theme in this interplay of subjects, and many important outstanding problems can be expressed in terms of such principles. This project has the objective of understanding local-global principles and their obstructions, in contexts that are broader than those considered in number theory. The project will also support and enhance the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers through seminars, conferences and workshops, and mentoring activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Focused Research Group will focus on local-global principles for algebraic structures defined over function fields of curves over base fields such as p-adic fields, with a longer term goal of treating the case of function fields of curves over global fields. The obstructions to such local-global principles can often be formulated in terms of cohomology. Our project aims to study the finiteness of these obstructions and determine criteria for them to vanish. The resulting understanding will be applied to proving conjectures and solving open problems concerning algebraic structures such as quadratic forms and associative algebras. This will include situations that have been studied by many researchers but where solutions had previously seemed out of reach. Research methods will include field patching, cohomological methods including residues and duality, and approaches from geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research funded in this grant is at the intersection of number theory and algebraic geometry, and focused on local-global principles. These principles concern the question of whether the validity of algebraic statements can be ascertained by checking whether they hold locally.  Classically, such statements can be phrased in terms of the existence of solutions to algebraic equations whose variables have specified types of values.  Such principles have played a central role in number theory.    In this grant, rather than considering equations whose coefficients are rational numbers or that lie in some global field, we considered a higher dimensional analog in which the coefficients lie in systems that are called semi-global fields.  This situation is richer than the classical one both in terms of number theory and algebraic geometry.  Using a variety of methods, we obtained conditions for local-global principles to hold for systems of equations whose solution spaces are objects known as torsors under tori.  We also obtained generalized local-global principles in which we considered not just points, but also combinations of points known as zero-cycles.  In addition, we established the relationships between several types of local-global principles over semi-global fields.  Beyond the research results obtained, this grant helped to train Ph.D. students and postdocs, through conferences, workshops, and seminars; this included professional development activities.  It also funded research interactions with other mathematicians who have been working in this general area.  In addition, the investigators gave talks at other universities and at conferences to communicate the results of the grant, and they wrote and disseminated research papers describing these results in detail.
