<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Networking Technology and Systems Program in the Division of Computer and Network Systems in the Directorate for Computer Information Science and Engineering; the Mathematical Physics Program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two grand challenges in two disjoint fields of science are network dynamics prediction and quantum gravity theory. The lack of understanding of fundamental laws driving the dynamics of many complex networks, and consequently our inability to predict and control their behavior, are among the reasons why many practical problems of great significance remain unsolved for decades. The lack of a complete theory of quantum gravity, unifying all the fundamental interactions, is perhaps the most fundamental problem in physics after Einstein.  Motivated by the recent results suggesting that the two problems might in fact be intimately related via a geometric duality between hyperbolic and de Sitter spaces---the former reflecting the latent geometry of complex networks, the latter representing the asymptotic geometry of spacetime in the universe---this project addresses both grand challenges and advances science in both fields by deriving fundamental laws of network dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main hypothesis that the project investigates is that one can extend and apply the canonical approach in physics used to study all the fundamental interactions in nature to a wide class of physical systems---complex networks. One part of the project focuses on finding Hamiltonians defining Hamilton's equations of network dynamics, and validating the derived equations against the dynamics of real networks.  These equations are expected to be simpler than the corresponding equations in gravitational theories.  Other parts of the project focus on building tools to predict this dynamics based on the derived equations, and investigating connections between this dynamics, its conformal invariance in the de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence (dS/CFT) context, and network navigability that may lead to a different interpretation of the dark energy problem in cosmology.  This interdisciplinary project combines concepts and methods from mathematical physics and network research by extending the canonical approach in physics to complex networks to advance our understanding of their dynamics, and to explore whether applying theoretical concepts in network science will advance our understanding of dark energy.  This project thus opens exciting new research directions by hypothesizing a fundamental connection between Hamiltonian dynamics and network dynamics that until now have been considered completely unrelated.  The transformative project thus challenges the conventional wisdom that neither the canonical approach in physics can be useful in studying complex networks, nor network science has anything to offer theoretical physics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  Many problems of broader impacts in science and society are blocked on network dynamics prediction.  Examples include disease treatment, drug design, and a variety of link-prediction problems, which are sub-problems of network dynamics prediction. In general, connections between systems as different as the brain, the Internet, and the universe, appeal to general public, foster creative thinking, and attract wider and more diverse circles of students to science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project discovered a multitude of deep connections between geometry and physics of the structure and dynamics of real networks and stochastic network models in network science, quantum gravity, string theory, and cosmology. Specifically, the main outcomes of the project include:  The discovery that the dynamics of preferential attachment, which is one of the most popular models of the emergence of broad (scale-free) degree distributions in growing real networks, admits a formulation as Hamiltonian dynamics, which is a very general theoretical framework used to study dynamical systems in physics. The demonstration that networks grown according to a soft version of preferential attachment are statistically equivalent to random graphs in the soft configuration model -- maximum-entropy random graphs with power-law distributions of expected degrees of nodes. The identification of the unique model -- the hypersoft configuration model -- of random networks that are sparse, have power-law degree distributions, and satisfy a fundamental set of basic statistical requirements: unbiasedness, exchangeability, and projectivity. The proof that maximum-entropy random graphs with strong clustering, i.e., large numbers of triangular subgraphs, are statistically equivalent to random geometric graphs, thus establishing that strong clustering it not only a necessary but also the sufficient condition for the presence of latent geometry in networks. The design and development of tools to identify the latent-geometric positions of nodes in real networks, based on the dynamics of their growth. The discovery that communities in networks emerge as aggregations of nodes in latent spaces, conceptually similar to formations of galaxies in the Universe. The development of the first systematic (inclusive and convergent) series, the dk-series, for comprehensive analysis of the amount of randomness in real networks, and the demonstration that non-randomness in a variety of real networks lies only in their degree distributions, degree correlations, and clustering. The design of a collection of tools based on game theory to identify network navigability skeletons, which are minimalistic ideal networks required for optimal information routing in a network, and the demonstration that a variety of real networks, whose main function is to route information or other media, do contain such skeletons, composed of sets of critical links whose severance can quickly paralyze the network. The demonstration that the spatiostructural organization of the human brain is nearly as needed for optimal information routing between different parts of the brain. The discovery that random geometric graphs in Lorentzian spacetimes, known as causal sets in quantum gravity, can efficiently route information only if spacetime contains dark energy, i.e., if it is (asymptotically) de Sitter spacetime, similar to the spacetime of our accelerating Universe. The design and development of geohyperbolic routing, the optimal (as efficient and scalable as theoretical possible) set of routing, addressing, and network design schemes for information routing in telecommunication networks, not requiring any non-local information at any point of scheme operations. The development of new methods to study the vacuum selection problem in cosmology in the context of eternal inflation, linking this problem tightly, using tools from network science, to the properties of the string geometry landscape in string theory.   The projected resulted in a host of software packages and datasets released to general public, and in more than twenty publications in high-impact journals in physics (Physical Review Letters, Physical Review E, Physical Review D, New Journal of Physics, Journal of Statistical Physics, Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical, Computer Physics Communications), computer science (Transactions in Networking, Computer Communication Review), as well as in interdisciplinary journals (Nature Communications, Nature Scientific Reports). Many of these publications were enthusiastically covered by the press worldwide (U.S. News &amp; World Report, International Business Times, R &amp; D Magazine).

The project also led to follow-on projects, ranging from mathematical investigation of connections between the discrete structure of random geometric graphs and the continuous structure of Riemannian and Lorentzian manifolds, to predicting the dynamics of real networks using their latent geometries, to the investigation of practical aspects of designing and deploying latent-geometric routing in future Internet architectures such as Content-Centric Networking in general and Named Data Networking in particular.
