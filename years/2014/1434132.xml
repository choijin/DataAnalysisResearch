<AbstractNarration>This dissertation uses experimental methods to investigate how social class shapes the experience of motherhood. The dissertation assesses whether - and if so, why - employers discriminate against low- and high-skilled mothers in the labor market. The investigators perform a large-scale field experiment, an audit study, by studying low- and high-skilled job openings. The dissertation then investigates why employers might discriminate against mothers, experimentally manipulating motherhood status and indicators of applicant quality. Obtaining an understanding of discrimination in low- and high-skilled jobs advances our understanding of when and how motherhood disadvantages women. Findings can aid understanding of and suggest directions of inquiry to address discrimination at this stage of the employment process. Additionally, the study evaluates whether low-skilled mothers face significant barriers in finding jobs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, the dissertation examines how ideas about good parenting differ by social class, and whether parents hold mothers to higher parenting standards than fathers. A survey experiment is performed in which respondents evaluate descriptions of parent-child interactions, with the gender of the parent presented being experimentally manipulated. By examining how parents evaluate different childrearing approaches, this research can strengthen stakeholders' efforts to promote family involvement in children's education, and help to design more effective parenting interventions. The dissertation aims to illuminate the role of social class in producing distinct disadvantages for mothers with different resources.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Standard">Parenthood plays an important role in exacerbating gender inequalities within couples and reproducing inequalities across generations. Three important empirical patterns related to parenthood and inequality motivated this dissertation: (1) differences in the parenting behaviors of more- and less-educated parents, (2) differences in the parenting behaviors of mothers and fathers, (3) differences in the motherhood wage penalty experienced by low- and high-skilled women. While each of these patterns is well documented, understanding how and why they occur has been difficult with existing data.</p> <p class="Standard">The dissertation draws on data from two original, large-scale experiments. First, I conducted a vignette survey experiment about parenting attitudes with a nationally representative sample of more than 3,600 parents and an oversample of poor parents. The use of a nationally representative sample is important for generalizing to the population. I presented respondents with short vignettes describing parenting behaviors, experimentally manipulating the parenting style, situation, and gender of the parent and child described in each vignette. I then asked respondents to evaluate the parenting behavior.</p> <p class="Standard">In the first chapter, I ask whether more- and less-educated parents have different views about &ldquo;good&rdquo; parenting. Using methods designed to increase response validity, I show that more- and less-educated parents have remarkably similar views about what good parenting means across a wide range of situations. Differences in cultural beliefs about good parenting are therefore unlikely to be a primary cause of differences in parenting behavior by more- and less-educated parents. The findings instead are consistent with the idea that resource constraints limit less-educated parents&rsquo; ability to do more-intensive parenting behaviors. These findings have important implications for policy. Billions of dollars are spent annually on programs that have components designed to support effective parenting. Given the very high costs of existing programs and their generally modest impacts, it is important that future parenting interventions are based on empirically-tested assumptions. Interventions that assume that low-income parents have different cultural beliefs about good parenting will risk being ineffective if this assumption influences program design.</p> <p class="Standard">Next, using data from the same survey experiment, the second chapter aims to understand why mothers continue to be significantly more involved than fathers as parents. I ask whether parents have different expectations for mothers&rsquo; and fathers&rsquo; parenting. Using an experimental design that establishes causality, the study demonstrates that parents have very similar attitudes about good mothering and fathering. Parents expect both mothers and fathers to be highly involved and to use intensive parenting methods. Furthermore, men and women have similar views about what it means to be a good mother and father.

I experimentally manipulated whether applicants signaled motherhood status, and compared callback rates for mothers and non-mothers in each of the occupations. In this study, I ask whether employers discriminate similarly against mothers in different low- and high-skilled occupations. Results provide causal evidence using an experimental design that, on average, mothers receive callbacks approximately 20 percent less often than women without children, but that there are important differences across occupations in these effects. The strongest evidence of discrimination is present in marketing manager jobs, which are the most time intensive and the least flexible of the occupations in the study.
