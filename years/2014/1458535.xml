<AbstractNarration>Gavin R. Davies of the University of Kentucky together with associates from the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala will investigate how rural communities in the southwestern Maya highlands in Guatemala negotiated the multiple challenges of the Classic to Postclassic Transition (c. 800-1200 AD). Inspired by recent research on the environment and globalization, this research is grounded in notions of community resilience and quality of life, concepts that have significant potential for the comparison of past and present social dynamics and for facilitating cross-disciplinary research. Long an important focus of studies in the Maya Lowlands, this period remains shrouded in mystery in the neighboring highlands, critically undermining understanding of the origins and development of the major social and political entities. Preliminary data from the southwestern highlands, however, indicates that collapse in the lowlands and crisis in the adjacent Pacific Coast may have galvanized political elites in this area to strive for greater integration, urbanism and complexity. However, a lack of rural settlement data means that it is currently impossible to determine how rural households and communities responded to, or were affected by, this transformation. Addressing this lacuna, the current investigations will generate baseline settlement and chronological data for all habitable portions of the western shore of Lake Atitlan region. Representing the first collaboration between the University of Kentucky and the Universidad Del Valle de Guatemala, this project is expected to pave the way for future collaborations between these two institutions and to generate future training and research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students in anthropology and related disciplines. It will also provide data for Mr. Davies doctoral dissertation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining intensive reconnaissance survey, with the test excavation of domestic and non-domestic locales, the investigators will identify patterned responses to broad-level changes and delineate changes in community wealth, identity and resilience. Recognizing that all adaptations entail a cost or trade-off, the primary hypothesis of this research is that the communities that were most prosperous in the aftermath of the crisis were those that traded community autonomy and identity for security by submitting to the rising power of a centralized authority.</AbstractNarration>

Ultimately, 60 private properties were surveyed and those that shared the same landform were then grouped under a single site name. The sites have since been classified based on the presence or absence of monumental architecture (i.e. mounds or other structures) and the presence or absence of evidence for permanent habitation (e.g. dense surface ceramics, stone tools, house walls or albarradas (stone fences). The frequencies for each class of site are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>4 ritual / administrative centers with monumental architecture and permanent habiation areas</li> <li>15 permanent habitations without monumental architecture</li> <li>13 artifact scatters, some of which are associated with sacred sites or monuments but lack evidence of permanent habitation.</li> </ul> <ul> </ul> <p>The documented sites spanned the entire pre-Hispanic sequence, but the ceramic evidence indicated that the most intensive occupations occurred between the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods (c.300 BC to 600 AD), and between the Late Postclassic and the Spanish Conquest (c.1200 and 1524 AD). Ceramics dating to the&nbsp;intervening Late Classic and Early Postclassic periods were scarce, suggesting that during this time (c.600-1200 AD) there was either a significant population decline or a nucleation of the population around the now obscured centers of San Pedro and San Juan.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Excavations</strong></p> <p>Following the survey portion of the project, excavations were conducted at 3 sites: the Preclassic-to-Early Classic site of&nbsp;<strong>Xe Kuku Juyu</strong>&nbsp;(ancient San Juan), and at the two Postclassic sites of&nbsp;<strong>Chi Tzunun Choy</strong>&nbsp;(ancient San Pedro), and&nbsp;<strong>Pan&rsquo;alujaay.&nbsp;</strong>These excavations helped to clarify important details of the ceramic sequences and successfully identified the remains of house floors and associated features. &nbsp;Unfortunately, no intact Late Classic occupations were identified and while excavations at Chi Tzunun Choy and Pan&rsquo;aluhaay indicated that both of these sites had been occupied during the Classic period, most traces of these earlier occupations had been obliterated by the more intensive Postclassic activities.</p> <p>The excavations in San Juan indicated that this site was probably abandoned just prior to the beginning of the Late Classic (c.500 &ndash; 600 AD), a finding which correlates well with local oral history which records that the original population of San Juan was decimated by a pestilence and that the survivors then relocated to the area known as Xe Kaka Abaj (Zone 5). Our limited investigations in this latter area identified evidence of a small settlement associated with an impressive carved stone head that shares stylistic elements with some of the Cotzumalhuapa sculptures from the Pacific piedmont. The surface ceramics and the sculpture here thus indicate that a small group, quite possibly the remnants of the earlier center (Xe Kuku Juyu), occupied this more hidden and defensive location during the Late Classic.

The principal goal of this project was to investigate how communities in this regi&oacute;n negotiated the various challenges that occurred during the Classic to Postclassic transition (c. 800 - 1200 AD).  Archaeological evidence recovered during early investigations in the Lake Atitlan Basin, indicated that it was during this interval that the site of Chuk?muk, one of the largest sites on the lake during the Classic period (c.300-800 AD), was abandoned, and the fortified capital of the Tziquinahay (named Chiya) was established on the opposite shore. It was thus hypothesized that, in addition to having to adapt to a drought and possibly waves of immigrants fleeing the hotter, dryer climate of the Pacific Coast, households and communities in the lake would have been forced to adjust to a local increase in political centralization.  Survey and Excavations  For the purposes of the survey, the project area was divided into five zones, whose limits were defined by natural boundaries such as prominent ridges, streams, or abrupt elevation changes. These zones were as follows:  Chi Tzunun Choy - the area around modern San Pedro Ruta Finca - the area between San Pedro and Finca Tzantziapa Chikaqajaay - the higher elevation areas between San Pedro and its border with Santiago Xe Kuku Juyu - the area around modern San Juan as far as the Rio Seco Xe Kaka Abaj - the northwest portion of the San Juan municipio, between the Rio Seco and the edge of the Atitlan caldera.   Attempts were made to survey a representative sample of the sites from each of these zones. Ultimately, 60 private properties were surveyed and those that shared the same landform were then grouped under a single site name. The sites have since been classified based on the presence or absence of monumental architecture (i.e. mounds or other structures) and the presence or absence of evidence for permanent habitation (e.g. dense surface ceramics, stone tools, house walls or albarradas (stone fences). The frequencies for each class of site are as follows:  4 ritual / administrative centers with monumental architecture and permanent habiation areas 15 permanent habitations without monumental architecture 13 artifact scatters, some of which are associated with sacred sites or monuments but lack evidence of permanent habitation.     The documented sites spanned the entire pre-Hispanic sequence, but the ceramic evidence indicated that the most intensive occupations occurred between the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods (c.300 BC to 600 AD), and between the Late Postclassic and the Spanish Conquest (c.1200 and 1524 AD). Ceramics dating to the intervening Late Classic and Early Postclassic periods were scarce, suggesting that during this time (c.600-1200 AD) there was either a significant population decline or a nucleation of the population around the now obscured centers of San Pedro and San Juan.   Excavations  Following the survey portion of the project, excavations were conducted at 3 sites: the Preclassic-to-Early Classic site of Xe Kuku Juyu (ancient San Juan), and at the two Postclassic sites of Chi Tzunun Choy (ancient San Pedro), and Pan?alujaay. These excavations helped to clarify important details of the ceramic sequences and successfully identified the remains of house floors and associated features.  Unfortunately, no intact Late Classic occupations were identified and while excavations at Chi Tzunun Choy and Pan?aluhaay indicated that both of these sites had been occupied during the Classic period, most traces of these earlier occupations had been obliterated by the more intensive Postclassic activities.  The excavations in San Juan indicated that this site was probably abandoned just prior to the beginning of the Late Classic (c.500 &ndash; 600 AD), a finding which correlates well with local oral history which records that the original population of San Juan was decimated by a pestilence and that the survivors then relocated to the area known as Xe Kaka Abaj (Zone 5).

What?s more, two mentions of this site in the Annals of the Kaqchikels indicate that it continued to be occupied into the Postclassic period.  Finally, the ceramics recovered from Chi Tzunun Choy and Pan?alujaay include a number of types imported from the Quiche region and may confirm the K?iche conquest of this area in the 14th century.
