<AbstractNarration>This proposal extends the highly successful Injury Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with the long-term objective of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally engaged science and engineering workforce with a focus on pediatric injury prevention. The REU Site will conduct fundamental research on the causes and consequences of injury in youth and translational research to apply this scientific foundation into evidence-based prevention products, programs, policy, and interventions. Noting a dearth of funding for research training in injury prevention as a major barrier to the development of the field of injury prevention research, the National Academies called for increased injury prevention research training opportunities. This site will train a cadre of talented interns to help to ensure the growth, innovation, and continuity of the field to reduce injuries and death in youth. The comprehensive training will prepare diverse, internationally-competitive, and globally-engaged leaders in science and engineering. Their research findings will inform interventions to reduce injuries and deaths in youth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program will offer a 10-week intensive summer research experience for a total of 33 interns over a three year period (8 interns per year funded by the NSF plus 3 interns funded by CHOP and Drexel) which includes: 1) individual research projects with a faculty mentor, 2) ethics training, 3) intern meetings, 4) seminars, 5) field trips, 6) student presentations, and 7) career guidance, networking opportunities, and mentorship.  Recruitment will focus on interns from schools with limited STEM opportunities. Disciplines that will be targeted include engineering, behavioral science, population science, and statistics. Training will draw upon the multi-disciplinary expertise of a NSF I/UCRC and an internationally recognized research organization, the Center for Injury Research and Prevention. The site includes faculty and resources from the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. REU interns will gain rigorous research experience, learning the value of interdisciplinary work and applying research results to real world prevention.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Injuries and violence remain the leading causes of death and acquired disability for children, youth, and young adults in the US and worldwide.  Addressing this global health challenge requires providing the next generation of scientists and engineers with the scientific foundation, technical skills, research training, and entrepreneurial skills necessary to conduct impactful research and fuel innovation in field of injury science.  However, as noted by the National Academies, a dearth of funding for research training in injury prevention remains a major barrier to the development of this field.  Therefore, the Injury Science Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site aims to overcome with barrier by assisting the nation in developing diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged leaders of a science and engineering workforce with a focus on pediatric injury prevention.  For over two decades, the world-renowned Center for Injury Research and Prevention (CIRP), a Center of Emphasis at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Research Institute, has provided a unique research and training site for the next generation of scientists and engineers who, through rigorous scholarship, address the leading risk of injuries to children, youth and young adults: concussion, traffic crashes, and violence.  Since 2011, CIRP has been honored to include as part of its training program the National Science Foundation Injury Science REU Site.  CIRP recently completed its Injury Science REU Site renewal period from September 2015 through August 2018.  During this renewal period, the Injury Science REU Site provided research training in the form of three 10-week summer internships for 32 undergraduates, 25 of which were funded through this NSF REU award; an additional 8 undergraduates were funded by supplemental grants and programs from CIRP-affiliated organizations.  REU interns received one-on-one research mentorship from internationally-accomplished research faculty at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, and Drexel University.  To foster scholarly independence, REU interns along with their faculty mentors identified an independent research question to pursue during their tenure.  Research topics included comparison of the crashworthiness of various booster seat designs using computational modeling, community-based participatory research to address cyberbullying, developing objective tools to diagnose concussion, evaluating driving behavior among teens with developmental disabilities, and understanding visual scanning patterns of pedestrians and cyclists in urban traffic environments.  Interns also received mentorship from CIRP graduate students, including scientific advice on analytical methods and guidance on applying to graduate school.   Interns also participated in the Injury Science REU Site Research Curriculum.  This curriculum consisted of seminars, workshops, laboratory tours, and networking social events designed to expose the REU interns to various research topics and state-of-the-art research facilities as well as gain professional development and networking opportunities.  Notably, from 2015 to 2018, the Injury Science REU Site nearly doubled the number of seminars and workshops in its curriculum.  The Injury Science REU program culminated with CIRP's Annual Student Research Day, at which students presented their work to the larger CHOP Research Institute.    The Injury Science REU Site evaluation methods included intern surveys, focus groups, anonymous feedback forms, and essays describing achievements. These methods showed a substantial programmatic success with evidence of progress toward long and short-term measurable goals with REU graduates meeting or exceeding all of the established goals.  Specifically, survey metrics indicated increases in research skills gained during the internship as well as increased interest in pursuing graduate education and research and/or pediatric injury science careers. Student performance was also evaluated by external faculty evaluators that attended CIRP's Annual Student Research Day.  The Injury Science REU Site was also very successful at providing internships to those from underrepresented in STEM (women, minorities, persons with disabilities): 70% of interns were from institutions with limited STEM research opportunities and 88% of interns were from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  These results are supported by the accomplishments of Injury Science REU Alumni.  Twenty-two (67%) of REU interns remained working on their research project after completion of the internships, culminating in 5 peer-reviewed manuscripts and 17 conference presentations involving Injury Science REU interns to date.  Alumni of the Injury Science REU Site have also gone on to pursue graduate degrees and research careers.  Of our 25 REU interns who have since graduated from their undergraduate institutions, 33% are in or have completed Master's programs, 21% are or have completed in PhD programs; and 55% are in or have completed additional research positions.  Six alumni have returned to CHOP or one of its affiliated universities to pursue a graduate degree or research career.
