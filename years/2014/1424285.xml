<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for committee deliberations and consultations with the geochronology producer and consumer communities during the Goldschmidt Conference and Geological Society of America Meeting in 2014. The goal is to document the intellectual and technical goals of geochronology stakeholders and translate those aspirations into suggestions that NSF's Division of Earth Sciences can consider in prioritizing funding initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed meetings will allow community input into defining the areas of potential priority support for geochronology, identify gaps in the requirements of geochronologic consumers, and forecast the training and education needs of the next generation of scientists.  Information gathered during these consultations will be compiled by the steering committee and consolidated in a report, including findings and recommendations, with an expected publication date of December, 2014.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Time lies at the heart of Earth sciences.  Every significant advance in geochronology &ndash; the science of dating the geologic record &ndash; has produced a paradigm-shifting breakthrough, from discovery of the age of the Earth to the calibration of plate tectonic motions.  More recently, new approaches to geochronology have permitted dating climate proxies that record both the substantial oscillations in planetary conditions and the consequences of that these variations have on life.  However, as geochronology expanded into fields related to surficial or paleoclimate processes, it may have failed to become firmly rooted within those disciplinary cultures. As a result, while demand for high accuracy dating has grown dramatically across the Earth sciences, support of its underlying infrastructure has not kept pace and we find ourselves at a crossroads.  This grant supported a series of consultations with the national geochronologic community to explore this groups ambitions and identify the barriers to realizing our collective goals.  We undertook a day-long workshop at the 2014 Goldschmidt meeting in Sacramento, CA to probe the role of geochronology in transformative geologic research, assess the support for single-investigator versus centralized facilities, understand how synergies are developed between geochronologist and other disciplines, how geochronologic innovation can be supported in the present funding climate, and the need for improved decay constants.  We then hosted a discussion at the14th International Conference on Thermochronology in Chamonix, France, and a Town Hall discussion at the 2014 GSA Annual Meeting in Vancouver, B.C., the latter specifically to assess the needs of the consumers of geochronology.  From these deliberations, our steering committee concluded that, for our community to truly prosper, we need to make the case across the geosciences that stewardship of geochronology is the responsibility of all disciplines that utilize its products, including the need to support innovative, high risk research and development. Several promising technological breakthroughs were evaluated that could potentially lead to transformative scientific discoveries.  Our development of this case and conclusions were published in March 2015 in a report, ItÆs About Time: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Geochronology.
