<AbstractNarration>Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse marine ecosystems on the planet, and provide substantial economic and ecological benefits to coastal communities. Corals are composed of both the Cnidarian animal host and complex communities of unique and underexplored microbial organisms. Today these natural wonders are in global decline, threatened by the intersecting effects of multiple stressors including overfishing, pollution, and climate change. These stressors can alter coral microbial communities in ways that may contribute to the susceptibility of corals to disease or overgrowth by algae. Therefore, understanding the relationships between corals and their microbiota may be useful for efforts to understand coral disease and preserve reef ecosystems. The microbial diversity of coral species in many diverse and ancient groups of corals remains unexplored, but understanding these communities will help to extend the knowledge gained in well-studied corals to diverse reefs worldwide. This project aims to describe microbial diversity across all major groups of reef-building corals in each of several distinct ecosystems across the globe, to determine the genome sequences and metabolic capabilities of key coral bacteria, and to test whether the composition of coral microbial communities helps to explain the overall vulnerability or resistance of different coral species to stress or disease. The project includes plans for maximizing public access, scientific community building, and training opportunities for early-career scientists. The project will fund two hispanic principal investigators, two PhD students, and two postdoctoral researchers in laboratory and field research - and also in key computational techniques for managing "Big Data". Project funds will support an extension of a program of collaborative, multilingual scientific podcasts; establishment of recurring science cafes; K-5 coral reef educational modules tested successfully for incorporation into the curriculum in the State College School District; and educational video segments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coral species differ in their susceptibility to bleaching and disease, but these differences are only partially explained by coral phylogeny. Therefore this project will test the extent to which incorporating the microbiota (or their contributed genes) better predicts these and other traits. Recent technological advances have broadened understanding of how complex microbiomes shape the life history, physiology, and evolution of their multicellular hosts (e.g., the human microbiome). The use of newly developed DNA sequencing techniques will allow a more complete exploration of microbial diversity in corals than has previously been feasible, while advanced computational methods will help to maximize the value of sequenced bacterial genomes. Improved predictive models that incorporate both coral phylogeny and microbial function will help inform conservation strategies and yield predictive biomarkers for coral vulnerability to disease or bleaching. Relating the diversity of corals to the diversity of their microbes will also provide important insights into how intimate symbiotic associations with microorganisms arose and are maintained in diverse animals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity project characterized the microbiome of over 12,000 stony coral specimen from around the world?s tropical seas in an effort to understand: a) what factors or interactions of factors mediate the intimate associations between corals and their microbes, b) how changing environmental conditions alter these associations between corals and their microbes, and c) how shifts in coral microbiomes can consequentially affect coral reef health now and in the future. This ?Global Coral Microbiome Project? was one of the largest and longest efforts to understand how bacteria, fungi, and other microbes influence coral health, evolution, and resistance and resilience to environmental change. During this project we identified numerous coral microbes some of which are beneficial and some of which are parasites or pathogens. These data are now allowing researchers and managers to determine how each of these coral symbionts alter coral health mechanistically. Further these microbial data provide important information for the conservation of endangered coral species in the US because some corals maybe hosting non-beneficial bacteria that limit their success during restoration efforts. Along with important patterns of microbial diversity in corals, during this project we identified a novel pattern of microbiome disturbance. We showed that, in general, animal microbiomes experiencing stress tend to show stochastic patterns of change rather than deterministic ones. Expanding upon this important and previously unrecognized paradigm in animal microbiomes, we developed statistical approaches to identify this and other patterns within microbiomes. These are techniques and methods now used in multiple fields of microbiome science, and our collective work has spurred dozens of studies concerning, for example, the impact of disturbance on agricultural soils and human diseases. Overall this project has involved numerous as training and outreach programs and efforts to broaden the impact of the basic scientific work. This project included the training of 5 postdoctoral researchers, 5 PhD students, 1 master?s student, and 12 undergraduates. We generated several outreach materials including: a cartoon series called ?Coral County? on coral reef microbiology and ecology, a series of short documentaries about each of our major field expeditions, and current and future scientific displays at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry and Newport Oregon Aquarium. Lastly, we produced and released a full-length documentary on coral reef decline and microbiology called ?Saving Atlantis.?
