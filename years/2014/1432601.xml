<AbstractNarration>The engineering workforce needs to better represent the diversity of the society it serves by attracting and retaining students from diverse backgrounds. The process students experience to become engineers requires them to acquire technical knowledge but also to identify with the profession. This project is designing a new curriculum for freshman engineering courses to help shape students' emerging engineering identities and expose students to the important role diversity plays in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curriculum is created to help students recognize the value that diversity brings to engineering in terms of (a) designing better and innovative solutions, and (b) expanding students' conceptions of who can be an engineer.  The project is evaluating the effect of the curriculum on students in two different freshman engineering classes. The research questions include the following: How did the intervention change students' attitudes toward diversity in engineering? How did the intervention change students' ability to recognize themselves and others as an engineer? Both quantitative and qualitative methods are being used in this evaluation. The intellectual merit of the project is its transformational approach to retaining diverse students. In particular, the project seeks to change the culture in the educational and work contexts for engineers rather than simply trying to support students from underrepresented groups in engineering. Furthermore, the project contributes to our understanding of how students form engineering identities. The broader impacts of the project include helping to broaden participation in engineering, preparing students for a global work environment, and improving STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Women and people of color are underrepresented in US engineering schools and in the engineering profession.  This underrepresentation has important consequences for engineering companies and US society as a whole.  In order to have the best talent and maintain the engineering workforce it is important that engineering careers are attractive and welcoming to a broader portion of the US population. Furthermore, teams of diverse individuals who have the skills to work in inclusive ways have been proven to produce more innovative design solutions that better serve the needs of society, especially when confronted with complex modern problems.  Engineering schools and a variety of partners, including corporations and the National Science Foundation, have been working on the issue of underrepresentation for many years with most approaches focused on providing additional support for individuals from underrepresented populations outside the classroom.  In this project we studied a novel approach to the problem of underrepresentation that seeks to teach all  engineering students about the benefits that diversity can bring to engineering practice and how they can work in more inclusive ways.  We worked with instructors of three different first-year engineering courses to design and implement a series of course activities intended to introduce students to the importance of working in teams, the variety of skills needed in engineers and the value of diversity in engineering practice. Activities included a welcome presentation from the dean of the college of engineering that emphasizes how diversity strengthens the engineering profession, an interactive theater sketch about conflict and teamwork, a panel of engineers who articulated how diversity benefits engineering practice, and assignments about the impact of bias in human interactions.  We used surveys to measure students? appreciation for diversity and identification with the engineering profession at five times during the course of a semester and compared the survey results to responses from students in the same courses from the prior year when these activities were not yet offered.  We found that the activities produced little change in how much students identified as engineers.  The beginning of the semester welcome from the dean did produce a small increase in students? appreciation for diversity. In the course with the theater sketch later in the semester, this increase was maintained until the end of the semester. The key outcomes of this project are 1) a set of activities that can be adapted by other institutions to help introduce first-year students to an inclusive vision of the engineering profession, 2) experience with faculty members in helping them adopt changes to their curriculum that will help their students work better in teams, 3) preliminary data supporting this novel approach to issues of underrepresentation in engineering.  The ultimate goal of this line of work is to help change the culture within engineering classrooms so a diverse body of future engineers are prepared to create and work in inclusive professional environments.
