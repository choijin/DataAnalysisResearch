<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program is supporting the fundamental research of Professor Arthur Winter at Iowa State University. Professor Winter will investigate the structure-reactivity principles for photoheterolysis reactions of carbon-leaving group (C-LG) bonds.   Photoheterolysis reactions generate ionic initial products and are important in biological processes, materials science, and environmental chemistry applications. The long-term goal of this research is to generate a predictive theoretical framework that relates chemical structure to excited state reactivity for heterolytic bond scission. Understanding the mechanistic principles for simple archetypal photoreactions will contribute to the broader challenge of understanding the guiding mechanistic principles in  photochemistry.  As part of his Broader Impacts effort, Professor Winter will further develop a "Chats with Eminent Female Scientists Initiative" that involves video interviews with eminent female scientists.  These interviews will be posted online to provide insights and advice for students who are interested in an academic career. He will also continue to recruit undergraduates and members of groups underrepresented in the STEM disciplines into his lab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study these photoheterolysis reactions, the PI will employ a joint theoretical/experimental approach. High-level quantum mechanical methods will be used to map the excited state transition states and surface crossing topologies in model systems. Experimentally, spectroscopy will determine the effect of structure on the rates and mechanisms of photorelease in model systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of "Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Photoheterolysis Reactions" is to understand the structure-reactivity relationships of photoheterolysis reactions.  Such photoheterolysis reactions are important in the development of photo cages (molecules that can release bioactive substrates using light), in understanding the photo degradation channels of pollutants and aerosols, and in chemical synthesis for metal free coupling reactions.  We have made a number of breakthroughs in this regard:  1) We have evaluated that the strategy of looking for carbocations with low-lying diradical states is an effective one for identifying new photoprecursors.  To this end, we have performed a computational screen of molecules with low-lying diradicals and shown that most photoactive substrates lead to carbocations with low-lying diradical states. Evidence for the importance of post transition-state conical intersections also come from static models. To provide a basic feasibility test of whether it is possible for post-transition-state dynamical considerations to govern the outcomes of a photoheterolysis reaction, we computed the ground state minimum (S0), the excited-state minimum (S1), and the conical intersection between S0 and S1 for several representative cations formed from photoheterolysis reactions. Our computations support the possibility that the photoreactions could be under conical intersection control (hypothesis 2). The unstable cations favored from photoheterolysis have access to a nearby low-energy conical intersection compared to the excited state minimum, whereas stable cations have energetically inaccessible conical intersections relative to the excited state minimum.  2) We have discovered an intimate connection between successful direct photoheterolysis reactions and generation of carbocation diradicals. Surprisingly, during our computational investigations, we discovered that carbocations that are formed from direct photoheterolysis reactions feature low-lying diradical states. In many cases, the diradical form of the carbocation is the computed ground state, not the expected closed-shell singlet carbocation configuration. Consistent with our computational predictions, Givens and Ramamurthy and coworkers recently reported experimental support that the carbocation rom the coumarin photocage has a diradical ground state,  in accord with our predictions. We have identified new classes of carbocations and other reactive intermediates with low-lying diradical states and in some cases diradical ground states.  These are candidate structures for novel photo cages.   3) We have acquired femtosecond laser flash photolysis data on representative photoheterolysis substrates.  Early results indicate that the ortho-methoxy benzylic cation is an exception that proves the rule, since we discovered that its anomalous photoreactivity arises as a consequence of it going through an unusual adiabatic photoreaction mechanism.  4) We have synthesized a suite of photoheterolysis chromophores that can release substrates with visible light based on BODIPY dyes.  By tuning the structure, we have identified derivatives with exceptionally high quantum yields of photorelease.  We have collaborated with a colleague (Prof Emily Smith) to show that these work in living cells without phototoxicity.  This work has broader impact because understanding how photoheterolysis reactions work contributes to the bigger problem of understanding the mechanistic principles of how structure impacts photochemical reactivity.  From a human resources perspective, my lab has trained numerous female and under-represented students and undergraduates, and developed a website featuring video interviews with successful women academics.
