<AbstractNarration>Research has shown that socioeconomic status affects a population's vulnerability to environmental hazards, yet little scholarship exists regarding how such groups understand their own vulnerability to coastal hazards.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate how a diverse populace understands and visualizes coastal hazards and how these understandings align with depictions of their vulnerability as represented by U.S. Census data.  The project will provide new insights on how socioeconomic status affects participation and resource allocation for coastal hazard adaptation and mitigation projects.  It will expand hazards theory to include elements of critical race theory and bring to bear the political ecology concepts of marginalization and facilitation.  The doctoral student will work closely with several local organizations, state agencies, and nongovernmental organizations to enable findings to help guide policy makers in mitigating social vulnerability via adaptation planning projects.  Project findings also will assist resource planners in their long-term management of coastal resources.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a mixed methods approach, the doctoral student will analyze inequalities in social vulnerabilities to environmental hazards.  The project will address two core questions: (1) What populations are vulnerable to hazards along the coast of Georgia?  (2) How do these populations conceptualize and understand these hazards?  Census-based modeling methods such as the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) will be used to identify and map vulnerable populations and their exposure to multiple coastal hazards.  Furthermore, the student will investigate alternative understandings and conceptions about vulnerability through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and sketch-mapping of livelihood use spaces across a diverse population.  The analyses will inform policy makers and planners about existing inequities in vulnerabilities and provide guidance regarding policies that would minimize the impacts on marginalized or underrepresented populations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Outcomes Report: NSF Award # 1458978</span></strong><strong><br /> Doctoral Dissertation Research: <br /> Mapping Socioeconomic Vulnerabilities to Coastal Hazards</strong></p> <p>The potential for harm to people from environmental hazards (for example, floods, hurricanes, and droughts) occurs from interaction of both social <em>and</em> environmental factors. This potential for harm is what researchers and emergency management professionals often refer to as <strong>social vulnerability</strong>. When environmental changes or hazards negatively affect an individual, household, or community, the ability to respond and recover often varies greatly <em>and unevenly</em> across social difference. By social difference, we are referring to differences in income, race, ethnicity, age, education, and gender. In this project, we investigated both the social and environmental factors that are expected to lead to an increased social vulnerability of future populations living in the southeastern U.S. coastal regions. Specifically for this project, we focused on the intersection of social characteristics that increase social vulnerability and predictions of future flooding that will be caused by sea-level rise.</p> <p>We chose the Georgia coast as our project study site in 2015 for a few key reasons. First, it has a rapidly growing population, one that increased 15% between the years 2000 and 2010. Many of Georgia&rsquo;s coastal residents have social characteristics that are typically associated with increased social vulnerability to environmental hazards. Second, much of Georgia&rsquo;s coast is low-lying land with high tidal ranges of 6 to 10 feet and increased flooding from rising seas. Further, we found that nearly 110 square miles of land is less than 2.1 feet above the current high tide line.</p> <p>To achieve our project&rsquo;s key goal of investigating how social vulnerability to sea-level rise would change over the first half of this century, we projected the coastal population and some of its key characteristics out to the year 2050. Employing social science methods that included interviews with 41 local residents and over 100 hours of observation of coastal life, we also investigated how racial inequality combined with rising seas will increase the potential for harm to the African American population (36% as of 2010) living on Georgia&rsquo;s coast.</p> <p>Our project&rsquo;s <strong>first key finding</strong> is that the future population of Georgia&rsquo;s coast that could be directly exposed to flooding from sea-level rise by 2050 is between 12,500 and 42,000 people. This range depends on the rate of sea-level rise. Our sea-level rise scenarios ranged from eight to 25 inches by the year 2050 and are based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&rsquo;s low and high scenarios. For the fastest scenario, nearly 9,400 people are projected to have higher levels of social vulnerability, a substantial increase of 116% over estimates based on the 2010 population. The results of our population model show that Georgia&rsquo;s coastal population is projected to increase between the years 2010 and 2050 by approximately 48%, with an average growth rate of 0.98% per year and reaching nearly 745,000 people. Compared with the U.S. Census&rsquo;s 2008-2012 American Community Survey estimates, our model shows that by the year 2050 the percentages of coastal Georgia&rsquo;s population with less than a high school education is projected to decrease from 11.3 % to 9.3% and those living in poverty is projected to increase from 17.6% to 18.5%. Our population model results also show a demographic shift for coastal Georgia to a majority non-white population from 44% in 2010 to 60% by the year 2050.</p> <p>Our <strong>second key finding</strong> is that acknowledgement and acceptance &ndash; by the professional community working on sea-level rise &ndash; of race as a process of enabling or constraining meaningful engagement, rather than treating it merely as a demographic category, will improve mitigation of social vulnerability in underrepresented communities. We define this explicit practice as <em>race-aware</em> adaptation planning, which is in opposition to current practices that we define as <em>colorblind</em> adaptation planning. This second key finding conveys another crucial result of our project&rsquo;s investigation into the role of social difference, specifically racial difference, in creating increased potential for harm to communities of color. The idea that being a racial minority indicates increased levels of social vulnerability need not necessarily persist into the future. In other words, if what it means to be a non-white person changes in the social realm over the coming decades, our population model&rsquo;s projection of social vulnerability will be altered accordingly. Social vulnerability is not a static state, but a multi-dimensional process. This process is dependent, in part at least, on social institutions and attitudes about racial difference and identity. In other words, social configurations of power and racial inequality are mutable. Race-aware adaptation planning is one pragmatic method for mitigating <em>uneven</em> social vulnerability to future flooding from sea-level rise.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/23/2017<br>      Modified by: R.
