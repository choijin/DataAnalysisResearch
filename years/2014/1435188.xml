<AbstractNarration>The design of complex engineered systems is of critical importance to society due to the impact these systems have on productivity and quality of life. The complexity of systems such as electronic appliances, aircraft, spacecraft, or cars has grown tremendously as the expectations for performance and functionality continue to increase. The process for designing engineered systems has itself become complex, to the point where this complexity is becoming unmanageable. This award supports research on new approaches for designing that can tackle problems of unprecedented complexity through the use of optimization algorithms.  Using optimization software, an automotive engineer can already design a car that maximizes the fuel economy by varying the car shape, dimensions, and engine characteristics, while satisfying all safety constraints. However, for engineered systems that involve large numbers of components and parameters that depend on each other, existing optimization algorithms become unacceptably slow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a new set of computational design optimization algorithms that will be able to optimize large-scale complex engineered systems in a scalable way. This scalability will be achieved by taking advantage of high-performance parallel computing resources and by exploiting the mathematical structure of the problem, decomposing it automatically into manageable components. The algorithms will be built upon recent mathematical developments that unify numerical methods for the solution and sensitivity analysis of coupled systems. The developed algorithms will be tested in collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the design optimization of a satellite and its operation. The resulting software will be of general purpose, and will be published under an open source license agreement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Human history has been characterized by an unrelenting march towards greater complexity in ideas, socioeconomic environment, and technology. The complexity of engineered systems has increased at a tremendous pace over the last two hundred years of engineering design. While this increase in complexity has, for the most part, resulted in better performance of the engineered systems themselves, the problem is that we are now at a critical point where the design problem is larger than we can currently manage effectively.   The ever increasing size of engineering systems has thankfully been accompanied by an exponential increase in computing power. However, in recent years, computer power has been increasingly dependent on multi-core processors. Current computational design processes are largely sequential and do not take full advantage of this growth in parallel computing power. Thus, the major challenge we choose to address in this proposal is to develop a truly scalable parallelized computer-aided design process that is able to manage the complexity of current and future engineering design projects.   In this project, we achieved the following objectives to address the issues above: 1. Derived a new mathematical representation that describes the design optimization of large-scale coupled engineered systems in a general and flexible way. 2. Implemented the mathematical representation in an open-source computational framework (OpenMDAO) that is versatile enough to handle the design optimization of a wide variety of engineered systems. 3. Demonstrated the developed framework in real-world engineering design problems of unprecedented scale, including the design optimization of aircraft and satellites.    The main broader impact was a drastic decrease in the design cycle time for complex engineered systems. This enables the design optimization of  automobiles, aircraft, spacecraft, watercraft, bridges, buildings, electronic circuits, and manufacturing equipment with an unprecedented amount of detail and completeness.
