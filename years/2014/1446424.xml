<AbstractNarration>Seismic protective systems, such as base isolation, passive energy dissipation, and semi-active and active control, can be applied to new and existing buildings to provide significant reductions in building motion and damage during earthquakes.  The objective of this award is to build a community of researchers from Chile, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States, through a virtual institute, to accelerate research on seismic protective systems.  This institute will enable U.S. researchers to proactively learn from their foreign counterparts from Pacific Rim countries about the performance of buildings with seismic protective systems during recent major earthquakes in Chile in 2010 and in New Zealand and Japan in 2011, to ensure that seismic protective systems research is directed to better prepare for future hazards. This award will enable the U.S. seismic protective systems community to better anticipate structural damage from future large earthquakes, and avert risk to these events by conducting research now to address the challenges that will facilitate seismic protective systems implementation in buildings.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virtual institute will incorporate the following face-to-face and virtual activities: (a) one workshop per year, hosted sequentially in the countries of the foreign partners, to provide direct opportunities for U.S. participants to share research and data and chart future research directions with international collaborators, (b) pairings of early career U.S. faculty participants with foreign counterparts to develop case studies about the effectiveness of seismic protective systems in past earthquakes, thereby building long-term research collaborations, (c) lectures by the foreign counterparts and U.S. senior participants about research on seismic protective systems in their country, (d) an on-line, directed-study seismic protective systems course that will be used to teach graduate students in the United States and around the world about the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-research in seismic protective systems, and (e) regular quarterly virtual meetings using online collaboration tools.  The virtual institute will bring together researchers on 13 active NSF awards in the areas of seismic protective systems, as well as 20-30 early career participants, to form long-term global research relationships with their international collaborators, who share common research interests and are supported by their respective government research agencies.  This award is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is co-funded by NSF's Directorate for Engineering and NSF's Office of Integrative and International Activities.</AbstractNarration>

PREEMPTIVE brought together a group of over 100 researchers from 6 countries -- primarily from Chile, Japan, New Zealand and the United States -- to interact and discuss advances in seismic protective systems, and to develop research plans and research collaborations to make new advances.

PREEMPTIVE organized four workshops, one in each of the principal countries, co-organized by the project principal investigators and by seven counterparts in Chile, Japan and New Zealand.   Nov. 2015 Japan: The first workshop, which had 43 participants (half from Japan, half from the U.S.), was held in two segments: the first two days in Tokyo in conjunction with the Japan Association for Earthquake Engineering (JAEE) Annual Meeting, and the last two days in Sendai at Tohoku University's International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS), including a tour of earthquake- and tsunami-affected areas of the region around Sendai with particular emphasis on buildings with seismic protective systems.   Aug. 2016 New Zealand: During the second workshop, 16 researchers from the U.S. met with a similar number of New Zealander counterparts in Christchurch with a focus particularly on the effects of the Feb. 2011 earthquake on the central business district of Christchurch, followed by meeting a partially different group of New Zealand researchers as part of a workshop co-sponsored by PREEMPTIVE and by New Zealand's QuakeCoRE research center to focus on innovative and low-damage designs and energy dissipation and protective devices.   Jan. 2017 Chile: The third workshop brought together 16 Chilean researchers, 11 from Japan, 1 from New Zealand and 21 from the U.S. at the Univ. of Chile just prior to the 16th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering. The workshop focused particularly on the seismicity of Chile and its effects on Santiago in the past decade, and included a tour to a high-profile instrumented bridge outside Santiago.
