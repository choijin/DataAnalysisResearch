<AbstractNarration>The researchers will study our Milky Way galaxy and the great star clouds of Sagittarius, which are easily visible on a dark summer night, low on the Southern horizon, from the anywhere in the United States. Their observation plan is to precisely measure the colors of stars in the brightest part of the Milky Way, including the bulge of stars near the center of our galaxy.   Their scientific target is understanding the origin and history of formation of stars in the bulge. The investigators will use the Dark Energy Camera (currently most powerful on any telescope) on the 4m telescope at the Cerro Tololo observatory in Chile.  They will produce a sequence of color images, from infrared, optical to ultraviolet wavelengths. The broader impact of this program has several components. Foremost is providing professional astronomers and public with tools to view the multi-color images online.  The investigators will give the public access to the same data as are used by professional astronomers.  The investigators will report the results via popular journal articles, public lectures and sky viewing events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration will use these detailed images of the bulge of our Milky Way to map the structure of its stars, deduce their age and metal content, to shed light on the structure and formation history of the bulge stars. An additional bonus will be detailed images of over 30 globular star clusters in the six filters observed by the collaboration. Over time, the space motions of stars will be measured, enabling study of the stellar orbits that support the structure of the bulge. The bulge of stars surrounding the core of our galaxy was likely formed as the result of three processes, 1) rapid, violent merging within the first billion years after the Big Bang, 2) ongoing mergers of massive stellar clusters and 3) formation from the early disk of the Milky Way, by slower dynamical processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration's images and derived measurements, combined with additional studies, have the potential to transform our understanding of the formation of the Galaxy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have used an advanced astronomical camera at the Cerro Tololo observatory in Chile, near La Serena, to  take images of the central bulge of the Milky Way galaxy, some 30,000  light years away. That is the brightest part of our galaxy toward the  constellation of Scorpius and Sagittarius.  Our goal is to make a  detailed map of the central bulge of the Milky Way using images in six  colors of light.  The bulge is interesting because it is one of the oldest parts of our Galaxy, but appears to have formed  very  early and rapidly.  It also is massive, with 10 billion suns of mass,  about 20% of all of the stars in the Milky Way.   The stars in the bulge  have metal content as high as that of the Sun, and yet many of them are 10 billion years old.  This is quite different from the region around our Sun, where stars continue to  form more or less in the present day.  The  camera we have used is remarkable and illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.   It's called the Dark Energy Camera or DECam, not because it takes  pictures of Dark Energy but because the project will make maps of the  distribution of galaxies int he Universe that will shed light on the  nature of Dark Energy.   It sits atop the Blanco 4m telescope.  In  one picture, its 62 CCD imagers cover an area of the sky much larger  than the full moon.  Figure 3 shows the detail of one of our images;  it's the beautiful globular cluster M22, about 10 billion years old and  hosting one million stars.  Figure 4 shows a closeup of one CCD's level  of detail; both of these images are composed of 3 black and white images  taken behind different filters.   To give you an idea of just how large  a piece of the sky we are covering, Figure 5 shows a part of our mosaic  compared to the fields covered by the Hubble Space telescope.   The  final figure shows our field of view, and also, a plot of brightness  versus star color.  From these data, with some analysis, we can measure  the ages and the metal contents of the stars in our bulge, and learn  more about the how the bulge formed some 10 billion years ago.  In  the early 2020s, the Large Synoptic Survey telescope (LSST) will be  operating nearby Cerro Tololo, on Cerro Pachon.  This 8m telescope will  take images of the whole sky, every night.  The data we have is almost  identical the kind of data the LSST will be producing.  Our dataset is  huge- 50 terabytes.  Collaborator Christian Johnson at the Center for  Astrophysics has developed new techniques for processing such a huge  dataset.  Our team has already developed a reduction algorithm that is  superior to the one intended for use by the LSST project.    Our survey  now has over one billion stars measured in 6 colors of light; we are  working to archive the data and offer it to the world community.    Our  goal over the next years is to map the stars of the bulge and to study  the structure of the bulge as a function of stellar age and metal  content.  We will match our stars to a powerful new database created by  the Gaia satellite; we will then be able to explore the orbits of stars  of different metal content.  The result will be an exciting new picture  of how the central part of the Milky Way formed.       Last Modified: 11/17/2018       Submitted by: R. Michael Rich]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
