<AbstractNarration>This research project addresses several areas within symplectic topology and its interaction with gauge theory, complex geometry, and low-dimensional topology. Lagrangian morphisms in the symplectic category are viewed as morphisms between manifolds that are not necessarily symplectomorphic, but their geometric composition is generically singular. A previous project partially resolves this problem, with consequences including the construction of invariants for three-manifolds and knots; the next goal is to fit these invariants into a framework of higher topological quantum field theories, in particular four-manifold invariants. Another goal is to extend the existing framework to a refined Fukaya category, leading to a tool for mirror symmetry proofs. Moreover, the proposal seeks to solidify and provide accessible expositions of the differential-topological foundations for regularizations of moduli spaces of elliptic PDEs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects described in this proposal concern symplectic geometry, the geometric structure that lies behind the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics. Recent applications of ideas from symplectic geometry include invariants that help to distinguish one (three or) four-dimensional space from another. Broader impacts of this project concentrate on promoting women in mathematics, e.g. by continuing a lecture series by accomplished researchers and expositors, named after Dorothy Weeks, the first female graduate from the MIT math department.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The symplectic category and pseudoholomorphic quilt invariants introduced by the PI provide a general framework for studying questions relating the symplectic category to others, e.g. categories of sheaves involved in mirror symmetry, or cobordism categories involved in topological quantum field theories. As example of the latter, the project developed a general framework for constructing 2+1+1 field theories, in particular 3- and 4-manifold invariants from decompositions into simple pieces and representation of a minimal generator set in the symplectic category. By continuation of previous work on the Atiyah-Floer conjecture, the proposal established a relationship between Yang-Mills gauge theory on 4-manifolds and (as of now infinite dimensional analogues of) pseudoholomorphic quilt invariants arising from representation spaces.  Moreover, the proposal made significant steps towards extending the categorical structures to general symplectic manifolds with the help of refined analysis for tangencies of seams, polyfold transversality techniques, and more refined algebraic structures capturing obstructions from, most notably, the novel figure eight bubbles. The latter were shown to appear - in a geometrically controlled manner - under strip shrinking in lower codimension than even disk bubbles.   This project moreover developed a new analytic setup for Fukaya categories allowing to capture the disk bubbling obstructions in finitely generated A_infty-algebras.  Finally, the PI successfully transferred her women-in-math activities from MIT to UC Berkeley - introducing e.g. an annual mentoring retreat and regular professional development activities for junior female researchers.
