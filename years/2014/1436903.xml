<AbstractNarration>Developing a robust timescale of geologic events in key geographic areas is essential for understanding the global system and its record of change. The high-latitude North Pacific is under-sampled, poorly understood, and filled with controversy. This study, using material from new deep-sea sediment cores collected during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 341 in the Gulf of Alaska, will provide the first high-quality, high-resolution isotopic and magnetic data needed to understand the contribution of this region to global oceanographic and glacial dynamics, biogeochemical cycles, and fundamental properties of the earth's magnetic field. Results of this study will be of keen interest to the public, for example, by relating variations in the earth's magnetic field to shielding of cosmic rays, a phenomenon which impacts global telecommunications and businesses that rely on tourism related to the Aurora Borealis. In addition, results from this work could have implications for environmental and biological exposure to radiation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great sedimentation rates in the Gulf of Alaska are supported by a glaciated, tectonically active margin that ensures an almost continuous supply of fine-grained lithogenic material. These high sedimentation rates support a strong record of paleomagnetic variations and enhance preservation of calcareous microfossils suitable for isotopic analysis. Such rapidly accumulating sediments are only accessible through drilling. Three sites (U1417, U1418, U1419) drilled during IODP Expedition 341 (Southern Alaska Margin Tectonic, Climate and Sedimentation) provide, for the first time, the high-quality materials needed to assess globally important climatic, glacial, and paleomagnetic variability in the North Pacific. The PIs will use a tandem stable isotopic and paleomagnetic approach to develop robust, high-resolution chronostratigraphies in the Expedition 341 sites. The primary focus is on the past ~ 1 Ma, at submillenial resolution for sites U1417 and U1418; and will focus on the last glacial cycle (~0-50 ka) at subcentury resolution for site U1419.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Understanding of the Quaternary evolution of climate, ice, and the geomagnetic field of the NE Pacific has lagged behind that of many other regions of the globe. Three sites (U1417, U1418, U1419) drilled during the recently completed Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 341 (Southern Alaska Margin Tectonics, Climate and Sedimentation) set the stage for a detailed study of the paleoceanographic and paleomagnetic dynamics from a NE Pacific perspective. Site survey cores collected to test the suitability of these sediment for drilling are providing a new understanding of the region, but only recovered 10 + meters of sediment and less than twenty thousand years of record, only hinting at what could be expect from the many 100s of m of sediment and more than one million years of record recovered through drilling. Shipboard data acquired during the IODP Expedition outlined the potential of these drilled records to meet the Expedition&rsquo;s primary objectives, but only provided minimal information on the time interval recovered and the temporal resolution that studying these sediment will allow. With the lack of robust chronologies being one of the primary reasons why our understanding of the NE Pacific has lagged behind that of other regions, we embarked on a multi method (stable isotopic, radiocarbon, and paleomagnetic) dating program to better constrain the chronology of Sites U1417, U1418, and U1419. Such an integrated approach, although substantially more work, was needed as no one method works at all sites and at all times &ndash; one of the main reasons why this region has been difficult to study - while some techniques work better at some sites than others. Because of the Expedition&rsquo;s objectives and the enormous amount of sediment recovered that needed to be studied (~ 200 m at site U1417 and ~ 800 m at site U1418 for the last ~1.3 Ma and ~ 100 m at site U1419 for the last ~50 ka), we organized an international team to facilitate data acquisition, while using a strategic approach to get the most understanding within the constraints of the grant. Findings presented are preliminary, as we focused on data collection over data interpretation. Possibly the most important finding so far are the greatly variable sedimentation rates at all sites over the last two (~ the last 250 ka) and potentially all glacial/interglacial cycles. Interglaciations associated with minimal Alaskan ice are characterized by relatively low sedimentation rates, while times of expanded ice conditions like the 17 &ndash; 43 ka time interval are characterized by exceptionally high sedimentation rates.

For example, oxygen isotope data from Site U1419 reveal distinct millennial-scale oscillations in near-surface ocean conditions (planktonic foraminifera that likely record temperature and salinity) relative to a stable benthic (subsurface) record. The combination of stable isotope and radiocarbon data provide a detailed chronology that resolve massive changes in sedimentation rates (from ~10 cm/ka to ~1000 cm/ka, or 1 cm/year), proving that this site can deliver decadal resolution equivalent to typical ice core records at certain time intervals and showing that stadial (cold intervals) and interstadial (warm intervals) climate oscillations in this part of Alaska closely track those of Greenland. Second, the Late Pleistocene part of the radiocarbon period represents an interval of expanded accumulation at all sites, allowing the best paleomagnetic records derived from the deepest sites (U1417, U1418) to be compared to the best dated (but worst paleomagnetic) records derived from the shallowest site (U1419).
