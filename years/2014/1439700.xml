<AbstractNarration>The Grid-Connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES) IUCRC proposes renewal as a two-site I/UCRC, comprising personnel and facilities at the University of Arkansas (lead) and the University of South Carolina with a focus on developing the new knowledge, tools, hardware, software, and personnel that are required to pervasively insert power electronics into the 21st century power grid in ways that will strengthen and modernize the grid. GRAPES makes use of an already-developed facility for design, development, &lt;br/&gt;test, evaluation, and standardization of distribution-level grid-connected power electronic equipment. This enables validation of research findings, and accelerated insertion of new solid-state equipment into the power grid at both source and load ends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power electronics in grid applications are essential to achieving efficient power systems of high reliability and resiliency. The I/UCRC in Phase II will train students and practicing engineers who will become qualified to develop and manage the next generation of power systems, thereby helping to mitigate the forecasted shortage of power engineers. GRAPES will establish new courses that will integrate research with education to make our students highly competitive in their ownership of unique skills and knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

All of these examples illustrate the impact GRAPES research contributes through knowledge accumulation, student education, industry recruitment of students and technology transfer.     Broader Impacts:     The GRAPES Broader Impacts outcomes were also significant. The Center added a third site with University of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Several international sites have joined, including RWTH Aachen University in Aachen Germany, and two universities in South Korea - Yonsei University and Korea University.  This expansion continues the formal establishment of the GRAPES Global Institute (GGI).  The GGI is a concept long overdue because reliable, clean, resilient electric power is every nation?s concern. Through this process, GRAPES will broaden the impact of its research, increase the return on the dollars that industry members contribute, improves the education of students, and brings unique perspectives to the IAB-driven research.   Within the last year, four new industry members were also added.  It should also be noted that a number of graduating students who contributed to GRAPES research projects are now employed in prestigious positions.     As of today, GRAPES-Korea has already recruited four Korean industry members that confirmed commitment of this program for the next three years as follows: KEPCO (Korea Electric Power Corporation), KERI (Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute), DOOSAN (DOOSAN Heavy Industry &amp; Construction), LG Electronics and additional companies have expressed interest.     As a result of the continued success of GRAPES, along with other projects, the University of Arkansas decided to invest approximately $3 Million to expand the National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission (NCREPT) Test Facility which supports the aforementioned center as a primary testing facility.  NCREPT is an approximately 7000 sq foot facility used to test almost all of the technology developed by the GRAPES center.  The facility is shared by the site partners.  It has grown by approximately 5000 feet in order to accommodate additional testing areas, along with more office space to support students, faculty, and visiting researchers.       Among the most significant benefits for our members have been: 1. Better prepared students hired by industry at all degree levels, 2. New circuit design methods for equipment, 3.
