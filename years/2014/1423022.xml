<AbstractNarration>This project underscores the close link between the ability to do high throughput sequencing and the wide range of applications that are critical to understanding the biological world.  Data analysis is the bottleneck in sequences.  This project will lead to new efficiencies in sequence comparison and will lead to a new compendium of genetic variation. This work will provide support for both graduate students and undergraduate students, the latter especially through a new site the PI has established to recruit students from underrepresented groups.  The BitPal algorithms will be widely distributed and facility sequence alignment in a variety of areas.  The work also directly enhances the infrastructure for research in genomics, while the new protocol will facilitate the epidemiological study of pathogenic infections and analysis of biothreat agents.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deluge of genomic sequence data has outpaced the growing speed of modern computers. For sequence analysis programs, such as VNTRseek, to keep pace with data growth, extremely high efficiency algorithms are required. This project will develop a novel class of bit-parallel alignment algorithms which exploit the inherent parallelism in computer logic operations and will yield dramatic acceleration of sequence comparison tasks.  The project will achieve the following: A variety of multi-purpose, high-efficiency bit-parallel alignment algorithms will be designed and implemented for CPU and GPU (graphical processing unit) architectures. A website will be created for easy download and use of the computer code implementing the algorithms. The bit-parallel techniques to be developed are novel and represent an extension of a successful method to a larger class of problems. The algorithms will be widely applicable in bioinformatics and other fields that involve text comparison. Implementation in GPUs will expand the domain of this underutilized computing architecture. The bit-parallel algorithms will be used to replace less efficient algorithms in VNTRseek and TRF, in order to accelerate the analysis of large data sets. Initial analysis will identify VNTRs in 380 human genomes (moderate to high coverage) from the 1000 Genomes Project. Additional genomes will be analyzed as they become available. An online database will be created to store the VNTR data and provide online tools for VNTR analysis. Genome wide occurrence of VNTRs is currently unknown. The VNTRseek analysis of human genomes will result in an entirely new compendium of human genetic variation. A bacterial strain typing protocol will be developed for pathogenic bacteria, based on multilocus VNTR analysis (MLVA), using high-throughput sequencing data as an alternative to slower techniques. This will facilitate the epidemiological study of pathogenic bacterial infrections and the analysis of biothreat agents for national security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major research goals of this project were 1) development of bit-parallel alignment algorithms that have higher efficiency in terms of computer instructions and processing time than standard sequential algorithms, and  2) analysis of whole genome sequencing data to detect unknown Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) genetic variants in a large collection of publicly available human samples.   The major educational goals were  1) training in computational biology algorithm development for PhD students at Boston University, 2) training in bioinformatics analysis research for undergraduate students at Boston University, and  3) training in genomic sequencing data analysis to primarily second- and third-world international graduate students and postdocs as part of overseas graduate level short courses in Bioinformatics.  Research Results. Bit-Parallel Alignment Algorithms.   A series of bit-parallel alignment algorithms and computer programs were developed which are appropriate for comparing biological sequences such as protein or DNA sequences.  The algorithms cover different types of alignment scoring or different types of alignment: 1) Substitution scoring, which assigns a potentially different integer substitution weight to every pair of alphabet characters and applies to global alignment, 2) Affine gap scoring, in which gaps in the alignment are scored with separate initiation and extension weights and applies to global alignment, 3) Match, mismatch, and gap scoring, which allows only three different weights, one for matching characters, one for mismatching characters, and one for a gap in the alignment and applies to global alignment, and 4) Tandem alignment, which aligns one copy of a pattern against potentially multiple tandem copies in a sequence. These algorithms are based on a "partial sums" approach to computing alignment score.  They also use SIMD based (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) computer instructions, which are available in all modern computers, and for which increases in the computer word storage size easily translate into additional speed-ups in these algorithms.  VNTR Detection in Human Genomes. Publicly available, high-throughput, whole genome sequencing data from a collection of 393 human genome samples were evaluated for detection of VNTR genetic variants using VNTRseek software which was developed in an earlier NSF funded research project (NSF IIS-1017621).  During the course of this study the VNTRseek software underwent major revisions and improvements.  The genome datasets were a collection of lower coverage (5-10 times the size of the human genome) and higher coverage (70-350 times the size of the human genome) data, with sequencing reads of length 100 base pairs (bp), 148 bp, and 250 bp.  The individuals were from a cross-section of world populations, with some related individuals (mother-father-child) included, and two "haploid" genomes included.  The analysis discovered over 11,000 VNTRs, the vast majority of them previously unknown.  Approximately 30% of these VNTRs were private, i.e., discovered in only one genome.  Another 28% were common, i.e., occurring in at least 5% of the genomes, indicating that they could be used for disease locus detection in genome-wide association studies.  Common VNTRs were found to be enriched in chromosomal regions which affect gene expression, including transcription factor binding regions, transcription enhancer regions, DNAse hypersensitive regions and CpG islands.  Additionally, 36 of the common VNTRs occurred within protein coding gene exons.  Nearly 900 VNTRs were hypervariable, meaning four or more different alleles were detected in the samples.  A public database, VNTRdb, was developed to store information on the detected VNTRs.  Development of two additional methodologies, using machine learning, to detect VNTRs outside the range of detection of VNTRseek were initiated.  The first seeks to classify VNTR loci as either homozygous in an individual (both chromosomes have the same allele) or heterozygous (chromosomes have different alleles), in particular, when only one allele is detected by VNTRseek (because, for example, another possible allele is outside the VNTRseek detectable range).  The second seeks to identify VNTR loci when the size of the repeat is larger than the size of a sequencing read.  It uses information about the number of reads that map onto the repeat in comparison to the number of reads that map onto the regions flanking the repeat.    Educational Results. Three PhD students were trained under this project.  One was female and two others were members of underrepresented groups (URMs).  Two have defended dissertations related to this project and have graduated.  Eight undergraduate students were trained in bioinformatics analysis research.  Two were female,  one was a URM, two were first generation college students.  All eight presented posters at national undergraduate research conferences (ABRCMS or SACNAS).   Two were co-authors on papers arising out of the research, one of which received a "Best Paper" conference award.    70 graduate students and postdocs, primarily from second- and third-world countries, were trained in genome sequencing data analysis techniques, during four graduate-level Short Courses in Bioinformatics sponsored by the Institut Pasteur and the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in Tunis, Tunisia; Izmir, Turkey; and Thessaloniki, Greece.
