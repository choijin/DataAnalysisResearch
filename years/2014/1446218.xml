<AbstractNarration>The social and behavioral sciences create knowledge that has significant potential for producing societal benefit. Scientific understanding of people's behavior during hurricanes, floods, and other natural disaster has, for example, led to the development of safer evacuation procedures, while studies of how children learn have helped improve education policy. However, the mechanisms by which such knowledge makes its way into public policy contexts are not fully understood. In an era of increasingly complex policy challenges, defined and acted upon by a diverse and wide-ranging set of stakeholders (e.g. legislators, public administrators, and community leaders), the successful transfer of scientific knowledge requires an in-depth understanding of policy development and implementation. Understanding the interactions between science and policy will help governments and communities better leverage scientific discoveries into beneficial policy innovations.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Building on the findings from a previous workshop titled "Catalyzing Discovery for Social Impact: Exploring the Power of the Research-Academic-Policy Nexus to Stimulate Policy Innovation," this workshop will explore, in particular, the role of entrepreneurial scientists in facilitating the exchange of knowledge between science and policy.  Social and behavioral scientists are often not trained in how to transfer their knowledge into the public sector.  Therefore, a major element of this challenge is identifying and developing the necessary skill sets social scientists need to help catalyze the transformation of their research into practical application.  This workshop will convene a dynamic group of the nation's top researchers, thought leaders, and curriculum developers who are actively studying or writing about the challenges posed by the creation and sustainability of strong academic-research-policy relationships.  Utilizing participatory action methods and drawing on participants' expertise and experience, this workshop will collaboratively build a skills inventory and a curriculum to build such skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  PROJECT OUTCOMES SUMMARY: "Curriculum Blueprint to Enhance Social ScientistsÆ Capacities to Create and Sustain Social Change" (February 27-28, 2015)   There is far-reaching agreement that deep gaps exist between those who generate new scientific knowledge and those who could use that knowledge to formulate and execute social policies.  Despite this consensus, little has been done to strengthen the exchange between academic and policymaking communities, resulting in serendipitous relationships that are often fraught with challenges, and unsustainable over time. In 2013 and 2015, The National Science Foundation supported two workshops held at the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin to explore why these gaps persist and what, if anything, could be done to close them. The aim of NSFÆs investment was to determine whether knowledge and expertise resident in academia could result in innovative approaches to social problems, and if so, then what efforts would have the most promise of achieving this aim. By the end of the first workshop, which brought over 30 academic leaders and policymakers together to examine the academic-policy-research nexus, several researcher skills were identified as inherent to improving transmission of research to policy decisionmakers, including the ability to:  &bull; Collaborate with actors across multiple sectors with diverse incentives and institutional constraints,  &bull; Build and sustain trusting relationships,  &bull; Identify common shared values,  &bull; Engage early and consistently in the policy development and implementation processes, and  &bull; Communicate knowledge in accessible formats. Another important conclusion of this workshop was that, while the skill sets may appear obvious and commonsensical, there is a dearth of systematic training available to social scientists to support their understanding of, and sustained communication with, policymakers.    Key Outcomes:  2015 LBJ Workshop On February 26 and 27, 2015, thirty leaders from academia, the policy community, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations, met at the LBJ School to review and revise an initial draft curriculum developed by the primary investigator team.  The draft contained the specific purpose of each module, guiding questions to probe the relevance of the module content, the skills associated with each module, and the learning outcomes expected. In developing these modules, the principal investigators analyzed interviews with participants in the first and second NSF workshops, interviews with selected experts around the country, feedback received from attendees of various conferences in which the results of the first workshop were presented, and pre-workshop dialogues conducted with congressional staff in Washington, D.C. Workshop participants were tasked with revising the curriculum to meet two primary aims:  1) Build capacity among social scientists to offer innovative approaches to social problems in ways that preserve their research independence while engaging with those who create and support policy change, and  2) Construct a formal protocol through which researchers, regardless of the stage in their research or career, could develop skills and build experiences that would better position them to engage in an ongoing basis with policymakers at the federal, state and local levels of government, as well as those in nonprofit entities (e.g. think tanks, foundations, and service providing organizations). The workshop participants met these tasks, producing a proof of concept in the form of a draft curricular outline, which confirmed basic skills needed to enhance the transmission of social science research to the policymaking sphere, and elaborated how they could be taught and measured. They also developed a detailed protocol for the sequencing and timing of the training.  This proof of concept, when refined and piloted, could serve as the foundational training ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
