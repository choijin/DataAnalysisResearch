<AbstractNarration>In industry, the design of a product is a multidisciplinary effort since engineers and technologists need to integrate the various laws of physics, optics, chemistry and thermodynamics and use algorithmic technical computing to analyze the design. The most fundamental abilities needed by workers in engineering and technology fields are problem-solving, critical thinking, and the ability to digest, analyze and communicate information; however, much of the student learning in technical fields has been along rigid disciplinary lines and has been visually static. To address this issue, Housatonic Community College is using integrated multidisciplinary software to develop software modules that teach mathematics, science, and engineering and engineering technology courses with the aid of 3D solid modeling software and embedding these modules into science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses. These modules are increasing fundamental abilities in understanding and applying engineering design principles for current students, new students, and incumbent workers. Links are being created by connecting three-dimensional solid modeling software to three-dimensional equations; using technical computing language software to connect equations with solid modeling software; and connecting physics based analysis to the design process. Students are thus experiencing direct application of engineering principles through visualization and thereby enhancing their understanding and appreciation of these principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All modular curricula being developed in this project are being tested, assessed, and disseminated to the twelve Connecticut Community Colleges and the four state universities. Partnering with the NSF Regional Center for Next Generation Manufacturing (RCNGM) has the potential to impact 4,500 community college students in the state of Connecticut, and this method of instruction and learning is being spread to high school level students and educators through local affiliates of Project Lead the Way. The NSF SC ATE Center of Excellence has agreed to distribute the modules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modular curricula being created use solid modeling and technical computing and focus on a particular task or application and link mathematics and engineering technology.  Three dimensional objects and surfaces come alive visually in three dimensions with proper lighting, dynamic rotation, and interactive cross section visualization and with 3D printers. Students actually hold 3D mathematical equations in their hands. The modules are being used in classrooms that contain computers, the required software, and 3D printers and are being tested at the college with approximately 400 students who are taking Manufacturing Mathematics, Blueprint Reading, Computer Numerical Control classes, College Algebra, Precalculus, Statistics, Computer Aided Design, Statistical Process Control, Calculus, General Physics, General Chemistry, and pre-engineering courses.</AbstractNarration>
