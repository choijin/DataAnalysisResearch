<AbstractNarration>SES- 1458469&lt;br/&gt;John W. Curtis&lt;br/&gt;American Sociological Association&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding through this award provides ongoing support for the joint American Sociological Association/National Science Foundation (ASA/NSF) Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline (FAD). Since its inception in 1987, FAD has provided small grants to encourage innovative research and support conferences that advance the state of knowledge within the discipline. More than 300 scholars have received funding through the program to date, and this award, together with a renewed funding commitment from the ASA, will continue the program for another three years. Proposals submitted to FAD are reviewed by an advisory committee of established scholars; about one quarter of the submitted applications is funded, with a maximum award of $8,000. Funds have been utilized by recipients to train research assistants, and defray the costs of original data collection, data transcription, and travel to archives.  Among recent FAD recipients,those receiving awards between 2009 and 2012?more than half published results from their supported project in a scholarly journal or book and 19 percent reported that their work had been cited in popular media. Spread over all recipients during the same period, every dollar spent on FAD awards generated $1.46 in additional funding from other sources; among the approximate one-third of FAD researchers whose awards led directly to additional research support, the average additional return was $4.76.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important purpose of the FAD program is to encourage successful applications on the part of younger scholars, those employed outside research universities, and researchers who are minorities and women. FAD provides guidance and mentoring to these scholars through a well-developed process, including developmental evaluations by prominent scholars in the discipline and mentoring opportunities. Additional broader impacts of FAD include substantial student training and learning; curriculum modification; building scholarly networks; contributions to sociological infrastructure; and policy impact and media attention. The scholarly, educational, and policy impacts of FAD projects far outweigh the cost of these small awards.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline (FAD) is a program jointly undertaken by the Sociology Program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the American Sociological Association (ASA) that has been in existence for more than 30 years.  The program has four purposes.  The primary intellectual purpose of this program is to support small, potentially groundbreaking sociological research projects and professional gatherings that have the potential to advance the discipline. Because the most innovative ideas often arise from sources outside the mainstream, the second purpose of the FAD program is to draw out and nurture the scientific and intellectual potential of researchers who might have difficulty securing funding from other sources, including early career sociologists and those not employed at major research universities.  A third goal of the program is to serve as a funding catalyst, helping awardees prove the value of their preliminary ideas and approaches and thereby attract subsequent support for their research agendas.  The fourth goal of the FAD program is to foster the development of new publications, educational resources, intellectual debates, and public conversations that challenge the discipline and stimulate new lines of scientific inquiry.   FAD grant recipients report numerous contributions, strong publication records, and subsequent funding success, providing solid evidence of the program?s success.  The contributions of these projects reported in a recent survey of grant recipients demonstrate both intellectual merit and broader impacts of the program. Nearly all (95.5 percent) of the FAD recipients surveyed reported presenting findings from their funded projects and 72.7 percent reported publications. The majority of publications reported were articles in peer-reviewed journals, followed by reports, book chapters and books. Just under half (45 percent) reported being cited by other scholars and over a quarter were cited in social and popular media, demonstrating the relevance and reach of these research areas.    One of the goals of the FAD program is to serve as a funding catalyst for cutting edge sociological research. When the additional funding secured by grant recipients is divided by total funding for "All Projects" awarded during the period examined in the follow up survey (including survey non-respondents), the additional funds secured by award recipients amounted to $2.78 per FAD award dollar. When only "Responding Projects" are included in the calculation, the figure is $4.70 per FAD dollar. Narrowing the analysis to only include "Projects Receiving Additional Funding" reveals that for each FAD dollar awarded to these projects another $11.08 of funding was generated.  The implications and applications of FAD projects extend across numerous facets of society.  Results from projects funded during the 2015-2017 grant cycle can inform business practices, including small loan providers and companies striving to understand consumer decision making in light of experiences of racial/ethnic microaggressions. They can provide insights to urban school districts seeking to attract racially and economically diverse families. Results also can inform government policies working to address challenges such as Zika and Ebola virus outbreaks.
