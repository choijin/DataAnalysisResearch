<AbstractNarration>This theoretical program will improve our understanding of the formation of large-scale structures in the universe such as galaxy clusters, and use this understanding to provide constraints on cosmological models derived from observational studies. Broader impacts of the work include training of a postdoctoral researcher, public lectures both for adults and in primary and middle schools, interviews in the media including those targeted to Hispanic audiences, and a lecture series at a senior citizen center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Zaldarriaga will develop a new theoretical and statistical framework combining two state-of-the-art techniques: analytical field theory methods that provide a theoretical foundation, and computational and statistical techniques that confront theory with observations in an efficient and statistically accurate way.  The work will be useful in the future interpretation of data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cosmology has gone through a revolution in the past decades thanks to the availability of new data that has allowed us to observe the Universe as it evolved to the present day.   In order to interpret these data and to understand what would be the best observations and measurements to make in order to clarify some of the many puzzles that still remain open in the field new theoretical tools need to be developed.  These are calculational tools, new ways to make predictions to make them more accurate or new ways to analyze data that are more efficient or can extract additional information.   This project help develop a number of new theoretical tools to predict how the structures we find in the Universe (such as galaxies and galaxy clusters) form and evolve and how these evolution depends on properties of the Universe we want to determine (expansion history, composition, etc.).  These tools were made available to the rest of the community. They were developed by postdoctoral scholars who were as a result trained in advanced analytical, numerical and statistical techniques.   In addition the PI was involved in outreach efforts. He has developed a cosmology course for senior citizens organized through the local senior citizen support center. The course is very well attended and has been going on for over 5 years.        Last Modified: 12/03/2018       Submitted by: Matias Zaldarriaga]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
