<AbstractNarration>Poison frogs (family Dendrobatidae) are well known for their bright colors and for the toxins (alkaloids) contained in their skin. In fact, some of the most powerful natural toxins known are found in dendrobatid frogs. Because these toxins interfere with the function of ion channels (proteins in cell membranes that control muscle contraction and sensory systems), predators exposed to poison frog alkaloids may experience numbness, slowed muscle response, or even respiratory failure at high doses. Predators of poison frogs learn to associate the frog's bright color with distastefulness and toxicity, and then avoid them as prey items. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is that poison frogs are not poisoned by their own toxins, and how could such a complex system evolve? One hypothesis is that genetic changes in ion channels within poison frogs prevent the adverse effects of alkaloids and thus prevent self-toxicity, and that this pre-adaptation enabled the evolution of the overall predatory defense system. This project will utilize new methods of DNA analysis and physiological tests of ion channel function in toxic and non-toxic poison frogs to reveal the evolutionary basis of toxin resistance in this group. In a broader context, this research will contribute to understanding the general effects of toxins and how resistance to these toxins can evolve. It will also strengthen international collaborations between scientists in Ecuador and the United States, and train several students in field and laboratory work.</AbstractNarration>

Many animals use chemicals to defend themselves from predators, including bumblebees, butterflies, coral snakes, frogs, and skunks. However, these animals face a difficult challenge: how can they be toxic but avoid poisoning themselves? The evolution of chemical defenses is complicated and often spurs numerous physiological changes as an organism adapts to high levels of toxin exposure. Early in this process, the organism must evolve resistance to self-intoxication, or autoresistance. This trait then allows an organism to develop higher levels of chemical defenses without harming itself. Our study aimed to investigate how poison frogs, a classic example of a chemically defended animal, resist their own defenses, and how the ability to resist auto-intoxication has influenced the evolution of chemical defenses in this group.</p> <p>Poison frogs acquire and accumulate alkaloids from small arthropods (mostly ants and mites) in their diet. These chemicals target specific proteins in the nervous system that control the flow of information within the brain and in sensory systems that the frogs use to perceive their environment. At high enough concentrations, these chemicals can be lethal; at low concentrations, they are distasteful. In either case, they can turn away predators from a potential tasty snack. We found that poison frogs resist their toxins through simple genetic changes in the target proteins of their toxins. Essentially, they are genetically modified to be insensitive to their own toxins. In most cases, the ability to resist toxins evolved at the same time as the ability to acquire toxins (Tarvin et al. 2016; Tarvin et al. 2017); this indicates that these traits are interconnected and evolve together.</p> <p>Autoresistance is really just the first step to evolving chemical defenses.
