<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project's broader/commercial impact is to create a shift of the national educational paradigm in education so students succeed and employers have a ready pool of highly skilled, math and science fluent employees; especially, students that can graduate career and college ready to fill and thrive in professional technical positions.  A primary focus of this project?s programming is to attract minorities, girls/women, students with disabilities and other underrepresented populations and to actively influence these populations toward educational attainment; especially in STEM skills. The project outcome will result in scalable technology/know-how that will impact the broad arena of education and will have sustaining economic, commercial and societal benefits to populations not being reached on a large scale currently. The commercial outcome of the proposed SBIR project leads to a marketable product and/or process that warrant significant NSF support. This SBIR project will create scalable technology and know-how that will impact a broad arena of education leading the way to practical solutions for both students and teachers in math and science skill enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to renovate the current educational model in instructional technology using innovative design to transform students' declining interest and proficiency in mathematics and science; cultivating a foundation for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) expertise in learners of all ages. The project will develop and deploy compelling educational technology that promotes student interest, skill and proficiency in mathematics and science. To achieve this, the developers will fabricate, deploy and commercialize hybrid experiential educational technology through instructional kits comprising developed apparatus, curricula and methodology.  Curricula will be focused on STEM-targeted activities and projects specifically designed for high interest, multi-sensory, hands-on student lessons.   Employing curriculum that is highly engaging using teaching strategies developed specifically for an alternative presentation of math and science instruction that is innovative, intensive, and integrated will be the primary objective of this SBIR project.  This project is designed to offer practical solutions to both students and teachers in math and science educational enhancement by providing learning tools applied to real world life skills. Embedded in the instructional technology are approaches for students to increase confidence, competence, and self-esteem especially for underserved and underrepresented students; increasing their college and career readiness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ AfterMath Education, Inc., a woman, minority owned company located in Albuquerque, NM, completed the SBIR Phase I in December 2014. As an educational enrichment company, AfterMathÆs major goals of the project were to prepare students to enter the technical work force and to ensure that United States (US) citizens are the most competitive to fill Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) careers now and in the future. These goals are the driving force behind AfterMathÆs educational methodology and technology.    The main objective of the AfterMath SBIR Phase I project was to improve the proof of concept technical design and demonstrate the effectiveness of the AfterMath I3E2 Kits (Interactive, Integrated, Innovative, Educational, Enriching) that are educational enrichment products for schools in the areas of mathematics, science, and readerÆs theater (reading skills development through performing arts). The Kits are designed to introduce students to science, technology, engineering, math and reading as a complement and supplement to traditional school curriculum. Included in the I3E2 Kits include teacher training, curriculum/activities, supplies/equipment, and quality assurance processes. When the Kit is implemented using the unique AfterMath-designed teaching methodology, students receive highly interactive and exciting lessons to help improve their math and reading abilities. This innovative method of teaching has changed the way teachers teach and how students learn critical skills required to succeed in school and to compete in the technical workforce.   AfterMath met or exceeded all of the Phase I SBIR program objectives.  The specific objectives outlined in the AfterMath Phase I proposal resulted in the following key outcomes:  Fabricated and implemented AfterMath prototype I3E2 Kits; educational enrichment products in math, science and readerÆs theater at two pilot test sites (See figure 1 in "Image" attachment for photo of an example of the AfterMath Kit). Expanded the commercialization of AfterMath educational enrichment products by conducting three professional development training workshops during Phase I. (See figure 2 in "Image" attachment  for professional development evaluations) Continued to develop and improve AfterMath prototype educational enrichment products by successfully upgrading the curriculum based on teacher, student and parent feedback/evaluations. Tested STEM- infused educational enrichment I3E2 Kits into schools at two pilot sites with positive feedback and results (See figure 3 and 4 in "Image" attachment  for photos of students participating in AfterMath programming). Based on the data collected from the pilot test sites using the I3E2 Kits, AfterMath upgraded website for commercialization and data storage. Collected and evaluated data from the two pilot test sites and developed a data management plan to measure quantitative results for the AfterMath I3E2 Kits utilized in future programming.   Since 2011, AfterMath products have touched over 1500 students and 100 teachers. Of those 1500 students, over 80% were classified as below the poverty line and from underrepresented cultures that are currently shortages in the US technical workforce. (See figure 5 in "Image" attachment  for AftermathÆs customer growth.) Based on program evaluations, results show students with increased competency and confidence in math, science, and reading as well as an awareness and desire to pursue STEM careers. (See figure 6 in "Image" attachment  for elementary and middle school student evaluations)  AfterMath has proven its impacts on education for students and teachers at the sites using AfterMath prototype products. AfterMath is now poised for broader commercialization and impact on student academic achievement in the US.  Education is a direct pathway to breaking the cycle of poverty and is critical to successful entry into technical careers.  The results of the I3E2 Kits implementation during the SB...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
