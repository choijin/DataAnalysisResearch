<AbstractNarration>This award supports the initial development of the US hub of Future Earth Secretariat. Future Earth seeks to harness the insights and capacity of the global scientific community, development professions, and stakeholders to address global scale problems. The Future Earth effort is based on the recognition that modern environmental problems cannot be solved by disciplinary science alone and rather requires the coordinated efforts of many disciplines working with stakeholders to meet today's societal challenges and to catalyze a transition to global sustainability. Future Earth seeks to advance a new way of doing science by directly emphasizing the co-design and co-production of knowledge with those who most need scientific information to make effective decisions to help manage a changing environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First and foremost the Future Earth Secretariat will serve the needs of stakeholders and scientists around the world.  The Future Earth program is organized around three major themes: Dynamic Planet; Global Development; and Transformations toward Sustainability. Under the auspices of these three themes, the Secretariat will support workshops and other efforts to foster the co-design of research to enhance transdisciplinary efforts to inform solutions and decision making. The secretariat will also develop programs and initiatives to educate the next generation of inter-disciplinary professionals on how to integrate global sustainability with human prosperity and will actively engage the public through an extensive communication and outreach effort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Future Earth - a global platform for support, integration, translation, and communication of global change research -  was established to  meet the complex challenges posed by the increasing pace of global environmental change by harnessing the capacity of the world?s research communities, creating links across disciplines, and engaging with a wide array of stakeholders to shape, support, and increase the impact of research.  The challenges that Future Earth was established to tackle - from changing resource and land use, to urbanization and climate change, are global in scope, but regionally variable in both social and environmental dimensions. To address these challenges, the Future Earth secretariat was established by 5 countries, with a mandate to create a global network of national, regional, and global support structures for global change research.    This NSF award, titled "Collaborative Research: Development of the U.S. Hub of the Future Earth Secretariat" (NSF ID 1450554), covered the development period of the U.S. Hub of Future Earth, allowing the US to join with Canada, Sweden, France and Japan to jointly establish the distributed secretariat for Future Earth. In the past 3 years, Future Earth has established national structures in over 20 countries, and regional partners, hubs and centers in Uruguay, Cyprus, Egypt, India, and Japan, with a southern Africa Regional Center opening in South Africa in the summer of 2018.  We have established 5 primary functions for the distributed secretariat, including Research Enabling (Led by the US Hub), Capacity Building (Led by the US Hub), Communications (Led by the Swedish and US  Hubs), Synthesis and Foresight ( Led by the Canadian and French Hubs), and Coordination (Led by the Canadian and Swedish Hubs).  As a part of these functions, the Future Earth secretariat  has provided support for 20 different core research projects associated with the previous Global Change Programs (IGBP, Diversitas and  IHDP), and worked with the communities associated with these projects to develop and incubate a set of Knowledge Action Networks serving to integrate researchers, practitioners and end-users around a core challenge (e.g. sustainable urbanization, ocean sustainability, and human and environmental health) and to align research production with knowledge needs of communities, nations, regions, and major international conventions such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, UNFCCC, CBD, UNCCD, and Habitat III.  The Colorado Hub of Future Earth has made major contributions in Research Enabling, Capacity Building, Communications, and Coordination. We have established an MOU between the partner universities hosting the hub (CSU and CU Boulder),  brought in over USD 2 million in external support for sustainability science, and built a diverse 8-person team focused on research enabling, capacity building, communications, and coordination. Major collaborative initiatives that the Colorado Global hub have led for Future Earth include 1) the Partnership for Resilience and Preparedness (PREP), a public-private partnership focused on providing global information and data sharing for communities coping with climate change, which launched in 2018 and is already being used in many countries; 2)   The World in 2050 project, a collaborative integrative modelling effort focused on mapping the pathways towards achieving the UN sustainable development goals; 3) a strategic partnership with START, allowing us to lead capacity building efforts for Future Earth; 4)  the Future Earth Open Network - a digital platform designed for catalyzing research and innovation focused on global sustainability that has over 6000 people working on it cvurrently; 5) Anthropocene Magazine, a general-interest magazine that captures the latest news and thinking in solution-oriented sustainability science and innovation, 6) the Program for Early-stage Grants Advancing Sustainability Science (PEGASuS), a major grants program funded through collaborative support from multiple private foundations, and 7) the Global Sustainability Scholars Program, launched in fall 2017, supporting undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields working on sustainability science with Belmont Forum Collaborative Research Action teams.
