<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Heritage University (HU), located in Toppenish, WA, will support the training of 30 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2017. The overall research theme of molecular biology involves 12 mentors from HU and five regional partner institutions. Students can select from projects that include 1) genomic studies on plants at the University of Washington, Seattle; 2) polyploidy in plant evolution at the University of Puget Sound, Tacoma; (3) insect molecular ecology at the USDA-ARS Lab, Wapato; 4) molecular plant pathology at Washington State University, Prosser; 5) plant genomics and biotechnology at Washington State University, Pullman; and 6) role of histone variants in chromatin structure and DNA barcoding of native plants at HU. The ten week research experience will include a one week workshop at HU that will train students on the scientific method, basic skills in molecular biology, keeping a laboratory notebook, data management in excel, and ethics/responsible conduct of research.  The overall strategy is to provide undergraduate students with a fulfilling and challenging research experience supported by a richly mentored environment. Students will be recruited at HU, Yakima Valley Community College and Columbia Community College, with emphasis on underrepresented students. These opportunities will provide students from the Yakima Valley area with career options that include pursuit of graduate degrees in STEM.  Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The program will be assessed by using the REU common assessment tool (SALG URSSA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting www.heritage.edu/REU , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Nina Barcenas at Barcenas_N@heritage.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Kazuhiro Sonoda at Sonoda_K@heritage.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The innovative year-long NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates at Heritage University (HU REU) has trained over 30 undergraduate students from Heritage University and its partner institutions Yakima Valley College (YVC), and Columbia Basin College (CBC).  In particular, approximately 21% of HU REU participants are from YVC or CBC.  Since 2015, HU REU has trained over 65% first generation undergraduates; 56% Hispanics from central Washington; 18% Native Indigenous students from Yakama Nation; 9.4% non-traditional first generation Hispanic undergraduates, and over 70% are female undergraduates.   Using an innovative culturally-responsive mentoring approach, our HU REU undergraduates have made important scientific contributions.  Since 2012, our HU REU undergraduates have contributed nine peer-reviewed publications in the field of genetics and molecular biology.  HU REU undergraduates also had opportunities to present their research a national conferences, such as the annual diversity conference Advancing Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Sciences (SACNAS). During pre and post REU phases, students are not only had opportunities to hear guest research talks on latest cutting-edge genomic tools, but also 43% of HU REU participants since 2015 wrote an original two-page specific aims section of a research proposal.  Finally, HU REU undergraduate researchers have demonstrated excellent gains in thinking like a scientist, critical thinking skills, and great research experiences at leading research labs across the state of Washington.  Since 2012, our HU REU participants have pursued STEM careers that significantly benefit the Yakima Valley area.  For example, HU REU students after receiving their bachelor's degree in STEM then enter into several career paths: enrollment into master's or doctorate program in STEM; science education in the Yakima Valley area; graduated from a STEM master's program; or entered into a lab technician analyst in STEM in the greater Yakima Valley.  Through our innovative year-long HU REU program, first generation underrepresented minority students have increased self-confidence, resiliency, and persistence in STEM fields, and will transform the greater Yakima Valley communities for future generations.
