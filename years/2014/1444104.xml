<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the proposed research is to establish a new collaboration between Dr. Aram Chung at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) from the US and Dr. Sunghoon Kwon at Seoul National University (SNU) in Korea for collaborative research on "Optofluidics".  The two research groups will develop a new manufacturing paradigm based on interactions between fluids and light, which is referred to as Optofluidic Manufacturing.  In short, Optofluidic Manufacturing is comprised of two coupled processes: (1) Inertial flow in a microchannel, and (2) Light activated polymerization.  The Chung group has a strong expertise in understanding inertial flow for flow cross sectional engineering (Step 1).  On the other hand, the Kwon group has pioneered the light activated polymerization process termed Optofluidic Maskless Lithography (OFML) (Step 2).  Therefore, two research groups with distinct and complementary disciplines in fluid mechanics (Dr. Chung) and photonics (Dr. Kwon) make an ideal collaborative relationship. This synergistic "Opto+fluidic" integration will open new scientific directions to solve complex unconventional problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex shaped particles can provide unique properties and additional functionalities that can be of great practical use for applications such as self-assembly, photonics, biotechnology, structural materials, and pharmaceutics.  However, it still remains challenging to fabricate large quantities of uniform 3D shaped particles with scalability, tunable geometries, and adjustable functionalities.  Optofluidic manufacturing proposed in this project has the ability to precisely control flow and light conditions, allowing for dynamic reconfiguration of the fabrication.  The process generates various scalable and tunable shaped particles using a single device with high-throughput and full automation.  Briefly, flow streams of photosensitive fluids in a microchannel are horizontally engineered via fluid inertia and then exposed to orthogonal patterned UV light, synthesizing complex 3D shaped particles.  The benefit of the proposed manufacturing system is its ability to be readily reconfigured.  In contrast, most of the current particle manufacturing systems have a lack of tunability for particle shape, but by modulating flow and light settings on-the-fly, arbitrary particle shapes can be generated in real-time.  Therefore, through this collaboration, full controls of fluid and light will be demonstrated, enabling a new paradigm of complex shaped particle generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported and helped initiate a new collaboration between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and Seoul National University (SNU) for collaborative research on "Optofluidics" through a planned visit in 2015.  Two institutes have worked together towards establishing a completely new manufacturing paradigm based on fluids and light, which we refer to as On-the-fly Optofluidic Manufacturing: Creating complex 3D shaped particles.  Briefly, on-the-fly optofluidic manufacturing comprises of two coupled processes: (1) Inertial flow shaping in a microchannel (lead by Prof. Chung at RPI), where at finite Reynolds numbers, sequential structures (e.g. pillars or columns) create lateral secondary flow motions that cause fluid twisting which is used to precisely engineer the flow cross section, and (2) Light activated polymerization (lead by Prof. Kwon at SNU), where "dynamically" changing patterned ultraviolet (UV) light triggers the fluid polymerization process.  Thus, a horizontal fluid twist formed by fluid inertia is exposed to orthogonal patterned UV light creating complex 3D shaped particles at the cross section with real-time particle shape changing capabilities.   Through the support, a deep understanding of inertial flow enabling flow cross sectional engineering has been made by successful modeling of inertial flow from finite element analysis.  Experimentally, inertial flow deformation in channel has been demonstrated, confirming the numerical expectations.  The on-the-fly light activated polymerization process via Optofluidic Maskless Lithography (OFML) has also been established, and a proof-of-concept of the project has been demonstrated successfully.  Moreover, the program has allowed for investigating new directions under Optofluidics through a continuing collaboration.  For the visit, a PhD graduate and an undergraduate student were recruited (both U.S. citizens). Considering the highly interdisciplinary nature of the research, this program trained students in fluids, optics, photonics, polymer chemistry and manufacturing.  It should be noted that while every year a large number of Korean students come to the U.S. for his or her higher education, less than 1.5% of U.S. students actually go to Korea (Larry Weber, EAPSI in UKC).  Although it was a short period of time, the program let US students to visit Korea, mitigating the imbalance.  The visit allowed students not only to learn how fluid mechanics and optics can be synergically combined through an international collaboration, but also tying two nations and institutes.  As a long-term outcome, the visit would play a great role in sending U.S. students (who participated or heard about this program) to Korea and recruiting top Korean students from SNU to RPI.
