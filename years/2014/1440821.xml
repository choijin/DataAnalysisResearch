<AbstractNarration>Broward County Public Schools will bring together researchers, teachers, administrators, and an evaluator to develop a research plan that examines how computational thinking skills taught with a rigorous computing curriculum will increase not only exposure to computing and engagement in school of students, especially girls and underrepresented minorities, but also their academic achievement in science and mathematics courses.  This planning project will adapt a structured computing curriculum to be integrated into the K-5 core curriculum in 14 diverse elementary schools and measure the effect of the interventions on achievement in literacy, mathematics and science. The planning project will develop plans for gathering longitudinal data as students matriculate to middle school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this planning project was to develop the foundation for a research proposal to integrate computer science into the elementary school day.  The result of this work was a National Science Foundation (NSF) Exploratory Integration STEM+C research grant proposal (Grant No. 1542842) which was awarded for approximately $1.25 million in September 2015.   This project brought researchers, teachers, administrators and an evaluator together to develop a research plan to examine how integration of computer science and computational thinking at diverse elementary schools affect student achievement (in literacy, mathematics, and science) and student attitudes towards computer science.   A cadre of twelve K &ndash; 5 teachers were selected and trained on computer science at the elementary level.  The cadre evaluated the feasibility of integrating computer science and STEM into modules. These modules were evaluated to determine a practical model for their use within the structured elementary school curriculum.  The planning team also began to investigate what structures and supports would be necessary to implement these modules in diverse classroom environments. The use of problem-based learning in the elementary classroom was evaluated by these teachers.

Select project participants also attended local and national meetings and conferences to meet with colleagues and experts in the field in order to gain insights, share and present work, and bring back relevant information to the committee.  The continuation of this work through NSF Award #1542842:  Investigating Conceptual Foundations for a Transdisciplinary Model Integrating Computer Science into the Elementary STEM Curriculum, will lead to the development of a model for integrating computer science at the elementary level.  This is crucial in order to ensure we are preparing students at the foundational level to be critical thinkers and problem solvers, thereby ensuring their success in 21st Century careers.
