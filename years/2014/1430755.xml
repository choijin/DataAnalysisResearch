<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the mobilization of toxic mining contaminants in the Lake Superior basin. The investigator will conduct archival research and oral-history interviews, and she will develop a geo-spatial database.  She plans to link her historical research with contemporary policy and regulation issues, and to engage with local communities, including Native Americans in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is a well-known environmental historian whose previous work has drawn on multiple disciplines and generated significant media interest; she has a network of contacts that includes a documentary filmmaker and relevant stakeholder groups. The project will produce a narrative of environmental history with the potential for overlap with important questions of technology, culture, and society. It will be of interest to citizen scientists, a wide-array of scholars, and the general public. The most important broader impact of the project is that it might very well influence contemporary policy and law-making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explores the complex relationships between pollution, mining waste, and the communities who live within those watersheds.  We use an enviro-tech lens to examine the ways that mining waste and the mining industry?s built infrastructures have polluted watersheds, undermining community and ecological resilience. Integrating methods from environmental history, industrial archeology, and spatial analysis have allowed us to explore the ways that spatial relationships between sites of production, sites of consumption, and sites of exposure influenced the understanding and regulation of toxicity.  The research tracks the development, expansion, and abandonment of iron mining across the Lake Superior Iron District moving from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan across Northern Wisconsin and into Northern Minnesota.  Drawing on archival materials, surveys, and the analysis of historic maps, aerial imagery, and remote sensing data, we ask:  What were the landscape-scale environmental impacts of historic mining in the Lake Superior District? What landscape transformations occurred as a result of shifting mining technologies? What effect has iron mining had on water quality? How has mine expansion and closure impacted communities and the environment? How are these environmental legacies retained on the landscape and in the discourse of heritage organizations?    To address these questions, we constructed an historical GIS(HGIS) documenting mining activity, tailings deposition, and water use in the iron ranges of Minnesota. We integrated over 11,000 item of archival source data, and then used this HGIS to illuminate how shifts in mining technology produced new forms of water pollution and new challenges for human communities, particularly Indigenous communities in the Lake Superior watershed. We then coupled these historic mining datasets with public datasets showing current impaired waters, producing a watershed-scale assessment of mining intensity over a 120 year period. We found that historic mine waste continues to have impacts on water quality.  Using archival materials, we then analyzed community conflicts and negotiations over mining waste, showing how past conflicts remain embedded in the landscape and in the communities. We argue that critical heritage discourse should interpret legacies of environmental pollution.  Research products include an ESRI Story Map website https://arcg.is/1jO1vK, over 25 scholarly and public presentations, a PhD dissertation, a book, two additional book chapters, and 4 peer-reviewed  journal articles. Public outreach activities include a public website http://www.sustaininglakesuperior.com/ , 8 community events, 5 radio interviews or podcasts, and a TedX talk.
