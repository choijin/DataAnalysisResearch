<AbstractNarration>The signal transduction events in the legume-rhizobial symbiosis not only involve two organisms of different kingdoms, but communication required to establish the symbiosis occurs between cells layers in tissues, between organs in the plant, and across time, from the induction of the first chemical responses within 6-12 hours to the establishment of nitrogen fixation in the nodules 10 days after inoculation. The result is differentiated bacteria living inside the cells of a plant organ that allows the bacteria to reproduce and fix nitrogen due to the provision of carbon skeletons and a low oxygen tension by the plant. While transcriptome profiling of whole roots during nodule development has expanded our knowledge of what genes are involved in initiating symbiosis, such experiments are unable to resolve the progression of events at the tissue/cellular level. In order to understand the signaling occurring between these cells in space and time in a coherent manner, it is necessary to analyze the transcriptome of the individual cells at specific points in time, as neighboring cells may have very different transcriptomes. The training components of this grant include training mid-career of the principal investigator (PI) in genomic techniques, training postdoctoral scholars and a graduate student in genomics and informatics through their participation in this research, training graduate students, postdocs and PIs from underserved groups in the summer workshop, and exposing underserved and economically disadvantaged middle school students to science and higher education through field trip lab experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transcriptomes will be measured for each cell type involved in nodule formation at specific time points tied to critical events during the progression of nodule development by use of laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by RNAseq and a systems biology analysis of the libraries.  The following questions will be addressed: What genes are differentially expressed relative to uninoculated plants in a given cell type at a given time? What genes show conserved patterns of differential expression from uninoculated plants over time within a cell type? Is there a synergistic effect of multiple genes showing small changes in expression but a conserved pattern? Which gene networks contain known nodule regulatory genes and therefore, by association, what do these genes control? What genes are misregulated in autoregulatory mutants at these early time points that allow too many nodules to develop? Applying time series analysis and systems biology tools, datasets will be created that will allow for these and other queries. Understanding gene regulation during the establishment of symbiosis is key to being able to recreate nitrogen-fixing symbioses in other plants, and understanding at the level of individual cells is required to generate a structure similar to a nodule.  The work proposed here will provide information about what genes are being differentially regulated in a specific cell type in the part of the root responding to rhizobia, about what genes are coordinately regulated within a cell type, and combined with published knowledge from mutant analyses, will yield information about which groups of coordinately regulated genes in which tissues are critical to early nodule development. The end result will be a spatiotemporal model greatly expanding our knowledge of nodulation signaling in roots and a data mining resource for the symbiosis community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Atmospheric nitrogen makes up over 70% of the air around us but is unavailable to living organisms until it is reduced ("fixed") by certain bacteria. Legume plants set up a symbiosis with some of these bacteria, supplying carbon from photosynthesis to the bacteria while the bacteria fix nitrogen from the air for the plant inside special plant root structures called nodules. Since legumes provide 33% of human nutrition in the world, this project contributed to understanding nodule development and the plant control of nodulation to benefit agricultural production, both in legumes and other plants. The communication required to establish the symbiosis between two widely different species occurs between cells layers in tissues, between organs inthe plant, and across a time span from hours to days. The result is bacteria living inside the cells of a plantand fixing nitrogen in exchange for carbon and a home.      To understand the signaling occurring between these cells in space and time we determined the genes expressed in individual cells, documenting the kinds of genes and the levels of expression of each gene for each cell type involved in nodule formation (epidermis, vasculature, inner and outer cortical cells) at specifictime points tied to critical events during the setting up of the symbiosis. This was done by using a technique (laser capture microdissection-LCM) which allows the manual isolation of individual cells from plant roots, followed by a technique called RNAseq to identify what genes are being expressed and at what level. Using computer algorithms and manual curation to model the data, we identified over 2000 genes that change expression in a root during the initial 3 days before a nodule can be seen by the naked eye and sorted them by pattern and cell type.  We identified genes that were specific to cell types, both over the course of time in the experiment and at specific points in time.  The creation of a data collection open to all scientists is an additional benefit of the work.    Intellectual Merit:  This work combined with previously published experiments expands the knowledge of nodulation signaling in roots. We have published several papers documenting our analysis and techniques throughout the proposal time frame and are continuing publication beyond the proposal life. This knowledge forms the foundation of understanding the molecular signaling required to generate a structure similar to a nodule and is the first steptoward establishing nitrogen fixing symbioses in crops that do not make nodules.  The resulting data sets can also be mined by other scientists for use in their own research.   Broader Impacts:  The results of the work contribute not only new knowledge, but to the data in the public domain.  The creation of a data collection of over 200 RNASeq libraries that can be used by other scientists to address other questions about genes of interest is an additional impact.  Three supported graduate students earned their doctorates and two female postdoctoral associates were trained.  Additionally, we trained 28 faculty, postdoctoral scholars and graduate students (the majority from underserved groups) in LCM/RNAseq andinformatics through a summer workshop, and almost 200 underserved and economically disadvantagedmiddle school students were introduced to DNA and genetics research through field trip lab experiences and in-classroom workshops over the course of the project.
