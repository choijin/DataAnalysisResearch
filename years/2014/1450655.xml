<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for US PhD students attending WAFR 2014 held in Istanbul, Turkey, from August 3 to August 5, 2014. The goal of the workshop is to highlight the research on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles. This gives an opportunity for the students to interact with senior faculty and get feedback on their work. One of the most important aspects of WAFR is its informal atmosphere, which allows a frank exchange of new, previously unpublished ideas; this is a critical component of graduate student development. In particular, WAFR has been an occasion for graduate students to meet and interact with more senior researchers who many times are not accessible to students at other major robotics conferences. The WAFR 2014 organizing committee will select participants and recipients of this travel support based on their contribution to the workshop. This award aims to have a diverse representation of participants in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
