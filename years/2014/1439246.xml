<AbstractNarration>Drought in the California Floristic Province has recently reached record-setting severity, with 2013 having the lowest precipitation ever recorded in a calendar year. The proposed study will test predictions about which plant species and plant communities are most vulnerable to severe droughts and which ones are more resistant to drought. This will be done by gathering new data from the sites of five previous studies across California. Each of these previous studies examined how water availability affected plant communities, using either experimental water additions, comparisons of wetter and drier years, or comparisons of geographic locations with differing amounts of rainfall.  Each of these studies provided evidence about which characteristics of plant species and communities make them more or less sensitive to water availability. Using the data collected in 2014, the same plant communities previously studied will be compared after versus before the drought, allowing this study to document which species and communities have changed the most in response to the drought.  Next, this study will test whether the changes seen after versus before the drought are consistent with predictions based on the five earlier studies. As one example of the expected results, it is predicted that species with small, thick leaves will decline less in abundance than species with broader and thinner leaves, because these characteristics were previously found to predict the sensitivity of plant species to water availability. This research is urgent because effects of the drought can only be quantified by intensive resampling of the five datasets in spring-summer 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will confirm or reject generalizable predictions about the attributes of terrestrial plant species and communities that render them more or less vulnerable to drought. Severe droughts are expected to worsen with climate change, and so this research may have great potential applications to prediction of plant community composition with climate change. Additionally, the research will involve a female postdoctoral researcher.  At the principal study location, the researchers will continue contributing to an outreach program that provides field science learning opportunities to &gt;500 K-12 students per year in an under-served area.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the consequences of extreme climatic events is a growing challenge in ecology.  Climatic extremes may differentially affect varying elements of biodiversity, and may not always produce ecological effects exceeding those of ænormalÆ climatic variation in space and time. We asked how the extreme drought years of 2013-2014 affected the cover, species richness, functional trait means, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of herbaceous (non-woody) plant communities across the California Floristic Province. We compared the directions and magnitudes of drought effects with expectations from four æpre-droughtÆ studies of variation in water availability: 1) a 5-year watering experiment, 2) monitoring of grasslands over 15 years of varying rainfall, 3) a resampling of historic (57-year-old) plots within a warming and drying region, and 4) natural variation in plant communities across California spanning a broad range in precipitation. We found that the drought caused reductions in cover and numbers of species, especially for annual plants, but did not reduce the functional trait diversity or phylogenetic (evolutionary) diversity of plant communities. Reductions in total plant cover and cover of exotic annual grasses were æextremeÆ in that they exceeded quantitative predictions based on the four pre-drought studies.  Among the four studies, the 15-year monitoring study produced effects that most closely matched the effects of the drought, although they were milder.  In summary, we found that some short-term ecological effects of the drought, though not all, substantially exceeded normal background variability.   While analyzing the effects of the drought, we also completed two studies with closely related aims, namely the 15-year grassland monitoring study and the 5-year watering experiment mentioned above.  In the monitoring study, we found that grassland plant community diversity has declined over the entire 15-year period, as native annual species with traits indicating low drought-tolerance have been lost, and these changes are strongly correlated with declines in midwinter precipitation, humidity, and cloud cover.  Diversity has declined less severely in plant communities on harsh, nutrient-poor serpentine soils than those on more fertile soils, however, in agreement with a range of other evidence suggesting lower sensitivity to climate in plants on infertile soils.  In the 5-year watering experiment, we found that this climate-insensitivity of serpentine plant communities had two causes: first, co-limitation of plant productivity by nutrients and water, so that water addition had little effect unless coupled with fertilization, and second, an absence of species with functional traits allowing fast growth when resources are abundant.  We conclude that an aridifying climate may cause widespread loss of diversity in plant communities, but also that infertile soils may offer a partial refuge from this decline.
