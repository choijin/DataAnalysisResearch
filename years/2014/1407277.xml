<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports a project directed towards experimental studies of fundamental optical and electronic properties of structures made of thin layers of semiconductors. A special design of the structures on a length scale of a billionth part of a meter allows the creation of new quasi-particles called indirect excitons. The indirect excitons are unique because they can be cooled down to ultralow temperatures. Furthermore, the indirect excitons are also unique because they can be electronically controlled like electrons in electronic devices and can shine optical signals that electrons cannot do by themselves. The project is directed towards increasing our understanding of the physics of ultracold indirect excitons. In particular it will address the transport and optical properties of the indirect excitons in high magnetic fields. The specific parameters of indirect excitons allow the realization of the high magnetic field regime in the lab. The understanding gained through this research may lead to the exciting possibility of developing advanced devices that make use of electronic as well as optical properties, i.e. optoelectronic devices. The students involved with this project have the opportunity to perform exploratory research on the cutting edge of contemporary physics. The potential impact of the project is in development of knowledge in condensed matter physics and increase of fundamental understanding of the optical and electronic properties of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports a project directed towards experimental studies of cold indirect excitons in coupled quantum well semiconductor structures. Indirect excitons are formed by electrons and holes confined in different quantum well layers. Due to their long lifetime, indirect excitons can cool below the temperature of quantum degeneracy. This gives an opportunity to study cold excitons. Due to their long lifetime, indirect excitons can travel over large distances before recombination. This gives an opportunity to study exciton transport. Furthermore, indirect excitons are dipoles and their energy can be controlled by voltage. This gives an opportunity to create a variety of potential landscapes for indirect excitons and use them as a tool for studying cold excitons ? cold composite bosons in materials. Studies include exciton transport and pattern formation in high magnetic fields. The specific parameters of indirect excitons allow the realization of the high magnetic field regime in the lab. The research is performed by students and is integrated with education. The potential impact of the project is in development of knowledge in condensed matter physics and increase of fundamental understanding of optical and electronic properties of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  The goal of the project was to study indirect excitons. An indirect exciton (IX) is a bound pair of an electron and a hole confined in spatially separated layers. The research results include the following:  - We observed fluctuations of the IX density wave and the commensurability effect - the fluctuation suppression when the number of wavelengths confined between defects is an integer. The commensurability effect is a collective phenomenon in quantum bosonic gases.  - We demonstrated experimental proof of principle for two-dimensional snowflake traps for IXs, collection of IXs from all directions to the trap center, and control of the trap potential by voltage.  - We developed and realized an excitonic device: a ramp that directs the transport of IXs down a potential energy gradient created by a perforated electrode. The device provides an experimental proof of principle for controlling IX transport with electrode density.  - We performed imaging spectroscopy measurements of IXs in ZnO/MgZnO wide single-quantum well structures, observed transport of IXs, and estimated the IX diffusion coefficient.  - We developed theory of IX condensation in a trap. The agreement between our theory and experiment indicates that IX condensation is adequately described by the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation of interacting bosons.  - We measured transport of cold bosons in high magnetic fields. The high magnetic field regime for bosons was realized with IXs in magnetic fields achievable in a lab. We found that increasing magnetic field slows down IX transport due to IX mass renormalization.     Broader of impacts:  IXs have long lifetimes and long spin relaxation times, can cool down to low temperatures well below the temperature of quantum degeneracy, can travel over large distances before recombination, and can be controlled by voltage. Due to these properties, IXs form a model system both for the studies of basic properties of quantum matter and for the development of novel optoelectronic devices.  Education: Five graduate students contributed to the studies of IXs within the project.       Last Modified: 09/25/2017       Submitted by: Leonid V Butov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
