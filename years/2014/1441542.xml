<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Development and Implementation (DIP) Projects build on proof-of-concept work that shows the possibilities of the proposed new type of learning technology, and PI teams build and refine a minimally-viable example of their proposed innovation that allows them to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and that allows them to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning. An important issue in education is helping learners understand scientific phenomena, especially those that are too small or large, fast or slow, dangerous or inconvenient to experience and manipulate first hand. A way of helping learners experience such phenomena is through modeling -- building a model of the phenomenon or process and then manipulating it to see what happens in different circumstances. Computer tools are available for creating such models, but model building, though very useful for learning, is a complex and difficult task for many learners.   In this team's Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Project, they developed what looks like a promising way to help middle school students learn to build computational models of scientific phenomena. They designed a visual language for expressing models and showed how progressing from less to more sophisticated models across several phenomena could help middle schoolers not only learn targeted science content but also learn how to design and build models and how to interpret and learn from models. In this follow-on project, they build on that approach, aiming to extend the technology to cover more sciences, automate some of the help teachers provide to students as they engage  in model building and interpretation, systematically study the challenges learners face in learning through model building and interpretation, and identify pedagogical approaches that will foster successful learning in these circumstances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to improve middle schoolers' computational thinking and scientific modeling capabilities in parallel with each other and in a way that prepares young learners for the computational sciences of the future. The PIs' earlier Cyberlearning EXP project explored the potential of using what is known about learning to be a computational thinker to guide sequencing of activities for fostering model-building and interpretation capabilities in science. The sequencing they proposed has middle schoolers building models of phenomena that they gradually make more sophisticated over the course of a science unit, then in the next unit, repeating that sequencing again, but with different content requiring more sophisticated or different modeling practices. They designed a language for model specification that they hoped would foster computational thinking and model-building capabilities. CTSIM, the software that supports the approach, is a visual programming platform for modeling scientific modeling that includes discipline-specific constructs, provides a scalable architecture that seamlessly weaves together  model construction, simulation, testing, experimentation, and verification, is usable across science domains, and connects to NetLogo, which runs the simulations. In this project, the team will extend the technology to cover more sciences, add adaptive scaffolding based on what they saw teachers providing to help students build and learn from models, identify pedagogical approaches for promoting learning from model building, and systematically study the challenges students face and how to address those challenges. Their research questions focus on students' abilities to simultaneously learn science content and computational thinking skills involved in modeling, the ins and outs of using linked representations, the kinds of feedback needed for scaffolding the approach, and scaling issues for teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    CTSiM (Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling) is an Open-Ended Learning Environment (OELE) developed at Vanderbilt University (see https://wp0.vanderbilt.edu/oele) that supports the synergistic learning of science and computational thinking (CT) concepts using a ?learning by modeling? approach. OELEs provide students with a learning goal, usually in the form of a complex problem (e.g., build a computational model of a rollercoaster car as it moves on a track), and a set of tools that support the problem-solving task (e.g., resource pages to help students learn domain content and computational thinking ideas; inquiry modules to help students experiment with models; a simplified visual model building interfaces, and tools to run and check the correctness of the simulation model being developed). In CTSiM, students build their simulation models using an agent-based, block-structured visual language and are provided with additional tools to help them test and verify their models. Students? learning and model building activities in CTSiM involve a mixture of five primary activities, and students can freely switch between them.  The five learning activities are  (1)  Viewing and acquiring information about domain content and CT-related concepts from hypertext resource libraries;  (2)  Constructing an abstract conceptual model of the science scenario using an agent-based framework (which defines the relevant properties and behaviors associated with the agents that operate in that environment);  (3)  Building computational models of agent behaviors using a block-structured visual language;  (4)  Executing their models to analyze the behaviors generated as NetLogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) simulations; and  (5)  Verifying the correctness of their models by comparing them to the behaviors generated by an expert model that runs synchronously with theirs.  The accompanying figures illustrate the CTSiM interfaces.  Learning Progression  The CTSiM system implements a learning progression that consists of an introductory training activity, i.e., drawing polygonal shapes to introduce students to computational modeling.  There are seven learning modules: :  (1)  Kinematics (modeling the motion of a rollercoaster),  (2)  Mechanics (modeling motion of racing cars with acceleration),  (3)  Vertical motion in mechanics (vertical trajectory of a rocket that burns fuel)  (4)  Momentum (modeling collision of  spheres),  (5)  Diffusion and dynamic equilibrium (particles in a liquid medium),  (6)  Macroscopic model in ecology (fish and aquatic plants in a fish tank), and  (7)  Microscopic model in ecology (bacteria in the fish tank).  Studies  We have conducted a number of studies with CTSiM in middle school classrooms, including pilot pull-out studies, in-classroom interventions, studies administered directly by the classroom teacher, and summer camp projects.  Pre- and post-tests result from all of these studies show that students have significant learning gains in the science content knowledge as well as CT skills. And the learning is synergistic. Working on grounded science models helps students understand the computational thinking concepts, such as the use of variables, conditional statements, and loops in a much clearer way. Building computational models of scientific phenomena help students gain a deeper understanding of science concepts and the laws that govern the behaviors of entities in different domains (e.g., physics and ecology).  We have studied difficulties that students face in synergistic learning during computational modeling of scientific phenomena, and have developed adaptive scaffolds in CTSiM to help students overcome these difficulties.  We have also combined the use of data-driven methods (such as understanding students learning behaviors by modeling their action sequences using sequence mining techniques and Hidden Markov models) and by combining model- (e.g., deriving analytic measures that define students learning behaviors and performance) and data-driven methods (e.g., sequence mining) to better understand students' learning behaviors, and developed additional scaffolding methods to help them overcome their ineffective behaviors (e.g., building a computational model using a trial-and-error method).
