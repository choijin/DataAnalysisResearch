<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Multiferroics represent an outstanding 21st century challenge toward next generation electronics, due to the exciting prospect of combining magnetism and electrical polarization in a single compound with true spin-charge coupling. Combining both properties is very exciting scientifically in terms of the devices that might ultimately be designed, in logic circuits or spintronics, furthering the quest for the ultimate memory device for computing. The challenge is to find new materials that can show spin-charge coupling of meaningful magnitude, closer to room temperature. This project applies an innovative green chemical synthetic technique developed by the researcher, Gel Collection, to the discovery of novel oxide compounds that exhibit multiferroic properties, synthetic multiferroic oxides. This project is experimental in nature, supported by scientific theory; new material discoveries may spark more theory. The project trains graduate students in materials chemistry and nanotechnology, through synthesis, structure characterization and in the measurement, interpretation and crossover of electricity and magnetism. Select undergraduate students in the chemistry program on-campus are also trained. The project promotes diversity and broadens participation of underrepresented groups in materials science, through a peer-learning program between the City College of New York and a local high school, both minority-serving institutions. The project includes an elementary school visitation program within the New York City public school system, with introductory exploratory kits in STEM aimed at grades K through 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Progress in multiferroics has been limited by physical restrictions on the co-existence of magnetic or electrical polarization vector fields in a single compound, and the magnitude of magnetoelectric coupling. Presently, there are real opportunities, theoretically and experimentally, for placing lower constraints on this coexistence. The impact of this research is the deployment of a low temperature chemical synthesis technique effective for making new materials that are multiferroic and/or high dielectric in nature. The project relies on a solution processing approach, based on precursor coordination chemistry, sol-gel and nanochemistry that offers routes to new complex oxides of previously unexplored compositions and stoichiometry. The procedure is considered green, due to the complete consumption of reactant precursors and use of non-toxic solvents, which are recycled. The project researchers prepare and characterize novel complex oxides, such as Ba-Ti-Mn-O hollandites, study the structure-property relationship through a combination of structural (X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, companion analytics), spectroscopic (Infra-red, Raman, X-ray photoelectron) and ferroic (impedance, magnetic, ferroelectric) characterization techniques. Seeking and detecting potential magnetoelectric coupling in novel multiferroic complex oxides is an underlying, long term challenge, with many important research and education goals along the way.</AbstractNarration>

The project, experimental in nature, followed underlying principles and theory that guide combining electronic, magnetic and dielectric properties in novel complex oxide materials. The materials chemistry approach challenged certain assumptions behind traditional ceramic processing and enabled the discovery and design of new nanomaterials of previously unexplored compositions and stoichiometry. Of particular focus was the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials in possession of multiferroic behavior, for both fundamental scientific interest and for their potential incorporation into electronic devices. Several classes of nanomaterials were prepared and fully characterized. These included [KNbO<sub>3</sub>]<sub>1-x</sub>[BaNi<sub>0.5</sub>Nb<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3-</sub><sub>d</sub>]<sub>x</sub>, Ba(Ti<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>, BaMn<sub>3-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>14+</sub><sub>d</sub>. In addition, novel nanoscale compounds were developed, based upon the element compositions of Ba-Ti-Nb-O and Ba-Ti-Eu-O.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the significant findings were the ability to prepare new nanoscale complex oxides that could combine magnetic and dielectric behavior. The studies showed that composition, size and structure could be controlled using the synthetic technique (Gel-Collection) which in turn permitted control over the properties. For the testing and analysis of dielectric devices, a nanocrystal-polymer composite platform was created, by which nanocomposites could be fabricated and their electrical properties analyzed. Through this process and for specific design cases, it was determined that the polymer-nanocrystal interface is highly relevant for the optimization of a fundamental parameter - the effective permittivity, <em>&epsilon;<sub>eff</sub></em>,<sub>&nbsp;</sub>- which determines how the material performs as a dielectric, for capacitors and other potential electronic devices. While the main thrust of the project was in electronics applications, the expansion of control parameters for the synthetic technique allowed for development of novel methods for surface coating and dispersion in aqueous media. This led to an in depth investigation into possibilities and opportunities for biomedical applications of perovskite oxide nanoparticles. Coated sub 10 nm barium titanate nanoparticles were tested for biocompatibilization and evaluated as Computed Tomography (CT) contrast agents, demonstrating a promising future avenue of inquiry.</p> <p>The project trained graduate students in materials chemistry and nanotechnology, through synthesis-structure projects that lead to the measurement and interpretation of behavior as it relates to electricity and magnetism. The students became experts in their research area, with mastery of a range of important laboratory materials science techniques, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cleanroom fabrication, impedance spectroscopy and magnetic characterization. Three graduate students successfully defended their PhD dissertations by 2020, while two more are set to graduate by 2021. Select undergraduate students were also engaged with the project, during term and over the summer.
