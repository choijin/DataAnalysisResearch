<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research and education that is aimed to develop new ways to use computers to model processes in materials, such as growth, that operate far from the steady balanced state of equilibrium, and to apply these methods to realistic materials problems. Non-equilibrium materials processes play an important role in the production of a variety of technologically important materials and devices, including the growth of semiconductor thin films, solar cells, thin-film based sensors, and materials for protection from radiation. This award provides support for the development of various methods to extend the time- and length-scales over which process like materials growth and defect formation can be simulated on computers, as well as to increase the accuracy of simulations of such non-equilibrium processes.  The PI will use these enhanced methods to study technologically relevant processes including the growth of semiconductor thin-films used in solar cells, metal polycrystalline thin-film growth, the nucleation of islands of materials in metal on semiconductor growth, and defect formation and healing of damage  in boron nitride nanostructures arising from exposure to electron radiation.  &lt;br/&gt;The development of improved methods for simulating non-equilibrium processes on computers over extended length- and time-scales is likely to have a significant impact on the realistic simulations of a broad variety of materials-related processes. This project contributes to developing a capability in the quest to design materials from the atoms up to obtain materials with desired properties, and contributes toward the success of the Materials Genome Initiative. Software developed in the course of this project will be made available to the broader community, contributing to the software cyberinfrastructure for the materials simulation community.  This project provides opportunities for educational and outreach activities with broad national, international, and societal impact.  In addition to the postdoctoral research associate and graduate students involved in this project, several undergraduates will participate through the Department of Physics and Astronomy's Research Experience for Undergraduates program.  Undergraduate students will also participate during the academic year.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research to develop methods to extend the speed and accuracy of temperature-accelerated dynamics (TAD) simulations.  These include the development of methods to improve the scaling of temperature-accelerated dynamics simulations with system size, a method to carry out on-the-fly kinetic Monte Carlo simulations by the use of local temperature-accelerated basin searches, a method to automatically store local configurations and processes during accelerated dynamics simulations in order to carry out kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with a large database, and the development of methods to efficiently identify, characterize, and exit local superbasins in order to deal with the 'small-barrier' problem. These methods will significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of accelerated dynamics simulations thus allowing realistic simulations of complex ordered and disordered systems over extended time- and length-scales. The developed methods will be used to study a variety of different materials processes which are relevant to semiconductor technology and photovoltaics. In particular, simulations of cadmium telluride thin-film growth will be carried out in order to understand the kinetics of defect formation as well as the dependence on growth conditions.  In order to study the early stages of polycrystalline metal on semiconductor growth, simulations of island nucleation and growth in silver on amorphous silicon will also be carried out.  The PI will use simulations to investigate glancing angle deposition with an aim to understand the effects of activated processes on surface morphology, grain size, microstructure and scaling behavior as a function of temperature.  Finally, in order to explore the potential for boron nitride nanostructured materials to serve as protective shields at high temperatures and in hazardous environments, simulations of the response of boron nitride nanostructures to electron irradiation will also be carried out.  The results of these simulations will be used to understand the mechanisms of defect formation and evolution as well as to explain a number of apparent discrepancies between energetics calculations and experiments.  &lt;br/&gt;Software developed in the course of this project will be made available to the broader community, contributing to the software cyberinfrastructure for the materials simulation community.  This project provides opportunities for educational and outreach activities with broad national, international, and societal impact.  In addition to the postdoctoral research associate and graduate students involved in this project, several undergraduates will participate through the Department of Physics and Astronomy's Research Experience for Undergraduates program.  Undergraduate students will also participate during the academic year.</AbstractNarration>

A postdoctoral research associate and four graduate students were also trained in giving research presentations and writing reports and scientific manuscripts. An undergraduate Physics major (member of a traditionally under-represented group) has been trained in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and scientific computation, as well as in giving research presentations and writing reports.  Another undergraduate (Research Experience for Undergraduates) student (Mikhael Semaan) won the 1st place Helen Quinn Award for Undergraduate Theory at the 2015 American Physical Society Far West Section Meeting for a talk he gave on work carried out as part of this project.  In addition, one graduate student (Ehsan Sabbar) completed his Ph.D.    Eleven peer-reviewed journal publications were either published or finalized during the period of this grant.  In addition, 3 invited talks and 9 contributed talks were given at international conferences, along with a seminar at Los Alamos National Laboratory.   As part of our research on improving the scaling of temperature accelerated dynamics (TAD) we have completed our benchmark study of the scaling of serial TAD simulations as a function of system-size.  We have also measured the scaling exponents corresponding to the computational cost for each component as a function of system-size N, and have found approximate agreement with theoretical predictions.  In order to improve the overall scaling of serial TAD, we have also developed a variety of methods which rely on the idea of localization, e.g. the idea that most events in the system are "local" and do not extend across the entire system for large system-sizes. Using these methods, we have shown that the scaling of each of these two components of TAD can be improved by a factor N, where N is the number of atoms in the system, thus significantly improving the overall scaling of serial TAD. We have also developed a general theory of island nucleation in the case of anomalous monomer diffusion. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for the case of reversible and irreversible island growth are in excellent agreement with our theory.  Our results for the case of anomalous monomer diffusion in d = 3, and 4 have also confirmed a number of predictions made in our previous work. Our temperature-accelerated dynamics (TAD) simulation results for the growth of Fe on vicinal (stepped) Cu(100) have, in addition to explaining the previously unexplained experimental results, also elucidated the very strong interplay between strain and chemical effects, as well as the competition between kinetics and thermodynamics in this system. A variety of interesting, and unexpected kinetic and multi-atom processes were also identified. Our results may also explain the unusual step morphologies observed in a number of other systems.

Our results also indicate that while the activation energy for such defects to form is quite large, the large entropy at the saddle-point leads to a prefactor which is more than 10 orders of magnitude larger than usual, thus allowing the transition to proceed. Our TAD simulation results for the growth of Cu on Ni(110) have allowed us to identify a number of key mechanisms for the intermixing process in the early stages of growth and also to explain the experimentally observed dependence of the embedding fraction on coverage at low coverage.  Our kinetic Monte Carlo results for the scaling of the minority and majority species as a function of the initial number of particles in a compact 3d region in two-species diffusion-annihilation have elucidated the asymptotic dependence of the scaling behavior for both minority and majority species on the initial number of particles as well as on the initial difference in the number of both species.
