<AbstractNarration>The FrameNet Project (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu) at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California, has been building a unique dictionary of everyday English words, which connects words with semantic frames, each representing a type of event or relation and the roles of people or objects that participate in it. For example, the Kinship frame includes the words 'nephew', 'mother-in-law', 'sibling', etc. and the Leadership frame includes both nouns like 'corporal', 'bishop', 'CEO', and 'headmaster' and verbs like 'lead', 'preside', and 'rule'. Since 1997, the FrameNet project has developed more than 1,100 such frames covering more than 12,700 word senses, and manually annotated almost 200,000 examples showing how these semantic roles fit into the grammar of the sentences. The database is freely available and is being downloaded daily for use around the world, in NLP applications like question answering and reasoning about the causes and effects of events.  &lt;br/&gt;Projects elsewhere are building FrameNet-style databases for many other languages, including Spanish, German, Japanese, Chinese, French, Brazilian Portuguese, Arabic, etc. These other projects have largely followed the English FrameNet example, using the same semantic frames and roles.  Their conclusion has been that roughly 80% of the lexical units in the target languages fit nicely into semantic frames that were originally defined for English.  But there has been no broad, systematic effort to align all these databases to produce a freely available unified multilingual frame semantic resource. This award is used to plan such an effort, to lay the groundwork for connecting all these FrameNets into one multilingual database, which will permit many new NLP applications, such as frame-based machine translation and recognizing when news accounts in two different languages are discussing the same event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this planning project, the investigators are planning how to go about aligning the separate FrameNets, based in part on the frame names (other FrameNets either use the English frame names or translations of them) and in part on quantitative measures of the similarity of frames, lexical units, and semantic roles.  The quantitative measures will exploit the networks created by frame-to-frame relations in each language, comparing not only individual frames, but also their neighbors in the network, their corresponding semantic roles, and the similarity of the fillers of corresponding roles across languages. In this way, correspondences will be established between the quite different syntactic constructions (valence patterns) in which these roles are realized across languages, similar to the methodology used in creating FrameNets in other languages by projection. &lt;br/&gt;The plan includes both face-to-face and virtual meetings to define community requirements and priorities and to gather researchers and developers' suggestions on alignment methods, application interfaces, etc.   As a result of this project, the investigators plan to prepare a comprehensive proposal to the CISE Research Infrastructure Program to actually create the multilingual database, guided by continuing consultation both with the teams developing the various FrameNets and with those who are already using FrameNet in research and practical applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to prepare for and submit a proposal for a creating a Computational Resource Infrastructure (CRI) by building a database for aligning existing lexical databases in various languages, as describe d below.   The FrameNet Project (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu) at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California is building a new kind of online dictionary for English that contains richer information about how words are used in sentences than any other dictionary.  In addition to definitions of each word, the FrameNet lexical database defines semantic frames, which group together  words with similar meanings; for example, there is a frame called Questioning which contains  words like ask, inquire, interrogate, question, inquiry, and interrogation. This frame also defines a set of  "roles" for people and things that participate in any questioning event, among them Speaker,  Addressee, and Message.  In addition to the frames, frame elements, and lexical units, the database also contains manually annotated examples of these words and how they are related to other parts of the sentence.  For example, one of the sentences for ask in the Questioning frame is annotated like this: [Speaker We] ASKED [Addressee Ruby] [Message what kind of food they ate.] The FrameNet database now comprises more than 1,000 such frames and more than 200,000 annotated examples. The frames ,  are linked to each other in a semantic hierarchy; Figure 1 shows a small portion of the hierarchy, with relations "Uses" and "Precedes" between frames related to Questioning. The FrameNet database has been downloaded thousands of times and is used around the world for Computational Linguistics research and for developing software for natural language processing (NLP).   Similar dictionaries have been created by projects in different countries for Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, Brazilian Portuguese, French, and other languages.  These other projects have based their work on English FrameNet, and have found that roughly 70-80% of the vocabulary fits frames that correspond to the English ones.  For example, one of the example sentences in Spanish FrameNet for preguntar in the Questioning frame is annotated like this:  [Speaker Algunas personas] [Addressee me] PREGUNTAN [Message que por qu&eacute; no voy a misa]. ('Some people ask me why I don't go to mass.'), in other words, with the same frame and role names as in the English sentence above. By aligning the databases  across all the languages, both at the frame level and the individual word level, computational linguists will be able to study the extent to which the FrameNet semantic frames are universal,  where they differ, and how these facts relate to frame differences in translations.  (Figure 2 shows an alignment at the frame level for the frame Arriving.)    As part of the preparation for writing the proposal, the FrameNet team  held a meeting for members of the computational linguistics community in Denver in May, 2015, where they were asked about whether the new database would be helpful to the community.  The participants agreed that aligning the databases will produce a valuable new resource for NLP research, machine translation, and cross-linguistic  applications such as information retrieval.  The full CRI proposal was submitted in January 2016 and funded in August 2016.        Last Modified: 09/02/2016       Submitted by: Collin Baker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
