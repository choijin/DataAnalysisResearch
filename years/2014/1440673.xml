<AbstractNarration>The project builds a full featured "scienceDMZ" that leverages the Old Dominion University's investment in operational high availability resources in the existing data centers routing and switching fabric, incorporates an enhanced and scalable High Performance Computing (HPC) model, and facilitates data intensive research while precluding the need for science projects to create their own stand alone environments. This high performance and high availability computing and networking environment accelerates scientific discovery by increasing the rate at which data can be transferred between collaborators, and by facilitating the creation of communities focused on the data. This project represents a significant shift in promoting and facilitating greater scientific research through collaboration by accommodating the needs of data driven discovery in Physics, Oceanography, Computer Science and Engineering, along with researchers from across campus. Three scientific domains are selected as first users to show the impact of the developed enhanced scientific research environment. The developed environment will have a broad impact on scientific discovery by being a common reliable infrastructure for scientists to host collaboration environments in support of their works. It is envisioned that this infrastructure could be more broadly utilized to accommodate further "Big Data" science in social sciences, biomedical research and public health. This project provides opportunities for enriching the undergraduate and graduate curricula and for exposing students to cutting-edge research in different science domains. Moreover, all of the designs, documentation, and developed tools are made available for other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

The primary objective in the creation of a Science DMZ is to develop a high performance and high availability computing and networking environment that provides an optimized solution for institutional and affiliated scientists for data-intensive research. This project included several activities including updating the initial design of CHARMED to include higher capacities routers and links, installation and deployment of CHARMED hardware into ODU campus infrastructure, testing and validation of the CHARMED infrastructure, tuning of the CHARMED infrastructure, and moving CHARMED infrastructure and components into production. CHARMED accommodates the needs of data-driven discovery in several fields such as Physics, Oceanography, Computer Science and Engineering, along with researchers from across campus utilizing ODU large-scale HPC cluster. CHARMED advances the state of the art by of campus networking infrastructure by integrating the science DMZ with HPC infrastructure resources that support collaborative and scientific research environments. As an evidence of the impact of the proposed enhanced scientific research infrastructure, CHARMED is utilized to advance the research needs in science projects requiring large-scale data transfer including data-driven discovery in Computer Science and simulation environments in Oceanography. Results show a significant increase in data transfer rate (up to 125%) when compared with data transfer using campus original network infrastructure. Several IT system administration members were involved in finalizing the design and purchasing CHARMED components. This helped in improving their skills and experiences with Science DMZ design and operation. In addition, several PhDs for last few months got involved in utilizing, understanding, and using this Science DMZ architecture. We shared our designs and documentation with other institutions to help them in replicating this effort and to enable a community to be built on the infrastructure itself. CHARMED will encourage researchers to utilize and exploit the HPC resources to their needs without the need to consider the physical infrastructure.

More broadly, others will easily duplicate the CHARMED infrastructure in the NSF community thus leveraging its value.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Tamer&nbsp;Nadeem</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
