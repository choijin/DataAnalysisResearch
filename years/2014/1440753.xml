<AbstractNarration>ASSISTments is a free, university-based platform created to perform controlled experiments  with the potential to help increase the quality, speed, and reliability of results related to K12 education. ASSISTments' mission is "to improve education through scientific research while not compromising student learning time." Each day, teachers assign problems to thousands of students (currently 50,000 students) in ASSISTments. These problem sets often contain controlled experiments. ASSISTments has used this platform to do controlled experiments that have resulted in 17 peer-reviewed publications. For a typical education researcher, developing relationships with schools is costly. ASSISTments has built relationships with teachers and researchers to run experiments to improve education without disrupting classrooms. This project will add researcher accounts to ASSISTments to better facilitate the research process. Researchers will create their own experiments, get approval from WPI for release to teachers, and get anonymized data. ASSISTments will reach out to its community of teachers who trust ASSISTments, to invite them to run the study in their classrooms.   The intellectual merit of this work will be the contribution of the studies that this system would support. ASSISTments' ten-year goal is to have a community of hundreds of scientists that use this tool to do their studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psychologists tend to study human learning in lab studies; researchers in education and learning sciences point out that it's not clear if those studies generalize to K12. These communities need to work together, but are lacking common ground.  Thousands of researchers in psychology, mathematics education, and learning sciences care about using science to better understand human learning. Some researchers study how to help students with motivational messages, spaced retesting, or comparing feedback. Many researchers have used thousands of psychology undergraduates as subjects, but want their ideas tested and validated in authentic K12 settings. Everyone understands physicists need a shared scientific instrument to do their work, but so do educational psychologists.  The broader impact of this work will be as a demonstration, showing how a tool could be built that helps many researchers conduct controlled experiments.  This will include showing how the project can increase the efficiency of the scientists? work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to provide the software infrastructure necessary for researchers in psychology, mathematics education, the learning sciences, and similar fields, to propose and conduct randomized controlled trials in real-world classrooms, leveraging the ASSISTments platform (www.assistments.org) and its user population.     An MIT meta-analysis of educational technology recently listed ASSISTments as one of only two promising online learning interventions in the country.  We also recently earned nearly $7M in grant funding to scale our efforts with teachers and students through an Effectiveness Trial and Replication Scale Up of our positive Efficacy Trial findings.  ASSISTments as a learning tool has remained powerfully impressive over the course of this grant.     As a tool for researchers, the ASSISTments TestBed has also grown considerably over the course of this grant period. Throughout the grant period we have been able to achieve steps toward our goals for a broader impact: improving upon the science behind personalized learning by laying the foundation necessary to make smarter educational software and demonstrating that online learning platforms can be used as shared scientific tools to help researchers conduct randomized controlled experiments.  After successfully leveraging ASSISTments for published academic research through the creation of the ASSISTments TestBed, we continue to advocate for similar ?research revolutions? from other platforms. We have facilitated the research process of numerous researchers, providing the capacity for research that is minimally invasive to learning in authentic classroom settings. Researchers proposed and created their studies, worked with the WPI team to get approval and release of their work, received anonymized data, and sought out publication independently or with the WPI team.     As this grant period nears completion, more than 100 studies are currently underway within the ASSISTments TestBed in various stages of completion, with nine publicaitons of note, two of which were conducted without connection to the WPI team.  The ASSISTments team will continue to work extensively with researchers using the TestBed to extend their research plans, to design supplemental studies within the TestBed, and perhaps most importantly, to use lessons learned during implementation to iteratively improve the TestBed?s infrastructure in response to the needs of our expanding community of users.  Improvements have been made to experimental design capabilities as well as the processes underlying study implementation and data reporting.      The current workflow underlying researchers? use of the ASSISTments TestBed has grown from its pilot form under this grant, but remains bulky, with bottlenecks requiring the WPI Team when the researcher has to build their study and when the researcher has to handle the large amount of resulting data. Due to the need for such support, the team at WPI has to intervene often. To address this issue and to sustain support for the TestBed, the team secured DIBBs funding ((Award #1724889, "CIF21 DIBBs: PD: Enhancing and Personalizing Educational Resources through Tools for Experimentation") to improve TestBed workflow in two phases (Building Studies and Data Reporting/Analytics) using lessons learned from the experiences of real researchers. This will help researchers reach publication faster, and will remove some of the issues that leave these tools feeling overwhelming or easy to neglect in favor of old methods.  Plans to regulate our analytics will also assist in these efforts, letting researchers know when studies have reached proper completion.      In addition to our original goals, from a data mining perspective we have learned that independent variables measured in certain studies can serve as long term covariates in data mining analyses and when looking across studies. Analyzing numerous studies simultaneously has opened new doors for the educational data mining community by pushing researchers to build models that better predict experimental effect sizes with the ultimate goal of personalizing learning.  Establishing this collaborative of researchers and their shared data has been a critical impact of our work.     We continue to believe that the ASSISTments TestBed can lower the stakes of educational research by reducing costs, promoting validated universal measures of achievement, and assisting researchers through the process of designing, implementing, and analyzing randomized controlled experiments within authentic educational environments. Our ten-year goal is to have a community of hundreds of scientists that will rely on this tool for their research.
