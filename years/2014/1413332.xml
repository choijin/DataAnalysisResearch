<AbstractNarration>The formation of planets around our own Sun and around other stars begins with dust-sized particles sticking together and gradually forming larger and larger objects. The stage of growth from pebble-sized objects to km-scale objects may follow one or more of several different routes, depending on the distance of the objects from the star and the age of the star. This project will experimentally study a broad range of collisions between pebble-sized clumps of dust, ice and rock to determine the conditions that lead to growth of larger objects. The results of these experiments will help resolve fundamental questions about a critical stage in planet formation, including the role that water ice and other biologically important molecules play in the sticking process. Many of the experiments will take place in a microgravity or free-fall environment in order to replicate the conditions in the early solar system. Video data of the collisions will be analyzed to understand the outcomes of similar collisions in the early stages of planet formation. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the experiments, and the video data will be shared through public websites, allowing the general public, students, and researchers to visualize this critical stage in the history of planetary systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity is an experimental exploration of low-energy collisions in the protoplanetary disk to better understand the collisional evolution of pebble-sized (cm-scale) aggregates and solids, the initial building blocks of planets. The experiments will extend the current database in parameter space by including icy particulates mixed in with silicates to study the accretion efficiency in the outer solar system (beyond the frost line where water vapor condensed) and by studying collisions between large-scale aggregates at modest impact speed both with and without ice particles in the aggregates. These pebbles may grow through pairwise collisional accretion or participate in local gravitational instabilities to form larger km-scale planetesimals. It is possible that some combination of these processes took place, depending on the local conditions in the protoplanetary nebula. A major source of uncertainty in the accretional growth model is the behavior of small objects and aggregates of dust colliding at the low speeds expected (~0.1 - 10 m/s). The proposed experiments would add much-needed data to these models to help determine the conditions under which accretional growth can produce planetesimals and the outcomes of collisions between pebbles in various nebular environments. The proposed work will involve a team of several undergraduate students and one graduate student in the design, operation, and interpretation of the experiments as well as publication of results. The experimental data consist of high speed videos that will be shared with K-12 educators and the broader research community through the public website microgravity.physics.ucf.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>One of the long-standing puzzles about the formation of planets is how the basic building blocks of planets, rocky and icy miniature worlds known as planetesimals, formed from the gas and dust that made up the original protoplanetary nebula. The nebula, a disk-shaped cloud of gas and small particles, is the birthplace of everything in the solar system.&nbsp;Small, dust-sized particles stick to each other easily due to electrostatic forces, the same forces that make dust stick to TV screens and allow insects to climb walls. Once objects are many kilometers in size, gravity allows them to stick together to eventually grow into planets. Bridging the gap from small clumps of dust (clumps about 1-2 cm across, or the size of a pebble, up to the kilometer-sized &ldquo;planetesimals&rdquo; is complicated by the gas in the nebula that blows the small particles into each other too fast for them to stick.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We carried out a series of experiments to study collisions between small objects in the protoplanetary nebula with water ice mixed in with the rocky materials that planets such as the Earth are made of. Water ice was present in the outer solar system as a solid, but was only a vapor in the inner solar system where temperatures were warmer due to closer proximity to the Sun. Water ice tends to be stickier at the molecular level than silicate minerals. Our experiments showed that the presence of water ice mixed in with rocky materials reduces the amount of ejecta produced in gentle impacts. This indicates that water ice can help form planetesimals (objects that today we know as asteroids and comets). In our experiments we only found sticking of particles, however, when collision velocities were very slow (less than a few centimeters per second).

This allowed us to study the outcomes of very gentle collisions without interference from the Earth&rsquo;s gravity. Undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Central Florida participated in all phases of this research. Mechanical, Aerospace, and Electrical Engineering students were trained on how to design and build experiment components. Undergraduates in science majors such as physics analyzed the video data, such as that shown in the figures, to determine how the outcomes of collisions depended on the initial conditions. Students participated in the writing of research papers and presentations of results at scientific conferences.
