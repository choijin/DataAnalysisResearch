<AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology is one of the premier technologies with vast potential and is progressively changing the frontiers of innovation to create novel applications that impact a broad range of application domains. Nano-research facilities have nanofabrication engineers who fabricate nanostructures for their novel research ideas, and most nanostructures are characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) imaging techniques that are prone to variability between different users, especially as the dimensions of the nanostructures are reduced. There are a few commercially available software solutions to automatically analyze and characterize images of nanostructures to identify magnetization states and fabrication defects, but they lack in providing a quantifiable feedback as to how well the designed fabrication layout meets the intended requirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed innovation: Software based analysis of Patterned Nanostructures (SPaN), is an automated, image based software suite that provides nanotechnology fabrication engineers the ability to automatically analyze and characterize microscopic images of nanostructures, thereby quickly identifying magnetization states and geometric shape defects for various applications that require patterned nanostructures with very specific geometry and spacing requirements.  The proposed software suite will have enhanced value in mass-production of nanoscale electronics and sensors applications. In addition, the proposed innovation will enable customers to analyze images for quality checks and defects in few minutes compared to a few days that an expert user may require to complete the same task. The software also enables users to perform rapid fabrication development iterations with progressively improved fabrication quality by providing relevant feedback on the fabrication quality.  This I-Corps team will investigate the viability of a proof-of-concept developed to support accurate patterned nanostructure fabrication following a desired base layout. While current state of the art only uses post-processing and enhanced image quality of post-fabrication characterization, this product SPaN will ensure a comparison with base pattern at a systemic level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This I-Corps award focused on early viability and pivot determination based on avid customer discovery. The subject innovation was a computer-implemented technique to dramatically reduce human involvement in design, analysis and characterization by translating structure/magnetic domain distributions into images.  The Software based analysis of Patterned Nanostructures (SPaN) requires minimal user interaction and provides an easy to use interface for fabrication engineers and researchers to automatically analyze and characterize various electron/atomic force microscope images of fabrication attempts to identify errors with respect to an initial fabrication layout design.  Core activities of I-Corps training (through lean launch-pad central) were   We participated in the      I-Corps experiential learning curriculum opportunity to help determine the      commercial readiness of SPaN software suite. Customer Discovery:  We      had to do around 100 customer      discoveries (around 15/week) to really understand value of the subject      innovation. In fact, right in the beginning, we had an initial      understanding of our software product.  Customer discovery really      alerted us on various new pain points of the users. Through the customer discovery      process, we were constantly assessing the minimum viable product      that addresses not just our innovation but also the pain-point of majority      of customer segments. We had weekly online      presentations through the curriculum, which focused on value      proposition, customer segments, channel economics, revenue stream, viable partners      and resources necessary. During the curriculum, we constantly      evaluated and pivot.  We have      pivoted once in the beginning of the I-Corps training and we had pivoted      twice after the initial training ended.       We are creating IPs and working to generate a better prototype      based on the customer discoveries. Current customer discovery is      about the need of emerging memory, computing entities which is      guiding our current prototype development with electrical analysis.   This proposal has tremendous impact on our research and innovation and was very educational to us in terms of lean start up process. Most importantly, it taught us the value of early pivot and innovation geared towards the need of users as opposed to individual strengths.  Beyond the initial training, we had to pivot two directions:  First, through the non-disclosure agreement with Consortiums (Sematech), we were initially planning to evaluate  SPaNÆs performance on SematechÆs industry benchmarks. Unfortunately, Sematech had a shift of plans and were no longer generating the datasets for us to test. We realized that without the SematchÆs help, it will be difficult to pursue SPaN for large  manufacturing companies.  Second pivot came from the mid-size Microscope Manufacturers (Hardware only). We were planning on gain trust by using benchmark performance on Sematech Data  to attract attention from the mid-sized scope manufacturers. This Plan had two obstacles (1) it is also reliant on our toolÆs performance on Sematech benchmark data and (2) additional customer discovery suggested that the hardware-only microscope manufacturers cater to a diverse set of defect characterization need that is hard to customize in one tool.  After the two pivots, team is continuing with research and development on emerging Memory/Computing.  We are creating and adding to existing IPÆs.   The first patent (US 9286687 B1) on SPaN, was awarded in 2015.  We filed a new patent (PCT/US15/32914) on utilizing magnetic defects as security primitive to enhance hardware security using magnetic memories. We have created a new method of creating an MRAM based a physically unclonable function (PUF), comprising of  (a) destabilizing the MTJ cell for a predetermined period of time; (b) releasing the MTJ cell after the destabilizing;  (c) reading a settling state of the MTJ c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
