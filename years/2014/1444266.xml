<AbstractNarration>With the baseline support provided by this grant, the Board on Science Education (BOSE) of the National Research Council (NRC) will coordinate a series of regular, structured meetings over the next five years between the leadership within the NSF Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) and the leadership of units within the NRC that focus on STEM education. These meetings will focus on emerging ideas or pressing issues in science education and science education research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematical Sciences Education Board of the NRC was disbanded in 2008. This project provides support to re-establish mathematics education expertise within BOSE, reflecting the growing importance of improved practice in mathematics education. A group of six experts in math education research will join regular BOSE meetings. With the inclusion of mathematics expertise this project provides the resources to pursue ideas and issues in a timely manner across the full spectrum of STEM. Providing evidence-based strategies to address deficiencies in science or STEM education is one of the major contributions of projects in the BOSE portfolio. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In connecting NRC/BOSE to NSF/EHR, their complementary missions form a context for developing a jointly designed agenda for both investing in research on STEM education and for integrating the findings obtained by the research community. Combining the discovery process supported by NSF and the reflective, interpretive, independent work that can be conveyed in NRC reports and through the convening power of BOSE will advance the relevance and applicability of the national STEM education research agenda in significant ways. This proposal will help to shape the focus of that agenda through greater collaboration and interaction between the networks established by BOSE and the expert advice gathered by NSF through its review panels, regular conferences involving its PIs, and the expertise of its program officers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the last 5-year grant were very productive. For examples, the reputation of BOSE for evidence-based, impartial guidance was instrumental in two recent projects that hold promise for transforming K-12 science education in the United States: A Framework for K-12 Science Education (the blueprint for the Next Generation Science Standards) and a two-report series on successful STEM education that lays out recommendations for improving STEM education and outlines a set of indicators that can be used to monitor progress toward these improvements: Successful K-12 STEM Education (2011), and Monitoring Successful K-12 STEM Education (2013).  The 2012 BOSE consensus report - Discipline Based Education Research (2012) - summarized findings from education and learning research in physics, astronomy, chemistry, geo-sciences, the biological sciences, and engineering.  It provided recommendations for improving the quality of undergraduate education in these fields that dovetail with major reform initiatives throughout the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) Board on Science Education (BOSE) was established in 2004 with five principal goals:  to provide national leadership in science education pre-K through adulthood within informal and formal settings (K-16); to improve the knowledge base for science education by charting the frontiers for research on science education; to identify critical issues in science education policy and practice and provide evidence-based strategies for addressing them; to narrow the gap between science education research and practice by translating research into evidence-based guidelines for practice and disseminating them; and to develop the intersection of science and science education by building an interdisciplinary community of scholars whose expertise can be brought to bear on current issues in research, policy and practice.    BOSE is composed of national experts drawn from the social, behavioral and natural sciences. Collectively, the board members have expertise in a variety of key areas related to science education such as teaching and learning in science, teacher education, state and national educational policy, assessment, research in the learning sciences, equity and access issues, and technology. The board’s commitment to thoughtful planning and critical analysis accounts for its strong reputation in various science education communities. The active engagement of board members, supported by professional NASEM staff, ensures that BOSE projects are well-designed and thoughtful in their scope and direction, and that projects are relevant to key stakeholder communities. BOSE’s reputation allows it to attract highly regarded experts and thought leaders to volunteer considerable time in service of "advising the nation" on issues of science and science education.  During its 15 year history, BOSE has become a recognized national leader in science/STEM education, expanding from an initial portfolio focused mainly on grades K-12 to one that includes studies of higher education and science learning in settings outside of school. Since its inception BOSE has received funding to complete 26 major research synthesis studies, hold numerous workshops and meetings, and actively communicate its findings to a broad audience. BOSE’s reputation for evidence-based, impartial guidance was instrumental in its recent role in K-12 science education reform in the United States; in its contribution to understanding the significance of informal and afterschool settings for lifelong STEM learning, and in a national effort to improve undergraduate STEM education.  BOSE provides evidence-based guidance for policy and practice that synthesizes across multiple lines of research. In addition, the board identifies areas where evidence is missing or weak thereby laying out the road map for future research. Through consensus studies and workshops, the board leverages NSF’s investments in research to draw out relevant guidance and communicate it to a broad audience. This work helps to bridge the gap between research and practice and identify the most pressing challenges for policy, practice and research.
