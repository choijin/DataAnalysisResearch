<AbstractNarration>For the Growing Opportunities in Technology and Engineering Careers (GO TEC) project, the project will award at least 10 scholarships annually to academically talented, financially needy students pursuing associate degrees in technology and engineering at Indian Hills Community College (IHCC). GO TEC will target eleven academic programs, including Agricultural/Biofuels Process Technology, Bioprocessing Laboratory Technology, Electrical and Renewable Energy Technology, Computer Software Development, and Engineering. In terms of broader impacts, important goals include increasing to 80% the proportion of GO TEC participants earning an associate's degree in one of the targeted programs, and increasing to 90% the proportion of GO TEC participants enrolling in further education or becoming employed after earning an associate's degree.  Diversity goals will seek to increase underrepresented minority student enrollment by 25% and female participation in the targeted programs by 20%.  The overarching outcome goal of the project will be to increase the number of students obtaining postsecondary degrees and pursuing careers in technology and engineering in rural southeast Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scholarship award, participants will receive comprehensive academic and personal support. These added support structures include faculty mentoring and participation in an active learning community through a series of STEM-related courses and activities for participants.  The project design takes into account research on successful scholarship programs and utilizes best practices such as establishing an active learning community for participants. Primary project activities include: recruiting and selecting academically promising students with financial need; linking participants to program-specific faculty mentors; providing a community of learning and support for participants through a required series of courses and activities for participants; and ensuring participants have the tools and resources needed to further their education or enter the workforce in a related field after graduation. The project team from numerous areas of the College includes faculty and staff who each play an integral role in ensuring the success of the project.</AbstractNarration>

During its formulation, the original outcomes for GO TEC were to:  Provide      scholarship awards to at least 10 financially needy, academically talented      students pursuing associate degrees in technology and engineering each      year; Increase      female student enrollment in the targeted programs by 20%; Increase      underrepresented minority student enrollment in the targeted programs by      25%; 80% of GO      TEC participants will earn an associate’s degree in one of the targeted      technology or engineering programs; and 90% of GO      TEC participants who earn an associate’s degree will be enrolled in      further education or employed in a related field within 12 months of      graduation.   The annual cohort was selected based on their:  Completion of a standardized test (e.g. SAT, ACT, ACCUPLACER), FAFSA,  college and GO TEC application; High school or college GPA of a 3.0 or higher; Selection and registration of a supported academic program; Demonstration of the most financial need.   The size of the ann  ual GO TEC cohort depended on the amount of rollover funds from the year previous and how many students were continuing their education into their sophomore year.  Once selected, students were tracked quarterly via their:  Capability to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA; Ability to schedule and keep meetings with their mentor each term; Completion of the required steminar courses; and Attendance to the annual summer trip.   If a GO TEC student did not meet the above criteria then they were put on academic probation the following quarter to provide them the opportunity to improve their performance. If no improvement was made their funds were terminated the second following quarter and the next applicant in-line  would be granted the opportunity to be a scholar.  At the completion of the program (August 2020) it was found that the program met the following outcomes:  58 unique students received financial support ($average: $8,675 per student) from the GO TEC scholarship program (Outcome 1);  In years 3-5 the number and percentage of grant funded underrepresented minority students met the growth per year target in selected programs for GO TEC (Outcome 3). 47 out of 58 students retained or graduated from Indian Hills with an Associate degree (Outcome 4); and 13 out of 42 non-current recipients transferred to a 4-year college and 31 out of 33 graduates received employment or transferred to a 4-year institution (Outcome 5).   The increase in female and underrepresented minority enrollment is a difficult task for both the GO TEC scholarship program and the institution to achieve. However, through such programs like GOTEC there is the opportunity to fill this gap.  Overall, GO TEC functioned as a model for the institution with regards to the mitigation of challenges commonly encountered by low income students and how to promote their academic success. As a result, it could be argued that this too played a role in the institution’s success rate and the promotion of the economic development in the state of Iowa.
