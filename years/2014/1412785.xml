<AbstractNarration>In collaborative research funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program, Chong Cheng of the State University at New York at Buffalo and Honggang Cui of John Hopkins University are developing new techniques for the controlled preparation of tiny nanometer-sized polymer cages. These small structures have enormous potential for the development of new methods to deliver drugs or other substances directly to tissues and cells. The research is focused on a specific type of nanometer-sized cage, or nanocage, that is crystalline but coated with a soap-like molecule known as a surfactant. The strategy is meant to stabilize the resulting surfaces and make it possible to more closely control the size of the resulting cages. The group is also carrying out systematic studies to investigate precisely how this stabilization occurs, in order to learn more about the molecular-level events involved. This will allow application of the results of this research to other systems. The work is having a broader impact on the development of new systems for the delivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents to precise locations in the body. It is having a further broad impact through the production of a series of videos that explain the work. These videos are being distributed via YouTube, helping to bring the results of this research to members of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the precise synthesis of polyelectrolyte nanocages via "crystal-forming" miniemulsions. A second aim of the study is to obtain a molecular level understanding of the stabilization mechanism in this template system. Systematic studies are being conducted to obtain crystallized miniemulsion nanodroplets with high surfactant efficiency and predetermined sizes. This is allowing the synthesis of a great diversity of nanocages with well-controlled dimensions and varying cross-linking densities via free-radical polymerization. The stabilization mechanism study is being performed to identify whether the surfactant monolayers are stabilized on the surface of crystallized miniemulsion nanodroplets through hydrophobic interaction or via co-crystallization of surfactant alkyl chains with oil molecules. This "crystal-forming" stabilization strategy may lead to a practical solution for the decades-long technical problem of dynamic instability of surfactant monolayers in various emulsion systems. Successful implementation of this project will lay the foundation for further optimization of monolayer systems with both enhanced stability and controlled dimensions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>This NSF project focused on the development of new techniques for well-controlled preparation of tiny polymeric nanometer-sized cages or capsules (NCs). With inner cavities, these NCs have promising application potentials, especially in biomedical field for delivering therapeutic agents to diseased organs and cells. The new techniques are based on miniemulsion, a special type of emulsion in which nanometer-sized oil droplets are stabilized by a soap-like molecule known as a surfactant. Because each surfactant molecule has both a water-soluble part and an oil-soluble part, these molecules form monolayers at water-oil interface of the miniemulsion oil droplets. In principle, cross-linking these molecules through chemical bonds to stabilize the surfactant monolayers can generate polymeric NCs. However, the stability of small molecule surfactants in miniemulsion (as well as other types of emulsions) is relatively low, because they may be quickly dissolved in the medium and then reassemble in monolayers; as a result, cross-linking of surfactant in conventional miniemulsion typically yields ill-defined products. A key innovation of this project is that, prior to cross-linking of the surfactant molecules in the monolayers, they are physically stabilized by converting the liquid miniemulsion oil nanodroplets to crystallized ones via cooling the system below the melting point (mp) of oil, thereby subsequently allowing precise preparation of NCs via cross-linking of surfactant monolayers and oil removal (Figure 1). The rationale for crystal-forming miniemulsion strategy is that surfactant molecules are more physically stable at liquid-solid than liquid-liquid interface, because of their enhanced adhesion with the crystallized oil phase.</span></p> <p><span>It is important to understand how surfactant structures can affect the crystal-forming miniemulsion strategy regarding the physical stabilization of surfactant molecules. In particular, because the adhesion of surfactant with oil phase is based on the affiliation of its oil-soluble chain with oil, the length of its oil-soluble chain can be critically important. A systematic study by using a series of acrylate-functionalized surfactants with varied oil-soluble chain lengths revealed that surfactants should have an oil-soluble chain with at least sixteen carbon atoms to result in crystal-forming miniemulsion with significantly stabilized surfactant monolayers to allow for precise synthesis of NCs at room temperature (Figure 2).</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, the structures of reactive groups in the water-soluble parts of surfactants have important effects on both the preparation of crystal-forming miniemulsions and the subsequent chemical reactions (Figure 3). Surfactants with different reactive groups (acrylate, allyl disulfide, norbornene, styrene, etc.) have been studied. It was found that, if the reactive groups (such as styrene) are poorly water-soluble, the corresponding surfactants are not suitable for the miniemulsion preparation. A variety of chemical reactions (i.e., radical polymerization, and thiol-ene coupling) have been successfully applied in cross-linking the surfactant monolayers of crystal-forming miniemulsions to generate well-controlled NCs. The influence of reactive groups on reaction efficiency has also been demonstrated.</span></p> <p><span>Based on the success in the well-controlled preparation of NCs with monolayer shell structures, research work was further expanded to explore the preparation of NCs with multilayer shell structures (Figure 4). Because the crystallized miniemulsion nanodroplets have high surface electric charge, they were chemically stabilized at their surfactant monolayers and then utilized as the sacrificial substrate for alternating deposition of macromolecules carrying opposite charges via a process known as layer-by-layer (LBL). As a result, multilayer NCs with well-controlled dimensions and structures were prepared, and their multilayers can be further cross-linked to enhance structural stability. As compared with typical LBL systems that produce micron-sized capsules with limited composition scope, the strategy may allow the preparation of even smaller capsules with broader composition scope. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This project has significant broader impacts. First, the low physical stability of surfactant molecules in emulsion systems is a decades-long technical challenge for template synthesis, and the crystal-forming stabilization strategy established in this project may provide a practical solution to address this challenge. Second, a variety of reactive surfactants with different structures have been prepared in this project, and they may be also useful for the preparation of other materials with significant application potentials. Moreover, during the NSF funding period, the principal investigator (PI) has worked to co-author a new edition of a classic textbook on polymer chemistry. The PI has also supervised students to prepare short YouTube videos on polymer basics for educational outreach (Figure 5), and to attend a "Science is Elementary" program to give monthly science educational classes in a local elementary school with most kids from educationally-underrepresented groups (Figure 6). </span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Chong&nbsp;Cheng</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412785/1412785_10335893_1543547331585_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412785/1412785_10335893_1543547331585_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412785/1412785_10335893_1543547331585_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic illustration of precise synthesis of monolayer NCs via crystal-forming miniemulsion</div> <div class="imageCredit">SUNY-Buffalo</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chong&nbsp;Cheng</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412785/1412785_10335893_1543547996162_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412785/1412785_10335893_1543547996162_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412785/1412785_10335893_1543547996162_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">a) Effect of oil-soluble chain length of surfactant on the preparation of NCs via crystal-forming miniemulsion;
