<AbstractNarration>All toads produce a class of toxins known as bufadienolides that have a lethal effect on cardiac muscle in most animals, making them inedible to the majority of species. Rhabdophis tigrinus is a Japanese snake that is resistant to those toxic compounds and stores, or sequesters, the toxins in its own tissues. This unusual adaptation provides this snake with a chemical defense against its own predators. Despite its evolved resistance to the bufadienolide toxins (BDs) of toads, preliminary evidence suggests that R. tigrinus experiences physiological consequences from BDs consumption, including increased heart rate. To date, no well-controlled study has demonstrated experimentally any definitive physiological effects of ingestion of toads by R. tigrinus. In collaboration with Dr. Akira Mori at Kyoto University in Japan, this research will determine the effect of toad toxins on a key measure of physiological performance, locomotor speed. Using a racetrack equipped with infrared timers, this study will measure locomotor speed before and after injection of BDs, along with examining cardiac function and metabolic rate in response to the injection of toad toxins in R. tigrinus.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Because there is evidence that R. tigrinus exhibits seasonal shifts in foraging associated with reproductive activity, this research will document the male reproductive cycle and seasonal changes in the size of the adrenal glands using preserved specimens in the collection of the Kyoto University Museum. Finally, reproductive and adrenal tissue samples will be collected for subsequent preparation and microscopic examination. These further studies will shed light on the physiological changes associated with toad eating. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The production of defensive chemical compounds is an adaptation that has arisen frequently throughout the living world. These toxins provide an evolutionary benefit for an organism by protecting their organism from predation by many other organisms. However, nearly as frequently as these toxins arise, predators develop resistance to these toxins, and sometimes they even evolve the ability to store the toxins they ingest from their prey and co-opt it for their own defense. One such predator is the Japanese snake Yamakagashi (<em>Rhabdophis tigrinus</em>) which feeds on both frogs and toads, but is able to sequester bufadienolide toxins from its toad prey. Bufadienolides inhibit the function of the cellular sodium pump (NA/K-ATP-ase) in cardiac tissue, causing tachycardia and eventually heart failure. <em>R. tigrinus</em> has evolved resistance to these toxins, however they do show some physiological costs to consuming these toad toxins, including increased heart rate. The laboratory of ethology at Kyoto University, under the guidance of Dr. Akira Mori, is the leading laboratory on research of this unique organismal system. My plan for the summer was to further examine the physiological costs associated with toad eating in this species. I attempted to determine if <em>R. tigrinus</em> exhibited a reduction in locomotor speed in reaction to ingestion of a bufadienolide. After designing and building my racetrack, I ran some snakes, only to have them not cooperate. Perhaps due to their sequestered toxins or even acclimation to the lab environment, the snakes did not run when placed on the track as I expected. Without a consistent response from my study organisms, I wasn&rsquo;t able to get a suitable baseline. In addition to the locomotor study I measured metabolic rate in these snakes before and after feeding on frogs. I did see a small increase in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production within 24 hours of feeding. Unfortunately I ran out of time before I could get metabolic rates in response to injection with a bufadienolide. This research opportunity provided me with a chance to become familiar with a unique biological system. In addition, I was able to foster relationships with a number of Japanese scientists with the hope of future collaboration.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/28/2015<br>      Modified by: Kevin&nbsp;A&nbsp;Moses</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
