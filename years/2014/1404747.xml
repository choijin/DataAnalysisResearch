<AbstractNarration>Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and they are the most abundant organisms on our planet. They are also sophisticated machines that exploit mechanics as vividly illustrated by bacteriophage T4 which injects its DNA into a host through an amazing protein machine. This research will answer fundamental questions regarding how the injection machinery works using novel computational modeling methods. The computational models will expose details of the entire, highly dynamic injection process by advancing modeling and simulation methods for longer time and space scales and with greater detail than current approaches. This research, which lies at the intersection of mechanical engineering, molecular biophysics and computational science, has direct implications to advances in nanotechnologies which aim to harness viral machinery for useful purposes for human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will combine continuum models and large scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to arrive at a multi-scale model that captures the dynamics of the T4 injection machinery. In particular, the multi-scale model will emerge from a novel coupling of local (atomistic) and global (continuum) representations of the major protein domains of the injection machinery, including the flexible sheath structure which powers injection, the central tail tube that penetrates the host (E. coli), and the modulating effects due to hydrodynamic forces on the viral capsid (head) and the interaction forces of the host on the tip of the tail tube.  Simulations based on this multi-scale model will reveal the biological time scale of injection, generate dynamical pathways for tail contraction, explain the stored energy mechanism driving injection, and predict the forces responsible for driving the tail into the host cell. Individually, these represent major contributions in understanding the science of virus infection at a mechanistic level. These contributions may also enable future advances in the use of viruses in nanotechnology applications ranging from gating, sensing, translocation, peptide display, and phage therapy. In addition, this project will positively impact the education of two doctoral students who will create the multi-scale model and a team of undergraduate students who will construct a working mechanical model of the T4 injection machinery.  The project will also engage the broader public by featuring results at scientific workshops, educating graduate students and postdocs in the Mathematical and Computational Biology Gateway Program at UC-Irvine, conducting engineering-themed lessons at Adams Academy in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and disseminating simulation results through the Computational Modeling Facility at UC-Irvine and to two partner institutions with large URM student populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Viruses are the most abundant organisms on our planet and yet we still don?t understand many aspects of their lifecycle. A very large category of viruses, called bacteriophages, infect bacteria and thus they offer an alternative way to treat viral infections aside from antibiotics. This projects contributes to our understanding of the life cycle of a large family of bacteriophages that infect bacteria through an amazing dynamic contractile tail.  The specific bacteriophage that serves as our model system is known as T4.  Despite a wealth of data on the atomic structure of T4, fundamental questions remain regarding how its contractile tail injection machinery works and what is its dynamic behavior. Our project fills that void by developing the first theoretical model that exposes the dynamics of the T4 injection machinery. Our approach employs a multi-scale model that spans atomistic to continuum scales.  Doing so yields a dynamic model of the fully assembled virus that is capable of simulating the dynamics of the entire injection process and on biologically relevant time scales.  The calculations reveal how the energy that is stored in the contractile tail powers the injection process and pushes the needle-like tail through the surface of the bacterial host cell.  This process is illustrated in the sequence of illustrations below which shows the virus anchored to (a small portion) of the host cell (Fig a) and the subsequent contraction of the tail (Figs b-d) which ultimately pushes the tip of the tail into the host (Fig d).  This process is driven by energy stored in the contractile tail (about 5500 kT) as shown in the graph below that also illustrates how this stored energy is then released as a function of time during injection. Importantly, the model predicts that tip of the tail twists as it is forced into the host and we believe that the combined, two-punch twisting and pushing action serves to effectively pierce the cell membrane. The model further predicts the dominant sources of energy dissipation that set the time scale of the injection process.  Overall, these are major findings as they represent the first ever predictions of the dynamics of the injection process.
