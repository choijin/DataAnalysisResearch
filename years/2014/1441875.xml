<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the organization of the National Science Foundation Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) Principal Investigators' Meeting, held in Arlington, VA, 5-7 January 2015.  The meeting brought together a broad group of researchers working on security and privacy including over 380 academic researchers, as well as participants from funding agencies and industry.  Nearly all of the materials from the meeting (including videos of the sessions) are available on a public website, https://www.usenix.org/conference/satcpi15. Additional supporting materials are available at http://www.rematchr.org/, and the source code used for supporting the meeting and arranging rapid-fire cross collaboration meetings is available under an open source license.  To foster new collaborations and interactions among people from different backgrounds and research areas, the meeting included a rapid-fire cross-collaborations session where participants were matched in groups of 2-4 researchers for a short discussion. To support this, the PIs developed software for analyzing the text in public NSF abstracts and arranging individual and small group meetings according to various criteria.  The meeting include 18 breakout groups, organized by the PI with help from the organizing committee and volunteer leaders.  Participants were assigned to a breakout group based on matching participants to their interests as well as ensuring an intellectually diverse group with a variety of backgrounds in each breakout session.
