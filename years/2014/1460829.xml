<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program of the Chemistry Division of NSF, Professor Mark Griep and colleagues at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will support ten students in a ten week summer research program each year for three years. The overall goals of this training program are two-fold: (1) teach and nurture interest in science by engaging undergraduate students in analyzing and solving complex problems, and (2) significantly impacting the career decisions of students in the program. This program provides research opportunities for undergraduates from under-represented groups as a critical step on the path to increasing the diversity and number of talented students entering the nation's chemical research programs. At least 60% of the REU students are female and/or from under-represented groups. Each student is paired with a graduate mentor, who gains experience in teaching others to do research. Upward Bound Math Science (UBMS) high school students from economically disadvantaged households learn to summarize REU students' projects and give oral presentations attended by the REU students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research opportunities in this program in are in the area of chemical assembly. This covers a range of projects extending from the controlled assembly of colloids onto surfaces, to the synthesis of assembled nanoscale catalysts, and to the directed modification of biomolecules. Students are involved in innovations in the areas of information technology, targeted medicines, energy storage, and others. Chemical assembly is also strongly aligned with environment-friendly technologies because fewer atoms are wasted during the manufacturing process.</AbstractNarration>
