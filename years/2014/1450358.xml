<AbstractNarration>Stochastic network models are mathematical descriptions of interconnected systems with randomly varying properties. These models provide a critical bridge between the powerful tools of mathematical network theory and the unpredictable real world. Stochastic networks have been used to model manufacturing systems, call centers, health care systems, and a wide variety of electronic communication systems, including the Internet, wireless and wireline networks, and sensor networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together mathematicians and applied researchers who share an interest in stochastic network models, and will highlight areas of greatest current activity, providing intellectual guidance to young researchers and to the larger community of applied probabilists. In particular, this workshop will connect mathematicians developing powerful abstract tools with the applications communities that can translate these tools into major improvements in real network performance. The supported activity will allow the organizers to broaden participation in the workshop by partially defraying travel costs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stochastic network models are the subject of a rich and varied mathematical theory, with a long tradition and a vibrant body of applications. This special workshop brought together mathematicians and applied researchers who share an interest in stochastic network models and highlighted areas of greatest current activity.   Stochastic networks have been used to model manufacturing systems, call centers, health care systems, and most notably, a wide variety of electronic communication systems, including the Internet, wireless and wireline networks, sensor networks, and ad hoc networks. There have been many important developments associated with stochastic networks in recent decades, specifically, semimartingale reflected Brownian motions (SRBMs) in polyhedral state spaces have enjoyed extensive study. Such diffusion processes arise as heavy traffic approximations for multiclass queueing networks, as well as more complex networks. Advances have also taken place in stability theory based on fluid limit models, fixed point theory for networks, large deviations theory for networks, self-similarity in networks, stochastic geometry of networks, gossip based information dissemination, and network information theory.  These topics are well represented in the recent work of the invited speakers. The workshop also included discussions in related areas, such as the  exciting new applications of stochastic networks in molecular biology. The workshop featured 12 invited talks and six poster presentations. See an attached image file for the workshop program and schedule. The slides of these talks are available on IMA website (https://www.ima.umn.edu/2014-2015/SW6.25-27.15). In addition to the presentation slides, there are 10 videos of presentations that are accessible from the website. These videos can be found by searching through "SW6.25-27.15" on the website.  More than 70 researchers around the world attended the workshop. They include participants from  Australia,  Canada, Israel, Hong Kong, Japan, Singpaore, Spain, UK, and US.
