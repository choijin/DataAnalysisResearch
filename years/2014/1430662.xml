<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to obtain funding for the seventh annual inter-Science of&lt;br/&gt;Learning Centers (iSLC) Conference entitled "Navigating the Future of the Science of Learning. This conference organized by students and postdoctoral fellows of the six Science of Learning Centers in the Science of Learning Centers (SLC) Program will be hosted by the NSF-funded Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center (PSLC) in March, 2014. The funds will be used to cover participants' costs of attending the conference, including conference registration, travel, per diem, and accommodations as well as use of facilities at Carnegie Mellon University. The 2014 Conference will build upon the previous Conferences by including cross-Center presentations in both symposia and methodology workshops. In addition, the conference will feature special programming to address its sub-goals of supporting intra-center collaboration, promoting inter-center collaboration, and improving collaboration with the broader community. To promote inter-center collaboration, members of the PSLC will present the Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) Framework, a theoretical taxonomy for categorizing and aligning knowledge, learning processes, and instructional principles.  This would be followed by a discussion of how each Center's research fits (or does not fit) into this framework, or how the KLI could be extended to be applicable to a wider range of studies. To improve collaboration with the broader community, the conference will include a workshop on how to design educational museum exhibits for children. This effort will culminate in an exhibit being designed and installed at the Pittsburgh Children's Museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The iSLC Conferences have been and continue to be vital to the education and training of the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who attend them, and to the emerging interdisciplinary Science of Learning field. Research discussions organized around selected themes will facilitate cross-center collaborations and expand the expertise-base of interdisciplinary researchers in the Science of Learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The Conference's focus on networking provides important community-building and access to diverse expertise that is essential for the sustainability of interdisciplinary training that the students/postdocs have experienced at their home SLC.  This annual event enables the trainees to learn from the experiences of their peers, while being exposed to new and alternative methodologies, paradigms, and tools used at the other SLCs. In addition, the Centers will benefit from the increased familiarity of their graduate students and postdocs with ongoing work at other SLCs and in other disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

Seventy-nine trainees             from across the six Science of Learning centers attended the             conference (see Figure 1). The conference, which was             entitled "Navigating the Future of the Science of Learning,"             had three goals: (1) to support intra-center collaboration,             (2) to promoting inter-center collaboration, and (3) to             improve collaboration with the broader community. To support             intra-center collaboration, there was an alumni panel that             focused on how to establish a Science of Learning community             at a company or institution. The panel also included a             discussion about networking and alumni experiences as new             professors and new industry professionals. To promote             inter-center collaboration, all participants delivered an             oral or poster presentation of their research. Additionally,             all participants read a paper on the             Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) Framework (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2012.01245.x" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2012.01245.x" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2012.01245.x</a>),             a theoretical taxonomy for categorizing and aligning             knowledge, learning processes, and instructional principles             published by the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center, took             a survey on how the research they do at their center fits             into the KLI framework, listened to a keynote presentation             on the framework, and then had a series of small group             discussions about how all of the centers' research fits into             this paradigm and how the paradigm might need to be             extended. Finally, to improve collaboration with the broader             community, we hosted a workshop on how to design educational             museum exhibits for children, which culminated in an exhibit             being designed and deployed at the Pittsburgh Children&rsquo;s             Museum. &nbsp;</div> <div>In summary, the conference had             multiple intellectual merits and broader impacts. First, the             conference gave center trainees the opportunity to share             their research with their peers from across the different             Science of Learning centers. Further, the conference             provided participants with training on how to establish             Science of Learning communities at their current and future             institutions. Finally, participants received training on how             to disseminate their work to the broader community through a             series of workshops with the Pittsburgh Children's Museum.             These kinds of opportunities will ultimately help to enrich             and expand the infrastructure for interdisciplinary research             in the Science of Learning. In addition to these broader             impacts, conference attendees also learned about the KLI             framework, which provided them with a broader taxonomy and             language for conceptualizing their research and for             discussing how their research connects with the research             being conducted at other centers. Further, all participants             took a survey on which types of knowledge (see Figure 2),             learning processes (see Figure 3), instructional approaches             (see Figure 4), and timescales (see Figure 5) that their             research focuses on.
