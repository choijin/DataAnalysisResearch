<AbstractNarration>This NSF fund is solely for support of student participants at the Workshop on Meteorological Sensitivity Analysis and Data Assimilation. The 75 expected participants will present, review, discuss, and evaluate works pertaining to atmospheric sensitivity analysis and data assimilation, but will include representation from oceanography and other fields that employ similar techniques. The fund will provide partial support for at least 8 students or postdocs who will attend. The workshop will be held at a fairly remote, self-contained facility at which all participants will share meals and evenings, providing many opportunities for dialogs with and between experts to make maximum use of our time.  Presentations will include a mix of tutorials on fundamentals, overview talks on recent paths of developments, posters or short seminars on new works, and some informal debates. The students will also have an opportunity to present their own works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the work is in extending the notion of model tuning to align it with the basic tenets of spatial verification. The framework will improve forecasts by allowing a user to tune the model parameters to have desirable spatial features.  The PIs have contributed to the development of the spatial techniques as well as to the sensitivity analysis methods suitable for this problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research are multi-pronged. The student involved in this project will become an expert in some of the most sophisticated topics in numerical prediction models: spatial verification, sensitivity analysis, and model tuning. This highly interdisciplinary framework itself has general applicability in that it can be employed to improve predictions from any numerical model involving inexact parameterizations of physical processes or inexact knowledge of physical constants, including weather, climate, ocean, etc.  Given that spatial verification is emerging as the verification method of choice for future forecasts, the method will have wide-spread use. The method will be disseminated in the form of journal articles, and computer code to be included in a verification R package produced by National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Workshop on Sensitivity Analysis and Data Assimilation in Meteorology was the 10th in a sequence of scientific meetings concerned primarily with the scientific and engineering problem of weather prediction.  These have especially concerned the problems of estimating current states of the weather given diverse and scant observations available in a short window of time and of determining what aspects of the present weather or its observations may be most important for improving forecast accuracy. Since many of the practical issues and mathematical techniques are similar to those for ocean prediction and even some engineering problems, a few attendees from those disciplines were also present.     The format of this workshop series is rather unique. Most open scientific meetings discourage public discourse by restricting the number of questions following each presentation to between 0 and 3, with no give-and-take exchange permitted. Large meetings are generally in urban areas providing many distractions and tending to scatter participants during meals and evenings, but the same is often true for smaller ones. In contrast, this open meeting explicitly states that its purpose is to allow the audience to hear what experts among them have to publically say about each presentation.  A means of scientific accountability is thereby encouraged. Also, it convenes at rather isolated, self-contained venues so that all participants dine and socialize together, thereby becoming better acquainted and providing more time for scientific exchange.  This particularly aids newcomers, notably students, who otherwise may be omitted from dispersing groups of senior researchers.  Some tutorials are also offered prior to the general sessions so that novices can become well versed in fundamentals taught by leading world experts in both theory and practice.  This latest workshop was convened 31 May &ndash; 5 June, 2015 at the Stonewall Resort and Conference Center in Roanoke, West Virginia. There were 63 participants, half from outside the United States.   Eight of the worldÆs operational numerical weather prediction centers were represented.  A pair of 2-hour tutorials presented on the day prior to the workshopÆs start was attended by 15 listeners. The workshop program, abstracts and presentations can be found at http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/events/adjoint_workshop-10/.  The workshop was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and European Geophysical Union. This support was entirely used to pay hotel and car rental expenses for some students and new post docs.  All other participants, including invited speakers, were expected to be sufficiently motivated to attend such that they would pay their own expenses.  For the same reason, all the supported participants were expected to obtain funds for their airfares from their own supervisors.  The quality of the presentations and venue were excellent.  Following almost every talk there were 8 or more questions with some give-and-take among the audience and speaker.  As explicitly instructed by the organizers, almost all presenters attempted to teach the audience about something they had learned rather than simply advertise what they had done.  Thus almost all presentations revealed enough information for the audience to follow and evaluate the work rather than effectively see only glitzy figures that, although artistically pleasant, are devoid of necessary content.  The works presented were generally highly technical and often mathematical. Except for a few as such, they would appear unintelligible to the general public. Nevertheless, since the subjects concerned weather analysis and prediction or related practical problems in oceanography or engineering, their implications were all implicitly of interest to the general public.    Three of the presentations were at the level members of the general public could understand. One concerned how neglect of scientific fundamentals could lead to continuing ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
