<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed work is to greatly improve our ability to understand and predict space weather hazards on society in the near-Earth environment.  Specifically, models of the impact of a coronal mass ejection originating from the sun as it interacts with the Earth's ionosphere and atmosphere and lithosphere will be generated.  Applications of this work include:  (1) protecting the electric power grid from blackouts caused by space weather; and (2) maintaining communication capabilities during space weather events. A 2008 National Academies report indicated that extreme space weather events, "though rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future."  However, it is clear that the re-occurrence of an 1859-magnitude space weather-driven geomagnetic storm could disrupt modern society to a much greater degree than in 1859 due to the proliferation of vital but vulnerable electrotechnologies (such as power grids and wireless communications).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology of the proposed work involves the application of detailed, high-resolution Maxwell's equations finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide developed by the PI over the past decade.  These three-dimensional (3-D) models will include such details as the Earth's topography, oceans, lithosphere composition, and ionosphere plasma (both small and large-scale structures).  Output data will be location-specific electromagnetic field data that will be used to improve our ability to maintain power grid operations and communications during space weather events.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Storms (coronal mass ejections or CMEs) can occur on the sun and project particles and magnetic fields towards the Earth, resulting in geomagnetic storms on Earth.  The largest documented geomagnetic storm resulting from a CME on the sun occurred in 1859.  That storm caused telegraph operators communicating over 100-km-long wire lines to experience electric shocks, some nearly fatal.  Further, business transactions requiring telegraphic exchanges were completely shut down in the worldÆs major capitals.   A 2008 National Academies report indicates that extreme space weather events, "though rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future."  However, a re-occurrence of an 1859-magnitude space weather storm could disrupt todayÆs society to a much greater degree than in 1859 due to the proliferation of vital but vulnerable electrotechnologies.  Interruptions to radio communications, commercial airline flight plans, satellite operations, transportation, banking, financial systems, home and industrial computer electronics, and electric power grids are just some examples.  The National Academies report estimates the overall economic cost of one such extreme event as ranging from millions to trillions of dollars, with a recovery time of 4 - 10 years. The goal of our project was to create an ultra high-resolution electrodynamics model that solves MaxwellÆs equations within the global Earth-ionosphere waveguide (within about +/- 100 km in altitude from the EarthÆs surface).  Specifically, our work advanced the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models created by the PI and her group over the past ~15 years.  These models include the global geometrical and material details of the ionosphere, topography / bathymetry, lithosphere, geomagnetic field, and disturbed ionospheric currents during space weather events.  Our application of interest was the effect of space weather on (1) the operation of electric power grids; and (2) electromagnetic wave propagation &lt; 5 kHz in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide.   Our team worked closely with Blue Waters staff to test the efficiency of our model on the Blue Waters supercomputer.  As a result of this interaction, we effectively implemented a new non-blocking means of communications between processors in a portion of the code that improved the speed of the model by 4%.    We also successfully ran the first global FDTD model of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide at resolutions of just 300 x 300 x 1000 meters globally (the previous resolution prior to the start of this project was 40 x 40 x 5 km).  No other existing analytical formulations or numerical approaches for studying space weather effects on the near-Earth environment and on electric power grids simultaneously solve the complete MaxwellÆs equations while also accounting for all of the 3-D geometrical details and realistic time variations as permitted by the PIÆs models running on Blue Waters.  The outcomes from this project in combination with future ongoing work may help individual power grid stations predict their specific vulnerability to space weather.  Since protective technologies are expensive to implement, our models may ultimately help station operators implement only those protections that are necessary for their location and predicted vulnerability level based on the underlying rock structure, their vicinity to ocean-continent boundaries, latitude position, etc.  Further, the outcomes from this project along with future ongoing work may help society maintain the use of technologies that rely heavily on global electromagnetic wave propagation during space weather events (e.g. communications and remote-sensing).   Finally, during this award, the PI was invited to participate as one of 20 international researchers in the NASA Living with a Star Working (LWS) Group Institute on Geomagnetically-Induced Currents, relating to space weather effects on the operation of power grids.  Through the two NASA LWS workshops, the PI was able to...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
