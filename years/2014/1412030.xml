<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical: These awards by the Macromolecular/Supramolecular/Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to Carnegie Mellon University (Lead), University of Pittsburgh (Non-lead) and Duke University (Non-lead) aim to develop new strategies to create self-assembling chemical structures that may, in the long term, perform information processing and chemical transformations associated with computation, sensing, and energy conversion.  In addition, these studies would enable the invention of new types of artificial machines that would function on the same scale as biological machinery.  At the present time, many of the key transformations and functionalities of interest are either very difficult to create or entirely inaccessible. The team will develop new strategies to teach beginning graduate courses that leverage scientific expertise across multiple institutions - thus enriching the excitement for- and content of- introductory courses, while lowering the cost per institution.  The team is also strongly engaged in outreach to K-12 students and educators, are actively involved in developing teaching and learning kits, and modules for K-12 students and teachers such as "DNAZone" and "Classroom Kit Lending Library".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: Artificial, supramolecular systems that perform complex chemical transformations with high efficiency are an important target of modern chemistry, with potential long-term applications in bioelectronics and biomedicine. This collaborative research program uses DNA and synthetic nucleic acids to program the self-assembly of structures in which electroactive groups based on metal ions and nanoparticles are organized with nanometer resolution.  The aim of the research is to determine rules for the construction of structures in which it is possible to separate charge on the tens of nanometers length scale. The students working on the project would gain expertise in synthesis, characterization, and theory and learn collaborative skills.  The investigators will develop and use an internet-assisted strategy for teaching small-to-medium-size introductory courses for graduate students on topics at boundaries among scientific disciplines at different institutions involved in this collaborative research. The team will be engaged in creating tools that K-12 educators can use to teach science concepts using examples from modern research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The NSF has funded collaborative work between the Achim group at Carnegie Mellon University, the Beratan group at Duke University, and the Waldeck group at the University of Pittsburgh.  The focus of the studies was charge transfer that is mediated by nucleic acid-based nanostructures. Charge transfer underpins the functioning of our modern electronic world and understanding how to control the flow of electrons at the molecular scale represents one of the great challenges of our time.     The studies in this project took advantage of our ability to compare the properties of DNA and the related molecules known as peptide nucleic acids (PNA), which are synthetic analogs of DNA.  Our studies have delineated the relationship between the charge transfer through both of these nucleic acids over a few nanometers (one billionth of a meter) on the one hand, and the chemical nature of the nucleic acid molecules on the other hand.  More specifically, we examined the influence of the nucleobase sequence on the transport, the role played by the chemical structure of the nucleic acid backbone (which is different for DNA and PNA), and the linker that connects the nucleic acid to the underlying electrodes.   The conclusions of these studies were that (1) PNA has a higher conductance than DNA likely due to its higher flexibility, (2) the electronic delocalization in carefully chosen DNA sequences can enhance the transport by introducing novel quantum effects, and (3) the attachment of the nucleic acid to the measuring device through the pi stack of the nucleobases facilitates faster charge transfer than linkers that connect to the nucleic acid backbone. Other significant outcomes include: (1) the successful attachment of gold nanoparticles to the PNA duplex structures; (2) the development of a new method to characterize single-molecule transport properties of nucleic acids; (3) the elucidation of a new mechanism to mediate seemingly spin-forbidden energy transfer via neutral excited states of the nucleic acid; and (4) the establishment of new design principles to place nucleic acid systems in the regime of coherent or incoherent transport. These design principles allow us to synthesize DNA sequences with designed charge transport characteristics.   The discoveries that were derived from this research fed upon the richness of the collaboration where theory motivated new experiments, experimental outcomes stimulated the development of new theories, and molecular synthesis, measurement, and simulation were all performed in a rich context of collaboration, ideal for training the next generation of scientists.   This research led to 16 peer-reviewed publications, the training of two high-school students, five undergraduate students, fifteen graduate students, and one post-doctoral associate, the design of novel methods to teach science courses via the internet, and STEM outreach work that involved several hundred K-12 students and several tens of science teachers over the last three years.
