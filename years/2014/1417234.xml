<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop a new Present Weather Sensor (PWS).  The impact of this project will be felt in the transportation sector where, annually, 1.4 million traffic accidents are caused by weather at an estimated cost to the nation of $42 billion. Knowing whether freezing rain or snow is present greatly influences how Departments of Transportation approach anti-icing, plowing, and road closure operations.  State budgets for road weather safety run in the tens of millions and an estimated ten dollars is saved for every dollar spent on improving weather systems. There is a federal push for improvements to the 2499 Roadside Weather Information Systems (RWISs) nationwide. Unfortunately, no existing Present Weather Sensor has the capacity to accurately assess precipitation type. The new PWS will offer a highly sophisticated and flexible instrument for determination of hydrometeor form that offers broad utility for improving transportation safety. Assuming widespread implementation of the new PWS in the RWIS network, the anticipated domestic market size is in excess of $10 million. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Present Weather Sensor devices are widely deployed by weather networks used by the scientific, weather monitoring, agricultural, communications, and transportation safety communities. A key capacity of any PWS is an ability to automatically distinguish hydrometeor types, including snow, rain, sleet, and hail.  However, PWS sensors are known to be unreliable, particularly around the freezing point where precipitation related damages tend to be greatest. Current PWS instruments only measure the attenuation of one or two radiation beams; in this case, questionable and fallible assumptions are required to obtain hydrometeor phase and form. For this Phase I project, new high-speed photographic imaging techniques will be used to quantitatively diagnose the quantity of liquid in hydrometeors, working on the basis that the presence of liquid is characterized by surface smoothness and differential visible/near-IR absorption. The result of this study will be a prototype PWS that can achieve on-the-fly diagnoses of hydrometeor size, shape, and phase.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Commercially available present weather sensors use a laser based system to view and classify precipitation type.   This type of system uses a laser positioned across a light detection sensor.  When a precipitation particle falls through the beam, it creates a shadow and scattering signature.  At or near the freezing point, precipitation can take the form of rain, hail, graupel, snow, mixed phase, etc. which can confuse laser based present weather sensors.  Therefore these present weather sensors are inaccurate at or near the freezing point, which creates the most dangerous driving conditions.      During this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project Fallgatter Technologies successfully developed and tested a vision based present weather sensor.  The Present Weather Imager (PWI) uses industrial grade cameras to view precipitation as it falls and does not get confused like laser based systems.   The first PWI prototype is capable of automatically capturing images of falling precipitation, measure fall-speed, automatically classify precipitation type at any temperature.     Annually in the United States alone, there are 1.4 million weather related traffic accidents at an estimated cost of $42 billion dollars.  Having the ability to accurately detect precipitation type is an important parameter used to access road conditions.  Having a better picture of what is happening on the road will assist snow removal efforts and improve driving alerts.  This will in turn decrease taxpayer spending, but more importantly, save lives.   More information can be found on the NSF discoveries webpage by searching "Road Safety through Snowflake Imaging".
