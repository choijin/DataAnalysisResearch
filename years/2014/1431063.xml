<AbstractNarration>Understanding how humans comprehend speech is an unsolved and challenging problem, in part because factors such as different speakers, dialects, and speaking rates introduce a great deal of temporal and spectral variability into the speech signal. The focus of this research is on the influence of temporal context on perception of segments, syllables, and words. Results of the research may offer insights into treatment of disorders that involve disruption of speech rate (e.g., dysarthria, stuttering, Parkinson's disease, and aphasia), inform approaches to improve speech technology applications (e.g., enhanced automatic speech recognition, more natural sounding computer-generated speech), and lead to new discoveries related to brain mechanisms involved in understanding spoken language. The investigators will also involve students in the research, including those from a primarily undergraduate institution collaborating on the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will test different accounts of temporal phenomena in the perception of speech. They propose two interacting cognitive mechanisms controlling phenomena at lexical and phonetic levels, each driven by a different neural timing mechanism. The hypothesis is that effects of lexical rate primarily stem from top-down, speech-specific temporal expectancies, while phonetic rate effects originate in bottom-up, transient rhythmic expectations that are not specific to speech. This hypothesis will be assessed using psychoacoustic studies, non-invasive measures of brain activity, and theoretical modeling in order to identify the processing characteristics revealed by neural representations of temporal properties of speech.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project addressed how human communication via spoken language succeeds in spite of tremendous ambiguity in the sound patterns of words. Pronunciations of words by talkers producing connected spoken messages are often not carefully articulated, nor is the acoustic information in many spoken words uniquely identifiable as a single intended word or meaning. It is a challenging scientific problem to understand how listeners can perceive the identity of an intended spoken word in spite of minimal acoustic evidence of the word?s presence, and in spite of blending of sounds across words and syllables. This project capitalized on a recent discovery that the timing and rate of information flow of context speech influences which words human listeners identify in nearby speech material, and whether some words are heard at all. That is, earlier research showed that the same acoustic chunk of audio information could be perceived as having different numbers of words, depending on the rate of speech information around that chunk.

Further, the neural and cognitive mechanisms at work in using context timing and rate cues in sentences to understand words are not the same ones which are involved in general perceptual-cognitive slowing under normal aging processes for older listeners (Heffner, Newman, Dilley, &amp; Idsardi, 2015). In addition, variation in timing and rate cues in context speech can only be used by listeners to perceive words in nearby speech when those timing and rate cues occur as part of intelligible speech material (Pitt, Szostak &amp; Dilley, 2016); critically, this suggested that language prediction processes in the brain must generate a set of possible sentence continuations, in order for subsequent timing information in speech to be meaningfully interpreted as words. We found evidence using recorded speech from a database of speech from talkers in Ohio, as well as from Neil Armstrong's communication from the moon in 1969, which supported a hypothesis that listeners collect statistical information on timing and rate information of words over their lifetimes and use these statistics as a source of information for understanding words (Baese-Berk et al., 2016).
