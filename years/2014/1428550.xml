<AbstractNarration>This exploratory research seeks to advance understanding of how research-based, highly innovative technology tools that support student learning can be implemented in schools in a sustainable way.  This is an important and basically unchartered area of research.  Both public and private agencies and business have invested significant sums in designing and testing technology systems and applications for education.   While exciting and potentially transformative, many of these innovative tools have not been successfully implemented, in part because of a lack of knowledge or theory about what is needed in the schools.   Different designs (e.g. whole unit, replacement units, tutoring systems, etc.) may require different levels of support.  There is very little research on what it takes to implement and sustain technology enhanced educational systems and products that lead to increased student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a series of case studies, this project will study what is needed to implement three very different types of  digital resources that can be implemented and sustained in schools.  The case studies will focus on technology difficulties, systems integration and pedagogical support.  The findings could have broad impact on the how educational technology is developed and implemented.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Learning performance in the U.S. has stagnated. Students lag far behind their international peers and gaps among black and Hispanic students are even more troublesome. Employers in the twenty-first century look for skills that are not being taught in classrooms, such as teamwork, problem solving, and communication.  The U.S. is not preparing its students for future challenges.      This NSF EAGER research examined best practices for the migration of well-vetted evidence-based instructional digital materials into classrooms. Progress in education technology is evident in new growth of platforms and tools and the existence of excellent instructional materials; however, their introduction into classrooms is happening very slowly and might be called dysfunctional at best. Many school stakeholders (teachers, principals, superintendents, and parents) can?t find effective digital resources, while large collections of resources exist online, waiting to be discovered.  We wrote a document for distribution in the public media that described several case studies of instructional software that were successfully shepherded into classrooms. No single template exists for how to move instructional software into classrooms. However, we identified several policies and strategies needed to create successful transitions. The article targeted entrepreneurs of instructional product and education stakeholders and described processes, resources, equipment, procedures and algorithms. One goal is to identify outstanding educational technology that delivers problem solving activities in several domains and also teaches "soft skills."     The Intellectual Merit of this research is to increase and substantially scale-up improved learning within and across the K12 sector and to increase teaching of 21st century skills including problem solving, analyzing data, communication, and teamwork. This research described the current state of research-based digital teaching and learning materials in K12. It distinguished between strongand typicaleducational technology, the former adapting software to students? learning needs, using educational theory and cognitive science and the latter producing a digital version of current classroom learning, including work-pages, text to read, videos of lectures and quizzes. This research took inventory of effective digital resources and described systems that reach thousands of classrooms. It identified several challenges that need to be addressed, including: the cost and effort required to produce digital instructional systems, lowinvestment by the US government in education research and the lack of uniform implementation of digital systems in classrooms.One goal is to identify outstanding educational technology that delivers problem solving activities in several domains and teaches "soft skills."
