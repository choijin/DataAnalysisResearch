<AbstractNarration>SES-1434160&lt;br/&gt;Javier Auyero&lt;br/&gt;Jacinto Cuvi Escobar&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The range of cities and countries bidding for mega events (e.g., the Olympics and the World Cup) has expanded over the last two decades to incorporate emerging economies like South Africa, Russia and Brazil. Among the reasons put forth by proponents of these tournaments are the possibility to fast-track development, generate employment, and incorporate excluded sectors of society. While the benefits of hosting such events are still debated, there is not a good understanding of their effects on the local, informal economies from which a majority of the population draws its income.  Previous work on the social impacts of sporting mega-events tends to treat disadvantaged groups as homogenous, despite evidence of both success stories and increased hardship.  These studies therefore do not account for divergent outcomes and trajectories within affected populations. Premising the study on field theory, this research will map the divisions among street vendors and analyze the dynamics leading to their success or demise during a mega sporting event.  This project expands on existing research about the social impact of mega events while challenging the notion that members of marginalized groups are all victims of exclusion.  The co-PI hypothesizes that street vending is divided into three subgroups: (1) leaders and members of street vendors unions, (2) non-unionized street vendors, and (3) unlicensed street vendors. Each of these groups controls specific assets. Among licensed street vendors, the research proposes that leaders and union members will benefit from government programs because of political connections. Among unlicensed street vendors -- where mobility is the main asset -- it is the youngest and highly mobile street vendors who will manage to avoid security checks and gain access to fans. Other peddlers should experience few gains and may suffer losses due to increased repression. The study will test the foregoing assumptions through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. First, the researcher will examine the design and implementation of the program to incorporate street vendors using key informant interviews. Concurrently, the co-PI will observe street selling around tourist hotspots and record the demographics of the licensed and unlicensed street vendors operating there. Finally, the researcher will administer a questionnaire survey and analyze existing survey data to assess the overall impact of the event on the income and working conditions of street vendors across town. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze the effects of a specific mega event, the 2014 soccer World Cup, on the livelihoods of street vendors in Brazil's largest city, São Paulo. In the run-up to the event, the government was faced with a wave of social protests along with mounting criticism that organizing the tournament was too costly and that its benefits did not reach the social groups most in need. Street vendors, in particular, were explicitly targeted in the General Law of the World Cup, which cracks down on informal commercial activity around the official events where tourists are concentrated. In response to such pressures, the city government of São Paulo designed a program to integrate a group of street vendors by granting them the right to sell official products. Who wins and who loses from government initiatives to integrate marginalized populations? Are mega events an opportunity for informal entrepreneurs to improve their lot? How can the benefits be spread more evenly among disadvantaged groups in the future?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide critical input to the planning of such events so as to ensure social inclusion and the sharing of economic benefits. To this end, the findings will be disseminated in forums and outlets within and beyond the academic world. The co-PI will draw on a wide network of local policymakers and civil society actors --including NGOs (non-governmental organizations) advocating for the rights of informal workers -- to share research results and conclusions. Research findings have the potential to inform policymaking for disadvantaged groups during mega events in the future.</AbstractNarration>
