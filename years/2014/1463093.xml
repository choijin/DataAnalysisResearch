<AbstractNarration>Dense urbanized areas are places where businesses thrive, but they are also increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters.  This project aims to quantify the effect of natural disasters, and specifically Hurricane Sandy, on the resilience and recovery of business establishments in a large and dense urban center, New York City. Our findings will inform financial planning and risk-assessment strategies for businesses, property owners, and government officials so that they can be better prepared against the threats of natural disasters and execute more effective recovery processes. The findings from our study will enable governments to better understand the economic costs of disasters, identify the most vulnerable businesses, and help bolster the resilience of those vulnerable businesses and enable them to recover more rapidly in the face of extreme events.  The results will also help local governments design and target more effective programs to support urban businesses and neighborhoods after disaster events.  Overall, our findings will not only help to improve the viability of individual businesses and properties damaged by disasters, but also to enhance the overall economic health of coastal cities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We will create a rich dataset on business activity, properties, neighborhoods and storm damage and use it to analyze the nature and degree of post-disaster resilience for businesses in New York City. We will examine whether or not resilience varies depending on the type and size of the business, the characteristics of the local neighborhood and the severity of the disaster?s damage. We will use various analytical techniques and research designs to better identify the direct impact of a natural disaster on the nature and duration of a business?s recovery and resilience.  We will also test to see if government aid either facilitates or hinders the business?s recovery by looking at the case of Business Recovery Zones in New York City.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The density that makes urban areas economically productive may also make them more vulnerable to damage in the face of climate change and the increasingly common extreme weather events that accompany it. In this project, we consider the localized economic impacts of one such event, Hurricane Sandy, on businesses in a dense and diverse economy, New York City.  We exploit the random variation in storm inundation across blocks in the city?s pre-determined evacuation zone to identify the impact of storm-induced flooding on the survival of commercial establishments, employment, and sales revenues. We contribute to disaster research by quantifying, at a small scale, the economic resilience of urban markets after an extreme event, like Sandy. Previous studies have looked at the macroeconomic impacts from extreme events, such as national productivity or cross-regional migration (Boustan et al. 2017; Ono 2015; Xiao and Nilawar 2013; Leiter et al. 2009).  However, the localized effects are less understood and can be highly uneven. Spatial variation in the potency of the natural disaster can contribute to wide variation in how urban neighborhoods within the same city experience such shocks.  Further, some types of economic activity are likely to be more vulnerable to hurricane-induced flooding than others. We hypothesized that retail businesses that serve a more localized consumer base will be most harmed by flooding risk; businesses that do not rely on foot traffic and serve broader markets will be less affected.  Our reasoning was that the risk for retail establishments is twofold: they may not only suffer physical damage from excessive flooding, but also risk losing local customers who are displaced by the storm and/or experience reductions in income.  Further, disruption in transportation networks and closure of nearby establishments may also reduce the number of visitors and workers in the neighborhood who might shop at local stores (Boarnet 1996).  Finally, smaller, independent retailers may face a heightened risk due to fewer resources and minimal or no insurance to cover damage and help in surviving a temporary (or extended) hit. To test these hypotheses we built a detailed longitudinal dataset of business activity.  We relied on a combination of several micro-datasets on establishments, employment, sales revenues and property characteristics in New York City, for intervals of time both before and after Hurricane Sandy.  We overlaid these data with spatial information on locally determined evacuation zones to capture pre-storm risk, as well as surge maps that show us exactly where, and to what height, the flood waters rose during the storm. Because the city government publicly identified blocks in the evacuation zone as those most at risk of hurricane damage and issued a mandatory evacuation order for these blocks prior to Sandy, we restricted our core sample to establishments within the evacuation zone. To identify the storm's impact, we relied on variation in water surge heights within the evacuation zone.  Results indicate that neighborhood economic losses from Sandy are significant and, in certain cases, persistent.  Consistent with theoretical expectations, losses are primarily concentrated among retail businesses, especially those that serve a more localized consumer base.  We find evidence of higher rates of business closures among retail establishments located on blocks that experienced high surge levels.  By contrast, non-retail establishments in high surge areas did not exhibit any changes in rates of closure than those located elsewhere in the evacuation zone. Furthermore, establishment closures are concentrated among smaller and standalone establishments.    We also find that the storm led to reductions in employment.  For retail establishments, jobs declined by 14 percent after Sandy on blocks that faced three feet or more of inundation. Non-retail businesses saw no significant job losses. Finally, retail businesses in areas with higher levels of inundation experienced a 9% decline in sales revenues after Sandy.  Sales declines were persistent, indicating little sign of recovery to pre-Sandy levels four years after the storm hit.   Estimates from our analysis have financial and risk-assessment implications for businesses located in dense urbanized areas, for property owners, and for government officials that deal in regional and urban economic development and disaster preparedness.  Given the growing risk of climate-related threats, and their increasing presence in dense urbanized areas, our results indicate that cities should invest in both mitigation and recovery strategies that are localized and tailored to the type of businesses at risk.
