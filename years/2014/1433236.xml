<AbstractNarration>Proposal 1433236  Chief Scientist Training Cruise &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests $89,397 to conduct a short cruise aboard R/V Hugh Sharp  with the principle aim of training early career oceanographers to conduct research cruises.  A cruise will be scheduled, that consist of a 7-day cruise immediately preceded by two days of informational&lt;br/&gt;presentations, facilities tours, and cruise mobilization and one day of post cruise critique and&lt;br/&gt;demobilization. This proposal?s PIs, Dr. Mark Moline and William M. Byam (Director of Marine&lt;br/&gt;Operations), University of Delaware Marine staff and guest speakers will take part as presenters&lt;br/&gt;at the information sessions. On the cruise, up to 12 participants and 2 instructors (Senior&lt;br/&gt;Scientists) as well as the ship?s Marine Technicians and crew will work together to accomplish&lt;br/&gt;science objectives.  &lt;br/&gt;The need to improve the skills of early career scientists has been recognized by UNOLS as well as Program for several years.  Previous similar activities conducted on the West and East Coast under Clare Reimers were highly successful, and this effort would build on those experiences.  Udel proposes a series of UNOLS Chief Scientist Training Cruises to provide opportunities&lt;br/&gt;for teaching early career marine scientists how to effectively plan for, acquire, utilize&lt;br/&gt;and report on, time at sea for multi-disciplinary research projects and education. These&lt;br/&gt;cruises, to be held on the R/V Hugh Sharp in 2014, they will also offer new investigators&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to test preliminary or unfamiliar research methods, work collaboratively,&lt;br/&gt;with others and acquire samples and experience critical for developing future&lt;br/&gt;oceanographic programs for both research and education. Because berthing is limited&lt;br/&gt;on R/V Sharp, the plan is to run three short cruises and a series of day cruises. This&lt;br/&gt;approach will allow for a large number of participants, but will also provide&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for several participants to lead a cruise.&lt;br/&gt;The funding for the cruise is modest.&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this activity will be the results from the expedition to a scientifically important and interesting area.  The activity is not just a "look and see", but rather "learning from doing" real science.  The proposals lays out a very organized and proven time table for meeting the objectives. &lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the activity are the majority focus.  Training the next generation of sea-going scientists is essential to maintaining effective US oceanography.  It is particularly important at this juncture as the Academic Research Fleet downsizes and modernizes.  This consideration, as well as advancement in technology to support field work, mandates that new users become familiar with capabilities that are rapidly evolving.  This is one reason behind shifting the paradigm from learning through osmosis from seasoned veterans to actively participating in modern oceanography.  The experiences of the previous generation are rapidly becoming less relevant to the careers of the up-and-coming scientists of tomorrow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project successfully completed the objective of providing training for early career scientist in how to prepare for, receive funding, and lead a science party on board a research vessel at sea.  This project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with additional funding for the seven days at sea coming from NSF and the Office of Naval Research through their ship operations grants.    A team of University of Delaware faculty and staff developed the agenda and cruise plan, and led the coaching and instruction of the participants.  Representatives from NSF and the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) participated in the workshop and provided in depth information about research grant and ship time request submissions and award processes.  Experienced University Chief Scientists and Marine Operations personnel provided instruction and experiences with effective planning and leading of research projects at sea.  Nine participants were selected after a call for applications was posted on the UNOLS web site.   A secondary focus of the project was the use of robotic and autonomous platforms at sea.  These systems enhance the data acquisition capability of research vessels; however require special considerations in mission planning, deployment, monitoring and communications.   Participants were encouraged to bring systems they would use on future projects.  A variety of equipment including wave gliders, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, Remotely Operated Vehicles, and a multibeam sonar were key instruments used during the cruise.  The shipÆs CTD and Surface Mapping System were also utilized.  The broader impacts of this project will be evident in the careers and research work of the participants over the next decades.  This unique, coaching intensive experience provided knowledge and handÆs on skill development that gives the participants greater ability to propose and execute science projects at sea that will enhance overall knowledge and address issues of national significance.  Ship time for research projects is expensive and must be fully taken advantage of when the opportunity arises.  These nine early career scientists are equipped to maximize the scientific opportunity and make efficient use of future projects funded through the merit system.  An article and video highlighting the cruise can be found on the University of Delaware UDaily site:  http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2016/dec/sea-science-120815.html             Last Modified: 02/12/2016       Submitted by: Jon Swallow]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
