<AbstractNarration>This renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Colorado School of Mines (CSM) offers unique interdisciplinary research experiences especially related to cutting edge technologies like fuel cells, solar materials, sustainability, and health care to highly qualified chemistry and chemical engineering students from diverse backgrounds. Polymer materials improve the daily lives of nearly every person in the United States. At the end of the 20th century, many mass-produced items, like car bumpers, started to be made with polymers due to combining good mechanical properties with being lightweight and cost effective. Technological innovation in the 21st century will also leverage polymer materials in the areas of renewable energy, sustainability, and medicine. Introducing undergraduate research experiences such as this will train our future human resources and help drive the plastic and polymer industry toward more advanced technology, innovative products, and efficient processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in a 10-week summer research experience on cutting-edge projects integrating polymer science and engineering, using state-of-the-art methods, which reinforce and strengthen their classroom knowledge and encourage pursuit of graduate education. This will be achieved through integration of chemistry and chemical engineering. Unique aspects of this program include the exchanges between chemistry and chemical engineering students, as well as the range of application areas to be addressed - from renewable energy to sustainability to health care. Summer research activities are also supplemented with technical lectures as well as collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Children's Hospital Colorado. Another unique aspect of this program is the proposed workshop on the challenges inherent in commercializing new technologies, as innovations move from lab to market. This approach complements the strong professional development program that will prepare students to consider advanced studies in the field.</AbstractNarration>

These events were sponsored by the host Departments at CSM and were completely free for the REU students. The overall social program provided during the REU site was rated great or good by all of the student participants and was outstanding in team bonding between the REU students.  As a result of the research that was conducted by the REU students during the three years of the REU site, 10 manuscripts have been published or submitted for peer review that include at least one REU students as a co-author. In addition, 7of the students who participated in the REU program presented their research as a poster at regional and national conferences.  By keeping track of all the students who attended the REU site over the past three years using our LinkedIn site, 100% of the REU students that could have obtained their degree in either chemical engineering or chemistry (based on their class standing at the time the attended the REU site) have obtained it.
