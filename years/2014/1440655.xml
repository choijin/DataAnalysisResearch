<AbstractNarration>West Virginia University (WVU) is, with the support of the National Science Foundation's Campus Cyberinfrastructure - Infrastructure, Innovation and Engineering program, deploying a new campus cyberinfrastructure architecture.  This new architecture is specifically designed to support, foster and advance scientific and engineering research and discovery through the implementation of a high performance research data networking infrastructure.  This project capitalizes on previous investments in a high performance campus network backbone and creates high performance end-to-end connectivity between the campus core and critical scientific and engineering research and education assets. More specifically, the WVU project team is 1) creating high speed connectivity between the campus network core and its Genomics Core research facility, the astrophysics analysis center, its neuroscience research program, and the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Education Lab; 2) implementing a science DMZ (a science "express lane") within the campus network for high performance science application data transfers; and 3) establishing a data transfer node to serve as a high performance end-point for large scale transfers of scientific data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will result in high performance end-to-end bandwidth connecting these research assets to the campus network backbone, and in turn, connecting them to the research community and other resources across campus and to the international research and education network infrastructure.  This will enable new levels of data-driven science that have been difficult if not infeasible to carry out at WVU.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Researchers at West Virginia University are facing growing needs to collect and transfer truly vast quantities of data in the pursuit of scientific discovery.  These researchers face a challenge in being able to move data from collection to storage and analysis in a timely manner.  WVU, with the support of the National Science FoundationÃ†s Campus Cyberinfrastructure &ndash; Infrastructure, Innovation and Engineering program, deployed a new science data network architecture to help meet this challenge.  This new science network architecture has three major components: Science DMZ &ndash; taking advantage of existing campus fiber infrastructure, WVU built a dedicated high performance data network backbone (or DMZ) for science and engineering data.  This DMZ enables high speed data exchanges among campus research and high performance computing facilities and with off-campus research partners via a connection to WVUÃ†s Internet2 link. High speed data links to critical campus research and engineering facilities &ndash; High speed connections to the DMZ were installed at select high data volume research facilities on campus: the Genomics Core research facility, the astrophysics data center, the neuroscience research laboratory in the UniversityÃ†s Health Sciences Center, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Education Lab in the College of Education and Human Services, and the High Performance Computing Center.  Data Transfer Node &ndash; WVU created a high volume, high performance Data Transfer Node (DTN).  This DTN gives researchers a high capacity data "depot" to place research data sets for processing and later handling.  This DTN also has a high speed connection to the High Performance Computing CenterÃ†s supercomputers.          Last Modified: 09/06/2015       Submitted by: Earl E Scime]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
