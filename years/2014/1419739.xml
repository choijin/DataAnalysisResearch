<AbstractNarration>Reconciliation analysis is a fundamental method in the study of species and genes, hosts and parasites, and geographical areas and species. While these applications are different, the underlying mathematical and computational problems are analogous.  Genes and species interact through complex evolutionary processes such as gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, and gene loss. Parasites and their hosts coevolve through processes including both contemporaneous and independent speciation, host switch, and extinction. And, species and their geographical habitats interact over geological time scales through vicariance, sympatric speciation, dispersal, and extinction. Consequently, the phylogenetic trees for genes and species, parasites and hosts, and species and their geographic regions are inherently incongruent.  This research will develop new algorithms, visualization methods, and software tools for studying the evolutionary histories of pairs of entities such as genes and species, hosts and parasites, and species and their geographical habitats and also help to train the next generation of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genes and species interact through complex evolutionary processes such as gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, and gene loss.

And, species and their geographical habitats interact over geological time scales through vicariance, sympatric speciation, dispersal, and extinction. Consequently, the phylogenetic trees for genes and species, parasites and hosts, and species and their geographic regions are inherently incongruent.  Phylogenetic tree reconciliation seeks to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of pairs of related entities by positing the evolutionary events that explain their incongruence.  Traditional maximum parsimony methods for tree reconciliation require the user to select costs for each type of evolutionary event.  These cost parameters are notoriously difficult to estimate and their values can substantially affect the results and conclusions.  This approach uses a Pareto-optimal methodology that does not require the user to select event costs a priori, thereby providing a systematic view of the set of all possible optimal reconciliations.  This work will ultimately result in software tools with applications across the life sciences including genomics, parasitology, virology, and biogeography.  In addition, this project will involve a substantial number of undergraduates, thereby helping prepare the next generation of researchers in computational biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many biological systems evolve in tandem.  For example, a parasite may evolve to specialize to its host and the host may evolve to defend itself against the parasite.  Similarly, genes and species evolve in tandem. In the many situations of this type, biologists seek to understand the likely evolutionary histories of these pairs in order to better understand evolutionary processes and to help solve important practical problems in medicine and agriculture.  Our research addressed the design of algorithms that can ultimately be used by biologists to study these phenomena.  Specifically, biologists can first obtain genetic data to infer the evolutionary histories, or phylogenetic trees, for the hosts and parasites (or genes and species) that they are studying.  Then, they can use algorithmic methods to determine likely scenarios that explain the evolutionary history of that pair.    Frequently though, there are many equally plausible scenarios for the evolutionary histories of such a pair.  This research addressed techniques and algorithms for determining how to condense the very large number of scenarios into a small representative set that best captures their diversity and permits the biologist to make sense of what would otherwise be an overwhelming number of options.  Our work involved designing and analyzing algorithms, testing those algorithms on biological datasets, and developing software tools that can be used by biologists.
