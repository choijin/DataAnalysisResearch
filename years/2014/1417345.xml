<AbstractNarration>Shallow lakes and ponds may cover up to 40 percent of the land surface in Arctic lowland regions.  Many of these water bodies traditionally freeze solid during the winter, preserving sub-lake permafrost and keeping soil carbon stocks immobile at depth.  Slightly deeper lakes maintain some liquid water beneath floating ice, causing deep thaw zones in otherwise continuous permafrost.  Evidence suggests that thinner ice growth in response to warmer, snowier winters is pushing many bedfast ice lakes to floating ice regimes.  If such a regime shift becomes pervasive across lake-rich landscapes, resulting permafrost thaw and enhanced moisture and heat flux could generate positive feedbacks, further amplifying this regime change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the extent and dynamics of bedfast and floating ice lakes in relation to hypothesized interactions and feedback with permafrost and climate.  A combination of remote sensing, field monitoring and geophysical measurements, experiments and physical models are used to isolate processes, quantify interactions and project changes.  Project findings will be relevant locally for native village subsistence and for water supply to the petroleum industry, and globally for scientists studying permafrost thaw and Arctic climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we investigated the impact of changing ice conditions of shallow arctic lakes on the properties of the underlying permafrost. Currently, many shallow Arctic lakes freeze to the bottom in winter, however we observed warmer, snowier weather in which some of those lakes transitioned to floating ice. When lakes in permafrost environments have floating ice for several sequential years, they may start to initiate thaw in the underlying ground.  This can have a variety of consequences including carbon mobilization, lake drainage, and changing ecosystems.  To assess the state of thaw beneath lakes with a range of ice conditions, we used geophysical measurements that can detect subsurface properties tens- to hundreds of meters below the surface using electromagnetic energy.  We deployed these instruments to complete detailed imaging of a lake on the Arctic Coastal plain that has a floating ice center and bedfast edges and compared the measured observations to a heat flow model.  This revealed that the thaw below that lake is likely occurring more rapidly than would be calculated simply from the known climate and geological information suggesting that there may still be unknown process or preconditioning controlling how thaw evolves below floating ice lakes.  We also acquired a network of point-based measurements on lakes identified by remote sensing measurements to be floating ice or frozen to the bottom, as well as lakes that alternate between these two conditions depending on winter weather.  Here we found that lakes that are persistently frozen to the bottom show no evidence of permafrost thaw below them, and similarly persistently floating ice lakes are thawed continuously to many tens-of-meters below the surface.  In contrast, transitional ice lakes that change between ice conditions have erratic freeze-thaw patterns below them indicating alternating periods of permafrost thaw and aggradation. This suggests that past transitions were long enough to impact the thermal state of permafrost, and not just short annual excursions from normal temperature. Understanding the role that changing lake ice conditions has in permafrost thaw can potentially benefit society because these results can help predictions of changing water availability, release of ancient carbon gas to the atmosphere, and changes in aquatic habitat that is home to fish species.
