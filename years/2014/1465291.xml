<AbstractNarration>Abstract (Vasy, 1465291): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support junior US participants to attend two one-week workshops: "Semi-classical Analysis: Spectral Theory and Resonances" on August 24-28, 2015, and "Hyperbolic Equations on Spacetimes: Stability, Microlocal Analysis and Quantum Field Theory", on September 7 - 12, 2015, which are parts of a 3-month long program at the Erwin SchrÂ¨odinger Institute (ESI) in Vienna, Austria, on the "Modern theory of wave equations". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wave equations are hyperbolic differential equations that describe the propagation of waves in space time.The two workshops and the program in general are aimed at bringing together researchers working on wave equations in order to foster interactions between three related areas in  which joint conferences are rare: Asymptotic behavior of waves on Lorentzian spacetimes and related resolvent esimates;  Scattering theory, resonances and semi-classical analysis; Distinguished parametrices and Hadamard states in quantum field theory of curved spacetimes.   The organizers will make efforts so  that many young researchers can participate in the conference.  The organizers will also strive to ensure the diversity of the participants to the maximum extent possible.</AbstractNarration>
