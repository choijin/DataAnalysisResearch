<AbstractNarration>A major scientific challenge today is understanding the consequences of biological invasions in response to environmental change. The proposed research uses fossil and modern data on marine clams and snails to compare evolutionary changes in species that have expanded geographic ranges along their native coasts with changes in invasive species that have crossed ocean basins with (accidental or intentional) human assistance. This research will evaluate biological characteristics that may confer an expansion advantage (for example, body size), analyze changes in shell shape between the source and colonized regions in both native and invasive expansions, and experimentally assess the contribution of genetic evolution to such shell shape variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, this research seeks to understand biological invasions in marine systems through comparisons with ?native? species expansions, where the natives are coming into contact with novel climates and new ecological communities. Despite the negative consequences of invasive species, they may offer a window into the rapid evolutionary adaptation that occurs in a recently colonized region over contemporary timescales. The proposed research has the potential to give insight into the evolutionary responses of species to past climate change and may help us predict how species adapt in response to expansions under current climate change.</AbstractNarration>

As non-native species introductions increase and native species shift their range in response to climate change, we can expect more species coming into contact with novel environments. This project contributes to our understanding of the phenotypic consequences of range expansion into those novel habitats. Marine gastropods are an ideal study system for this project because they have a highly resolved fossil record and have numerous documented range expansions. Through this study on the phenotypic consequences of range expansion, I find that Nucella lamellosa and N. ostrina exhibit significant morphological variation across large and small spatial scales and across time.  I compared phenotypic patterns shaped by localized wave-exposure and inferred predation gradients with patterns shaped by latitudinal distance (either via isolation of populations in the case of N. lamellosa or recent expansion following the LGM in the case of N. ostrina). When separated into northern (AK) and southern (CA, OR, WA) groups, both species show significant morphological differences across latitudes, where northern shells tend to be higher-spired, with smaller apertures, than southern ones. This is somewhat contrary to expectations based on previous work that might suggest increased predation and heat at more southern latitudes would select for a higher-spired, smaller aperture shell.

Surprisingly, N. lamellosa does not show the expected pattern of thinner shells with larger apertures at exposed sites, but N. ostrina does show the expected pattern, possibly as a result of its position in the intertidal. The findings from this study contribute to our understanding about the phenotypic consequences of range expansion into novel habitats, and is one of the only studies to follow up on intriguing results showing rapid morphological evolution following a range expansion in another muricid gastropod, Acanthinucella spriata, (Hellberg et al 2001, Science).
