<AbstractNarration>Funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program  in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael C. Leopold at the University of Richmond, is investigating materials and strategies for the development of clinically relevant sensors that incorporate nanomaterials.  As a component within sensors, networks of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) elicit improved performance, including enhanced sensitivity and response time.  Nanomaterials enable miniaturization of sensing devices, allowing advances to be directly applied to needle electrodes - a sensor geometry amenable to implantable or bedside devices.   Greater understanding of NP networks within sensing schemes, allow for the formulation of sensor design strategies targeting molecules that serve as diagnostic markers in emergency room and maternity ward settings, where real time, continuous monitoring would be most beneficial.  Biosensing schemes with NP networks that detect lactic and uric acid, compounds linked to diagnosis/monitoring of serious medical conditions, sepsis and pregnancy-induced hypertension, respectively, are a focus.  This award is also supporting full immersion undergraduate research mentoring and a continuing outreach partnership with the Math Science Innovation Center to introduce nanotechnology to teachers and students of grades 6-12.       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to identify and understand critical structure-function relationships within amperometric biosensor schemes that incorporate metallic nanoparticles (NPs), establishing greater understanding of the NP's mechanistic role. First generation, xerogel-based amperometric glucose biosensors serve as model systems that feature composite xerogel/enzyme films embedded with a network of alkanethiolate-protected gold NPs or monolayer-protected clusters (MPCs).  Each component of the film, from MPC surface chemistry to the xerogel's silane precursor, is systematically examined to elucidate both the NPs and xerogel structural role in the sensing mechanism.  Those findings prompt rational design of NP-assisted biosensing schemes at "needle" or wire electrode geometries with potential in-vitro or in-vivo capability that are also selective for clinically relevant and chemically diverse species.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[               The overarching scientific goals or intellectual merit of our research funded by NSF-CHE-1401593 revolved around the development and understanding of biosensor schemes targeting clinically relevant molecules and providing physicians with effective and versatile diagnostic tools.  The broader impact of the funding were primarily focused on providing intensive and transformative research experiences to undergraduates in order to inspire and train the next generation of scientists and physicians.  Funding from the NSF has allowed for us to make a significant impact in both the lives of a significant number of students as well as advancing the field toward the realization of these diagnostic sensors.                 Biosensors are sensor designs that utilize enzymes to attain selectivity - the ability to detect a targeted molecule within a matrix of many other molecules. The proposal for this funding, originally written in 2014, was inspired by the principal investigator?s own experience where, during the birth of his son, his wife developed pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia risk.  The diagnostic procedure used for risk assessment involved taking numerous samples of blood and urine from the expectant mother to establish uric acid levels over time, a time-consuming effort that requires lab analysis of samples which can allow for the medical condition to progress.  More immediate action by doctors without the diagnostic results has led to costly intervention in the pregnancy, emergency C-section deliveries that are often unnecessary.   Thus, a clear need for a uric acid sensor capable of real-time, continuous measurements was evident. Upon further investigation, a number of various diseases/conditions exist where sensors could provide improved clinical diagnostics.  In each case, a target diagnostic molecule and corresponding enzyme are known.  A particularly noteworthy example is the use of lactate measurement for the faster and more accurate diagnosis of sepsis, a major cause of death worldwide, including children (https://rorystauntonfoundationforsepsis.org/).  With the recognition of the greater need for these clinical sensors we proposed a general strategy and a set of materials that would provide scientists with the ability to adapt the sensing scheme for all of these situations including control of selectivity and sensitivity (Figure 1).              The intellectual merit of our research revolved around the development of an adaptable sensor template incorporating layers of functional materials at an electrode to achieve a selective, measureable signal in the presence of the target molecule.  For our eventual applications, several key objectives had to first be met.  In addition to establishing sensors with appropriate selectivity/sensitivity, the sensing scheme developed would also require miniaturization to needle-sized electrodes (Figure 2) and the demonstrated operational ability in relevant bodily fluids, the latter goal requiring options to amplify the signal in these media.  In order to achieve all of these goals, it first required fundamental understanding of the materials, their assembly/functionality within the sensing apparatus.               As the grant closes, we are pleased to state that all the major goals were achieved, from fundamental understanding of the materials to the development of sensors for uric acid (preeclampsia risk), sarcosine (prostate cancer), xanthine (xanthinuria screening), galactose (galactosemia screening), and glucose (diabetes) as well as the demonstrated use of nanomaterials (gold and platinum nanoparticle networks; carbon nanotubes) for effective signal enhancement.  Miniaturization and functionality in bodily fluids was demonstrated for most systems including the use of signal-enhancing platinum nanoparticle films on the needles (Figure 3).  The work resulted in 14 papers (one currently in preparation) featuring 45 undergraduate co-authors and acknowledging NSF-CHE-1401593.  The research was featured in Chemical &amp;Engineering News and World Biomedical Frontiers.  Broader Impacts centered on targeted and intensive training/mentoring of undergraduates, particularly those from underrepresented groups, in meaningful, outcome-oriented research experiences.  Under this grant, 18 undergraduates participated in immersive research experiences, collectively amounting to 70+ semesters of research and 28 intensive 10-week summer research sessions by the students.  Students remained remarkably committed to the research with an average research group size during the grant of 7 students/semester - each student engaging in research, on average, for 4 consecutive semesters and 2 summers. These students routinely presented findings at regional/national meetings conferences with 65 student presentations while also gaining acceptance to top graduate/professional schools.  The research resulted in significant national recognition of the students with three Goldwater Scholars and three Beckman Scholars. In an effort to engage traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences, 50% of the researchers under the grant were female while nearly 40% identified as ethnically/religiously diverse. Outreach focused on involving research students in activities with regional K-12 students to promote interest and opportunity in science, including field trips to our science facilities and demonstrations at local elementary schools.  Collectively we believe this grant has provided both meaningful scientific advancement and been transformative for the personnel involved.
