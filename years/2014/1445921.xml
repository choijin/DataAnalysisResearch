<AbstractNarration>PI:     Hai Wang&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CBET 1445921&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day workshop (August  2-3, 2014) will be held at the Sandia National Laboratory campus with experts from around the world and the country to address the research needs for basic combustion kinetics for soot formation and sooting flames.  The dates have been selected to be in advance of the bi-annual 35th International Combustion Symposium, to be held in San Francisco, August 4-8, 2014, when experts from around the world will be congregate in the Bay area.  The workshop's schedule takes advantage of the larger event resulting in cost reduction.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop's key results have the potential of gaining knowledge that would make utilization of fossil fuels in energy production cleaner and more sustainable.  The workshop also provides students a unique opportunity to be exposed to multidisciplinary science and the leading issues in sooting emission from combustion processes.  Graduate students from US educational institutions are encouraged to attend the workshop, with NSF support to defray lodging costs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fossil fuel combustion is ubiquitous in energy conversion systems.  Currently, over 80% of the worldÃ†s power or electricity production is based on the combustion of fossil fuels.  Soot formation remains to be a problem central to combustion engine design and optimization.  The science of soot formation is interdisciplinary in nature, spanning from reaction mechanisms and chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, turbulence and fluid mechanics, aerosol dynamics, to large-scale simulations.    The award supported seven US graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend and present their work as posters at the 2nd International Sooting Flame (ISF) Workshop held on Aug. 2-3, 2014 in Pleasanton, California. The workshop aims to coordinate efforts in sooting flame research that ranges from theory and modeling to experimentation, laminar to turbulent flow conditions, premixed to non-premixed flame configurations, and low-pressure to elevated pressure conditions.    The Workshop brought together a diverse range of experimental and computational scientists in the area of sooting flames to identify common research priorities in the development and validation of accurate, predictive models of flames with soot and to coordinate research programs to address them; to identify and coordinate well defined target flames that are suitable for model development and validation, spanning a variety of flames types and fuels in each of the research programs; and to establish an archive of the detailed data sets of target flames with defined accuracy; and to provide a forum for the exchange and dissemination of these data.  During the workshop, the students and postdocs had the opportunities to "mingle" with top scientists working in the area. The experience is rewarding to them as they got to learn first hand the urgent questions that need to be addressed within this resaerch area.  They were also given opportunities to develop new scientific concepts and present their view in front of the experts.         Last Modified: 02/02/2015       Submitted by: Hai Wang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
