<AbstractNarration>Positronium is the bound state of the electron and its antiparticle, the positron. As such, it forms an "exotic atom", similar in many ways to the traditional simple atoms such as hydrogen and helium, but different because of its unique composition and because of its tendency to annihilate, transforming into pure electromagnetic energy in the form of high-energy photons. Many properties of positronium, such as energy level differences and lifetimes, are accessible to high-precision experiments.  Positronium properties can also be calculated theoretically to high precision. Consequently, positronium is an ideal system for testing the limits of electromagnetic bound state physics. The positronium hyperfine splitting--the interval between the spin-1 and spin-0 variants of the lowest energy state--is of prime interest because there is a long-standing difference (of about four times the experimental uncertainty) between theory and experiment for this splitting. The current proposal is to calculate the positronium hyperfine interval to a higher level. When complete, the result of this work will help to resolve or sharpen the positronium hyperfine discrepancy. This theoretical work is timely because two experimental groups, based at the University of California, Riverside and at the University of Tokyo, are developing improved experimental measurements of the hyperfine interval. The combination of improved experimental results and higher precision theory will work together to give bound-state Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) one of its most stringent tests to date. An important aspect of this project will be the training of undergraduate student collaborators in the techniques and processes of scientific investigation in this field.  The overall project involves a number of distinct parts that will make ideal projects for small teams of students. The students will cooperate in all aspects of the work including the development of calculational techniques and tools, the calculations themselves, presentation at scientific meetings, and publication.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Positronium properties will be calculated theoretically to high precision using the methods of bound-state Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) because strong and weak interaction effects are negligible. The positronium hyperfine interval will be calculated to a higher level of precision than heretofore by completing all three-loop corrections to the hyperfine interval. This will require an application of effective field theory methods, specifically Non-Relativistic QED (NRQED), at the three-loop order. When complete, the result of this work will help to resolve or sharpen the positronium hyperfine discrepancy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The scientific goal of this project is to obtain predictions for the energy levels of the electron-positron bound system "positronium" at the order m alpha^7 level of precision (where alpha is the fine structure constant).  There are many parts to this overall calculation.  Several major parts have been completed during the past three years.  Specifically, we have obtained and published results for contributions involving virtual annihilation to two photons that undergo photon-photon scattering, virtual annihilation to two photons along with two-loop vacuum polarization, virtual annihilation to two photons along with the product of two one-loop radiative corrections, and virtual annihilation to three photons along with one-loop radiative corrections.   More generally, we have worked to systematically develop the framework for a full order m alpha^7 calculation within the context of the effective quantum field theory "non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics" (NRQED).  Another important goal for this project is the training and mentoring of undergraduate student collaborators.  These students are instructed in the theoretical basis of particle physics and relativistic quantum mechanics and the techniques for calculation required for NRQED.  They collaborated in performing the detailed analytical and numerical work required for obtaining the results described above.  Of the nine students who have participated in this project, three have graduated from Franklin &amp; Marshall College and are now in graduate Ph.D. programs in physics, one is in a Ph.D. program in mathematics, one in a Master?s program in computational science and engineering.  The other four have not yet graduated.  The final results of this overall project could have a wide impact, especially if it is found that new physics is required in order to bring theoretical expectations and experimental observations into accord for the positronium hyperfine splitting or other energy levels.  This is the long-term goal, since the calculations are challenging and time-consuming, and the experiments are difficult and results of significantly improved precision are not yet available.  The most immediate and certain impact of this project is the training of the students involved to be more self-confident, knowledgeable, and experienced scientists and citizens.  They will have gained an understanding of how science actually works and experience with its practice that will be extremely useful to them in their future careers.
