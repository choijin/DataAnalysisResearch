<AbstractNarration>The Doppler radial velocity technique is a method of detecting planets outside of our solar system by measuring the slight wobble imparted on the host star by the planet or planets that orbit it. It is one of the most powerful and promising methods of exoplanet detection. Inferring the presence of a planet using this technique, however, requires a very precise measurement of the star's radial velocity.  Improvements in the precision of radial velocity measurements will lead to the detection of lower-mass planets, which are currently underrepresented in the sample of known exoplanets. Detecting Earth-like exoplanets is a critical step in the search for life outside of our solar system. In collaboration with Professor Motohide Tamura, at the National Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), this project goal is measuring precise radial velocities of low-mass stars for exoplanet detection and characterization. The NAOJ operates the Subaru Telescope, which will house the Infrared Doppler Instrument (IRD), a state-of-the-art instrument designed to take high-resolution spectra of low-mass stars. The IRD spectra will reveal a whole new population of Earth-like planets.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Another aim of this research project is the development of software designed to measure radial velocities using telluric (atmospheric) absorption lines as a wavelength reference. This method of wavelength calibration is complementary to that employed by the IRD. This study aims to improve the efficacy of both methods. In addition, the telluric line software will be applicable to any ground-based spectrograph that operates in the infrared or near infrared. In particular, the software could be used to improve the precision of several new high-resolution instruments, which will see first light in the next few years. The combination of high-resolution spectrographs and accurate wavelength references in the infrared will result in the discovery of a whole new population of Earth-like exoplanets in the next several years. Further study of this population will advance our understanding of planet formation, the origins of life in the universe, and other such long-standing mysteries. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Doppler radial velocity technique is a method of detecting  planets outside of our solar system by measuring the slight wobble  imparted on the host star by the planet that orbits it.  It is one of the  most powerful and promising methods of exoplanet detection.   As the field of exoplanet research advances, we are beginning to look in earnest for potentially habitable Earth-like planets.  To date, however, most exoplanet searches have surveyed stars like our Sun, which wobbles only very slightly due to the orbit of the relatively small Earth.  In an exoplanet search, this wobble would be undetectable with current technology.  Therefore, it behooves us to search for potentially habitable Earth-like planets by observing smaller stars.   Additionally, we would like to understand more about the planetary systems of low-mass stars in general.  Measuring radial velocities for many low-mass stars can help us answer questions like: How often do low-mass stars have a planet?  How often do low-mass stars have multiple planets?  What are the typical sizes and orbital separations of the planets in such systems?  Answering these questions will also help us to understand how the planets formed in the first place.  This project adapts the Doppler radial velocity technique, which has been used very successfully at optical wavelengths (where stars like our Sun are their brightest), for use at infrared wavelengths (where low-mass stars are their brightest).  This work started through the EAPSI program at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), which operates the 8m Subaru Telescope.  Prior to the EAPSI program, low-mass stars were observed using the Subaru Telescope's Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS), and an ammonia gas absorption cell for wavelength calibration.  During the 10-week EAPSI summer program, we performed data reduction on the observations, and used the ammonia cell to determine exactly the wavelength of light falling on each pixel of the detector.  These are essential steps in measuring precise radial velocities.  After the EAPSI summer program concluded, we continued work on the project, developing software to automate the data reduction, improve the wavelength calibration, and measure the radial velocities.  We have made preliminary radial velocity measurements and are currently working to improve the precision of the measurements.  Once the software is finalized, we will measure radial velocities for all of our target stars, and determine whether or not they have planetary or stellar companions.  Low-mass stars are excellent candidates for hosting potentially habitable planets, but they must be studied further.  Obtaining radial velocity measurements for many low-mass stars will help us to understand how planets form, and what kinds of planets and planetary systems are typical for stars of different sizes.  The radial velocities we measure, and the software we have made, will help to achieve this goal.       Last Modified: 03/01/2015       Submitted by: Steven Gilhool]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
