<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Lehigh University to develop an ultrahigh speed, label-free and non-destructive imaging technology based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) for biological research. The ability to non-invasively generate ultrafast, in vivo, 3D, synchronized structural and functional images of biological samples with micron-scale resolutions will greatly advance biological research. Technologies developed in this program can be readily transferred and disseminated to other fields, such as tissue engineering, ophthalmology and cancer imaging. In addition, the research project is integrated with multidisciplinary education and outreach activities to train graduate and undergraduate students to solve real-life problems, and to stimulate the interests of college and K-12 students in pursuing a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to develop further a space-division multiplexing OCT (SDM-OCT) technology in order to significantly improve OCT imaging speed through parallel imaging. This project will focus on developing new ultrafast functional imaging capabilities (e.g. Doppler) and optimized SDM components to facilitate broad dissemination.  The utilities of SDM-OCT will be demonstrated in developmental biology/cardiology through collaboration at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.  The SDM-OCT technology provides a new approach that can offer over an order of magnitude speed improvement for OCT without compromising image resolution and sensitivity.  SDM-OCT also has favorable cost scalability, and allows synchronized cross-sectional and 3D imaging of intact tissue samples, enabling new biological applications.</AbstractNarration>

High imaging speed is critical for capturing dynamic biological processes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an emerging label-free imaging technology, has demonstrated its utilities in biological research and clinical applications. This IDBR:TYPE A grant supported the development of a space-division multiplexing optical coherence tomography (SDM-OCT) technology, which provides ultrahigh-speed, synchronized, structural and functional imaging of biological samples non-destructively with micron-scale resolutions.  Intellectual merit: With the IDBR grant support, we have successfully achieved the three research objectives set forth at the onset of this research program: 1) Develop ultrahigh-speed and functional SDM-OCT technologies. We have developed several prototype SDM-OCT imaging systems working at either 1310 nm or 1060 nm wavelength range to obtain high-speed 3D morphological and angiographic images of biological samples. In particular, we developed a 1060 nm ophthalmic SDM-OCT system, which can perform high definition 3D volumetric scan of the human retina, covering a wide field of 12 mm x 7.5 mm, in 1 second. The acquisition speed of our prototype system is at least 10x faster than most commercial OCT devices on the market. The high acquisition speed significantly reduced motion artifacts and allowed us to scan a large field-of-view on samples.   2) Develop technologies to allow practical use and facilitate broad dissemination of SDM-OCT.

We built prototype SDM-OCT systems based on two generations of SDM photonic chips and successfully demonstrated the feasibility. 3) Demonstrate utilities of SDM-OCT in developmental biology/cardiology by investigating Drosophila heart development. Working with colleagues at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, we used high speed OCT to characterize the heart function of Drosophila and developed a novel optogenetic pacing technology to non-invasively control the heart beat rhythm of the flies to study the pacing effects on heart development.  Broader Impact: Several students, including both graduate and undergraduate students, women and underrepresented minorities, were involved in various aspect of the project and received extensive training in optical instrumentation, electrical engineering, image processing, and biological research.  This instrument development program benefits the developmental biology/cardiology research community in addition to many others. The ability to non-invasively generate ultrafast, in vivo, 3D, synchronized structural and functional images of biological samples with micron-scale resolutions will greatly advance biological research.
