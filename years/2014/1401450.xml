<AbstractNarration>The rapid biodiversity change in North America has significant effects on essential ecosystem services, from impact on soil health and nutrient cycling, to agriculture, forestry and water quality. Exploding populations of invasive species threaten fresh water and terrestrial habitats and potentially impact the natural resources of the nation. Easy access to robust, expertly vetted baseline data for species occurrences, abundances, and distribution ranges, and monitoring how these parameters have changed through time, will facilitate the protection of the nation's natural resources, and vastly improve the capacity for effective restoration, land management planning, and conservation management.  Numerous undergraduate students will receive training in digitization technologies and a modular exhibit will be developed to engage public interest in biodiversity changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective monitoring requires easy electronic access to historical specimen baseline information for temporal and regional species diversity comparisons that can facilitate informed land management decisions. Vast amounts of specimen data are housed within the nation's natural history collections, but most of these data are not readily accessible from digital resources. Size and complexity of scientific specimen collections require major technological advances in capturing specimen data. The goal of this four-year collaborative project is the rapid digitization of  &gt;2 million specimens and their locality data from ten arthropod and mollusk collections housed at six major US museums in six states (Il, OH, AL,MI, DE, PA). This project will significantly automate specimen data capture by utilizing optical character and voice-recognition technologies. The digitized data from this project will be immediately deployed for habitat-based distribution modeling and analyses.This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ InvertEBase: Reaching back to see the future: species-rich invertebrate faunas document causes and consequences of biodiversity shifts, is a four-year Thematic Collections Network (TCN) tasked with digitizing the paper records of more than two million specimens of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate animals (primarily arthropods and mollusks) held by six major natural history museums in the United States.  Having such data in digital form enables research into the identity and geographic distribution of the fauna of the United States, and enhances our understanding of how species are or are likely to be affected by climate change, pollution, change in land use and other human-mediated effects on the natural environment.  Each of the six museums that is contributing digitized specimen data to InvertEBase is a collaborating institution on the corresponding NSF award.  Harvard University is a seventh collaborating institution, but it did not contribute digitized specimen data per se.  Instead, Harvard's contribution was to assess the quality of the digitized data--to identify errors in the data that would qualify their use in research, education and other applications, and to recommend steps needed to correct the errors.  To do this, the Harvard component applied Kurator, a suite of semi-automated software tools for rapidly evaluating and enhancing the quality of biodiversity data, in general, and web-based databases from natural science collections, in particular, which was developed primarily with support from two other NSF awards.  The Kurator team worked closely with biodiversity informatics specialists at InvertEBase collaborating institutions to enhance their data-curation protocols and to assess the quality of their digitized data.  Using Kurator tools, we produced data-quality reports that helped evaluate the fitness-for-use of digitized data and, where appropriate, identified problems, proposed solutions, and suggested the likely consequences of proposed changes.  For example, we were able to quickly check that names of states and counties in thousands of data records are spelled correctly and flag records that contain localities with combinations of country, state and county that do not exist. Kurator also used data and  data-quality problems from InvertEBase to help inform community  development of standard tests of biodiversity data quality, principally through our participation in the international Taxonomic Databases Working Group.  Data curation is a critical step in scientific data digitization, sharing, integration and use.  The considerable financial investment made to support digitization of natural science collections, both in the United States and globally, necessitates a focus on maximizing both digitization efficiency and the quality and utility of the generated data.  A powerful way to simultaneously address both issues is to employ computerized workflow technology that can automate and streamline data-curation processes.  Support provided by the InvertEBase award enabled us to refine and improve the Kurator-web application, which makes its data quality-control tools accessible to anyone involved in data curation and digitization efforts at natural science collections.  Indeed, these tools have proven to be so effective and useful that an instance of Kurator-web is deployed and accessible through iDigBio, the NSF-supported national digitization hub (www.idigbio.org).  Kurator and its associated resources are now freely available to the greater natural science collections community for use in managing their databases and related digitization efforts.
