<AbstractNarration>In the proposed project, Cai plans to study classical recursion theory with emphasis on some interesting long-standing questions. In addition, he hopes to introduce new ideas and concepts to enrich the field, as well as to investigate some recent new results for different approaches and potential improvements. Cai also aims to expand the scope to applications of recursion theory, in particular he will continue the study of the degrees of provability, where proof-theoretic results can be proved using recursion-theoretic methods such as diagonalization and the recursion theorem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recursion theory is a field of logic addressing effective content of mathematical practices (e.g., which of the mathematical procedures can be performed by automated machines, or computers). It has classical applications explaining why some mathematical problems (e.g., Hilbert's Tenth Problem) are theoretically unsolvable. The proposed project aims to improve the understanding of recursion theory by investigating old and new open problems, as well as to expand it by building connections to other fields such as proof theory. The proposed project has potential applications explaining how certain arithmetical facts could be theoretically unprovable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recursion theory is a field of logic that addresses questions related to computability.  It has classical applications explaining why some mathematical problems, such as  Hilbert's Tenth Problem, are theoretically unsolvable.     The proposed project aimed to improve the understanding of recursion theory by investigating old and new open problems, as well as expanding it by building connections to other fields such as proof theory. The proposed project has potential applications explaining how certain arithmetical facts could be theoretically unprovable.  During the grant various problems in sub-areas of recursion theory were investigated by Cai and co-authors.   For example, problems in computatibility theory, which seeks to understand the computatibility of mathematical objects, were studied.   An impressive breakthrough was made by answering a long-standing question of Rogers from the 1960's.  The question addresses the relationship between computability and enumerability.  It was shown that the notion of "total degrees", which is closely related to "Turing degrees" which capture the computability features of mathematical objects, can be defined within the "enumeration degrees" which capture the enumerability features of mathematical objects.  In addition, Cai studied some fundamental questions in mathematics and in logic, such as "how hard is it to prove that a sentence is independent from known axioms", can be formalized in this framework and answered using various techniques developed in earlier research in the area. Research in this area reveals new layers of the unprovability phenomenon and provides new evidence of the deep complexity and the profound incompleteness of mathematics.  During the last few months of the grant, there was a PI change and during this period Orellana studied questions relating to the computatibility of the coefficients that arise when we expand in tensor products of representations of the symmetric group.  In addition,  a recursive formula for these coefficients was investigated to try to obtain a combinatorial algorithm for the computations of these coefficients.  The research will have impact in quantum physics and theoretical computer science.  In addition, Orellana has involved undergraduates in her research program and started programs for grade school children, middle and high school students to excite and hence increase the number of students wanting to study STEM related subjects.   Additionally, Orellana has been involved in the mentoring of female mathematicians through a number activities and workshops.
