<AbstractNarration>1450791&lt;br/&gt;Bowles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM).  The SRM will support research and research training in mineral and rock magnetism and paleomagnetism.  Fundamental studies in rock magnetism address the physical mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of magnetism by natural mineral phases and the processes through which that magnetism is either recorded with high fidelity or altered by environmental factors.  Mineral magnetic investigations have implications for the development of improved materials for use in many industrial applications.  Paleomagnetism studies address the behavior of the Earth?s magnetic field through geologic time and have application to understanding the former positions of continents on Earth, the dynamical behavior and evolution of the geomagnetic field and for interpreting past environmental conditions to better constrain the full spectrum of Earth?s past range of climate conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental studies of how magnetic phases acquire magnetization and studies of the historical dynamics of the Earth?s magnetic field based on paleointensity observations as recorded in magnetic phases in rocks and natural volcanic glasses will be supported.  The SRM will allow studies of weakly magnetized materials and very small synthesized phases given to the high sensitivity of direct current superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID) on the requested SRM.   Such investigations cannot be accomplished with an extant but much less sensitive spinner magnetometer in the investigator?s laboratory.  The instrument will be the first of its kind in the state of Wisconsin and will support regional and international collaborations.   The investigator will develop instrument control software that will allow for all SRM measurements to be archived and output in a format compatible with a community mineral, rock and paleomagnetism database (MagIC).   The SRM will support student research training with a focus on attracting underreprestented students to the geosciences.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and may advance the national prosperity and welfare through promoting student training for careers in the physical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to acquire a superconducting rock magnetometer for the Paleomagnetic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee (UWM). The field of paleomagnetism is concerned with understanding variations in Earth?s past magnetic field as recorded in geological materials such as rocks and sediments.  Applications include understanding processes deep in Earth?s core; reconstructing tectonic plate motions; providing age constraints on geologic features and processes; and quantifying flow directions in ancient lavas or rivers.  Environmental magnetism is an associated field of study that uses magnetic techniques to probe soils and sediments for variations in magnetic minerals.  These variations may be linked to paleoclimate or paleoenvironmental variations or to modern anthropogenic pollution or land use practices.     The magnetometer is the workhorse of any paleomagnetic laboratory, allowing for the measurement of weakly magnetic natural materials such as sediments, soils, and rocks.  The new 2G Enterprises model 755SRMS superconducting rock magnetometer was delivered and installed in the magnetically shielded room at UWM in May 2016.  The new system largely replaces a ~20-year-old spinner magnetometer, providing a 250-fold increase in measurement sensitivity while simultaneously decreasing measurement time by at least a factor of 5-10. The new magnetometer allows the lab to expand research in new directions. For example, work with weakly magnetic natural glasses helps us to better understand variations in the strength of Earth?s magnetic field; and magnetic particles incorporated into biogenic stromatolites may allow us to characterize fine-scale field variations in the distant past (hundreds of millions or billions of years).   Since the system became fully operational in September 2016, it has been used as part of a class in Paleomagnetism and Environmental Magnetism where all students used the instrument in laboratory exercises and independent research projects.  Additionally, four graduate students and two undergraduate students have been trained in the use of the system and have been using it to conduct independent research.  Two additional undergraduate students are slated to start in summer/fall 2017.  Along with the PI, these students have investigated projects including characterizing tectonic rotations in lower oceanic crust; a pilot environmental magnetism study of the 1.1 billion year old sediments from the Michigan Upper Peninsula; characterization of magnetic properties and magnetization of natural glasses with respect to their ability to faithfully record the strength of Earth?s magnetic field; a study designed to distinguish subglacial deposits from landslides deposits related to the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (roughly 300 million years ago); and a study of magnetic property variations in hydrothermally altered rocks from Iceland that will be used as an analogue for understanding Mars geological history.  Outside of Geosciences, the system is useful in physics, materials sciences, and geoarcheology.  The magnetometer has been advertised to the appropriate departments on campus, as well as to 31 institutions in the Milwaukee/Chicago areas, as well as greater Wisconsin.  Several have already expressed interest in sending students to use the system in their own work.  The new magnetometer will provide UWM and dozens of other regional institutions with cutting edge technology for use teaching and research.
