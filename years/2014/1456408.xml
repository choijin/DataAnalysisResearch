<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop and commercialize radiation-tolerant integrated circuit (IC) technology for producing radiation-tolerant/hardened (rad-hard) ICs capable of being manufactured using leading-edge commercial IC processing instead of expensive specialized processes which use older, less efficient lithography nodes. The direct customers for the technology, to be delivered in the form of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and support services, will be semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and semiconductor foundries. In the CT scanner industry, improved radiation-tolerance of the electronics will allow key components to be placed directly in the X-ray path, improving signal quality, and resulting in better images at reduced X-ray dose levels to patients. Reducing X-ray exposure from CT scans is a medical priority, as it has been estimated that 0.4% of current cancer incidents result from high X-ray doses from CT scans.  Application of the patent-pending technology in radiation-hard ICs for a wide range of other commercial radiation-environment markets will follow, including commercial satellites, nuclear-power electronics, nondestructive testing, and medical electronics sterilization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide integrated circuit (IC) designers access to leading-edge IC technology and advanced lithography nodes in developing ICs for radiation-tolerant applications, and is based on patent-pending transistor-level design and layout innovations and their implementation in EDA tools.  In Phase I, proof-of-concept was established; transistor structures evaluated for X-ray and gamma radiation tolerance improved by a factor of 7 for 1.8V transistors, and by well over a factor of 10 for 5V transistors, with the use of the technology.  The research objective of Phase II is to provide ready access to the benefits of the technology to IC designers by incorporating the methodologies for transistor-level design and layout improvements into industry-standard EDA tools.  A number of technical challenges will be addressed in Phase II, including optimizing the tools for producing area-efficient and cost-efficient transistor layouts, and assuring seamless integration with existing design flows.   A beta version of an EDA tool kit will be developed in Phase II; the anticipated result will be a tool that can be used by initial customers in producing rad-hard ICs used in CT scan electronics and other applications.</AbstractNarration>
