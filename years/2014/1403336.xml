<AbstractNarration>Ground-based gamma-ray observations have revolutionized the field of high energy particle astrophysics over the past decade. Supernova remnants, pulsars, active galactic nuclei, starburst galaxies and stellar-mass binary systems have all been shown to emit very high energy gamma-radiation, along with sources whose identification is still unclear. The detection of gamma-rays indicates that these objects are accelerating particles to almost the speed of light, but the acceleration mechanisms, and the connection between the accelerators and the origin of cosmic rays remains unclear.  Using the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory the Delaware group has led studies in many areas of gamma-ray astrophysics, including supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, active galaxies and searches for dark matter annihilation.  The PI is currently the spokesperson for the VERITAS collaboration.  With this award the University of Delaware group will continue their broad scientific program as well as technical work associated with the VERITAS observatory.  The Delaware group will also continue its education and public outreach activities.  Members of the group mentor students at the high school and undergraduate level, give public astrophysics presentations, and support the VERITAS outreach program.  The group will continue to organize an annual "Fermi Summer School" that caters to graduate students and post-docs from around the world.  Finally, as Spokesperson, the PI will communicate VERITAS science to the general public, and to the wider scientific community, through interactions with the press and with various scientific organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The astrophysics activities funded through this award are both scientific and technical.  Firstly, the group will use gamma-ray observations with VERITAS to study sites of particle acceleration, and specifically supernova remnants, gamma-ray binary systems, and blazars, through deep observations of known sources, and discovery observations of new candidates.  They will also search for high gamma-ray emission from regions of excess astrophysical neutrinos as identified by IceCube.  Secondly, the group will contribute to the maintenance and improvements to the capabilities of VERITAS.  This consists of hardware maintenance of the upgraded telescope camera pixels, and the development of new analysis methods to improve sensitivity.  Finally, the group will work on the commissioning of a prototype telescope at the VERITAS site for the next generation Cherenkov Telescope Array project.</AbstractNarration>
