<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the fall 2013 Future Internet Architecture (FIA) principal investigator meeting. The meeting enables PIs to discuss four topics: 1) the management of faults, which includes detection, localization, isolation/avoidance/working around them, and repair/recovery; 2) routing where the interest here is not the complete details of how the schemes are currently doing routing, but what the different approaches provide as foundations for routing, and what they require from a routing protocol; 3) the Internet of Things (IoT), which is of interest to several of the projects that have a point of view about sensors, machine to machine (M2M), etc.; and 4) performance, since most of the FIA proposals do not distinguish themselves from the current Internet on the basis of simple performance improvements (e.g., efficient use of links), but do raise different and interesting questions about aspects of performance. The goal of this session is to tease these questions out and compare the FIA proposals in this light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The discussions of these topics lead to a better focus by the various FIA projects on key issues, such as network management, which have not received high-level attention in previous FIA meetings. The discussion also lays the groundwork for a more substantive discussion of security, perhaps at the next meeting in spring 2014. The discussions of routing and performance tie the FIA efforts to some more traditional topics of network research. The discussion of IoT provides a lens into the applicability of the different FIA proposals for an important application space. The intention is that these discussions provide an in-depth assessment of these issues, which should be of direct benefit to the projects themselves as well as the broader networking community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader goal of the NSF FIA effort is enhancing the relevance and impact of the NSF program of network research, intellectual enrichment of the network research community, and the contribution of new concepts and thought leadership to the future of the Internet. FIA in general and the workshops in particular are a means to train a cohort of academic network researchers in the practice of long-range architectural thinking. FIA has the potential to contribute to a future Internet that is materially more secure, robust, economically viable, and fit for the needs of society than the Internet of today. The results of this workshop, posted on the FIA website (www.nets-fia.net) for public dissemination, are expected to provide a contribution to this broader goal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported one in a series of workshops for investigators funded under the NSF Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program. This program challenges the network research community to envision what an Internet of 15 years from now might be, and consider architectural alternatives to the current Internet.     This meeting addressed four topics: fault management, routing, Internet of things, and performance.     The issue of fault management is important because one of the problems with the current Internet is that while certain obvious faults, such as a failed router, can be detected by its neighbors and potentially corrected by the dynamic routing algorithms if there is adequate redundancy, there is no general way to detect or localize more complex or malicious failures. This limitation leaves both users and network operators confounded when things go wrong, and opens the door to a range of security problems. The alternatives being explored within the FIA program display a range of approaches to fault management; some rely on a very expressive packet header to provide detailed route control, others rely on a very constrained packet header but per-packet state in the routers. Either of these approaches might lead to an improved ability to deal with faults in the current Internet.     The question of routing is not the complete details of how the schemes are currently doing routing, but what the different designs provide as foundations for routing, and what they require from a routing protocol. Mobility is a challenge for the current Internet, and content delivery is handled today using delivery "overlays" that are only loosely coupled to the Internet forwarding scheme. Better integration of these issues into the fabric of the Internet might lead to improved performance, functionality and security.     The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a future where "everything" is network-enabled in some form. Small devices (sensors and actuators) raise issues of scale, power, security, management and the like.  Several of the projects address one or another aspect of the IoT vision. Overall, the landscape of IoT is not yet fully mapped, and there is probably no single architecture for IoT that will prevail. . However, there was a strong suggestion that the issues will not be centered on the data plane and packet forwarding, but on issues of configuration, security, power management and the like.     Most of the FIA proposals do not distinguish themselves from the current Internet on the basis of simple performance improvements (e.g., efficient use of links). However, the different schemes raise different and interesting questions about aspects of performance. Each of the funded projects discussed the key performance challenges raised by their proposals, and described research they are doing to address possible barriers to deployment of their schemes. Some of these mechanisms, if successful, might be of great benefit to the current Internet.       Last Modified: 04/13/2015       Submitted by: David D Clark]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
