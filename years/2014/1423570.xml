<AbstractNarration>Sensors are becoming omnipresent. A wide range of applications such as environmental monitoring, smart metering, and remote monitoring of roads are already making an extensive use of the sensor technology to measure and transmit a diverse set of physical signals over noisy wireless channels. Over the next decade, the number of machines and sensors connected to the Internet is expected to explode, creating the so called Internet of Things (IoT). It is foreseen that a significant portion of the quintillions of bytes of data that will be generated every day by IoT will be processed and transmitted using complexity, power, and energy constrained sensor nodes. For the sake of mathematical analysis, these practical constraints are usually relaxed or completely ignored, thereby simplifying the problem at hand, sometimes even to the extent that allows one to obtain closed-form solutions. The main goal of this research project is to question such simplifications commonly made among information/communication theory researchers, and to try to formulate more practically relevant problems which can still be analyzed rigorously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The practical constraints above will be solidified as zero-delay, peak-power-limited, and energy-distortion frameworks and combinations thereof in a multi-user joint source-channel coding setting. Preliminary analyses demonstrate that the solutions to the communication problems in these frameworks are significantly different from their counterparts in the classical infinite-delay average power-distortion framework. More specifically, the best known coding schemes in the classical framework become either provably suboptimal or not applicable at all. This research project will strive for complete characterizations of fundamental limits of communication under the aforementioned practical constraints.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to question some of the common assumptions among information/communication theory researchers, and to attack more practically relevant joint source-channel coding problems. In particular, we focused on three important system parameters; energy, peak power, and delay, and strived to better understand the performance limitations of communication systems with constraints on combinations of these parameters.  We took important steps towards understanding the energy and delay limitations in various communication scenarios and the impact of those limitations on the communication quality (i.e., distortion). This understanding will fuel development of practical coding schemes which can be used in sensor networks.   The results have been published and presented to the audiences of conferences such as IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, and Information Theory and Applications, and published in journals such as IEEE Transactions on Information Theory and IEEE Transactions on Communications.  The technical outcomes of the project can be summarized as below:  1) We computed upper and lower bounds on the distortion-energy tradeoff for the scenario of broadcasting a single source to two receivers, and demonsrated that the gap between the two bounds can be really small. We also devised a coding technique for broadcasting correlated Gaussian sources over Gaussian broadcast channels, where each receiver is interested in only one of the sources. Our scheme outperforms all the known schemes in the literature.   2) We proved that the best possible exponential rate of decay in the end-to-end distortion as the expended energy increases without bound can be achieved using zero-delay schemes if the distortion constraint is slightly relaxed to allow for "outage" events of very small probability. This is also true in the network scenario of broadcasting.  3) If we do not know the noise power in the channel in advance, but are required to achieve a "distortion-noise profile" where the communication scheme is required to be robust and achieve a certain distortion at each continuous noise level, we a) showed that uncoded transmission is optimal if the fidelity-quality profile is linear, b) proved that an exponentially increasing fidelity with respect to channel quality is impossible to achieve with finite energy, and c) devised lower and upper bounds on minimum energy when the fidelity-quality profile is quadratic.
