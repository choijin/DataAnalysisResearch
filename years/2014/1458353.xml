<AbstractNarration>The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Connections project at Lewis University will contribute well prepared graduates to the STEM workforce with advanced training in chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and chemical physics. It is designed to enhance physical sciences education through an experiential learning model based on real-world experiences. The scholars will be provided with a solid foundation for employment and graduate school in a competitive landscape. Specific emphasis will be placed on skills relevant to pressing societal issues, such as alternative energy, novel materials for information storage, next generation health care materials, and advanced optical technology. The college will leverage its relationships with nanotechnology companies, Argonne and Fermi National Laboratories, and the community to provide students with experiential learning opportunities. It will also expand its research collaborations with the labs and both domestic and international companies working in these advanced fields. Outreach and recruitment strategies will focus on academically qualified students from minority populations and thereby contribute to the diversity of the STEM workforce. The university will pilot several enhancements to its physical science programs through STEM Connections, providing evidence to support future expansion throughout the physical science programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STEM Connections will prepare students for physical science careers through an innovative process that emphasizes interdisciplinary connections in the context of real-world problem solving and workforce requirements. A special focus will be placed on interdisciplinary fields such as nanotechnology, materials science, and alternative energy. Connections will be strengthened among scholars to improve peer support and retention, and between students/faculty and outside institutions to improve engagement. STEM Connection will develop student understanding of interdisciplinary science, research methods, and how to apply science to real-world problems, as well as necessary skills in critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. An external evaluation will determine the impact of these strategies on enrollment, retention, graduation, and engagement. Extensive faculty and administrative support, up-to-date facilities, and a redesigned science curriculum will provide the resources to enable the university to accomplish its program objectives. Recruitment strategies will include using student and alumni networks, web-based marketing, and an on-campus mini-expo to connect with area high school students and their parents, teachers, and guidance counselors. Scholars will be supported financially through scholarships, and academically through first-year project-based experiences and foundational coursework linked to problem solving in industry and the community.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to providing scholarships, the project supported the academic development of the scholars and curricular innovations emphasizing experiential learning based on real-world experiences, with emphasis on the development of critical thinking; inquiry-based problem-solving; and project-based, interdisciplinary approaches to science. An important goal of the program was to prepare students for research and engage them early in their college careers. Inquiry-based and project-based labs, course-based undergraduate research experiences, and computational experiences were introduced throughout the General Physics and General Chemistry sequences. STEM Connections also extended the interdisciplinarity of this approach by linking sections of introductory physics, chemistry, and calculus courses. The Research Methods seminar which these students took their first year was significantly transformed to include a design project and experiential learning through participation in outreach activities. Many of the curricular developments developed in STEM Connections sections of these courses have been implemented in all sections of these courses so that all students can benefit from them.  While majors in physics and chemistry have several research and research-like experiences in their courses and labs, culminating in a Capstone project, 70% of STEM Connections scholarship awardees who remained in the physical sciences elected to participate in undergraduate research during their first three years, most participating for at least two semesters. STEM Connections scholarship awardees have been first-authors or co-authors on two journal articles and 12 national or regional conference presentations.  STEM Connections students also participated in a first semester seminar which introduced career paths and professional skills (e.g. resume writing, giving presentations, reading scientific papers), and they see professional skills again the Capstone curriculum through resume and cover letter writing and practicing interviewing skills through a mock interview.  They also attend colloquia, open to all students and faculty, throughout their college career where they learn about opportunities in academia, government labs, and industry as well as about a range of research topics in and applications of chemistry and physics.  In addition to the student research mentioned previously, STEM Connections faculty have presented on the program itself at five conferences so far. Activities developed through this program have also been used in outreach with local high school students and community groups. The Lewis STEM outreach program expanded significantly during the S-STEM award, reaching at least 4,500 K-12 students over the grant period by partnering with a wide range of schools, school groups, and community organizations. Many of the populations served were high needs or underrepresented in the physical sciences. These outreach activities both increase excitement and knowledge about science, and hopefully trust in science, in the community and provide our students the opportunity to develop their communication skills around engaging and informing the public about science.
