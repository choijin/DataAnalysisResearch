<AbstractNarration>The conference "Geometric and Asymptotic Group Theory with Applications" will take place in Newcastle NSW, Australia, on  July 21-25, 2014.  The meeting will attract the world's leading researchers in geometric and asymptotic group theory. This award is for support of some of the American participants, invited speakers and graduate students. The technological and societal impact of the proposed conference stems from potential wide applications to electronic communication and information security. There are also applications to computer science and complexity theory. The educational impact comes from the involvement of students and young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Geometric and Asymptotic Group Theory with Applications" conferences are devoted to the study of a variety of areas in geometric and combinatorial group theory, including asymptotic and probabilistic methods, as well as algorithmic and computational topics involving groups. In particular, areas of interest include group actions, isoperimetric functions, growth, asymptotic invariants, random walks, algebraic geometry over groups, algorithmic problems and their complexity, generic properties and generic complexity, and applications to non-commutative cryptography. The meeting is timed to precede the ICM in Korea in August, with two satellite meetings held in Japan and Korea starting Jul 30 that will be of interest to some participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found on the homepage of the conference:&lt;br/&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/gagta8/</AbstractNarration>
