<AbstractNarration>Many previous successes in information retrieval (IR) research have been based on open source software and test collections supported by university groups.  This project will extend open-source search engine software developed by the Lemur Project to support major emerging research areas that are important for the development of the next generation of search engines that will run on mobile, speech-based platforms and be capable of learning and adapting to individual users.  We will also add new capabilities that support large-scale collection of material from social media and common text mining tasks.  These extensions will also be an important part of training graduate students in computer science in these critical new research areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and social media on IR research has been significant and continues to grow.  Machine learning techniques, in particular, have been instrumental in helping to develop ranking functions that involve linear or non-linear combinations of many representation features of queries and documents.  The enhancements we will provide in Lemur to support ongoing research in these areas include tools for training parameters, defining and incorporating new features, learning-to-rank methods that are relatively easy to use and well-integrated with the other components of the search engine, and integration with NLP and data mining toolkits.  These enhancements, and the architectural changes to support multi-pass searching and flexible query processing, are not available currently in any open source search engine or IR toolkit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information, see the project web site at the URL:  http://www.lemurproject.org/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaboration between the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Carnegie Mellon University with the goal of developing new, open source software, to facilitate research in search engine development and improvement through integration with natural language processing tools to extract named entities from texts (persons, organizations, locations), support for flexible query definition and processing through new query transformations and addition of specialized index parts such as forward and annotation index parts, statistical summarization of feature use.  The Project developed, enhanced and improved four applications to aid and improve upon the creation and search of large scale text collections and to support new methods of searching these indexes. These applications include two search engines, a learning to rank library and text mining tools.  The Galago search engine provides a processing framework for efficient, distributed indexing of very large text corpora with index parts created for term and document based statistical access as well as integration of NLP tools to produce index parts from named entities extracted from texts. Galago also provided a framework for addition of new processing models, retrieval models, document scorers and new query operators to convert simply formulated general queries into more complex but effective queries. Researchers can determine effectiveness of new search components through Galago?s evaluation component supporting statistical testing of search results. Galago functions aid in understanding why documents get retrieved by allowing viewing of term and document index statistics, viewing of query tree node values, convenience in running retrieval experiments through a query format specification, a query operator wrap function, viewing of document content, meta information and tokenization, timing of batch query runs, specifying word stemming and viewing term stems and viewing collection, document and term statistics.  The Indri search engine is an older search engine that remains one of the most popular research tools and experimental baselines for information retrieval research.  The project provided maintenance, support, and regular biannual software releases for Indri to maintain its value to the research community.  RankLib supports several popular learning to rank libraries that are driven by user defined document features and result evaluation metrics to produce more effective ranking models. These ranking models can be tested for effectiveness using an evaluation module supporting many different statistical tests. Contribution of specific features can be indicated through the library's Feature Manager that may provide insight into which features are important or not important, allowing new features to be used in the place of unused or lightly used ones.  Lastly, the newly-developed Sifaka text mining application supports text mining in diverse, large-scale document collections. It is designed to be used by researchers in information science, social science, political science, and other disciplines where text analysis is important.  It supports advanced text representations, full-text search, frequency analysis, co-occurrence analysis, on-the-fly definition and population of categories, and export of feature vectors to popular machine learning software.  Sifaka lowers the barrier to entry for state-of-the-art text mining.  The project maintained and distributed the billion-page ClueWeb09 and 730-million page ClueWeb12 datasets, as well as several subsets designed to support specific research activities or evaluation campaigns.  These datasets are used widely by the international research community.  The project provided ten web-based search services for use by researchers with less ability to deploy search services for large datasets.  These services averaged 5,000 &ndash; 20,000 queries per month throughout the life of the project.  The search results were often used as experimental baselines in published research papers.  Indicative of the usefulness of Project software are the number of papers appearing in Computer Science conferences and journals that mention their use. Google Scholar reports almost 900 papers referencing Galago, Indri, Lemur Toolkit or RankLib as a part of a research effort. Graduate students at UMass and CMU have used these applications and tools for their own research, some of which have been accepted at prestigious conferences or by peer-reviewed journals in Computer Science.
