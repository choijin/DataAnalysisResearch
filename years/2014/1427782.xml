<AbstractNarration>This project will study two emerging and innovative technologies: interactive, dynamic simulations and touch-based tablet devices. The use of touch-based tablet technology (e.g., iPads) in the classroom is rapidly increasing, though little research has been done to understand effective implementation for learning science. Interactive simulations are now in use across K-16 levels of education, though what impact tablet devices have on the effective implementation of science simulations is not yet known. This project will explore this new frontier in education, over a range of contexts, providing new insight into effective interactive simulation design, classroom facilitation techniques, and the effects of tablet-based simulation use on underrepresented populations in STEM courses. Together, Dr. Emily Moore (PhET, UCB), a leader in interactive simulation design and classroom use, and Dr. Roy Tasker of the University of Western Sydney (UWS), a leader in chemistry education research, science visualizations, and teaching with technology, will research on the new technology frontier in science education - laying the groundwork for future investigations of foundational questions in technology use for learning science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has great potential to transform the future of science learning, making it both more engaging and more effective for diverse populations. The research findings will immediately impact 1) the design of new and existing PhET simulations - reaching millions of students and teachers using PhET simulations worldwide - and 2) the development of best practices guidelines for teachers using tablet technology to increase student learning, engagement, and participation in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to establish an international collaboration between the PhET Interactive Simulations project at the University of Colorado Boulder and a senior Australian researcher at the University of Western Sydney. The focus of the collaboration was to study the use of interactive chemistry simulations on tablet devices in classroom environments. Tablet devices provide unique affordances for interaction with chemistry representations (such as the ability to "grab" and rotate atoms or molecules directly through the tablet's touch interface), and novel supports for sharing, discussing, and interacting with the chemistry representations for collaborative group work.   Specifically, we were to have a 4-week planning visit, in which we collected preliminary data of students using interactive simulations on tablet devices in chemistry classrooms. Additionally, we would also begin collaboratively writing grant proposals to support continued foundational research and to develop best practice guidelines for the effective use of interactive simulations on tablet devices for chemistry learning.  Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, the collaborative visit was not able to occur as originally scheduled, and the Australian collaborator has since taken a position in the United States. Without the specific expertise of the Australian researcher coupled with the unique learning environments provided by the University of Western Sydney, this project could not be carried out.   No project activities were completed, and no National Science Foundation funds were spent.        Last Modified: 12/14/2015       Submitted by: Emily B Moore]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
