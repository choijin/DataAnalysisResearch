<AbstractNarration>The conference Mapping Class Groups and Teichmuller Theory - in Ramat Hanadiv, Israel, May 7-14, 2014 will make possible the participation of a large number of early career mathematicians at an important conference to assess the state of the field and build new connections between mathematicians in the areas of geometry and topology.  An important area in geometry is the study of the range of all possible shapes a given type of geometric object can take.  For example, one might study the range of all possible shapes of triangles, circles, or other kinds of geometric objects. Teichmüller theory takes as its objects 2-dimensional surfaces, and studies the shapes of these surfaces.  When a shape is symmetric, these symmetries are recorded by an algebraic notion called the "mapping class group".  From topology, to geometry, to physics, the interaction of these notions continues to produce new fruitful topics of study.  Indeed Teichmüller space (the "space of shapes") has its own geometry, and symmetries of the shapes appear as symmetries of Teichmüller space.  This conference will seek to introduce new researchers to emerging aspects and connections in this burgeoning field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of mapping class groups and Teichmüller theory lies at the intersection of a variety of important mathematical topics, including geometry, topology, geometric group theory, and representation theory. New research threads in these different subject areas have emerged recently, and the time is right to revisit the connections between such topics to assess parallels between their development.  While there are few mathematicians in Israel that work directly in the subject, there is a larger group of mathematicians that work in closely related areas, and great opportunity for enhancing connections between these working groups and those that exist elsewhere. The proposed conference on Mapping Class Groups and Teichmüller Theory, in Ramat Hanadiv, Israel, will provide a unique and new opportunity for scholars from a broad range of career stages to meet in Israel and interact with Israeli mathematicians in related areas, and will serve to broaden the geographic and intellectual base of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference URL: http://www.math.technion.ac.il/cms/decade_2011-2020/year_2013-2014/mapping/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mathematics frequently studies a geometric space using the notion of symmetry, this is the usual notion that a space looks the same under some kind of transformation or motion. When these symmetries are taken all together they form a group, in which combining any two yields a third. The mapping class group, provides a fundamental example of such a symmetry group, as it provides a way to think about the symmetries of a surface in space (or viewed abstractly as an entity).  The Project, and the Conference that it supported, brought together researchers from an international community whose research focuses on the properties and behavior of this group. A related notion of a mapping class group, the outer automorphism group of a free group, studies the ways that certain 'graphs' (sets of edges connected at their vertices at the endpoitns) can be symmetric. These symmetry groups are deeply related to mapping class groups of certain kinds of surfaces 'with boundary' - picture a donut with a 'hole' on its surface.  These groups are very classical in nature, and in the picture provided they describe the kinds of symmetries the triangles with the curved edges can have - this M.C. Escher-esque picture is literally an encoding of certain types of fractions that bear simple relationships to one another, and the mapping class group in question is represented as a collection of 'matrices'.  By exploring different methods of understanding the structure of these groups, the participants in the conference delved deeper into known classical and cutting edge results in the field, made new connections between research topics, and forged new directions for future research.  The conference was particularly notable for its range of different levels of seniority in its participants. There was a close to even balance of younger (pre-tenure) mathematicians and students, with the more senior participants. The impact of the conference stretched well into the work of these younger populations, generating new thesis topics for the students, and furthering the collaborative efforts of current researchers to address topics across the diffierent sub-specialties represented by the researchers involved.  The conference also served to bridge communities of researchers working in the US with a very active and dynamic community working in Israel.  The particular combinatorial techniques involved in studying mapping class groups involve how to arrange and understand the collection of 'loops' on a surface, up to 'isotopy' (which allows one to slide the loop around on the surface without cutting it). The tools to organize these 'isotopy classes' of loops, involve a study of the geometry of 'nodes and edges' in space, very akin to the study of 'networks' and 'large data sets' currently under considerable scrutiny.
