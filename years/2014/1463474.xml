<AbstractNarration>Additive solution-based printing of electronic devices with nanoparticle dispersions is technologically attractive and inspires new sensing and information processing technologies.  The key impediment for its wider use in nanomanufacturing is the presence of protective organic layer needed for their stabilization that hampers the charge transfer between nanoparticles.  Its resolution has had considerable academic success but new strategies in this direction are needed in order to reduce the cost, energy requirements, improve its scalability, and alleviate environmental concerns.  Realization of their low-temperature self-assembly into films with continuous crystallinity and competitive electrical properties will benefit energy storage/harvesting technologies, optoelectronics, and wearable health monitoring devices. The use of earth-abundant materials can potentially open different areas of applications in 'smart buildings' and agriculture that are expected to have a wide ranging ripple effect and contribute to improving the sustainability of the US economy.  Novel teaching and learning programs will engender the next generation of innovators with a fundamental understanding of nanotechnology and the technological thresholds for nanomanufacturing, allowing new and creative devices to be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the objective of forming films with continuous crystallinity and competitive electrical properties, the projected method will take advantage of the ability of nanoparticles to self-assemble following the oriented attachment mechanism. This recently discovered technique leads to the self-orientation of the crystal lattices at their boundaries, which should greatly increase conductivity.  This project will focus on the realization of oriented attachment for earth-abundant nanoparticles exemplified by the n-type semiconductor Cu2S. This material is attractive for nanomanufacturing not only because of its environmentally benign nature and low cost, but also for its promising electronic, plasmonic, and ion intercalation properties. Resolution of practical and fundamental issues surrounding the charge transport dilemma of solution-processed nanoparticle devices is central to this study.  The findings expected for Cu2S can be extended to other device-relevant semiconductors, such as FeS2. Within three years, transition from basic understanding of self-assembly processes of Cu2S nanoparticles to crafting highly conductive films and nanomanufactured devices exemplified by lithium battery cathodes is expected.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we set-up the goal to develop energy-efficient low-temperature self-assembly of NPs into films with continuous crystallinity and competitive electrical properties. These methods of nanotechnology will benefit  both traditional and emerging industries including but not limited by energy storage and harvesting technologies, optoelectronics, and wearable electronics  devices.  We were successful in achieving this goal  and demonstrated  that nanoparticles of earth-abundant materials, such as iron sulfide, zinc sulfide, copper, silicon and others can spontaneously produce conducting pathways in the solid-state composites.  These materials are directly applicable in batteries and flexible sensors.      Specifically, the work on materials design of anodes for high capacity batteries can be highlighted.  The safety and performance of the high capacity batteries has been hindered by the large mechanical stresses during ion insertion/extraction processes that lead to the loss of physical integrity of the active layers. Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembled nanocomposites were able to mitigate structural design challenges for materials requiring the combination of contrarian properties in the past. As a part of this project we showed that materials engineering capabilities of LBL augmented by self-organization of nanoparticles (NPs) during the layer deposition leading to lattice-to-lattice connectivity can be exploited for constructing multiscale composites for high capacity lithium ion anodes.  This manufacturing approach mitigate the contrarian nature of three central parameters most relevant for advanced batteries: large intercalation capacity, high conductance, and robust mechanics.

This project, therefore,  paved the way to finding a method for resolution of the general property conflict for materials utilized in for energy technologies.   As an outreach component of the project we were focused on educating the next generation of innovators with a fundamental understanding of nanotechnology and practical aspects of nanomanufacturing.  In particular, the project enabled participation of undergraduate and graduate students from University of Michigan in collaborative interactions with Detroit area battery manufacturer.  Five students were also engaged in customer discovery process aimed at better understanding of the needs of battery communities.  The PI of the project mentored four high school students from Michigan and two high school technology competition teams &ndash; one from  Massachusetts and one from California.
