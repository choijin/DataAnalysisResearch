<AbstractNarration>The planned University of Tennessee, Knoxville site of the I/UCRC for Integrative Materials Joining for Energy Applications has the potential to allow accelerated development and deployment of hybrid material systems for energy applications and will be focused on the scale-up of proven laboratory developments relevant to automotive, aerospace, and energy applications. The research has the potential to enable scientific discoveries related to the thermo-mechanical-chemical properties of interfaces between these constituent materials to be achieved. Advanced in-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques will be applied to understand issues such as cyclic thermal and stress loading, residual stress development, and microstructural evolution. This new site plans to produce fundamental research at the crossroads of joining and additive manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the planned site on joining and additive manufacturing of advanced materials is of central importance to the competitiveness of the automotive, aerospace, and energy sectors. The planned new site plans to work with Hardin Valley Elementary School (HVES) to recruit students for forming and mentoring independent FIRST LEGOfi League (FLL) team(s) as they tackle real-world engineering challenges. This interaction with elementary school children might be their first towards introducing and encouraging them to consider STEM choices in their future academic careers. Additionally, the proposed site of CIMJSEA will collaborate with non-profit organizations in Tennessee and the College of Engineering Office of Diversity Programs in order to foster interaction with underrepresented groups over a wide range of ages.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A successful planning meeting was held in early December 2014.  It was determined that there was enough industrial support to go through with a full proposal to NSF and the full proposal was submitted to NSF in March 2015.
