<AbstractNarration>In the fifty years since the discovery of quasars, a picture of these enigmatic objects has emerged wherein quasars are supermassive black holes residing at the centers of large galaxies. The black hole may have a mass of millions to billions times that of the sun. As this picture implies, the quasar phenomenon is one and the same as that of the objects referred to as "active galactic nuclei." All are characterized by enormous luminosity such that the quasar frequently outshines the light from all of the billions of stars in its host galaxy. Their extreme luminosity makes it possible to observe quasars located at billions of light-years from earth.  Due to the finite speed of light, this means that astronomers can literally observe quasars at an earlier epoch in the universe, the age of the formation of galaxies.  This project will specifically study pairs of quasars.  Quasar pairs are relatively rare and are not physically associated with one another. Instead, they are a superposition of two quasars at different distances that appear close together on the sky.  As the light from the more distant quasar passes by the nearer one, any gas in the halo of the galaxy hosting the latter quasar, the so-called "circumgalactic medium," imprints a signature on the spectrum of the more distant quasar, allowing the study of the characteristics of that gas and giving clues as to the mechanism of the formation of the host galaxy.  This team of researchers has assembled a sample of such pairs and will use them to study the circumgalactic gas as well as the gas between galaxies.  The project will also support internship programs at a minority-serving college and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an extension of the well-established Quasars Probing Quasars project into several new scientific directions and support astronomical outreach into the Hispanic community of Salinas Valley.  Specific scientific emphasis will be concentrated on the  circumgalactic medium of massive galaxies, AGN physics, and the intergalactic medium at  redshift of about 2. The project will utilize data from essentially every large-aperture, optical/near-IR telescope and will leverage state-of-the-art cosmological simulations to interpret results and test theories of galaxy formation, quasar  feedback, cosmic re-ionization, and supermassive black hole evolution.  The core of the project will be the use of pairs of quasars to probe the intergalactic and circumgalactic media at high redshift as well as to provide evidence for the resolution of fundamental questions in quasar physics.  Typical quasar pairs are not physically associated with one another but the light from the background quasar is imprinted by material associated from the nearer, lower redshift member of the pair.  This allows determination of the size of structure in any absorbing gas along with its density, mass, etc.  Three distinct but coupled programs will be supported:  (1) to test theories of galaxy formation by elucidating the properties of the circumgalactic medium around galaxies hosting quasars and sub-millimeter galaxies; (2) to estimate timescales for the active galaxy phenomenon using the transverse proximity effect; and (3) make the first measurements of the small scale structure of the intergalactic medium at redshifts around 2.  This is an ambitious program for which the PI and his collaborators have the necessary physical resources (telescope time, etc.) and intellectual prowess.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Quasar Probing Quasars (QPQ) survey was a comprehensive, international program designed to discover and perform follow-up spectroscopic observations of pairs of quasars (luminous, super-massive black holes in the distant universe). Although rare on the sky, quasar pair candidates may be identified in wide-field imaging surveys and then confirmed with optical spectroscopy on medium-aperture telescopes. Our group led this area of research for the past decade. Once discovered, these quasar pairs may be studied to pursue a wide range of scientific activities from cosmology to galaxy formation to exploration of AGN activity, properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and the growth of black holes.    During the duration of this grant, our primary results were:  Generated a dataset of over 500 quasar pairs including ~70 with physical separations of less than 200kpc and ~30 at z~4. Studied the physical environment of the massive galaxies hosting z~2 quasars via absorption-line spectroscopy of the background (b/g) quasar of projected quasar pairs.  Our results demonstrated that the galaxies hosting quasars exhibit the extrema of cool gas, in terms of surface density, chemistry, and dynamical motions.   This indicates that the galaxies hosting quasars are rapidly forming stars and assembling their systems.  Furthermore, it casts doubt on theories that invoke quasars to terminate the star-formation within galaxies. Probed the thermal history of the universe at z&gt;2. With quasar pair spectroscopy, one can resolve the so-called smoothing Jeans scale which is sensitive to the integrated heat dumped into the gas between galaxies.  Our group has developed a novel technique to perform this research and applied this to our spectra for the first time. Imaged the nebulae of z~2 quasars in HI Lya with narrow-band filters and integral field-unit spectrographs.  Inspired by our QPQ research to study gas in absorption, we initiated a program to examine the same cool gas in emission.  Despite its relatively faint nature, we have been successful in mapping this medium to great distances from the quasar and its host galaxy.  This establishes directly (as opposed to statistically) the great masses of cool gas in these systems.  Furthermore, the observations map the dynamics of the gas on these same scales to inform models on the accretion of cool gas which inspires future star-formation.     Regarding broader impacts, the primary activity was to support the mentorship and research activities of a series of undergraduates (from UCSC and Hartnell University) drawn from underrepresented populations.  These individuals led independent research projects and were trained in observational astronomy, data analysis, statistics, scientific writing, and scientific presentations. The funding also partially supported the development of astronomical software that benefits the greater community and the release of all the data obtained during the project.
