<AbstractNarration>CBET 1336353&lt;br/&gt;There is currently very little known about the environmental implications of rigid highly anisotropic nanostructures. Nanorods possessing high aspect ratios (AR = length:diameter) are an exciting nanomaterial class with many potential applications. To date, however, only a limited number of studies have examined the environmental fate of these elongated nanomaterials. The lack of work in this area is particularly surprising given that it has been definitively shown that anisotropy affects how nanorods interact with biological systems. The underlying hypothesis driving the present effort is that changes in AR and surface chemistry will alter the mechanisms and kinetics dictating nanorod fate in riverine systems. To test this hypothesis the PIs have developed a research plan that consists of four highly inter-related project tasks: In Task 1 we will synthesize gold nanorods with varying AR and we will then functionalize them using a range of environmentally relevant metal oxides (e.g., SiO2, gamma-Fe2O3, CeO2) to obtain a suite of nanomaterials that exhibit both shape and surface chemical heterogeneity. These nanorods will then be used in studies to evaluate nanorod aggregation (Task 2), nanorod deposition (Task 3), and uptake by the filter feeding bivalve Corbicula fluminea (Task 4). Completion of each of these tasks is an important undertaking in its own right; however, we have developed a cohesive research plan in which the knowledge gained in any one task is used to help refine the overall research plan.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;Anisotropic nanoparticles are being produced in an ever-expanding variety of shapes and sizes in ever-increasing quantities. Presently  ery little is known about the environmental implications of these highly complex nanomaterials. The effort proposed herein will provide a fundamental basis for the description of how material anisotropy dictates nanomaterial fate in environmental matrices. The expected intellectual outcomes of this effort are i) systematic examination of nanorod aggregation kinetics and fractal dimension as a function of aspect ratio and solution chemistry (ii) delineation of deposition mechanisms by the systematic variation of particle properties (AR, surface chemistry) and collector parameters (e.g., collector size and surface roughness) in column studies; and (iii) quantification of the effects of AR on nanomaterial uptake by the ubiquitous filter feeder C. fluminea. Although our focus is on gold and gold-core nanorods, the results obtained are expected to be translatable to other anisotropic materials. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;A multi-dimensional approach to broader impacts has been developed. This approach leverages existing programs at the three collaborating institutions while working to integrate efforts across the groups. Research dissemination and outreach. The PIs will collectively promote and disseminate the research results through existing community programs in Virginia, South Carolina, and Illinois. In addition, the  results of this project will be broadcast to a broad technical audience through the traditional pathways of peer-reviewed publications and presentations at relevant conferences. Outreach efforts will target minority students in local high schools. Undergraduate research.  Undergraduate research opportunities will be made available at all three collaborating institutions. Over the course of their careers,  the PIs have collectively supported over 90 undergraduate researchersin their laboratories (a significant percentage of whom are members of historically under-represented groups in science and engineering) and this effort will provide additional undergraduate research  opportunities. Undergraduate and graduate education. The research proposed in this effort combines nanomaterial synthesis and characterization techniques with colloidal physical principles in a manner that is not routinely found in undergraduate chemistry or environmental engineering curricula. Given this fact, all three PIs will take part in the development and production of classroom  material (e.g., lectures, demonstrations) based upon this research that will be incorporated into courses at all three institutions.</AbstractNarration>

The length to diameter ratio or aspect ratio (AR) can play a significant role in controlling the environmental processes; i.e., how these rod-shaped materials will aggregate and deposit in aquatic systems and how these will interact with aquatic species. The main purpose of this project is to systematically evaluate the influence of AR of a model rod-shaped nanomaterial (i.e., gold nanorods) in its environmental fate, transport, and biological toxicity. The University of Texas at Austin (UT) team focused on the aggregation and porous media transport or deposition aspects of this project.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p>In this project,&nbsp;laboratory experiments have been conducted to evaluate the role of AR of gold nanorods on aggregation and porous-media transport. Synthesized and characterized gold nanospheres and nanorods (at University of Illinois) have been used to study self-aggregation and porous-media transport of the rods in single and multi-particle systems. Dynamic light scattering and saturated packed-bed column studies are performed to assess these environmental processes. At the end of the project, another set of inorganic materials, i.e., high-AR halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) and low-AR kaolinite were employed to evaluate the transport mechanism of &lsquo;interception&rsquo; that may play a large role in the&nbsp;removal of rod-shaped nanomaterials. Packed-bed column studies and controlled microfluidics studies have been performed to evaluate pore-scale removal mechanisms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Negatively charged poly(acrylic) acid coated nanorods with AR of 5 and 10 showed higher stability in water compared to the same diameter nanospheres. The increased stability with the increase in AR likely resulted from lower diffusion of the rods in water as well as due to side-by-side repulsion (electrostatic and steric) from densely packed charged poly(acrylic acid) chains. Further evaluation of the nature of the&nbsp;attachment of nanorods was performed with cetyltrimethylammonium-bromide (CTAB) capped (positively charged) rods (AR 4.4) and spheres. Presence of di-valent sulfate anions caused end-to-end attachment of the rods in&nbsp;water. The end-to-end long assemblies of the rods could be controlled by varying sulfate ion concentration, nanorod concentration, and exposure time. The aggregation results indicated that nanorods have higher stability in water with a preference to end-to-end attachment (under the solution composition studied).</p> <p>Porous-media transport of gold nanospheres in a&nbsp;complex multi-particle system (i.e., in presence of a secondary nanoparticle, single-walled carbon nanotubes, SWNTs) provided interesting insight into co-transport of nanoparticles. When gold nanospheres were suspended with SWNTs in water, the&nbsp;heterodispersionwas highly mobile in the porous media. However, if the porous-media collectors (i.e., sand grains) were pre-coated with SWNTs, the mobility of nanospheres decreased significantly (or the removal increased). These results indicated that presence and order of introduction of a secondary particle (like SNWTs) can profoundly influence the mobility of gold nanoparticles through&nbsp;porous-media.</p> <p>The mechanism of removal of rod-shaped nanomaterials was assessed with gold nanospheres and nanorods as well as with inorganic HNTs and kaolinite. Out of the three known transport mechanisms (i.e., sedimentation, diffusion, and&nbsp;interception), interception (i.e., snatching a particle out of the streamline by collector grain) is known to contribute the least for nano-scale particle removal in&nbsp;porous-media. In case of&nbsp;rod-shape&nbsp;materials, the rotational diffusion of the particles can increase the removal by interception. Transport of nanosphere and nanorods through porous-media in a range of flow velocity (between 0.002 to 0.1 cm/s, the range of groundwater flow velocity) showed that AR of up to 11 did not significantly influence porous-media transport of the nanorods. To further assess the role of AR, HNTs (with AR as high as 40) were used; results indicated that high-AR HNTs were deposited more at this low-velocity condition when compared to the low-AR kaolinite. Microfluidics study showed that high-AR HNTs were preferentially deposited on the sides of collectors compared to uniform removal of low-AR kaolinites. The results indicated that high-AR nanomaterials have a tendency to be mobile in porous-media due to enhancement in their removal by interception.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>:&nbsp;</p> <p>The scientific results of rod-shaped nanomaterial aggregation and porous-media transport were disseminated through multiple conference presentations and a workshop lecture.
