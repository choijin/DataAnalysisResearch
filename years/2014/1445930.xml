<AbstractNarration>This student travel grant supports graduate/undergraduate students enrolled in US institutions to attend ACM Multimedia 2014 conference. ACM Multimedia is the worldwide premier conference in the multimedia field, covering latest technical papers, technical demos, grand challenge competition, open source software competition, doctoral symposium. It is extremely valuable for US students to take advantage of the unique research and education programs provided by this conference. Participation in such event allows students to learn/experience innovative research, develop professional networks, and interact with industry and academia leaders involved in practical applications and technology transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACM Multimedia conference offers various activities which particularly benefit students who are involved in research in this area. First, it hosts a Doctoral Symposium which will provide PhD students to present their ongoing work and receive feedback from established researchers.  This also aims to establish a supportive worldwide community, and build professional networks for PhD students. Second, Multimedia Grand Challenges presents a set of problems and issues from industry leaders, geared to engage the Multimedia research community in solving relevant, interesting and challenging questions about the industry's 3-5 year vision for multimedia.  Third, the ACM Multimedia Open-Source Software Competition is designed to promote the contribution of freely available resources, which advance the field by providing a common set of tools for building and improving multimedia research prototypes. Finally, the large Technical Demonstration session is intended as real, practical, and interactive proof of the presenters' research ideas and scientific or engineering contributions. This session allows students to demonstrate their own novel research prototypes, and also to view and interact first hand with live evidence of innovative solutions and ideas in the field of multimedia.</AbstractNarration>
