<AbstractNarration>This project will develop algorithms and software tools for extracting the written text from volumetric, non-destructive scans of scrolls, which were carbonized in the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum as a result of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. The library from Herculaneum, which was first discovered in 1752, is of immense interest to scholars worldwide. The excavated collection contains more than 1800 carbonized papyrus scrolls, and is the only library known to have survived from classical antiquity. All attempts at physically opening the scrolls have created profound damage, and many scrolls (nearly 300) are still intact. This project will build a computational framework in order to "digitally unroll" two complete scrolls, producing a comprehensive, non-invasive solution to the technical challenges and prescribing a path for the scholarly assembly and publication of all inaccessible texts in the Herculaneum collection. This will definitively establish that volumetric, non-destructive imaging methods can reveal complete texts that were long thought lost. The algorithms developed in this project will set the stage for the interdisciplinary discovery of new works from antiquity, the scaling of these methods and algorithms to the complete Herculaneum collection, and the broader interest in volumetric analysis for cultural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Herculaneum scrolls were written with carbon-based inks that create a challenging scenario for volumetric methods because density variations are very small. This work will overcome that problem using phase contrast tomography from a synchrotron beam in order to build high resolution volumetric models that show better contrast at ink boundaries. Because the internal structure of the Herculaneum rolls is complex, chaotic, and fully 3D, slice-based segmentation strategies fail when the surfaces turn into the dominant slice directions. Instead the segmentation approach will be based on registered multi-modal scans and a 3D structure tensor approach for building surface estimates from local multiscale volumetric operators and region-growing methods. The estimated papyrus surface segmentation will be locally re-positioned using optimization methods that improve the expected surface texture, and then digitally flattened to produce clear, flat views of the internal surfaces of the scrolls. This work will expand volumetric imaging toward a more widely used representational platform and will address fundamental technical challenges in segmentation, registration, representation, and visualization. The project will implement the developed segmentation and unwrapping algorithms as software tools so that non-scientists will be enabled to extract new images of text directly from volumetric data sets of scrolls.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We accomplished each of the major goals.  We completed the development of the algorithms for extracting written text from a volumetric scan, and we implemented these algorithms into an open-source software package that we have tested with non-expert (non-CS) users.  We have prescribed a processing pipeline and published the framework in Science Advances.  We have revealed a new text, previously inaccessible, in the scroll from En Gedi, which turned out to be a major discovery and a significant contribution to Biblical Archaeology.  The primary impetus for these accomplishments was the En Gedi scroll.  The Herculaneum material has proved to be more challenging, and as yet we have not revealed a complete unrolled text to the world.  We have, however, made major progress toward this ultimate goal.  First, there are two major challenges we have faced with Herculaneum material:  the chemistry of the ink;  and access to material.  The ink does not show contrast to the naked eye in micro-CT or even phase-contrast micro-CT easily based on density alone because it is primarily carbon black ink, with only very small amounts of trace elements and contaminants as differentiators from the carbonized papyrus substrate.  Access to material is difficult.  There are only four institutions which hold this material in the world:  The biblioteca nationale in Naples, Italy;  the Institut de France in Paris;  The British Library in London;  and the Bodleian Library in Oxford.  Second, we have made major progress on two challenges.  The first is technical.  We have implemented a machine learning framework based on new observations of the morphological behavior of carbon-based ink on papyrus in tomography.  We believe this framework can reveal carbon ink - even subtle evidence of it - in tomography.  The second is collaborative.  We have received permission from the Bodleian Library in Oxford to access their Herculaneum collection, a major project goal.  We also finalized negotiations with the Institut de France to restore access to their materials, giving our project two pathways for access to material.  In addition, at the very end of the project period, we signed an open scholarship agreement with the Biblioteca Nazionale de Napoli giving us access to the entire collection.
