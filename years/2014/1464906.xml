<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-B) and Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&amp;E) programs are supporting Professors Elfi Kraka and Dieter Cremer at Southern Methodist University to derive a general design principle for the next generation of chemical catalysts combining features of homogenous and enzyme catalysis. The unified reaction valley approach (URVA) of Cremer and Kraka aims to serve as a quantum chemical tool to study the mechanism of catalyzed reactions at a greater level of  than is currently easily achieved.  URVA acts like a "high-resolution-camera" attached to the reaction complex,  being able to reveal the interplay between vibrations and the electronic structure changes of the reaction complex. It records all events when the reaction complex follows the energy valley on the reaction side up to the energy pass point and then down through the exit valley to the products. Important and less important events are differentiated by analyzing direction and curvature of the reaction path rather than features of the reaction complex itself. Basic differences between and catalyzed and non-catalyzed reactions can be determined in this way, but also the limitations of man-made catalysts are apparent.  Enzymes are the well-tuned catalysts developed in response to stringent survival pressures. Given the remarkable catalytic power seen in many enzymes, the major focus will be on the extension and application of the URVA methodology to enzyme catalysis to determine its major advantages. The mechanism of transition metal, non-transition metal or metal-free- and (artificial) enzyme-catalyzed reactions will be systematically analyzed and compared. A strategy for de novo catalyst design is to be developed, which, by including aspects of both chemo- and bio-catalysis, can serve as an incubator for enhanced interdisciplinary efforts to generate target-specific catalysts.  The data of all reactions investigated (including reaction movies) will be collected in the CATCO reaction library, which will increase to more than 500 reactions. This library will be available to the chemical community for research, teaching, and student training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past two years, URVA has proven to be a unique tool for the mechanistic study of more than 150 homogenous catalysis reactions. In addition to following the chemical processes of bond breaking and forming, URVA uses a substantially improved algorithm for following the reaction valley far out into the van der Waals region to monitor pre- and post-chemical processes in a high level of detail. The direction and curvature of the reaction valley are analyzed in terms of internal coordinate or curvilinear coordinate components and then directly related to electronic structure changes. Other essential tools of URVA are the local vibrational mode analysis, the charge transfer and charge polarization analysis as well as the presentation of the chemical reaction in terms of reaction phases.  Method development will include the design and programming of i) URVA methodologies for an implicit or explicit inclusion of solvent effects, ii) 2-component relativistic methods for the investigation of "relativistic" systems, and iii) new QM/MM methodologies for the description of chemical reactions in an enzymatic environment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In recent years, one has started to substitute traditional chemical processes relying on heavy metal catalysts (often leading to toxic byproducts) with Nature's powerful way of producing environmentally pure compounds under eco-friendly conditions using enzymes as catalysts. This new trend goes hand in hand with the development of new technologies in enzyme engineering. One important prerequisite for optimizing and fine-tuning biocatalytic reactions for an industrial scale is the detailed understanding of the mechanism at the atomic level, which is still in its infancy. If we succeed in mimicking aspects of natural processes while implementing features of traditional catalysts, we will take the precision and selectivity of our chemistry to an entirely new level.</p> <p>During the past funding period the Computational and Theoretical Chemistry Group (CATCO) at SMU has extended and revised its Unified Reaction Valley Approach (URVA) to comply with this challenge. URVA analyzes the reaction complex (RC, e.g. the union of reacting molecules) as it moves along the reaction path on the PES from the entrance channel, up to the transition state and down into the exit channel. Any electronic structure change of the RC is registered by its vibrations. As sketched in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 1</strong>, changes in the vibrations in turn lead to a change in their coupling with the translational motion along the reaction path. The&nbsp;<em>Reaction Path Hamiltonian</em>&nbsp;approach of Handy, Miller, and Adams spans the reaction valley via the translational motion along the path and molecular vibrations perpendicular to it and calculates at each path point&nbsp;<em>s</em>&nbsp;the vibrational-translational coupling via the so-called curvature coupling coefficients B<sub>&mu;,</sub><sub>s</sub>,&nbsp;which can be used to recover the&nbsp;<em>scalar reaction path curvature</em>&nbsp;&kappa;(<em>s</em>) = |<strong>&kappa;</strong>(<em>s</em>)|. That means&nbsp;&kappa;(<em>s</em>) directly reflects the changes in the electronic structure of the RC during the chemical reaction. Therefore, the key feature of URVA is the analysis of&nbsp;&kappa;(<em>s</em>). Analyzing more than 685 reaction paths, we could confirm that each chemical event (e.g. bond breakage/formation, rehybridization, charge transfer and charge polarization, etc.) corresponds to a local curvature maximum&nbsp;<strong>Km</strong>&nbsp;flanked by two curvature minima&nbsp;<strong>Mn</strong>, e.g., locations of minimal electronic structure change of the RC. Different chemical reactions possess different curvature patterns, which we use as their&nbsp;<em>chemical fingerprints</em>, see&nbsp;<strong>Figure 2a</strong>. Two important new features were added to URVA, i) the curvature decomposition into components disclosing which parameters dominate a certain chemical event, see&nbsp;<strong>Figure 2b</strong>&nbsp;and ii) the calculation of&nbsp;&kappa;(<em>s</em>) on the fly avoiding the intermediate storage of large Hessians, an important prerequisite for URVA enzyme studies. Another important feature of URVA is that we can &nbsp;now directly compare reactions in different environments, such as gas phase, solution, and inside a protein.</p> <p>We successfully performed the first URVA QM/MM studies of enzyme reactions. As an example, the Claisen rearrangement of chorismate catalyzed by&nbsp;<em>Bacillus subtilis Chorismate Mutase</em>&nbsp;(BsCM) is summarized in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 3</strong>. We compared the mechanism in the gas phase, in solution and in the enzyme, and could first the first time clarify that the enzyme does not change the mechanism but lowers the barrier via space confinement.&nbsp;&nbsp;We complemented the URVA analysis with our local mode analysis, which has led to a unique description of the intrinsic strength of a chemical bond or weak chemical interaction, extensively explored during the funding period. Applying the local mode analysis to chorismate, the resulting rearrangement product prephenate and the corresponding transition state in the enzyme, we could also clarify that the enzyme does not lower the barrier via special H-bonding in the transition state, as has been speculated, see&nbsp;<strong>Figure 4</strong>. We then investigated how a gold catalyst would lower the rearrangement barrier, namely by splitting up the rearrangement into two steps, as revealed by&nbsp;<strong>Figure 5.</strong></p> <p>Another interesting outcome was that we could shed light into the question if there is a connection between the changes in the potential energy surface (PES) as reflected by the curvature maxima and the changes in the electron density (ED) distribution as monitored by changes in the Laplacian of&nbsp;&rho;(<strong>r</strong>), when a bond breaks/forms along the reaction path. By a systematic comparison of these two approaches for a series of chemical reactions ranging from hydrogen migration to cycloaddition reactions and gold(I) catalysis, we could for the first time unravel this PES-ED relationship. We found that the ED changes always occur in the vicinity of a curvature peak (see&nbsp;<strong>Figure 6</strong>) in accordance with the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, which postulates the existence of a relationship between energy and density. &nbsp;</p> <p>All URVA results were systematically collected in a&nbsp;<em>Reaction Library&nbsp;</em>with currently 685 entries, including 470 homogeneous catalysis, 167 organic and 48 enzymatic reactions. The library provides for each reaction comprehensive details about the URVA analysis in the form of tables, plots, coordinates, snapshots, and interactive movies, allowing to follow the chemical reaction in real time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/02/2020<br>      Modified by: Elfi&nbsp;Kraka</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464906/1464906_10359662_1583171244206_Outcomes-3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464906/1464906_10359662_1583171244206_Outcomes-3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3: Chorismate Mutase Story, Part I"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464906/1464906_10359662_1583171244206_Outcomes-3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Chorismate Mutase Story, Part I"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3: First successful QM/MM URVA study of an enzyme reaction: Chorismate mutase catalyzed chorismate rearrangement</div> <div class="imageCredit">Created by PI</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Elfi&nbsp;Kraka</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3: Chorismate Mutase Story, Part I</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464906/1464906_10359662_1583171180348_Outcomes-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464906/1464906_10359662_1583171180348_Outcomes-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2: Curvature profile"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464906/1464906_10359662_1583171180348_Outcomes-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Curvature profile"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">igure 2: (a) Curvature profile of a chemical reaction;
