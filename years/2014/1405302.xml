<AbstractNarration>One of the greatest threats to the health of North America's Great Lakes is invasion by exotic species, several of which already have had catastrophic impacts on property values, the fisheries, shipping, and tourism industries, and continue to threaten the survival of native species and wetland ecosystems.  Additional species have been placed on watchlists because of their potential to become aquatic invasives.  This project will create a network of herbaria and zoology museums from among the Great Lakes states of MN, WI, IL, IN, MI, OH, and NY to better document the occurrence of these species in space and time by imaging and providing online access to the information on the specimens of the critical organisms. Several initiatives are already in place to alert citizens to the dangers of spreading aquatic invasives among our nation's waterways, but this project will develop complementary scientific and educational tools for scientists, students, wildlife officers, teachers, and the public who have had little access to images or data derived directly from preserved specimens collected over the past three centuries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This bi-national Thematic Collections Network of &gt;25 institutions from eight states and Canada will digitize 1.73 million historical specimens representing 2,550 species of exotic fish, clams, snails, mussels, algae, plants, and their look-alikes documented to occur in the Great Lakes Basin. It is one of the first efforts to digitize liquid preserved specimens and to integrate cross-kingdom taxa and these methods could become national standards for cross taxon digitization. Students will be provided with hands-on experience in modern methods of specimen curation and this cross-taxon network will provide greater flexibility to existing web platforms for integration of data. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A bi-national network consisting of four lead institutions and twenty-two collaborating collections across the Great Lakes Region (with inclusion of additional data from nine Canadian herbaria via the Canadensys project) was created to digitize specimens representing 2,550 species of exotic and potentially invasive fish, clams, snails, mussels, algae, plants, and their look-alikes known to occur in the Great Lakes Basin.  The goal of this project was to better document the occurrence of these species in space and time by imaging and providing online access to the information on the specimens of the critical organisms via a project portal (http://greatlakesinvasives.org) and iDigBio.  A portion of the project leveraged prior NSF-funded specimen-digitization efforts and technological approaches developed through the Tri-Trophic TCN project.   Approximately 750,000 specimens were imaged and 1,000,000 digital records were created/enhanced across the project, adding significantly to the publicly-available information about existing collections of these species resident in the participating museum collections.  The portion of the project that was undertaken at the University of Michigan included imaging 51,400 plant specimens, 10,326 lots of mollusks, and 2,393 individuals of fish.  These images were loaded to the project portal along with associated data records created and/or enhanced during the project.   Two subcontracts covered label transcription for approximately 6,600 plant specimens housed at nine members of the Michigan Small Herbarium Initiative and the imaging of 19,300 specimens at the herbarium of Miami University       Last Modified: 08/27/2018       Submitted by: Richard Rabeler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
