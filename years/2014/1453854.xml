<AbstractNarration>This research will implement a "lab on a chip" ChemFET (Chemically sensitive Field Effect Transistor) sensor array in a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology that includes sensors with calibration and read-out circuitry all in a common substrate. Selective membranes or coatings deposited on the surface will enhance selectivity for a target molecule or ion to achieve a multi-parametric sensor array. As for potential applications of these biosensors, low cost/low power sensors can be used to crowd source monitoring of the environment. The benefit to society will be in terms of bringing the feasibility of ubiquitous sensing to reality. The acquired sensing data can provide information about the environment and alert people to dangerous conditions. Further, this information can be mined and analyzed with applications in safety and environmental monitoring, production control, and healthcare. Finally, the proposed research will be used to create a classroom experience at the graduate level, and a free workshop though the Arizona Science Lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The longer term potential of technical impact of the exploratory project work is in the design space exploration for the sensing systems using methods from design automation. Co-design and models of sensors and analog integrated circuits will be examined using performance metrics. Through this work the design process for sensing systems can be transformed from a completely bottom up approach to a systematic optimization of the entire system from individual sensors to circuits to communication devices. In addition, the system parameters can be adjusted on the fly to adapt the behavior and performance under the influence of sensor drift, environmental factors such as temperature variation, power supply and network availability. Through the use of predictive models and algorithms to govern the system behavior and operating conditions, strides toward a new paradigm in sensing system design and implementation can potentially be made.</AbstractNarration>
