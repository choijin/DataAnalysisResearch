<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: Iron pyrite is one of the most abundant minerals on the planet. Iron pyrite also has some key physical properties well suited to optoelectronics and energy storage applications. But numerous measurements indicate that the electronic transport and optical properties of bulk and nanocrystalline iron pyrite limit effective device development. The fundamental causes of these limitations remain mired in uncertainty, but recent work does suggest that defect structure and chemistry on the surfaces and interfaces of iron pyrite are of primary importance. This research project is a synergistic experimental and theoretical effort designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of iron pyrite and its surface physics and chemistry. In conjunction with this research activity, a collaborative K-6 outreach effort is planned to increase awareness of materials science, and to instill an interest in scientific methods in the younger generation. A series of hands-on materials science modules will be developed and disseminated in coordination with K-6 curricula at local schools in order to further their science programs for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: Recent observations of unusual optoelectronic phenomena in iron pyrite nanocube colloids directly link its unique {100} surface defect structure to the surrounding chemical environment. The experimental component of this research project aims to validate the surface interaction model through interface characterization and directed chemical modification of colloidal, thin film and single crystal samples. High-resolution, surface-sensitive spectroscopy, in conjunction with magnetic and electronic measurements that span a broad range of temperatures, are applied to iron pyrite's intrinsic and engineered surface structure to build a comprehensive structure/property relationship. A parallel theoretical effort systematically examines the nature of the excited states for iron pyrite's bulk and surfaces using some of the most detailed electronic structure calculations that can be done. For these purposes, the GW method, Bethe-Salpeter and time-dependent density functional theory relate optical and transport properties to their microscopic origins. In particular, the manifestations of electron-phonon couplings are systematically examined and compared to experimental observations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction Iron sulfide compounds have properties that, as predicted by theoretical methods and in some cases experiment, are highly promising for use in important technological applications including batteries, solar cells, environmental remediation, and superconductivity. The materials are non-toxic, inexpensive, and earth-abundant. Successful application of these materials has proven challenging due to the high reactivity of both iron and sulfur, which ultimately makes their controlled processing into useful compounds challenging.  As such, the performance of iron sulfide compounds in various applications is limited to the quality of the underlying material structure, and this is intimately related to the chosen preparation method and targeted material morphology.  In the end, the resulting defect structure in the final product dictates behavior and material viability.  Therefore, to facilitate the future viability of compounds from this material systems, we have designed and undertaken a number of experimental and computational studies over the course of this project to better understand the highly complex structure-property relationships in iron sulfur compounds.     Project Outcomes Both the monosulfide (FeS) and disulfide (iron pyrite, FeS2) compounds are technologically important, but exhibit complex defect structure and non-stoichiometry that inhibits material performance.  This project had two main thrusts: 1) the understanding of the formation pathways in Fe(1-x)S compounds, a complex and closely related family of materials with highly variable properties; and 2) improving our understanding of the role of common structural features on the behavior of FeS2, a particularly promising member of the iron sulfide family which is previously reported to be sulfur deficient.     We were able to add definition to the formation pathways of different Fe(1-x)S compounds, information critical in designing syntheses that target a specific structure. Combined experimental and computational work was used to learn about the influence of rate, time, and temperature on the chemistry and structure of the material product. This work targeted likely pathways between compounds with 1:1 iron-to-sulfur ratio and those with slight iron deficiencies.     The role of grain boundaries on magnetic and optical properties of iron pyrite was studied systematically with varying particle size. Grain boundaries are a common byproduct in material syntheses, but their effect on the performance of iron pyrite has not previously been studied in much detail. Nano-scale particles with no grain boundaries exhibit behavior close to that of a theoretically perfect specimen, while the increasing presence of grain boundaries shifts magnetic and optical properties to be much less favorable for the applications listed above. Our experimental observations thus reproduce the extensive behavioral deficiencies reported for FeS2 in the literature, and provide the most comprehensive explanation to date based upon underlying structure and chemistry.     Broader Impact Funding from this project was used to train three graduate students in advanced techniques for the study of materials science; one has obtained their PhD and one is scheduled to obtain a PhD in 2019. This work was disseminated at conferences touching the broader materials science community and in journals, including one article open-access journal available to the general public. This work also inspired collaborations between the university and two national laboratories in the local area.       Last Modified: 10/22/2018       Submitted by: Conrad R Stoldt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
