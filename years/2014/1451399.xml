<AbstractNarration>This project addresses an important need to seek a wider range of approaches toward broadening participation in engineering. The traditional pathway into engineering careers is based on a series of mathematics and science prerequisite courses that have proven to be a barrier for many interested and potentially capable engineering students. This project will explore the possibility of developing a version of the undergraduate engineering degree that is based on the perspective of the humanities, arts, and social sciences but also includes content from the traditional undergraduate engineering curriculum.  A workshop will be conducted to explore opportunities to establish an undergraduate, pre-professional, bachelor of arts degree for undergraduate students interested in a career in engineering but who enter college uncertain about their degree of commitment to engineering. For these students a liberal studies in engineering degree might serve as an alternative, smoother pathway into engineering.  Upon completion, these students could pursue options that include direct employment in technical areas, entreprenurial endeavors, and the pursuit of additional specialized training or advanced degrees in engineering, business, law, or medicine. In this workshop potential collaborator institutions will meet to clarify objectives, suggest content, and examine the structure such a program might take at their respective institutions.  The workshop participants will develop a plan to move forward with program development.  It is anticipated that a diverse group of approximately 50 educators from a variety of institutional types will participate in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is the beginning of a multi-phase process to explore and develop a potentially transformative step in broadening participation in engineering by offering a pathway into the discipline, and route to a degree, that is markedly different from the traditional path but still encompasses comparable content.  Traditionally engineering education heavily emphasizes mathematics and science prerequisite topics for beginning students and addresses the broader social, economic, cultural, and ethical aspects much later in the curriculum and often in an indirect manner.  The planned liberal studies in engineering degree envisions reversing the process, offering students an approach to the discipline from a humanistic, artistic, and social perspective.  Specific issues to be resolved are aimed at advancing knowledge along pedagogical, epistemological, and sociological dimensions.  Pedagogical issues to be clarified in this work include identifying the means for faculty to effectively collaborate in teaching across liberal arts and engineering in a mutually beneficial way.  Epistemological topics will address the question of what must students know to successfully engage the engineering sciences that are at the core of the traditional engineering major.  Sociological analysis will investigate the institutional and cultural values, beliefs, and norms that both guide and constrain the renovation of programs. Initiatives such as this workshop will identify the steps needed and challenges to be overcome in creating opportunities for individuals whose initial interests in engineering are different from those of the currently established demographic of the discipline. As such it holds the potential to provide a model for other STEM disciplines facing similar challenges.</AbstractNarration>

A Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies in Engineering degree program would be designed to attract students undecided about choice of a major but who have sufficient interest in engineering to enroll in a program that keeps open the possibility that they might pursue a career in engineering. For these individuals, the program will offer a smoother pathway into the profession. For others, it will serve as a new liberal arts program centered on STEM. It would take exemplary, substantive content of the "traditional" undergraduate engineering program and infuse this content into courses in, and subject it to study from the perspectives of, the humanities, arts, and social sciences.  A smoother pathway would attract more students into engineering who otherwise would not even consider the possibility. Independent of this, the program is needed because engineering practice has changed dramatically over the past few decades. Engineering graduates need a broader education to prepare them for the social, political and financial challenges they will confront whether working within a firm or with a public agency.  A program based in the liberal arts with engineering infused throughout would meet this need.  As a follow up to the workshop, Professor Bucciarelli and Professor David Drew of the Claremont Graduate University are conducting research - again funded by NSF - to determine the feasibility of establishing this new kind of undergraduate degree program at a wide range of institutions - Community Colleges, Liberal Arts Colleges, as well as at Universities.
