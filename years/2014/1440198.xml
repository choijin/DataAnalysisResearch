<AbstractNarration>The PIs propose to address the difficulty of developing a small, low power, highly sensitive molecular biology tool for oceanographic work with the novel implementation of a sensor technology known as Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF). The TIRF provides rapid, sensitive, simultaneous, and cost-effective detection of multiple biochemical targets with minimal sample preparation.  This EAGER proposal seeks funding to explore the feasibility of modifying an existing technology developed by MBio Diagnostics, Inc., consisting of a cartridge and reader system in order to achieve either a smaller form factor, an increased sample capacity, or both. This modified TIRF technology will be designed for integration with an AUV-based sample acquisition/processing module that will provide for underway generation of biological data in support of oceanographic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TIRF-based sensor is one of several emerging technologies that promise to transform ocean science by providing the ability to carry out interactive experiments and test hypotheses remotely at the molecular level. It has the potential for providing real or near-real time data revealing not only species? presence and abundance, but also the metabolic and physiological status of those organisms at the biochemical and molecular levels, can provide new insights into how populations are responding in situ to their environment over time as conditions change. This project will continue to build international collaborations with the UK and Ireland. It will include 4 undergraduate and 3 graduate student participation in both the US and Ireland. A workshop will be organized in Belfast as well as using these development experiences as part of an on-line module for a Masters in Diagnostics (University Arizona).</AbstractNarration>

Alteration in pH did not effect RNA extraction but did enhance DA extraction by 1.8 fold between pH 8 and pH 7.4 with an additional 1.8 fold increase between pH 7.4 and pH 7.2.  This group was able to demonstrate that peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes were highly specific when applied to the LightDeck&reg; as used in a proof of principle on non-modified cartridges.  Print buffers were tested with Atto647-labeled oligo target being slightly more effective.  The Pseudo-nitzschia PNA probes showed excellent specificity with hybridization at room temperature.  Overall these experiments demonstrated that the principle of concept for both PNA probes and toxin detection are viable chemistries for inclusion on the LightDeck&reg; portion of the 3G ESP AUV.
