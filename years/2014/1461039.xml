<AbstractNarration>This project is supported under the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program, which is an NSF-wide program although each Directorate administers its own REU Site competition. This program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in an effort to introduce them to scientific research so as to encourage their continued engagement in the nation's scientific research and development enterprise. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects designed especially for the purpose. The REU program is a major contributor to the NSF's goal of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce. The Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) sciences Directorate awarded this REU Site grant to Ohio State University in order to facilitate undergraduate students' exposure to research on various topics in the science of linguistics as well as science communications. This project utilizes a unique laboratory where students are trained in substantive research skills and the accessible communication of science. The results from these projects will significantly advance our understanding about how language is used in a social context; how children learn to use language in context; and how language understanding is integrated with other aspects of cognition, such as attention and memory. This REU site also helps create researchers who communicate effectively, particularly to the public and to policy-makers, a critical need for maintaining a healthy long-term societal commitment to good science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Language Sciences Research Lab is a glass-enclosed space within a premier science museum. The language sciences research conducted in the lab constitutes cutting-edge work at the intersection of rigorous linguistic analysis, social interaction, and cognitive processing. The lab hosts an innovative undergraduate course on informal science education, using interactive educational activities about the language sciences. The program includes classroom training in linguistics and psychology and in informal science education. Students' practicum time includes traditional research activities and hand-on experience on the museum floor interacting with the public. In the lab, Ohio State faculty and students conduct linguistic experiments, inviting museum visitors to participate in and learn about the research. The PIs provide an integrated experience that trains students in both missions of the lab: how to conduct language science research and how to communicate with the public about science. The REU site expands the population from the Ohio State Columbus campus students to students from regional campus and community colleges who might not otherwise be able to be involved. Students are recruited from the Ohio region and with a target population of students primarily from the regional campuses of Ohio State; unlike the main campus of OSU, these campuses have an open enrollment policy and attract a diverse student body; and also from local 2-year community colleges in the area, particularly Columbus State.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this REU Site was to provide a diverse group of students with an integrated research and outreach experience which provided hands-on training conducting language science research with leading scientists and simultaneously provided hands-on training on talking to the public about language science.  It was hosted by the Language Sciences Research Lab, a working lab embedded inside the local science museum, the Center of Science and Industry.     Over the three years of the program, the site funded 30 undergraduate researchers, including 29 women, 22 students from under-represented groups (African-American or Latinx), and 7 students from community colleges.  None of the students accepted into the program had previously had significant research experience.      Under the guidance of faculty mentors, students worked on research projects across linguistics and the language sciences. Students gave numerous poster presentations based on their projects, at events at their home schools and national and international professional venues.  Students also independently developed novel outreach activities. Several have been adopted for regular use by the Language Sciences Research Lab.     After completing the program, eight of the students returned to the lab as paid research assistants and as peer-mentors for new students.  In addition, 17 of the students re-connected with faculty mentors and expanded their professional networks by participating in one of the national outreach events the lab attends, including the Association for the Advancement of Sciences Family Science Days.  Students continue to be in contact with their faculty mentors, who provide professional advice and support.     Many of the students are still attending college, but already one student has won a Fullbright scholarship, four students are employed in work directly related to their research interests (paid research positions, teaching positions) and three are enrolled in MA level programs.  Students from our program succeed in STEM professions.     Qualitative comments from the students suggest that our program helped them grow both as individuals and as scientists.  As one student put it: "This program helped me understand more about how I want to go in my future&hellip;. It helped me figure out what I want to do or what paths I can take for my career".
