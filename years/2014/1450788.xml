<AbstractNarration>1450788 - Ierapetritou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to provide support for a workshop on Process Intensification that will take place on September 30 and OCtober 1, 2014.  The objective of the workshop is to create a forum where the main contributions in the area of process intensifivation will be reviewed and the remaining challenges will be identified.  Bringing together academic, industrial and government participants, the workshop will provide a forum to identify past successes and look to identify gaps in knowledge that future research needs to fill.  It is hoped that this will lead to identification of roadblocks to progress in this area as well as efficient ways to overcome these difficulties so that future efforts lead to more efficient, green and commercially competitive industrial processes.  The workshop will involve at least 40 participants from academia, industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the workshop should not only help US industry but also generate new educational advances.  New Process Intensification projects will create many educational and training opportunities where US students can naturally acquire fundamental skills while engaging in cutting edge research that is very relevant to domestic industry.  It is expected that the concepts generated will qucikly find their way into the syllabi of core courses such as reaction engineering, separations, unit operations, process design and control, etc.  One of the breakout sessions will specifically address educational opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored workshop on Process Intensification (PI) was held September 30 - October 1, 2014 in Washington, DC.  Forty people attended from academia, industry, federal government, and the DOE national laboratory system.  The objective of the workshop was to be a colloquium where the main contributions in the area of process intensification would be discussed and the challenges identified.  Bringing together academic and industrial participants, the workshop provided a unique forum to identify the existing successes and future opportunities in the process area.  The workshop consisted of four presentation sessions including one general session covering the main concepts of PI, and three application sessions including PI opportunities for different industrial sectors, such as chemical, petrochemical, energy, and pharmaceutical.  It also highlighted advances in the fundamental sciences of reaction engineering, separation processes and environmental engineering.  Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire providing input regarding the challenges and opportunities in PI, how their research fit into this area, and how the Smart Manufacturing initiative can interact with activities in PI.  After the workshop a report was developed that summarizes input received through the questionnaires, and from workshop presentations and discussions.    Questionnaire responses and discussions during break-out sessions delineated two broad challenge categories related to Process Systems Engineering and Process Science Engineering.  One involves improved understanding of macroscopic behaviors and properties of intensified processes, while the other encompassed the mezo-, micro- and atomistic scales.  Additionally, several practical challenges in the development of intensified processes, and organizational challenges related to process research, development, and industrial adoption were noted.     Workshop discussions revealed a broad palette of opportunities for developing new PI concepts and/or applying existing ones. These opportunities include:  a)     Distributed power generation and Distributed chemical processing.  In this area, the need for efficient processing of natural gas (especially monetizing stranded/associated gas deposits) was emphasized.  The opportunity for developing processes for simultaneous H2 production and CO2 sequestration was identified, along with the development of intensified processes using ethane-based (rather than petroleum-based) chemistries for the production of products such as low-cost plastics.  b)     Wastewater treatment.  The water and energy nexus was identified, and it was pointed out that process intensification concepts can be used for developing more efficient processes for treating wastewater, including cleaning drilling fluids and municipal waste.  The use of renewable resources, such as wind, for powering such systems was mentioned.  c)     Energy efficiency and productivity improvements can be gained from converting batch processes to continuous ones (e.g., in the food and pharma industries).  d)     Improving energy efficiency from waste heat capture.  e)     Processing biofuel and more efficient aqueous-phase chemistries (e.g., aqueous reforming of organic compounds for hydrogen generation).  f)       Intensification of CO2 capture using novel materials, including supported anhydrous biological materials.  g)     Product intensification.  This can lead to substantial energy and water savings (e.g., an "intensified detergent" carrying an improved surfactant, requires less detergent and less water to perform the same cleaning task).  h)     Treating low-concentration, high-volume materials such as ores from mining or waste from nuclear power generation.
