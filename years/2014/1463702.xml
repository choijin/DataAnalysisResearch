<AbstractNarration>Nanoparticulate atmospheric soot particles are complex in their shape, size and chemical composition. They can be variably observed as fractal aggregates composed of elemental carbon (EC- in graphitic or graphene structures), or organic carbon compounds (OC - hydrocarbons with oxidized or other attached heteroatom moieties). Other aerosol materials potentially embed or enmesh, in either internal or external mixing states, such soot particles as they age in the ambient atmosphere. Our limited knowledge of relationships between soot mixing state, soot morphology, and soot optical properties, remains a major source of uncertainty in evaluating the optical and radiative contribution of carbonaceous aerosols to direct radiative) climate forcing. Researchers will undertake a series of combined laboratory and computational studies to better characterize the formation of soot particles with different mixing states, and to investigate associated structural and optical properties in relation to the particle initial state and aerosol aging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mixing states and morphology of soot aggregates will be determined from a combination of mass-mobility measurements and environmental scanning electron microscopy imaging. Optical calculations constrained by the experimentally measured mixing states and morphologies will provide a closure with directly determined light absorption and scattering by this range of carbonaceous soot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One broader impact of this work will be the promotion of collaboration between faculty at a PhD-granting and a primarily undergraduate teaching university.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to conduct experimental and computational work to identify pathways leading to different mixing states of fractal soot nanoparticles, determine factors that control their restructuring into compact nanoparticles, and quantify changes in light absorption and scattering induced by compaction.     Intellectual Merit  The project has led to a new conceptual model for predicting the distribution of the coating material on soot nanoparticles (i.e., their morphological mixing state) when they interact with gas-phase pollutants in different environments. Since soot from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels is a significant contributor to climate change and an air pollutant, a better understanding of its atmospheric transformations is required to reduce uncertainties in evaluation of its environmental impacts. We have shown how the knowledge of the coating distribution can be used to make semi-quantitative predictions about restructuring of soot nanoparticles and accurate quantitative predictions of their optical properties.     Broader Impacts  Collaborative work involved researchers from research and undergraduate universities, and also from a national lab. Results have been published in seven peer-reviewed articles and disseminated at international and national conferences. A demographically diverse group of four PhD students, seven undergraduates, and eight high school students received an extensive research experience. This group included nine females, two Hispanics, and four African Americans. One undergraduate was supported by the summer research scholarship at the PI's university. One high school student and two undergraduate students co-authored journal articles. By advancing the knowledge of processes governing the soot aging in the atmosphere, this project has provided crucial knowledge to improve description of soot in atmospheric models, helping policy-decision makers develop effective pollution control strategies.
