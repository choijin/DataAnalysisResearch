<AbstractNarration>This research will analyze the factors associated with non-use of Facebook, in order to develop a deep, rich understanding of how social technologies more generally mediate and are embedded in complex sociotechnical milieux.  It will address three primary research questions: How can our understanding of technology use and "the user" be advanced by exploring its relationship with different types, degrees, and varieties of non-use?  How is privacy conceptualized and enacted through non-use, and how do those practices help us reconsider the definition and constitution of privacy?  What are the processes and experiences of leaving online groups and communities?  When particular technologies become nearly pervasive, intentional and pointed absence from them becomes both analytically conspicuous and potentially informative.  Questions of group persistence or dissolution apply broadly to a wide variety of domains and contexts integral to the composition of society.  This research will help understand how social technologies mediate these processes, thus contributing to the design of systems that better meet the needs of people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four lines of research will explore these themes.  First, a pair of large-scale surveys, one each during the first and third years, will establish the prevalence of different practices of and motivations for non-use.  Second, statistical modeling and network analysis, using both survey data and samples of usage data, will examine how both individual and group predictors relate to these motivations and practices.  Third, a series of focus groups involving participants with diverse experiences of use and non-use will help understand conversations and conflicts that may occur around non-use.  Fourth, an intervention wherein study participants will be asked to deactivate their Facebook account will enable observation of the processes and experiences of non-use as they happen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to and expand on the previous limited work on technology non-use, deepening our conceptualizations both of non-use and of "the user."  The combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses will build an understanding of the influences on and practices of social technology avoidance.  To facilitate research in this area, the anonymized survey data will be made available to other researchers.  Finally, this work offers non-use as a potentially transformative lens through which to examine long-standing issues of privacy and groups in technologically-mediated systems.</AbstractNarration>

With such prominence, though, it can be easy to forget that many people do not use social media. The work supported by this grant examined non-use of one of the most prevalent social media platform, Facebook. The results from these studies speak to a variety of questions, not only in terms of who actually uses social media, but also in terms of who has, and does not have, access to these platforms for social interaction.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Types of Non-use - The work supported by this grant has shown the value of going beyond simple distinctions between technology users and non-users. For example, creating a Facebook account and then deleting it has different implications than never creating an account in the first place. Some participants in our studies joined Facebook, left the site, and then later joined again. As yet another example, some people may deactivate their account, while others may want to but not actually do so. This point, about splitting into finer grained distinctions that ?use? and ?non-use,? enables us to find many of the patterns described below.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Privacy - Our work finds at least two distinct types of privacy concerns. First, participants in our studies often voices concerns around what other people they knew personally were able to find out about them, or what might be called <em>social privacy</em>. Second, participants also voiced a separate set of concerns about what social media providers such as Facebook knew about them, or what might be called corporate or <em>institutional privacy</em>. These varying concerns had different impacts. For example, when taking a short term break from Facebook, participants who talked about social privacy were more likely to return to the site earlier than they had intended. However, those who emphasized institutional privacy were more likely to stay off of the site. Such findings show the importance of nuanced conversations about privacy concerns. Put differently, varying answers to the question of ?privacy from whom?? has significant consequences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sense of Agency - Across multiple studies, a significant recurring factor was an individual?s feeling that they had the capacity to take action, or that they had a <em>sense of agency</em>. In one study, respondents who described negative privacy-related experiences in terms of their own actions, such as oversharing, were more likely to have deactivated their Facebook account. In contrast, those who described these negative privacy experiences in terms of others? actions, such as someone else posting compromising photos about them, were less likely to have deactivated their account. in another study, participants were asked to take a break from Facebook for four weeks and then given the option to return. Both those who returned to Facebook and those who stayed off the site framed their experiences in terms their own capacity for action, their own sense of agency. Not only do such results reinforce the value of distinguishing among different types of privacy concerns, they also underscore that some people feel they do not have a choice in whether or not to use social media such as Facebook.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Demographics and Socioeconomics - Many surveys show that social media use more common among younger populations. To some extent, our results support this trend. At the same time, our results show that younger people are also far more likely to have deactivated their account, while older people are simply less likely to have created an account in the first place. It is middle-aged users, roughly ages 40 to 60, who are most likely to have a Facebook account and never have even considered deactivating it. As another example, survey respondents who had recently applied for a job were more likely to have deactivate, or at least considered deactivating, their account. Such findings carry implications when considering who has, and who might not have, access to the benefits that can be provided by social media.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/08/2019<br>      Modified by: Eric&nbsp;Baumer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1421498/1421498_10319250_1570559261543_FinalReport-Age--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1421498/1421498_10319250_1570559261543_FinalReport-Age--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Effect of Age on Types of Facebook Non-use"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1421498/1421498_10319250_1570559261543_FinalReport-Age--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Effect of Age on Types of Facebook Non-use"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Older respondents are more likely to have never created a Facebook account, while younger respondents are more likely to have deactivated their account.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Eric P.
