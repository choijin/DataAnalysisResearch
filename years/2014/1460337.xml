<AbstractNarration>Under this grant, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will organize and run a series of conferences and workshops in the mathematical and computational sciences during the three-year period between October 2015 and September 2018.  These SIAM conferences form an important part of the research, education and technology transfer infrastructure for applied and computational mathematics.  The funding of this grant will support travel of students and early career professionals, facilitating the integration of education with research.  The funding will also support the travel of invited speakers to the conferences and the dissemination of invited conference presentations and tutorials to the wider community on SIAM's audio/slide service.  The first event in the series is the SIAM Conference on Applied Linear Algebra to be held October 26-30, 2015 in Atlanta, GA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIAM conferences and workshops are highly interdisciplinary and foster the communication of the latest fundamental and applied research and applications to mathematical and computational scientists, physical and social scientists, and engineers from academia, industry and government.  SIAM conferences are designed to identify and disseminate knowledge of emerging areas of research.  Conferences to be held in the first year of the award include the following: SIAM Conference on Applied Linear Algebra, SIAM Conference on Geometric and Physical Modeling, Analysis of Partial Differential Equations, SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, SIAM Conference on Imaging Science, SIAM Conference on Mathematical Aspects of Materials Science, SIAM Conference on Discrete Mathematics, SIAM Conference on the Life Sciences, and SIAM Conference on Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported conferences in the mathematical and computational sciences. The primary objective of the conference series is to provide a forum for communication among researchers in mathematical and computational sciences and their applications. The series offered a unique opportunity for researchers and practitioners to communicate the state of the art in applied and computational mathematics and to identify and address the latest challenges and opportunities.  SIAM conferences have played a key role in promoting research in key areas of mathematical modeling, numerical methods, computational science and their application. These conferences were an important venue in which to announce new results and exchange ideas.  Eleven conferences and two workshops were funded under the final year (September 15, 2017 - August 31, 2018) of the grant SIAM Conferences in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences, DMS- 1460337.  Conferences covered under this grant included the following topics: Analysis of Partial Differential Equations with applications to modeling fluid flow, weather, and materials; Parallel Processing, which dealt with techniques for high performance computing for scientific problems; Uncertainty Quantification to develop methods for assessing and quantifying uncertainty in models and simulations from various sources, such as parameters, data, and the models themselves; Data Mining, to develop new methods to extract information from massive sets of data;  Applied Linear Algebra, which covers basic techniques in linear algebra which underlie much of modern modeling and computation; Discrete Mathematics, which covers the theory, modeling, and algorithms for discrete systems; Imaging Science, which covers research in mathematics for imaging of all kind from radar to photographic;  Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures;  Mathematical Aspects of Material Science;  Applied Math Education, and  mathematics of Life Sciences with its many applications in biology and medicine.  Scientists from Academia, National Laboratories, and Industry gave presentations on innovative mathematical and computational methods and their applications at these conferences. In addition, all of the conferences provided an environment for networking and developing collaborations.  The key presentations are made available to public on the web at SIAM Presents. Another means of disseminating the results presented at the conferences is that key speakers are invited to write general description of aspects of their talk to be printed in SIAM News; SIAM News is also posted and available online to the general public.  The grant also provides support for students to attend conferences. In addition the Workshop Celebrating Diversity provides opportunities for graduate students from underrepresented groups in the discipline to participate and present their research results and to network.  The conference programs are currently available on SIAM's web-site: https://archive.siam.org/meetings/archives.php. Within the specific conference archives, proceedings and workshop notes (if produced) and abstracts will be available for most conferences.  For selected conferences, audio/slides of invited talks and selected minisymposia are or will be available on-line on SIAM Presents (https://www.siam.org/Conferences/About-SIAM-Conferences/Featured-Lectures-Videos).  In addition, SIAM News publishes special issues on conference presentations. All are available on SIAM News on-line (https://sinews.siam.org/Current-Issue)       Last Modified: 11/30/2018       Submitted by: James M Crowley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
