<AbstractNarration>The "Transforming Undergraduate Education in Engineering: Mobilizing the Community for Change" project carried out by the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) seeks to identify the critical components of engineering curricula, pedagogy, and educational culture necessary to support the education of engineers over the next decades of the 21st century. Technology has radically changed the world we live in and engineers, scientists, mathematicians, and technologists have been central to these developments. Technology has also transformed the typical engineering workplace and practice. Practicing engineers working today have little need for many of the facts and methodologies that were essential just a decade ago and now require skills and knowledge not previously anticipated. Engineering education has not kept pace with changes caused by technology. Content, pedagogy, and university culture have remained relatively static, and although there have been some changes, the most common engineering classroom is still a passive lecture. The project intends to catalyze change by building broad and thorough consensus within the engineering community on a shared vision of the future of engineering education. The project will enumerate critical steps for the vision to be achieved and will coordinate the pursuit of each critical step throughout the engineering education community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project will focus on Phases II and III of a planned four-phase process. In Phase I of the project, "Synthesizing and Integrating Industry Perspectives," ASEE brought together industry and academic representatives for an intensive exploration of the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed in engineering today and in the coming years by the primary customer of engineering education, namely employers.  This group found the engineering profession and the abilities of engineering graduates under pressure from several directions, with current training viewed as pursing a trajectory that may lag behind the technological demands of the nation in 2024. Areas of growing importance include: project management, effective product development, system integration, leadership, communication, and the ability to merge engineering, business, and societal priorities. Building on these findings, Phase II will involve students from diverse fields of engineering, representing the demographic diversity of the student body, and reflecting  institutional diversity in terms of Carnegie classification and geographical location, to render the perspective of the primary consumer of engineering education. Phase III of the project will then involve input from professional societies and selected Federal agencies. Individuals representing professional organizations will be invited to provide their feedback and observations on the state of engineering careers and educational programs. Results from all three phases will provide an up-to-date assessment of the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed in engineering today and in the next decade. That assessment and the findings on which it is based will be shared more widely with the STEM education community in a culminating activity involving a large group of invited stakeholders convened to create a flexible framework that fosters transformative changes to engineering curriculum, pedagogical approaches, and academic culture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the American Society for Engineering Ed&shy;ucation (ASEE) launched a project to examine how to improve engineering education. The project, Transforming Undergraduate Education in Engineering (TUEE), seeks to understand what knowledge, skills, and abilities the next generation of engineering graduates should have, and the changes to what and how topics are taught to achieve those qualities.  The TUEE initiative has had four phases, representing the perspectives of different stakeholder groups in the engineering education community. This outcomes report addresses the second and fourth phases of the initiative, focused on perspectives of students and perspectives of engineering societies and academic professionals, respectively.  For Phase II ASEE assembled a diverse group of 41 undergraduate and graduate students in May 2013 to review and comment on 36 characteristics of engineering graduates most sought by industry, referred to as KSAs (knowledge, skills, and abilities). This two-day workshop in the DC area allowed them to share observations, brainstorm, and offer ideas for improving engineering instruction so that graduates meet the needs of the contemporary workplace.  A major influencer of the current engineering KSAs is the National Academy of Engineering 2004 report, "The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century," and its list of priorities for engineering education over the next several years, including social, cultural, and political forces that affect innovation and the increasing diversity of those who are involved with technology.  A second influencer is the notion of what has been called a "T-shaped" professional, who has deep technical knowledge but also broad professional skills (previously "soft skills").  From the student discussions, several targets emerged for opportunities for improvements. Among them are balancing technical and professional skills; enhancing pedagogy and student support; curricular evolution; a need for industry exposure; and project-based and experiential learning. The students urged a greater emphasis on instructor training and suggested that teaching be more strongly considered in securing tenure and salary increases. They also cited a need for greater diversity among faculty. The Phase II report was published in December 2017.  The Phase IV project convened 36 professional engineering society and academic representatives in April 2017 to examine the notion of the "T-shaped" graduate, as mentioned above. Attendees considered three questions: what role should professional societies play in influencing curricular and pedagogical changes in academia; what role should professional societies play in providing experiential learning opportunities; and how can professional societies assist in affecting curricular and pedagogical changes within the constraints of academic environments.  Breakout discussions integrated survey results with findings from TUEE phases I (industry) and II (students) to refine the competencies engineers need. Then participants considered how to assess competencies and to determine which ones could be addressed through curricular and pedagogical changes. These discussions led to sessions on ways professional societies could contribute to preparing engineers so they meet the needs of the modern economy.  Near the meeting?s conclusion, attendees made pledges of specific actions which, if implemented, would launch initiatives sending a message of significant change. In addition, participants identified how individual societies and other organizations could contribute:  ASEE, for instance, could serve as a facilitator/catalyst for all societies to disseminate activities; increase opportunities for people to join the annual National Effective Teaching Institute (NETI) through other means; develop materials that enable faculty to instill KSAs; provide assessment instruments and a train-the-trainer workshop module; reevaluate program criteria, collaborating with accrediting agencies and professional societies to integrate new KSAs into program assessment; and collect best practices and minimum standards.  The Phase IV report was published in June 2018.    ASEE anticipates the engineering education community will use the collective TUEE reports as a framework for the continuous evolution of engineering and engineering technology colleges.
