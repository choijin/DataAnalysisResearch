<AbstractNarration>Next-generation Geoscience needs to handle rapidly growing data volumes from ground-based and space-based sensor networks. As real-world phenomena are mapped to data, the scientific discovery process essentially becomes a search process across multidimensional data sets. The extraction of meaningful discoveries from this sea of data therefore requires highly efficient and scalable machine assistance to enhance human contextual understanding. This is necessary both for testing new hypotheses as well as for the detection of novel events and monitoring for natural hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a computer-aided discovery approach that provides scientists with better support to answer questions such as: What inferences can be drawn from an identified feature?  What does a finding mean and how does it fit into the big theoretical picture? Does it contradict or confirm previously established models and findings? How can  concepts and ideas be tested effectively? To achieve this, scientists can programmatically express hypothesized Geoscience scenarios, constraints, and model variations. This approach helps delegate the automatic exploration of the combinatorial search space of possible explanations in parallel on a variety of data sets. Furthermore, programmable crawlers can scale the search and discovery of interesting phenomena on cloud-based infrastructures. The computer-aided discovery prototype is evaluated in case studies from Geospace science, including the exploration of structures in space and time using combined GPS, optics, and Geospace radar data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific discovery traditionally involves processes that require a significant number of manual steps and focused human attention. However, increasing data volumes are challenging this traditional approach. Examples are found in geoscience, space science, planetary science, astronomy, and other disciplines that are undergoing a Big Data transformation.   This research therefore explored how intelligent systems for computer-aided discovery can routinely complement and integrate human scientists in the insight generation loop in scalable ways for next-generation science. Data infrastructure building blocks and related software prototypes were developed to facilitate the  access to scientific data sets, the fusion of various data, and the search for new discoveries. Cloud computing environments were tested as new platforms for data provisioning and scalability of discovery workflows.    The project released open source packages on Github, such as scikit-data access and scikit-discovery that can be used by the general public under the MIT license. The science-casestudies repository also includes open source releases of Python Jupyter notebooks that provide demonstrations for accessing and using scientific data sets to scientists, students, educators, as well as the general public.  Successful applications of computer-aided discovery were demonstrated in several areas, including ionospheric studies, volcanics, seismology, astronomy, and planetary science. Results of this work have also been featured in the press multiple times.  The fertile environment of this project has facilitated a broad collaboration and joint publications spanning different academic institutions and industry. It enabled the exposure and/or participation of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and scientific staff.
