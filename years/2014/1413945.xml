<AbstractNarration>In this project co-funded by the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) and Chemical Catalysis (CAT) programs of the Chemistry Division, Professor Dan Mindiola of the Department of Chemistry of the Indiana University - Bloomington will explore dehydrogenation reactions of cyclic, linear, and branched alkanes with transient and unsaturated titanium and vanadium complexes having metal-carbon multiple bonds.  Also to be studied are (i)  the chemistry of a masked and unsaturated vanadium(I) complex in group-transfer reactions; and (ii)  the chemistry of low-coordinate and early-transition metals (mainly Ti, V, Cr, and Nb) using a bulky aryl oxide ligand (OAr).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As natural resources such as crude oil dwindle, novel chemical transformations are needed to produce synthetic fuels in a environmentally friendly manner.  A potentially important application of the proposed research is to produce higher hydrocarbons (fuel molecules) based on the volatile paraffins such as methane and ethane.  Students and research associates will be involved in synthesis, catalysis and kinetics study all in combination to provide a strong foundation to become a competitive scientist.  Professor Mindiola will be working with students from underrepresented groups through his association with the IU chapter of the NOBCChE (National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Project Outcomes Report for the General Public for Award CHE-1152123 (Metal-Ligand Multiple Bonds and Their Role in Alkane Metathesis, Dehydrogenation and Group-Transfer Chemistry).     Natural gas is a vast resource which is projected to affect our nationÃ†s economy (especially the state of Pennsylvania given the Marcellus shale reservoir) for at least the next two decades.  Methane and ethane, the most abundant hydrocarbon components of natural gas are therefore indispensable resources which should be taken advantage of given their cheap and vast amounts available. Rather than using these high-energy carbon resources as fuel (through the process of combustion or oxidation), we wish to convert them to more useful reagents for subsequent transformations.  The purpose of our study is three fold.  We are pursuing the conversion of methane and ethane to more value-added products such as ethylene or propene, both important building block for numerous organic-based reagents, for polymers, and liquid fuels.  Our method for conversion of these volatile gases into these compounds will utilize earth abundant metals such as titanium, vanadium, and niobium. We are the only group capable of transforming ethane to ethylene at room temperature (therefore saving a lot of energy in the process) using a titanium reagent.  Lastly, we are investigating not only the conversion of methane and ethane to ethylene in a cyclic manner, but also catalytically, in order to save even more energy and more metal reagents in the overall process.  Our research not only focuses on the applied aspects of natural and shale gas conversion to more value-added products, but the mechanisms behind such transformation. We investigate how starting materials convert to products in order to optimize our reaction conditions and develop better and cheaper (more efficient) catalysts or reagents that would save energy in such process.
