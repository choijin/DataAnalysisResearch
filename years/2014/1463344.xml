<AbstractNarration>In applications ranging from switches to electronic packaging assemblies, there is a critical need for electrical contacts with very low resistance.  Typical metal contacts have rough surfaces that limit the size of the contact area and thus cause high electrical contact resistance.  While larger forces can be applied to increase the contact area, this often results in failure of the contact and thus the device.  Repeated cycling of the contact, such as in microelectromechanical switches, accelerates the failure.  The poor performance of existing metal-to-metal contacts limits the design and performance of a number of electronic devices. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) Program project will investigate the manufacturing, performance and integration of carbon nanotube (CNT) contacts that aim to overcome the limitations of current metal-to-metal contacts.  This collaborative project will involve expertise in controlled carbon nanotube growth, microdevice fabrication, and small-scale mechanical characterization. It will also involve collaboration with industry to ensure the solutions developed are scalable and commercially relevant.  This work will have broad technical impact because improved electrical contacts will enable high reliability microscale switches that can improve the performance and reduce the power consumption of a range of electronic devices, such as mobile phones, and low-power wearable devices. The project will involve training of students in nanomanufacturing and materials engineering as well as the education of K-12 students and the public through demonstrations that illustrate basic principles of nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing at museums and outreach events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the manufacturing, integration, and characterization of a new class of electrical contact materials based on vertically aligned CNTs.  These nanostructured materials will have high electrical conductivity, high elastic recoverability, and low elastic modulus and thus allow surface roughness to be accommodated elastically in order to achieve high real contact area and very low electrical resistance.  Vertically aligned CNTs ('forests') will be grown on micro-patterned conductive layers by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and then optionally coated by secondary materials to enhance their mechanical and electrical properties.  The properties of these contact materials will be characterized using nanoindentation and electrical measurements. The techniques used to manufacture the contact materials allow the properties of the contacts to be tuned over several orders of magnitude so the materials can be engineered for specific applications by controlling process parameters. The project will generate an understanding of how to robustly and precisely control the properties of CNT-based contacts by our integrated nanomanufacturing approach, leading to strategies for manufacturing contact materials with high uniformity and yield.  This project is primarily motivated by the need for new materials for switches based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and novel strategies for the integration of CNT contact materials into silicon MEMS, based on low temperature growth processes, will be investigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the design, manufacturing, and performance of conformally-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) surfaces. These CNT surfaces are highly porous and coating the CNTs that comprise the surfaces with thin layers of metals and ceramics allow the surfaces to be engineered to have specific and unique mechanical and electrical properties.  In this project, metal-coated and ceramic-coated CNT structures were investigated. The metal-coated CNT surfaces have applications as electrical contacts in micromechanical switches and the ceramic-coated structures can be used in applications where surfaces with switchable adhesion are needed. Broadly, the intellectual merit of this work is in the fundamental understanding of the manufacturing processes used to realize coated CNT surfaces and knowledge of how the manufacturing processes can be used to control the properties and performance of the surfaces.  From a technical standpoint, the broader impacts of this work are the new technologies that these manufacturing processes and surfaces will enable, including higher performance electrical contacts in switches and gripping surfaces with tunable adhesion in robotic systems.  From an educational standpoint, this work resulted in outreach to K-12 students on engineering topics and the training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced manufacturing and materials, thus positioning them to contribute to the technical workforce in the United States.  The metal-coated CNT structures have a unique combination of high mechanical compliance and high electrical conductivity.  Both the mechanical compliance and electrical conductivity can be tuned over a wide range through the CNT growth conditions and the thickness of the metal coating.  As grown CNT arrays have a non-uniform structure and a top surface that is denser and more entangled than the rest of the array.  A key outcome of this work is that subsequent processing, notably etching, must be done to alter the top surface of the CNT array prior to metal coating to realize the mechanical compliance needed for switch contacts.  Over the course of this project the mechanical and electrical behavior of metal-coated CNT surfaces were characterized to establish routes to create surfaces with prescribed mechanical compliance and electrical conductivity for specific applications.  The ceramic-coated CNT surfaces developed are unique in that they have switchable adhesion that can be controlled through the application of an electrical voltage. When no voltage is applied, the adhesion of the surfaces is low because of the roughness of the surface.  When a voltage is applied, an electrostatic adhesive force is created between the surface and an object.  The magnitude of the adhesion force can be tuned through the design and manufacturing of the surface as well as the applied voltage.  A key outcome of this project was the development, characterization, and application of these surfaces with tunable adhesion.  From an application standpoint, these surfaces were demonstrated as gripping surfaces in microscale pick-and-place assembly processes.  Microscale assembly processes allow for the integration of different materials and devices to realize next generation electronic systems and displays.  This project was carried out as a collaboration between Prof. Kevin Turner's research group at the University of Pennsylvania and Prof. A. John Hart's research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The project also involved collaboration with industry via the NSF GOALI mechanism.
