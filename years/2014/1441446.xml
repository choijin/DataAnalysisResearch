<AbstractNarration>SES-1441446&lt;br/&gt;Roberta Spalter-Roth&lt;br/&gt;Kelly Joyce&lt;br/&gt;George Mason University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation supports research on a range of policy-relevant topics.  For example, its social science research portfolio includes projects on education and learning, immigrations, demography, terrorism, the environment, disasters, crime and criminal justice, marriage and family, social welfare, employment and occupations, the military, health and behavior, and issues associated with cities and urban areas (e.g., homelessness, poverty, and urban and economic development).  These studies have the potential to inform domestic and international policy, public debates and practice and some do, but in indirect and non-transparent ways.  The PIs plans to further conceptualize and test a new approach, a conceptual model that better captures how social science research is brought into the policy process and practice.  The project is transformative in that it does not assume an "idealized," but simplistic, causal model that takes for granted that policymakers will read research in scholarly journals and adopt their methods and findings to craft new policy.  Rather than a linear model that starts with the research and ends with new public policy, the researchers propose a relational model based on relationships, strategies, activities, networks, and processes that result in the use of social science research for policy purposes at a variety of policy locations.  To test and refine this relational conceptual model, the PIs will convene an interdisciplinary group of social scientists who will provide case studies of  both successful (and not so successful) social science researchers whose work has found its way (or not) into the policy process.  The case studies will be used to produce a refined model of successful pathways in which social science research can and does inform public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is potentially transformative because rather than examine an "idealized" casual model of the impact of research on policy, the project uses cases studies of researchers' experiences to inform an interactive model of human relationships, networks, and social processes that result in the use or the failure to use social science research in a variety of policy situations.  The widespread dissemination of a findings has the potential to increase the number of social scientists who are more attuned to considering  (1) about their research and findings beyond the academic research community; and (2) in more specific terms how social science research findings can inform public policy and practice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How does evidence-based social science research influence poliy-making either directly or indirectly. Through what strategies, relationships, context, or processes does social research enter public policy. Many social scientists do research that could have important policy implications, but do not have experience in getting their research used. To improve this situation, we held a workshop for 35 social scientists to answer this question. The participants discussed strategies, relationships, and networks in order to be effective.  Based on their experience, they found that research is more likely to be used when it is not in traditional academic format.  Social Scientists are good at providing understanding of the causes of social problems, to evaluate potential actions, and to offer ideas for future directions. Workshop participants  noted that resources play a central role in shaping contexts for possible action as does timing.  In order to successful disseminate research, tell stories based on the research, limit numbers and jargon, determine the target audience, and determine the most exciing finding. But, most important is the building of relationships and trust networks among researchers, non-profit organizations, professional organizations, institutions of higher education, government agencies, unions, and the media.  In sum, participants came up with a series of caveats to gain success and avoid disasters.  They are:  1. Repeat findings over and over;  2. Identify the gatekeepers to policymakers;  3. Seek out and be open to partnering with organziations that you might not be able to access on your own;  4. Trust networks are key for moving research into the policy process; these often develop by sharing resources;  5. Frame and translate findings for the public and the media.  6. Be altert to windows of opportunities  7. Do not expect policymakers to come to you;  8. It is often easier to get research accepted at the local and state level;  9.  Researchers should follow a code of ethics and call out bad science.  10. Power often trumps truth, and political contexts may obstruct the use of relevant research.
