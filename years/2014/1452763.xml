<AbstractNarration>PI: Lee, Sang Wook&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1452763&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is a multi-year program of interdisciplinary research and educational activities that investigate neurological and biomechanical factors associated with functional impairment of the arm and hand post-stroke. While devastating impact of stroke on both lower and upper extremity function has been recognized, functional impairment of the upper extremity (arm and hand) is found to be particularly more severe. Thus there is an urgent need for the development of an effective strategy to reverse damaging impact on the upper extremity functionality for stroke survivors. But complexity of neurological abnormalities associated with the upper extremity impairment, along with its sophisticated biomechanics, poses substantial challenges to understanding neuromechanical processes associated with the functional impairment of upper extremity following stroke. The novel experimental and modeling methods proposed in the study will help clarify such mechanisms of the upper extremity impairment post-stroke, and the outcome of the proposed project will be of great interest to scientists studying neurophysiology and neuroscience of stroke, engineers designing rehabilitative devices for stroke survivors, and physicians and therapists treating them. More importantly, improved rehabilitation outcomes resulting from the proposed novel training method will benefit patients as their quality of life will be greatly improved. In addition, the proposed collaborative research activities will strengthen the relationship between the Catholic University of America and the nation?s leading clinics, the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, and will provide students with unique educational opportunities, including enhanced laboratory experience, clinical work with patients and physicians, and hands-on work experience in nation's leading rehabilitation hospitals.  This award is being made jointly by two Programs:  (1) Biomedical Engineering, (2) General and Age Related Disabilities Engineering, both in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Division in the Engineering Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project attempts to elucidate key aspects of the neuromechanical process of the upper extremity functional impairment post-stroke, and to develop a novel strategy to improve upper extremity functionality of the stroke patients. Accordingly, the first two aims examine the following aspects of the functional impairment of upper extremity post-stroke: 1) neurological abnormalities affecting multi-muscle control, and 2) biomechanical pathway that such abnormalities translate into functional impairment. The proposed modeling methods clearly differ from existing approaches, as neurological abnormalities in multi-muscle control will be examined in a system perspective, rather than focusing on individual components (aim 1); and the proposed biomechanical model is based on "force-based" modeling, which contrasts to conventional "moment-based" modeling techniques (aim 2). The knowledge gained from these aims will be utilized to pursue the third aim of the project (aim 3), which is to develop biomimetic devices that can effectively promote neural plasticity of patients; a new type of devices driven by "exotendons", emulating human musculotendon anatomy, will be developed, which will enable a unique rehabilitation training method, i.e., targeted assistance of impaired muscles (aim 4). This assistance technique presents a new approach that focuses on restoration of muscle coordination, which is fundamentally different from existing approaches that attempt to restore kinematics, and is expected to greatly improve rehabilitative benefits of the training. The pursuit of the proposed project will also provide unique educational opportunities for students in the School of Engineering of the Catholic University of America. Interacting with an interdisciplinary team of engineers, physicians, and therapists, students will have clinical, hands-on work experience in top-ranked rehabilitation hospitals. The investigator plans to particularly engage students from underrepresented group (i.e., Hispanic origin) in the research projects, for which they will work closely with patients on "patient-specific" device design. Research topics covered by the proposed project will also be incorporated into the curriculum. Furthermore, the educational benefit of the proposed project will be extended to K-12 STEM education via a series of "case-study" presentations by the undergraduate interns to K-12 students within the District of Columbia Public School System. The broad spectrum of topics addressed by this project, including biomechanics, biological system modeling, neural signal/processing, and device design is expected to greatly improve students' "hands-on" experience, and research opportunities provided by the proposed activities will greatly help them prepare for their careers as successful biomedical engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stroke affects more than 600,000 people annually in the United States, and significant functional impairments of those affected are commonly observed.  In particular, the upper extremity (UE) and hand use is typically found more impaired than that of lower extremity, which significantly degrade the quality of life of those affected.  In order to effectively restore their UE function, various impairments of patients affecting their functional activities should be assessed accurately, which is followed by a ‘subject-specific’ training to maximize their functional recovery.  This project aimed to develop and validate new technologies that (1) assess UE functional impairment of individual stroke survivors; and (2) enable a novel training method that address subject-specific impairment patterns of patients.  We developed theoretical/mathematical models for the hand musculoskeletal system, based in part on the data collected from in vitro (cadaveric) experiments.  These models are used to calculate/predict how the deficits in producing musculotendon forces of the hand lead to problems in producing proper joint moments (movement generation) or fingertip forces (interaction with objects/environments), which are critical in understanding functional impairments of the hand that emerge after stroke.  They can also account for impact of finger postures on the musculoskeletal dynamics, which could significantly altered the tendon force to joint moment transformation, which was demonstrated in our previous studies.  The model performance was validated in in vivo experiments that recorded muscle coordination patterns of healthy volunteers while they produce force towards different directions.  We also investigated how impairments in the neural control of stroke patients affect their hand and UE function.  Chronic stroke survivors performed ‘functional’ tasks in which they interacted with ‘real-life’ objects (e.g., a bottle or a marble) located in different places.  We found that the degree of changes in the way they performed the task (i.e., changes in the task kinematics) is significantly affected by the object location; in particular, the shoulder abduction and elbow extension movements were identified as the major action that significantly degrade the quality of the hand tasks, while a significant degree of between-subject variability was also observed.  Further analyses revealed that the neural coupling between the hand and arm muscles (identified by intermuscular coherence) significantly increased when the task became more difficult for patients to perform.  This study elucidated a possible mechanism underlying the functional impairment of upper extremity of stroke patients.  We developed a series of robotic devices that can restore hand and arm function of those affected by stroke.  In particular, we built three different types of hand devices, two self-adaptable passive elbow devices, and a mountable passive shoulder-elbow device.  Most of these devices are inspired by the musculoskeletal structure of the human upper extremity (hand and arm), thus they can provide naturalistic feedback to the users (i.e., haptic and proprioceptive feedback).  These devices also restore the ‘mechanics’ of their task performance (e.g., proper joint coordination or force direction), which could help them further improve their functionality in the long term. These devices were also employed in a longitudinal training study, in which the robotic devices helped patients perform functional tasks (e.g., reach-and-grasp) using correct task mechanics, not compensatory strategies.  Such trainings were found to help patients improve their functionality, leading to a significant improvement in their clinical tests.  To date, the project has produced eighteen peer-reviewed publications (including three papers under review/in development). The mathematical models and the design of new biomimetic devices have been made publicly available via these publications.  Six graduate students and five undergraduate students (including three female, three minority students) were supported by the grant, who received intensive training on the theoretical and experimental aspects of rehabilitation engineering.  Outcomes from this project were incorporated in the curriculum of the undergraduate (biomechanics) and graduate (advanced biomechanics, rehabilitation engineering) courses.
