<AbstractNarration>Trichomes are specialized epidermal cells present in most plants that optimize the production of compounds that provide protection against environmental insults. Broad interest in these epidermal "biofactories" is heightened by the fact that many gland-derived substances are useful for industrial and medicinal purposes. Although significant progress has been made in cataloging the metabolic "parts list" of glandular trichomes, fundamental questions concerning the regulation of metabolism within, and development of, the trichome structure remain to be answered. In keeping with the analogy of the trichome gland as a biochemical factory, this project seeks to address two major questions concerning the operating principles of this highly evolved structure: how are various assembly lines (metabolic pathways) within the factory coordinated, and how do changes in the demand for the assembled products (bioactive compounds) influence the way in which the factory is constructed? The research has potential to transform current views of metabolism by advancing the concept of cross regulation between seemingly disparate metabolic pathways, and defining new roles for well characterized enzymes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glandular trichomes produce a wide variety of bioactive compounds that protect aerial plant tissues from biotic and abiotic stress. The metabolic activity of trichome glands is often dominated by the production of terpenoids and flavonoids, which comprise two of the most diverse and economically important classes of compounds in nature. Progress in elucidating biosynthetic pathways for these and other secondary metabolites has far outpaced efforts to understand the developmental cell types and structures that are often key to the biological function of defense chemicals. This research project builds on recent studies showing that terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of tomato is coupled to gland development and, intriguingly, is coordinately impacted by the action of the flavonoid biosynthesis enzyme chalcone isomerase (CHI). The broad objective of the project is to combine experimental and mathematical modeling approaches to achieve a systems-level understanding of how trichome metabolic and developmental processes are integrated. The experimental approaches are grounded in the use of purified trichome glands (a single cell type) for transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, as well as powerful genetic tools to manipulate functional processes affecting gland development and metabolism. The research may also reveal new roles for a well-studied metabolic enzyme (CHI) and broaden current views of how small molecules control metabolism. The project provides multi-disciplinary training opportunities for trainees from diverse backgrounds, including participation of undergraduate students in the Plant Genomics REU Summer Research Program. The project will increase access by diverse segments of the public to science through partnerships with the MSU Horticulture Gardens and local industry. Project scientists will partner with the 4-H Children's Garden, local elementary schools, and commercial growers of mint and other aromatic plants to provide children with hands-on learning experiences that illustrate the importance of trichome-derived compounds in plant biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The activities performed with NSF funding have allowed us to investigate a potential interaction between two seemingly independent pathways for the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites (flavonoids and terpenoids).  Our initial hypothesis, stating that a flavonoid signal leads to a downregulation of terpenoid biosynthesis, was formulated based on data acquired by collaborator Gregg Howe?s group with a tomato mutant deficient in the flavonoid biosynthetic enzyme chalcone isomerase.  However, after several years of experiments with additional mutants and multiple transgenic lines, we concluded that flavonoid deficiency in glandular trichomes does not result in the release a specific signal molecule but rather leads to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, which then affect numerous cellular processes, including terpenoid biosynthesis, in a cell type-specific fashion.  These novel insights are important because the constituents of glandular trichomes are directly correlated with resistance against insect herbivores.  Our results contribute substantially to an improved understanding of the biochemistry underlying plant defense reactions.  As part of our outreach activities, we have been hosting high school student interns, who work directly in our laboratory as part of the "Pipeline" program, which is placing particular emphasis on involving young students, those still in the public school system, and their teachers.  The "Pipeline" program was initiated about 15 years ago because of deep concerns about the lack of stem students of color at Washington State University and graduates from underrepresented groups across government agencies.  Pipeline projects are carried out by volunteers, including research scientists and engineers, faculty, educators, staff, administrators and students from multiple institutions: USDA-ARS Pullman, USDA-NRCS, Bellevue College, Wenatchee Valley Community College-Omak, The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Omak High School, Nespelem School, Paschal Sherman Indian School, WSU Cooperative Extension, WSU College Bound, WSU Provost?s Office, WSU College Assistance Migrant Program, WSU Multicultural Student Services, and many WSU academic departments and colleges.  The program currently focuses on Native American and Hispanic populations on the Colville Reservation (largest in the Pacific Northwest) and in non-tribal regions surrounding Omak, WA.  This region was targeted because it has chronic poverty, low high school graduation rates, and high youth suicide rates.  The "Pipeline Program" promotes economic development on the Colville Reservation and enhances STEM awareness, education and opportunities among Native American, Hispanic and rural youth and parents, thus bringing hope to underserved Americans and helping to train the next generation of scientists of color.   To date, more than 200 professionals and students have volunteered time and expertise.  The vast majority of "Pipeline" interns choose to enter institutions of higher education.  The enrollment of Native American students at WSU within the last 10 years has increased four-fold, due in part to "Pipeline" activities.  PI Lange has hosted 13 high school students over the last 10 years, all members of underrepresented minorities, who went on to pursue a college education.  Many of them have stated that the "Pipeline" program was instrumental in making them aware of opportunities outside their immediate surroundings and working on our laboratory opened their eyes to considering a stem career.
