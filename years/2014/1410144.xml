<AbstractNarration>Recently discovered topological phases in materials such as topological insulators have potential use in (quantum) computational devices that can out-perform standard microchip based computers. The most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum circuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the hardware to be of practical value, due to local interactions of the system with the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main scientific goals of this 2-year collaborative project were to 1) establish the mathematical foundations of topological quantum computation, 2) articulate the major mathematical problems and themes for future study and 3) make progress on these problems.  The outcomes are of both technical and expository natures, impacting the broader scientific and education community, and advancing our understanding of the mathematical, physical and computational aspects of topological quantum computation.  At Texas A&amp;M, this project partially supported 4 PhD students and one postdoctoral fellow, and indirectly supported 2 undergraduate researchers.  Rowell gave one public lecture on the subject at Texas A&amp;M as part of a symposium on the 2016 Nobel Prizes, which was attended by university faculty, staff and students as well as members of the local community and news media.  Nine scholarly articles were written during the 2-year project, with several others started:  Three expository articles explaining the mathematical, physical and computational aspects of topological quantum computation were written, each with a different audience in mind: a lengthy survey for the broader mathematical community (to appear in the Bulletin of the American Math. Society), a set of lecture notes for an introductory graduate level course and a shorter survey for scientists with a general physics background but no significant expertise in condensed matter physics. Three technical articles developing classification methods for mathematical models of anyons that are non-abelian, but not universal by particle exchange only.  These were applied the give a compete classification of so-called metaplectic anyon models. Three mostly technical articles developing and exploring the mathematical models for fermionic topological phases of matter.  These extend beyond the better known bosonic topological phases of matter.  Every elementary particle in 3-dimensional materials are either bosons or fermions (egs. photons or electrons) distinguished by their exchange statistics.  In 2-dimensional cryogenic materials there are other types of (quasi-)particles, and the distinction is related to physical locality/non-locality.   The chief advantage of the topological model for quantum computation is inherent, hardware-level fault-tolerance.  The standard quantum circuit array model suffers from crippling errors due to decoherence (i.e. the systems loses information into the surrounding material).  This typically requires expensive error-correction (encoding small amounts of information in a large space).  On the other hand, one pays for this topological protection in that the relevant physical systems are extraordinarily intricate both in their mathematical description and in the physical implementation and manipulation.  The proto-typical example is the fraction quantum Hall liquids, but other materials such as topological insulators and nano-wires show some promise.  Mathematically, they are described by topological quantum field theories, or, algebraically, by modular tensor categories.  These are the two main areas that this project has focused on for mathematical development.          Last Modified: 12/04/2017       Submitted by: Eric C Rowell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
