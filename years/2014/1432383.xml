<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to increase the number of graduates in the areas of Environmental Sciences and Sustainability at the University of Minnesota-Morris.  Three foci will guide the effort: 1) Inform - introduce students to science early; 2) Prepare - introduce high school students to data collection and quantitative analysis to prepare them for college level science and 3) Support - introduce a supportive network of peer, faculty and industry mentors that will offer guidance to students through all educational transitions.  The project plan is grounded in the needs of the local and regional community and should help to increase the participation of Native Americans in the pursuit and attainment of STEM degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inform-Prepare-Support framework is integrated throughout the project activities, which include: an early encouragement outreach program involving visits to reservations; a 2-week residential program for Native America high school students who are interested in STEM careers; a summer program for Tribal College science majors involving research projects in environmental science and sustainability; and an enrichment program to mentor career decisions and provide advice for the transition to careers after graduation.  Formative and summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of how well the project components align with successful attainment of the goals.  In so doing, the project will build on and contribute to the knowledge base regarding the education of Native American students in STEM.  In particular, it will address the role played by a culturally responsive approach embedded in long-standing community relationships and circumstances an conditions under which success occurs.  Surveys will be employed to collect information about student attitude and perception (project experiences, extent of engagement, and barriers to success).  Graduation and retention data will be tracked.  Dissemination of the results of evaluation will impact a wide range of educators.  Students and faculty will also present research results at the national meeting of the American Indian Science and Engineer Society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the UMM IUSE program is to increase the number of Native American graduates in the interdisciplinary Environmental Sciences.  Native Americans are underrepresented in the science (annually less than 1% of the STEM degrees awarded in the U.S. go to Native Americans). The UMM IUSE Program is designed to address this disparity in participation by encouraging of Native American students of all ages to envision both their success and potential contributions in the study of the environmental sciences. The complexity of the environment demands insights that cross traditional academic fields and approaches to environmental problems require a diversity of viewpoints.  Increasing the number of Native American scientists in the interdisciplinary environmental fields will ultimately lead to broader perspective on approaches to the environment.   The goal of the University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) IUSE project was accomplished by implementing programs that encourage Native American students of all ages (but predominantly high school and traditional college age) to continue their education and pursue STEM careers that will be fulfilling and rewarding. To do so we strengthened and expanded existing UMM programs and established new components of a well-established pipeline at UMM.  To encourage success at every level of academic development, the focus of the UMM IUSE program was "transitions"; specifically, the transitions from high school to college and college to the work force. The five programs implemented are:  1) An early encouragement outreach program involving visits to reservations by UMM Faculty and students.  2) Continuation of the Wind-STEP program, a two-week residential program for rising Native American high school juniors and seniors who are interested in STEM careers.  3) The "IUSE Summer Research Program". Faculty mentored research in the STEM fields for UMM Native American STEM Majors.  4) The "IUSE Summer Internship Program" which expanded partnerships with local research facilities, cooperatives, an environmental consulting firm and a USDA soil lab.   5) The "IUSE Enrichment Program" which helped place students in REU’s and field camps, as well as mentor career decisions and provide advice for graduate school selection and application.  Early encouragement programs interacted with student groups visiting UMM and at Science fairs and powwows in Native Communities.  Over the 6 years UMM Faculty, alumni  and students met with over 300 students and talked about careers and opportunities in STEM careers.  Of the 24 individual high school students that participated in the Wind-STEP program, 14 have graduated.  Four of those graduating students enrolled at UMM as STEM majors.  Two others enrolled as STEM majors at other colleges.  10 students are still in high school  One of the 19 undergraduate students that participated in  IUSE Internships, 17 graduated, 15 were STEM graduates, and one is still an undergraduate.  The enrichment program encouraged 5 students to participate in REU programs and 4 students to attend field camps.  One of the IUSE interns attended graduate school (M.S. Geology; University of Minnesota).  Three of the former Interns are working for Environmental Consultants and one is working for the Minnesota Department of Resources as a Hydrologist.
