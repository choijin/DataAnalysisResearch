<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL PART:  The National Science Foundation "Back to the Future" Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology provides research experiences focused in metallurgical engineering for a diverse group of students from all over the nation including students from two-year and tribal colleges with limited research opportunities.  Students conduct research on projects that improve the responsible and efficient use of domestic metal resources and improve the materials and manufacturing methods used in the transportation, medical, and energy sectors.  Students are engaged in an innovative series of workshops and seminars on the importance of metals throughout history (the Back to the Future theme) that enhance the student understanding of the impact of research on society.  In addition, students participate in an integrated professional development and technical communications program that will give them the capabilities to become the next generation of young professionals and researchers in science and engineering.  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site is supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL PART:  The REU Site: Back to the Future III at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology is a 10-week summer program that provides research opportunities in metallurgical engineering that enhance the global competitiveness of the nation in the areas of advanced materials and manufacturing, mineral beneficiation and resource recovery, strategic metals, and energy-efficient materials.  The program addresses the challenges faced by future engineers by providing a research experience within a unique cultural and holistic framework.  This framework is provided by projects that have historical significance and innovative programmatic activities led by faculty from engineering, science, and the humanities that explore the interface between engineering, history, and art (the Back to the Future theme).  Students participate in an integrated supplemental training program that nurtures their research skills and career development.  This program includes advanced technical communications training, workshops to give historical context for current trends in research, as well as activities that connect students to each other and the community.  Data suggest that the diverse nature of program activities attracts students of varied background and intellectual typology.  The Site will provide opportunities for underserved students in engineering with an emphasis on two-year community and Tribal Colleges.  The site will also strengthen ongoing Native American initiatives in the region including the NSF All Nations Louis Stokes, Tiospaye, and OSSPEEC programs.  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site is supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) "Back to the Future Site" at the South Dakota School of Mines is an integrated 10-week summer research program focused in Metallurgical Engineering.  Undergraduate students from many engineering and science disciplines work with a team of faculty mentors on important topics in Metallurgical Engineering including advanced alloy development, materials joining, biomaterials, nanotechnology, mineral processing, microstructural characterization, and corrosion engineering.  Many of these topics have the potential for far-reaching impact in terms of public welfare by improving manufacturing of advanced alloys and bolstering domestic development and sustainability of important natural resources.   Many of the projects also have important historical implications.  One such research highlight is shown in Figure 1, where REU students worked with the National Park Service Submerged Resources Center to better understand the characteristics and structure of marine growth on the S.S. Montebello shipwreck and the resulting impact on corrosion rate.  Figure 1 shows a marine growth concretion on the left and the three-dimensional internal structure revealed through micro x-ray computed tomography analysis on the right.  In, addition to conducting research, students participate in a highly advanced professional development program with technical seminars on global trends in metallurgy and an integrated technical communications program.  The results are that nearly 50% of the participants have either published or presented their research at a regional or national conference.  During the project period, the REU Back to the Future Site team helped lead a yearly statewide "South Dakota Undergraduate Research Symposium" that has grown to over 150 students from many REU and other undergraduate programs across the state.  Figure 2 contains a picture from the symposium which shows that the South Dakota symposium mirrors the format of a national student conference poster session. In addition, the South Dakota symposium has included guest speakers from the National Science Foundation and South Dakota graduate programs.   Engineering faculty have also teamed with faculty from the humanities and local artisans to develop supplemental workshops and activities that showcase the impact of metallurgy on history and art to provide a unique historical framework for current research, hence the "Back to the Future" theme.  These activities have included artistic metal working, blacksmithing, and metal casting.  Figure 3 shows an example of one such workshop where the REU students participated in a historical workshop on blacksmithing led by local artist-blacksmith Jack Parks.  Assessment data shows very positive perception of the program and a positive impact on student gains in research skills as shown in Figure 4.  Of particular note is the strong gain in technical communications from the integrated communications program.  The program has successfully engaged a diverse student population.   Nearly 20% of participants were Native American and 40% of participants were women.   Evidence from the literature suggests that a richer learning environment may be created in engineering by providing this context in the liberal arts.  The site assessment data on student typology suggests that the unique nature of site supplemental activities (focused on the historic, artistic, and cultural impacts of metals) may help to attract and retain students from underrepresented groups.  In addition, the unique learning environment may help to enhance educational opportunities for students of different learning styles or typologies.  Student retention in engineering fields and entrance into graduate school are also key indicators of program success. All REU alumni have one follow-up contact per year.  We successfully introduced an REU Back to the Future group page resulting in an impressive 90% response rate for a recent career path survey of all students.  Retention in STEM disciplines is over 95%.  As of March 2018, 75 students have graduated.  Of these graduates, 53% are attending or attended graduate or medical school, 43% are working full-time in STEM industries and 4% are teaching in STEM fields.  Participation in the program has had positive impacts on student preparation for graduate school.  Three recent highlights in the last period include REU alumni Mr. Ian Markon (NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship, Ms. Annette Hein (Goldwater Scholar), and Mr. Victor Champagne (NSF Graduate Research Fellowship). Finally, REU students participate in outreach activities that impact the community through mentoring of middle and high school students.
