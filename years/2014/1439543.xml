<AbstractNarration>Efficient infrastructure systems such as highways, bridges, buildings, pipelines, flood control systems and utilities are all necessary for a healthy economy and comfortable standard of living. Concrete, steel and timber are the backbones of physical infrastructure. High strength polymer composites have been used for aerospace structures for about five decades and their use in civil infrastructure spans about 20 years. To accelerate the adoption of polymer composites into infrastructure, the NSF I/UCRC Center of the Integration of Composites into Infrastructure (CICI) was established as a joint effort of West Virginia University (WVU), North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the University of Miami. Recently, NSF has awarded a travel grant to establish an additional CICI site at Nanjing University of Technology in China. The NSF I/UCRC program brings together universities, private companies and government agencies together to leverage the research dollars for all parties by engaging in highly cooperative research. CICI's work with civil infrastructure has a tremendous effect on daily life, thus the Nation as a whole benefits as composite and hybrid materials lead to infrastructure systems of higher safety, shorter construction times and longer life spans at a reduced overall cost and improved labor productivity with the creation of new and higher skilled job opportunities. Member companies and end users benefit from the interaction with others in their field including highly trained students, with over 100 students expected to pass through CICI in the next 5 years. CICI is prolific technology transfer machine, exceeding the output for most I/UCRCs through the publishing of journal articles and conference presentations to promote the scientific research and knowledge dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, the technical focus of CICI can be broken into four different areas. Initially, fundamental research projects are undertaken to broaden the knowledge base on infrastructure composites. This includes lifecycle performance, aging studies, evaluation of bond strength within a composite and as a substrate, and many others. From this on-going research, products are being developed that can be mass-implemented in infrastructure markets, including innovative hollow core or basalt fiber FRP rebar, waterway products that are noncorrosive or fabric reinforced cementitious composites for masonry wall strengthening and many others. The implementation of these products is the next focus area and is primarily accomplished through the development of codes and specifications. CICI has worked on the ASCE LRFD pultruded GFRP composites code, ASTM specifications, ACI building design and construction codes, the International Code Council and IIFC. Finally, CICI has an evaluation component based on IAB member feedback to ensure the composites that are implemented in the field are performing as designed as a part of our long-term performance program. Thus, through research, development, implementation and evaluation, CICI is involved in all facets of composite product evolution.</AbstractNarration>

For the latter, both polymeric and cementitious-based (inorganic) matrices were of interest. The acronym FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) is used to identify the class of composites covered in this project.  New Construction  The demand for the development of a more efficient and durable transportation infrastructure is among the priorities of highway authorities worldwide.  In the United States, the economic impact of steel corrosion in concrete highway bridges is estimated to exceed 15% of total annual costs. FRP bars are a suitable replacement for steel rebars as concrete reinforcement in structures subject to aggressive environments. In addition to center partners, UM worked with state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and other infrastructure owners for the demonstration and deployment of new technology. This included the development of guides and standards with national and international code-writing agencies.  Repair and Strengthening  UM focused on composites with both organic and inorganic matrices. In addition to FRP, the acronyms for the composites investigated at UM were SRP for ?steel reinforced polymer,? FRCM for ?fabric reinforced cementitious matrix,? and SRG for ?steel reinforced grout.?  In the areas of SRP and SRG, UM has been the main institution in the nation to conduct this type of research work. In conjunction with industry, UM has also provided the leadership required in the development of pre-standards issued by the International Code Council - Evaluation Service (ICC-ES). These pre-standards are known as ?Acceptance Criteria? and provide the requirements that a new technology must satisfy in order to show compliance with building code provisions.  Deployment  Two pedestrian bridges using FRP internal reinforcement (i.e., Fate Bridge and Innovation Bridge) were constructed at UM. For the latter, only concrete elements solely reinforced and prestressed with FRP composites were used. The concrete reinforcement featured unique configurations such as Basalt FRP continuous closed stirrups used in the pier-caps and curbs as well as prefabricated Basalt FRP cages for the auger-cast foundation piles.

UM is currently contributing to the construction of a residential building in the Bahamas and a marine dock (completed) in Miami. In addition to FRP reinforcement, both structures include the use of a concrete mixture using seawater as replacement for fresh water.  Dissemination  Research and implementation results have been disseminate via technical publications, presentation in national and international conferences and development of design guides and standards.  As an example of contribution to the technical literature of the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), UM developed a revised design guide on behalf of AASHTO Committee T6 to allow for the use of glass FRP bars in both the superstructure and substructure of bridges.
