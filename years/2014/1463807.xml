<AbstractNarration>Water and other volatile components circulate in the Earth's interior and this circulation controls the way in which Earth keeps its oceans and atmosphere on its surface. It is now well established that the transition zone (a layer between 410 to 660 km depth) can contain a substantial mount of water, and if the transition zone has a large amount of water, then the transportation of water-rich materials from that region up into the upper mantle or down to the lower mantle would induce partial melting. If melting occurs, chemical composition of materials will be modified and it has an important implication for the chemical evolution of this planet. In this proposal, we will investigate the nature of melting near the boundary between the transition zone and the lower mantle through an interdisciplinary approach including mineral physics and seismology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Melting in the lower mantle occurs only when some volatile (incompatible) elements (such as hydrogen and carbon) are present. When the amount of volatiles (such as hydrogen) exceeds a critical value, then partial melting should occur. The critical factors that define this value are (a) the solubility of water (hydrogen) in the lower mantle minerals and (b) the amount of metallic Fe in the lower mantle. Both of these factors are poorly constrained by mineral physics experiments at present, and the investigators propose to conduct experimental work to better understand these processes. The consequence of partial melting depends on the density of melt (relative to the co-existing minerals) and its geometry (dihedral angle), and the team plans to conduct theoretical and experimental studies on these issues. Also important is seismological detection of melting. In this project, the team plans to conduct a seismological study to investigate the evidence of melting using the frequency-dependent and anisotropic receiver functions. Combining these studies, the interdisciplinary team will investigate the nature of volatile transport in the Earth's mantle near the transition zone-lower mantle boundary.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is a collaborative proposal led by Prof. Shun Karato from Yale University. As I understand, the no-cost extension for one year has been requested by Yale. The budget allocated to LSU has been spent by 04/31/2016. Perhaps, I have to wait to submit the project outcomes until the grant ends for Yale. But, anyway here is my part of the project outcomes.     The low/ultralow-velocity zones in the Earth?s mantle can be explained by the presence of partial melting, critically depending on density contrasts between the melt and surrounding solid mantle. In this project, we completed first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of the (Mg,Fe)O system (the second most abundant material of the lower mantle) in its both solid and liquid states. Our results show that their densities increasingly approach with each other as pressure increases. The isochemical density difference between them diminishes from 0.78(&plusmn;0.7) g/cm3 at zero pressure (3000 K) to 0.16 (&plusmn;0.04) g/cm3 at 135 GPa (4000 K) for pure and alloyed compositions containing up to 25% iron. The simulations also predict a high-spin to low-spin transition of iron in the liquid at pressures above 45 GPa accompanied by a density increase of 0.14(&plusmn;0.02) g/cm3.  We also estimated the Fe partition coefficient between solid and liquid  to be 0.3 to 0.5, clearly implying that iron has a strong preference to the melt. Based on these results, an excess of as low as 5% iron dissolved in the liquid could cause the solid liquid density crossover at conditions of the lowermost mantle.   We have recently initiated simulations of hydrous (Fe,Mg)O system to assess the relative effects of Fe and H2O on the melt density. If more water is dissolved in liquid than in solid, the water component will widen the solid-liquid density gap. It is important to note that the density effects of water are smaller than those of Fe.  For instance, we find that the liquid with 6.25% Fe and 6.25% water is denser than the pure MgO liquid so with more excess Fe dissolved in the liquid, the density-crossover is possible even for hydrous melts.
