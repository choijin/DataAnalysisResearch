<AbstractNarration>This award is for the partial support of the International Conference on 2015 Physical Virology Gordon research conference (GRC) and Gordon research seminar (GRS) to be held January 2015 in Ventura Beach, California. This major international meeting will provide a single forum for discussion of the latest developments in physical virology and recent advances in virus-enabled materials synthesis. Regular meetings of the key researchers in this field are necessary for the exchange of ideas, information, and state-of-the-art technologies, in order to enable and accelerate advances and breakthroughs the fields of virology and nanotechnology. This international conference is a key mechanism for linking basic science with engineering towards the development of nano-enabled products, which are of significant importance to the US and world economies. This conference offers a forum for the open exchange of new and previously unpublished scientific ideas. The conference includes presentations, free exchange of ideas, and extended discussions and interactions among international participants. This forum has been instrumental in the generation and incubation of breakthrough and transformative ideas in many areas of nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will partially support the participation of junior participants, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty members. The funds will support the attendance at the conference of a total of 12 participants.</AbstractNarration>
