<AbstractNarration>Control of large power grids today is largely performed by centralized computer programs run at centers like the Independent System Operators (ISO). In order to cope with the growing stress and difficulty of these computations, as more renewable energy and more complicated users of power come on line, this team plans to develop new systems for distributed computation, both for scheduling of power supply and demand, and for balancing decisions which maintain stability of the grid in real time.  The research feeds into an active power education effort, including special efforts by the PI in Women in Engineering and in summer engineering programs for girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work fits within the growing new effort to take advantage of distributed or parallel computing, after the speed of classical sequential computers has hardly improved at all for many years. The distributed scheduling here will be based on multi-stage DC optimal power flow, though the team plans to move ahead to the nonlinear case of realistic AC flows as soon as they are able. The real-time balancing will try to balance dispatchable and nondispatchable generation and loads based on a consensus-plus-innovation approach</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project develops a fully distributed and robust approach for cost-effective balancing of dispatchable and non-dispatchable generation resources, storage devices and flexible demand in the electric power system. The distributed control approach takes into account several operational constraints associated with various (controllable and partially controllable) grid resources: notably, line flow constraints, generation limits, storage characteristics and risks associated with renwable generation resources as well as uncertain demand, as well as ensuring that the dispatch results in acceptable power quality, in that, regulation and safety constraints, for instance pertaining to frequency and voltage, are met. Specifically, the work of PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and  the PIs? efforts have led to advances in (1) distributed algorithms for power flow calculations and control, (2) distributed algorithms for real-time energy dispatch, (3) risk-aware energy dispatch, (4) distributed coordination of distribution system assets, including, coordinated charging of plug-in electric vehicles, toward demand side management.   Additionally, the PIs' collaborative efforts have led to methodological advances, based on the consensus+innovations framework, for addressing fully distributed model predictive control (MPC) type problems in large-scale multi-agent cyber-physical networks. The distributed decision-making algorithms developed in this project contribute to the general theory of distributed model predictive control and could be of independent interest to the broader control and cyber-physical systems (CPS) communities.  From a technology transfer viewpoint, the findings of this project are being implemented in an ongoing DOE project (under the DOE SunShot Initiative) that has been awared to CMU (lead institution) in partnership with the The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. A small-scale microgrid like testbed has been set up at CMU campus in this regard and variants of energy dispatch algorithms developed in this EPCN project are being implemented on this testbed.
