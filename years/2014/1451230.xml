<AbstractNarration>This proposal will support U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics the opportunity to share their knowledge and interact with each other and more senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within robotics, to meet potential employers, and to become apprised of new technology that will be demonstrated by vendors.  This goal will be accomplished by partially supporting the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS). IROS, sponsored by IEEE and the Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ), is one of the two premier annual conferences, along with IEEE ICRA, in the robotics field. The location of IROS rotates among North America, Europe, and Asia. The conference attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders. The meeting is a unique environment that allows participants to exchange ideas, interact with leaders in the field, meet up-and-coming engineers, network, develop collaborations, and generate new ideas on the leading edge of robotic technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant provided travel and registration support for thirty-three Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) conference held in Chicago, IL in September, 2014.  IROS, which is sponsored by IEEE and the Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ), is one of the two premier annual conferences, along with IEEE ICRA, in the robotics field.  IROSÃ† location rotates among North America, Europe, and Asia, and the conference attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency program managers.  The meeting is a unique environment that allows participants to exchange ideas, interact with leaders in the field, meet up-and-coming engineers, network, develop collaborations, and generate new ideas on the leading edge of robotic technology.   The broader impact of this work was increased involvement of U.S. Ph.D. students at a highly regarded and well-attended technical conference run by a major professional society.  Attendance and participation in the conference activities exposed students to high-quality technical material.  It also provided students the opportunity to interact with top researchers, educators, and industry workers in the field.  All of the participating students orally presented their original research.  Several additionally participated in symposia, workshops, tutorials, and competitions organized by the conference.
