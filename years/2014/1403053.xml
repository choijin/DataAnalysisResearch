<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1403860/1403053&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rege/Hayes&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Arizona State University/ Montana State&lt;br/&gt;Title: Polypeptide-Templated Nanoparticles as Colorimetric Sensors of Ionizing Radiation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ionizing radiation, including X-rays and gamma rays, is useful in several medical, defense, space, and agricultural applications. However, uncontrolled ionizing radiation can lead to large scale disasters and damage to human health. Given the necessity to balance potential deleterious effects and widespread application, it is important to develop novel radiation-sensing methods in order to ensure safety and prevent accidents. We have recently developed a novel nanobiosensing approach in which we employed proteins for templating the formation of metal nanoparticles from colorless metal salts. This change from colorless metal salts to colored dispersions of nanoparticles in water is a simple and visual indicator of ionizing radiation. In the proposed research, we will carry out a fundamental study on how different amino acids and small peptides mediate nanoparticle formation in the presence of different doses of ionizing radiation. Both, experimental and mathematical modeling approaches will be employed to study this behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our preliminary results indicated that polypeptides are capable of templating plasmonic metal nanoparticles from colorless metal salts in presence of ionizing radiation (X-Rays). In the proposed research, we will carry out an extensive investigation into how each of the 20 natural amino acids template bimetallic gold-silver nanoparticles upon exposure to different doses of ionizing radiation. We will then investigate dipeptides (?minimal peptides?), in which an amino acid with activity for templating the formation of plasmonic nanoparticles is juxtaposed with an amino acid that can bind and stabilize the templated nanoparticles. In addition, pentapeptides in which the binding and templating amino acids are separated by a tri-glycine linker will also be investigated. Mathematical modeling will be employed in order to investigate how different amino acids and peptides, together with experimental physicochemical conditions influence the formation kinetics of bimetallic nanoparticles. Water radiolysis, metal ion reduction, and nanoparticle formation will be modeled, and effects of pH, scavenging agents, and templating biomolecules will be investigated. Experimental and modeling studies will be employed for molecular engineering and developing sequence-property relationships for polypeptide-based colorimetric nanobiosensors for ionizing radiation.</AbstractNarration>

However, uncontrolled ionizing radiation can lead to large scale disasters and damage to human health. Given the necessity to balance potential deleterious effects with the widespread beneficial applications, it is important to develop novel radiation-sensing methods that help ensure safety and prevent accidents. We developed a novel radiation sensing method based on the formation of metal nanoparticles from colorless metal salts. Radiation changes the sensor from a colorless solution to a colored dispersions of nanoparticles; thus enabling a simple visual indicator of ionizing radiation.  The magnitude of the color change depends on the radiation dose.  The first objective of the research we performed was to study how different templating molecules impacted the sensitivity of the radiation sensor to different doses of radiation. Experimental work by our collaborators resulted in the development of different sensor platforms that could be used for sensing therapeutic ionizing radiation doses as low as 0.5 Gy.  To support the experimental work, a theoretical model that predicts the concentration and particle sizes of gold nanoparticles formed due to ionizing radiation was developed.  Gold nanoparticle formation is typically viewed as a two-step process.  The first step is nucleation or the formation of very small, stable gold nanoparticles that have achieved a minimum stable particle size.  The second step, growth, is the increase in nanoparticle size beyond the initial critical particle size.  Through this research project, a theoretical model was developed, and the model predictions were confirmed to be quantitatively consistent with experimental measurements of gold nanoparticle size and concentration. The final model had a few key, novel aspects, including a fourth-order nucleation rate model and a particle growth model based on diffusion limited particle growth.
