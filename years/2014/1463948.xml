<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The project targets synthesis of stishovite, a form of SiO2 (silica) and one of the hardest materials known to mankind at hydrothermal conditions. Presently, this precious form of silica can only be attained at extremely high pressure (ca. 100,000 times atmospheric pressure) in a technically very difficult and expensive process that yields only small quantities. The new approach of this project mimics geological conditions, and grows the crystals from aqueous solutions in bulk quantities. The process occurs close to ambient pressure and temperature conditions, and consequently, will be inexpensive and scalable. This facilitates new applications of stishovite as an abrasive, in cutting tools, and as a hard ceramic material in other applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Stishovite, a polymorph of silica (SiO2), is - together with cubic boron nitride - only second in hardness to diamond. Moreover, among the hardest materials known it is the only oxide, thus naturally resistant against degradation through oxidation. Despite these outstanding properties, stishovite is not used as an engineering material, because it can be synthesized only at pressures above 8 GPa. Although technically feasible, the high-pressure route is not scalable and rather expensive. In this project, a kinetically controlled hydrothermal synthesis approach for stishovite is being developed. The process occurs near ambient pressure and temperature conditions and is similar to the industrial production of quartz crystals. The difference to industrial quartz growth is that instead of quartz seed crystals, stishovite seed crystals are employed. The temperature gradient in the autoclave system allows for the supersaturation of the silicate solution in the growth chamber and the kinetically controlled growth of the stishovite seed crystals from the supersaturated solution. The experiments are guided by computations that explore and predict optimal synthesis conditions. The research is a seminal approach to synthesize high pressure phases near ambient conditions from solution which suggests a transformational impact on the synthesis of high-pressure phases. The project is training graduate students in high-pressure and hydrothermal synthesis techniques and computational materials chemistry. The results from the research are part of the graduate level course "Solid State Chemistry".</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hydrothermal experiments aiming at the crystal growth of stishovite near ambient pressure and temperature were performed in conventional autoclave systems using 1M (molar) NaOH, 0.8 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and pure water as a mineralizing agent. It was found that the hydrothermal metastability of stishovite and coesite is very different than the thermal metastability in all mineralizing agents, and that due to this fact crystals could not be grown. While stishovite and coesite are thermally metastable up to 500&deg;C and &gt;1000&deg;C, respectively, their hydrothermal metastability is below 150 and 200 &deg;C, respectively. The thermally induced conversion of stishovite and coesite leads to amorphous products, while the hydrothermally induced conversion leads to crystalline quartz. Both stishovite and coesite are minerals occurring in nature where they can be exposed to hydrothermal conditions. The low hydrothermal stability of these phases may be an important factor to explain the rarity of these minerals in nature. Coesite and stishovite are mostly formed due to meteorite impacts which can lead to hydrothermal conditions. Because the high pressure produced by the shock of the impact can return to ambient conditions more quickly than the high temperature, any coesite and stishovite formed due to this shock may be exposed to hydrothermal conditions near ambient pressure. Our data indicates that minutes to hours are sufficient to convert coesite and stishovite to quartz at temperatures as low as 150&deg;C. At room temperature it can be assumed that coesite and stishovite are near indefinitely metastable. The project trained an young scientist in the field of solid state chemistry, high-pressure chemistry, hydrothermal crystal growth, and crystal phase identification.
