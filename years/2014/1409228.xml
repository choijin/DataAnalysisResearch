<AbstractNarration>There has been a paradigm shift in the design of communication networks due to the content revolution: the focus has shifted from making a connection to delivering content.  Content Distribution Networks carry much of the data of the modern Internet, with video alone occupying nearly 80%, consuming a massive amount of resources.  The energy cost of data centers rivals that of medium sized countries. Traditional content distribution network designs have involved centralized capital-intensive infrastructure. For scalable performance, next generation content distribution networks will have to harness the "edge-cloud," consisting of vast numbers of highly capable end user devices such as smart phones, tablets, and e-readers. In this project we address the issues of models, fundamental limits, and storage and delivery algorithms associated with the distributed nature of next generation content distribution networks.  The main goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive theory for characterizing the fundamental capacity and performance limits of such networks, and to design the associated content storage and distribution algorithms to achieve these limits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content distribution networks generate the vast majority of all internet traffic, and we expect our results to guide the next generation of such networks.  In particular, we explore ways to support robust and efficient distributed storage and delivery of content over heterogeneous networks. An integral and key aspect of our proposal is to closely tie the theoretical and conceptual aspects of the project with the practical and real-world engineering issues. This approach is highlighted by building testbeds at each of the universities of the investigators as well as specific to each of the main topics (storage, centralized delivery, and peer-to-peer delivery) of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As multimedia content consumption becomes the centerpiece of today's on-line experience, the results of this work are expected to contribute to a seamless end-user experience, while freeing up significant backhaul resources and avoiding the saturation that would otherwise plague today's network infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Video streaming accounted for 60% of the mobile Internet traffic in 2018 . Compared to fixed-line broadband networks, the main advantage and also the challenge of mobile Internet connections is their mobility. On the one hand, users can watch a YouTube, Netflix or live steam video while commuting to work. On the other hand, the majority of services that are used over the mobile network are mostly based on a traditional client-server setup, through protocols like HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In this networking scenario, the client receives data from exactly one server. Furthermore, the servers are usually placed in the core of the network, far away from the client. When a user travels on a train or in a car with high speed, their mobile connection can have bandwidth fluctuations, because of signal losses or handovers. These fluctuations can lead to a reduction in video quality or even to stream interruptions. The interruptions may get worse when seeking or changing the played content since the application cannot use its pre-cached buffer to overcome the temporary communication errors.&nbsp;</p> <p>A possible solution to this issue is to use ICN with in- network caching or to create an edge cloud system. In both solutions, the content gets cached to nearby network infrastructure that can serve as source nodes. If clients can connect to multiple cell towers, they can download from all of them simultaneously. This minimizes the effect of having a single weak connection. To achieve this multi-source down- load, conventional protocols are not sufficient. Furthermore, in a mobile video streaming scenario, the available nearby source nodes are changing as the user travels. Therefore, it is challenging or not feasible to coordinate all source nodes such that they do not send the same packets to the receiver.&nbsp;</p> <p>To test the performance of our protocols, we developed a system that contains browser extensions on the client side and several proxy servers on the server side. The browser extensions intercept YouTube video downloads and forward them through multiple proxies. We deployed our proxy servers to five different locations on multiple continents using Amazon Web Services. We carried out an extensive measurement campaign that ran for more than eleven months. As we increase the number of sources, we achieved two- and three-fold normalized goodput increase by using the two approaches we developed over conventional approaches.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Muriel&nbsp;Medard</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1409228/1409228_10311883_1562085586645_NSF1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1409228/1409228_10311883_1562085586645_NSF1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="YouTube screenshot"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1409228/1409228_10311883_1562085586645_NSF1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="YouTube screenshot"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Screenshot of downloading a YouTube video with our multi-source MUTP protocols and with parallel HTTP requests.</div> <div class="imageCredit">n/a</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Muriel&nbsp;Medard</div> <div class="imageTitle">YouTube screenshot</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1409228/1409228_10311883_1562085637005_NSF2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1409228/1409228_10311883_1562085637005_NSF2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1409228/1409228_10311883_1562085637005_NSF2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">downloading a YouTube video with our multi-source MUTP protocols and with parallel HTTP requests.</div> <div class="imageCredit">n/a</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Muriel&nbsp;Medard</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
