<AbstractNarration>Aggregated search is the task of combining results from multiple independent search engines into a single presentation. The most widely used aggregated search systems are commercial search portals such as Google. In addition to web search, commercial search portals provide access to a wide range of auxiliary search services, or verticals, that focus on a specific type of media (e.g., images, videos) or search task (e.g., search for news, local businesses).  Aggregated search systems are responsible for predicting which verticals to present (Does the user want to see images or news?) and where/how to present them. This project will study a phenomenon called aggregated search coherence and its effect on search behavior. Given an ambiguous query (e.g., "saturn"), a common strategy for a search engine is to diversify its results (e.g., to return results about the car and the planet).  Aggregated search coherence is the extent to which results from different sources focus on similar senses of the query. The outcomes of this project will provide the knowledge required to expand the accessibility of search across a wide range of domains. The test collection produced will allow others to reproduce the results of this work and test their own solutions. The software will enable others to perform large-scale remote studies of search behavior. Insights gained from the user studies will be of interest to researchers in other fields such as psychology and marketing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior research by the PI found that the query-senses in the vertical results can affect user interaction with other components on the aggregated results page, the so-called "spill-over" effect. This project will investigate how aggregated search coherence affects search behavior and will incorporate this knowledge into new methods for aggregated search evaluation and prediction. Specifically, four objectives will be tackled. (1) A series of user studies will be conducted to investigate how different factors of the user, the search task, the results presentation, and the layout determine the level of spill-over from one component to another. (2) Using the insights gained from these studies, a new test-collection evaluation methodology will be developed and validated that models cross-component effects. (3) Due to the pipeline architecture of existing systems, results from different components are completely independent of each other. New algorithms will be developed and evaluated for predicting which results from each component to display and how. The goal will be to minimize negative cross-component effects. (4) The generalizability of the methods will be tested on two additional domains: library search and news story aggregation. Aggregated search facilitates single-query access to different types of media, which require customized search solutions. It is the underlying technology behind commercial search portals and also widely used in other domains such as library, mobile, and desktop search. The project will study a phenomenon that is not currently well-understood, nor addressed in existing evaluation methods and algorithmic solutions for aggregated search.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on three main areas of research.  The overarching goal was to gain insights about how to design search systems and tools that provide searchers with a more engaging and successful experience.  First, a series of studies focused on a phenomenon called aggregated search coherence.  Aggregated search engines combine results from different systems.  For example, Web search engines such as Bing and Google often combine results from different vertical systems (e.g., Web pages, images, news articles, and videos).

Our research focused on understanding the extent to which results from one vertical system (e.g., images) may influence user engagement with results from another vertical system (e.g., Web results).  We refer to this the spillover effect.  The project investigated how different factors can influence the level of spillover from one set of results onto others. Our results suggest that the level of spillover is influenced by: (1) visual salience (e.g., stronger spillover for results with image thumbnails), (2) position (e.g., stronger spillover for highly ranked results), and (3) visual cues that help distinguish between results from different vertical systems (e.g., weaker spillover when same-vertical results are grouped together and enclosed in a border). Additionally, we designed and evaluated a relatively simple algorithm for improving the level of coherence across search results.  A second series of studies focused on improving voice-enabled search.  Voice queries pose several challenges for search systems.  First, they may contain speech recognition errors.  The project developed and evaluated algorithms for: (1) resolving speech recognition errors, (2) automatically dropping query-terms to improve a query’s performance, and (3) predicting when the system should ask a user to reformulate a voice query.  Additionally, when formulating voice versus textual queries, searchers are likely to convey more information about their specific need. As part of the project, we conducted a study on how people formulate voice queries in situations where they have a specific extra-topical preference (e.g., "recent information", "information for novices", "information from someone with firsthand experience", etc.).  Our results found that searchers are more likely to convey extra-topical preferences when querying a system using voice versus text.  However, searchers are also more likely to adopt strategies that are problematic for search systems that rely on keyword matching. For example, searchers are more likely to describe the types of information they do not want.  Finally, a series of studies focused on understanding how specific cognitive abilities influence the way people search and the challenges they face.  To this end, we conducted studies that considered cognitive abilities such as perceptual speed, working memory capacity, attention control, and task switching ability.  One study investigated how specific abilities may influence searchers interacting with an aggregated search system.  Our results found several interesting effects.  For example, when interacting with a more visually cluttered interface, participants with slower perceptual speed and lower attention control had more difficulty finding relevant results and a slower pace of interaction.  A second study investigated the benefits of a knowledge representation tool referred to as the OrgBox.  The OrgBox tool was designed to help searchers organize information while searching.  Our results found that the OrgBox had a positive effect on participants’ perceptions and performance.  Interestingly, in some cases, these effects were conditioned on specific abilities.  For example, participants with greater task switching ability had more positive perceptions about their experience using the OrgBox.  Ultimately, our results suggest that search interfaces and tools can provide special benefits for searchers based on their abilities.
