<AbstractNarration>The coupling of the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field gives rise to a range of disturbance effects in Earth?s near-space environment.  Communications, navigation and energy production and distribution are significantly affected by this space weather. The ability to forecast disturbances that may impact these technologies hinges upon detailed knowledge and understanding of the connected Sun-Earth system, including complicated coupling processes between the magnetosphere and ionosphere. A particular aspect of the latter within the nightside aurora are meso-scale flow channels that have been discovered recently and are believed to play a significant role in the creation and dynamics of space weather disturbances in the ionosphere.  Determining the precise nature of the flow-channels and their relation to the large-scale dynamics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system is the main objective of this project.  It will be attempted through a comprehensive and carefully coordinated analysis of simultaneous observations of the phenomenon from a variety of sources.  The resulting understanding constitutes a critical step towards being able to include this effect in ionospheric space weather specification and forecast models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine observations from a large and diverse set of instruments and facilities across the auroral region in the North American sector, including incoherent and coherent scatter radars, spectral auroral imagers, and ground-based magnetometers, to investigate meso-scale flow channel events in the nightside auroral oval.   Specific project goals for the research effort include: 1) establishing the relative location of flow channels and auroral streamers; 2) establishing the relation between flow channel and streamer trajectories and large-scale convection; and  3) determining the connection between flow channel events and other plasma sheet disturbances, including substorms and omega bands.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have shown how the nightside magnetosphere-ionosphere system is a single system governed by an interplay between a more slowly changing large-scale pattern and meso-scale flows and currents. We have alkso shown how a thorough evaluation of meso-scale flows and their effects is necessary for moving forward in our understanding of Space Weather disturbances, which affect man made systems on the ground such as power delivery systems and pipelines and orbital spacecraft.  We have seen how colliiding aurora lead to the most dramatic disturbance known as the substorm, this implying an impact by plasma bubbles, which are like bubbles rising in a pot of hot water. We have also seem unexpecedly strong flows on the dawnside that lead to flow shears that generate intense distrubances on the dawnside that are seen in the aurora as auroral "omaga bands".  The shears generate waves just as wind over the ocean generate ocean waves.  We have also seen how disturbances in the aurora affect the neutral upper atmosphere via heating and composition changes, and via acceleration of neutral winds.  The wind acceleration can occur in times scales of about 10 to 20 minutes, much faster the previously envisionsed.  We have also identfied a specific type of auroral disturbance that generates continental size waves in the ionsphere and upper atmosphere.
