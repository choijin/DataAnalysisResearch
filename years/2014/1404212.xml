<AbstractNarration>Ultra-high-energy neutrinos are unique astrophysical messengers that interact weakly with intervening matter and can therefore be used to probe the distant universe.  A small but theoretically observable flux of these ultra-high-energy neutrinos is expected to be produced by the interaction between high-energy "cosmic ray" charged particles and cosmic microwave background photons as the cosmic rays travel through the Universe. Observing these cosmogenic neutrinos would allow physicists to begin to study physics at energies beyond the standard models. The large volume of radio transparent ice covering the geographic South Pole in Antarctica has hosted several pioneering efforts to detect these high energies neutrinos using a radio Cherenkov "Askaryan effect."  The Askaryan effect describes the process by which ultra-high-energy neutrinos traversing the dense polar ice generate observable radio waves.  The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located at the South Pole Station, was designed to exploit this phenomenon to first detect and ultimately study these ultra-high-energy neutrinos.  This award provides funding to deploy two more ARA stations to the existing suite of three stations, and to continue observations.  The award will support the involvement of students, including undergraduate students, who will be engaged in on-site activities at the South Pole.  It will also support outreach efforts including activities with QuarkNet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARA is designed to be implemented in phases.  During the initial phase the ARA project deployed a testbed and three full stations that used equipment designed and built for the co-located IceCube Neutrino Observatory.  With this award the project will deploy two more stations and continue observations with all stations to demonstrate the technology, accumulate knowledge about radio frequency properties of the upper layers of the ice sheet at South Pole, and develop reliable hardware and software for deployable in-ice stations in the future.</AbstractNarration>

IceCube has measured a spectrum of neutrinos up to the extreme energies of 10 PeV, an energy 1,000 times higher than the highest energies achievable at the most powerful terrestrial particle accelerator on Earth, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, near Geneva, Switzerland.  Yet, beyond the PeV scale, even IceCube becomes too small to observe the steeply falling neutrino flux.  At high energies (&gt; 1017 eV), neutrinos can be best detected in dense, radio-transparent media through a phenomenon called the Askaryan effect.  The abundant cold ice covering the geographic South Pole, with its exceptional radio clarity, has been host to several pioneering efforts to develop approaches based on this effect.  In 2010, a new experiment called the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), designed to ultimately detect hundreds of so-called "GZK neutrinos," was initiated at the South Pole, combining the drilling and logistics experience of IceCube, the in situ RF experience of RICE, and the subnanosecond data acquisition of ANITA.  The first phase of the project centered on a single goal: to develop and build a small-scale neutrino detector embedded at shallow depths in the Antarctic ice sheet as a proof of principle to building and operating such a detector at 200 meters depth in the Antarctic ice.  The current project expanded this detector by two more stations with enhanced capabilities.  The success of the preliminary program, with three successful campaigns at the South Pole and working stations comparable in sensitivity to the IceCube experiment, has attracted considerable international attention, with foreign collaborators who have proposed and/or pledged more than $3M in support as well as substantial personnel resources to the expanded project.
