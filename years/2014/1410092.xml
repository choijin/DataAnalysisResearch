<AbstractNarration>The southeastern USA is botanically rich, with areas of high global biodiversity in both the Appalachians and the coastal plain.  Millions of plant specimens have been collected from this region over the past four centuries, and these specimens and the information they contain currently reside in museums, or herbaria, at universities across the area.  Scientists study these specimens intently; however, it is difficult to retrieve information at broad geographic and taxonomic scales without pipelines to move the information electronically from the specimen to an accessible pool of data.  SERNEC, or the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections, is a large regional network of botanical experts and collections that has, through an NSF-sponsored research coordination network (RCN) project, developed critical skills in biodiversity informatics.  The current project will allow the SERNEC group to make data available for over 3 million specimens using the latest photography and information capture tools and to engage citizen scientists and students to assist in transcribing and georeferencing this large dataset.  The research generated through this project can help regional planners, land managers and communities to manage their natural resources in our ever-changing environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction of scientists, citizen scientists, and students will provide a synergy to build a research tool of an unparalleled scale and scope.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an imaged and databased set of over 3 million specimens from over 100 herbaria in one of the most floristically diverse regions in North America and a global hotspot of plant diversity. This will represent a valuable data source for research on the response of vegetation to climate change, human development, and rapid migrations of introduced species. This region has been a biodiversity hotspot for 100 million years and this project should encourage research on changes over time to develop better predictive models as areas of biodiversity change. By partnering with Symbiota, Notes from Nature, GEOLocate, Adler Planetarium, iPlant/TACC, and Specify, the project will develop ways to best integrate various efforts for data accessibility. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What is the project?       The Mississippi State University herbarium (MISSA) was invited to participate in this effort, coordinated by the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC) team, to aid in providing electronic images and data for plant specimens housed in our collection. The results of this work will provide scientific and educational resources to the citizens of Mississippi and researchers around the world. For the past six years, MISSA has served as a hub for digitization of herbarium collections throughout the state (http://www.mississippiplants.org/). These efforts involve the herbaria at the University of Mississippi (Dr. Lucile McCook), Mississippi State University (Dr. Lisa Wallace), Delta State University (Dr. Nina Baghai-Riding), the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science (Ms. Libby Hartfield, Ms. Heather Sullivan, Ms. Angel Rohnke), and the University of Southern Mississippi (Dr. Mac Alford). A portion of the collection at the Institute for Botanical Exploration, previously housed at MSU, and the Gulf Coast Research Collection, now housed at USM, are also being digitized through these collective efforts. All totaled, these herbaria contain more than 400,000 preserved plant specimens.     Why digitize the specimens?       Natural history collections, much like libraries, are important reservoirs of historical information about biodiversity and contribute to many areas of science and society, including systematics, ecology, environmental management, agriculture, and medicine. These collections also provide educational benefits by documenting distributions and providing resources to identify species and their unique features. The preservation of biological collections is essential for maintaining and expanding knowledge about biodiversity, particularly in the face of habitat modification and biodiversity loss.  Digital access to herbarium specimens and their associated georeferenced collection locales enhances their value because individuals who may not have previously thought of using the collections have ready access through the internet.     Our digitization process involves four steps: 1) capturing high-resolution images of herbarium sheets, 2) transcribing herbarium labels into a computer database, 3) determining geographic coordinates for the collection location of each specimen, and 4) contributing all of this information to a searchable web interface (SERNEC and others).     How will the digitized data be used?      Mississippi ranks in the top third to half of U.S. states for the predicted levels of in-state plant diversity. Documentation of most species distributions in MS is sparse, representing one of the major gaps in our knowledge of the North American flora. The data and information that will be provided through this project is urgently needed to accurately document biodiversity and understand underlying processes contributing to high biodiversity of the Southeast.  Additionally, the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science led the development of educational materials for K-12 teachers and students that can be integrated into the existing Mississippi science education framework.     What was accomplished?     In total, among the six core herbaria in this project (DSC, IBE, MISS, MISSA, MMNS, and USM), we digitized, in whole or in part, approximately 236,500 specimens. More than 99% of those specimens have high-resolution digital images loaded into a public, searchable database, accessible through (SERNEC; sernecportal.org) and the NSF-funded Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio; www.idigbio.org). Just shy of 40% of the specimens have been georeferenced, to provide digital access to location data for the original site of specimen collection.     In accomplishing this work, at Mississippi State University alone, we involved 11 undergraduate students and 8 graduate students in all facets of specimen preservation, storage/organization, imaging, label digitization, and georeferencing.  Those students were supported for a total of 51 months (average of 2.7 months per student) during their studies at MSU.  The full impact of the educational component of this program, however, will be met through the teacher training and teaching materials that continue to be provided through the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science.  Their ?Project Magnolia? program provides botany training and resources to teachers throughout the state, with six workshops having been held during the grant period.  Educational materials from the program are provided through the project website (MississippiPlants.org) and have been solicited not only by teachers in Mississippi but from other states, as well.
