<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Viktor N. Nemykin of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) will prepare and characterize donor-acceptor dyads and donor-antennae-acceptor triads of organometallic porphyrins and the other aromatic macrocyclic analogues.  Professor Nemykin and other research groups have recently shown that introduction of the organometallic substituents into porphyrin cores results in long-range metal-metal coupling properties, which are essential for application of such compounds in molecular electronics and in random access memory devices.  It was also shown that organometallic donor-acceptor dyads and donor-antennae-acceptor triads can be used as active components for effective light-harvesting in dye sensitized solar cells and organic photovoltaics. Therefore, this project potentially could result in the preparation of efficient modules for molecular electronics. UMD is a predominantly undergraduate institution and thus the broader impacts include the training of undergraduate as well as graduate (M.S.) students.  The project also contributes to the building of an excellent undergraduate and graduate (M.S.) chemistry program at UMD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organometallics, in particular ferrocene-containing porphyrins and their analogues, display a rich redox and photophysical properties.  Redox-driven and/or photoinduced electron- or energy-transfer properties of these systems can be tuned up by modification of the macrocyclic core or by substituents at the ferrocene group.  The proposed research will explore synthetic pathways for the preparation of a variety of ferrocene-containing donor-acceptor dyads and donor-antennae-acceptor triads, which could be potentially used in molecular electronics and light-harvesting.  A systematic investigation of the proposed compounds will allow the investigators to understand how and to what extent oxidation potentials, stability, as well as photoinduced electron- or energy-transfer properties can be controlled.  The factors to be examined include the nature of the central metal ion, through-bond and potentially through-space distance(s) between the transition-metal centers, the geometry (i.e. axial versus equatorial coordination), and the electronic properties of the macrocyclic ligand.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research was to continue discussed in our previous NSF proposal combined experimental and theoretical approach for the synthesis and characterization of metallocenyl-containing porphyrinoids, and BODIPYs, which will provide a detailed understanding of factors influencing the metal-metal coupling as well as redox- and photoinduced electron-transfer processes in these systems.  Understanding of through-bond and possible though-space interactions between donor (metallocene), antennae (porphyrinoid), and acceptor (fullerenes or nanotubes) subunits in the same molecule is very important in chemistry and biology and can potentially lead to the preparation of nanoscale-size functional materials with desired properties in a predetermined modular manner.  During the last three yers, we focused on the design and characterization of new ferrocenyl-containing porphyrinoids and BODIPY-type systems.  These systems could be potentially useful for application in nanotechnology, in particular in high-density molecular information storage devices and redox-driven fluorescent markers/bio-markers.  Formation of the long-live charge-separation states in some of the proposed below systems could also be useful for application in light-harvesting modules of the solar cells.  During this grant period, porphyrinoids and BODIPY-type systems were used as essentially planar, highly conjugated platforms, which can provide electronic communication pathways for electron-transfer processes between appended redox-active substituents.  Using different synthetic approaches we connected several organometallic or coordination type redox-active centers to porphyrinoids in order to prepare a variety of systems with systematic variation in geometric and electronic structures.  A systematic investigation of the proposed compounds allowed us to understand how and to what extent nature of the central metal ion, through-bond and (potentially) through-space distance(s) between the transition-metal centers, and the geometry (i.e. axial versus equatorial coordination), as well as the electronic properties of the macrocyclic ligand, can control oxidation potentials, stability, and photoinduced electron-transfer properties in these systems.  Our integrated approach combined design, synthesis, spectroscopic as well as electrochemical characterization, and theoretical modeling of porphyrinoids and provided an excellent opportunity to train undergraduate students at UMD.  During of the grant period, we were able to prepare and characterize a large number of the target molecules discussed in sections below. We published more than 20 papers in peer-reviwed journals including top journals in the field such as Inorganic Chemistry, Chemistry - European Journal, and Journal of Physical Chemistry A.
