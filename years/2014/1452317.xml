<AbstractNarration>This research includes the development of a new mobile instrument for providing data on the column absorption of infrared radiation by hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, a process that can lead to an atmospheric warming. The Principal Investigator of the project also has been invited to visit the Paul-Scherrer Institute in Switzerland to design a series of experiments at the CLOUD chamber facility at CERN. This facility will enable him to study the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere under varying conditions of ambient temperature and pressure. It is important to understand the mechanisms that lead to the fast formation and growth of secondary organic aerosol since they are important in predicting air quality and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed CLOUD chamber experiments will focus on the 'salting-in' effect as a mechanism for explaining accelerated nanoparticle growth rates. In the case of glyoxal, 'salting-in' consists of the displacement of water molecules from the hydration shell of sulfate ions by hydrated glyoxal molecules. Preliminary studies show efficient growth from glyoxal at relative humidity (RH) of up to 20% for highly acidic nanoclusters. However, there are currently no experimental data available at RH above 20% and for neutral nanoclusters, where the multiphase chemistry is expected to proceed via different pathways. The proposed research will address the following questions related to the formation of SOA (associated with glyoxal) in the atmosphere: (1) What is the 'threshold cluster size' at which glyoxal begins to assists with the stabilization/growth of clusters; and (2) How does the growth rate of stable clusters depend on relative humidity and pH? The 'salting-in' mechanism has been incorporated in an atmospheric model to successfully explain the fast formation of SOA from glyoxal that was observed in a recent NSF-supported field campaign to study air pollution in Mexico City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of the mobile Solar Occultation Flux instrument and the acquisition of new expertise for IR retrievals from the instrument will offer a novel way to better quantify atmospheric composition and changes in composition. The experiments at the CLOUD chamber may result in transformative research on the mechanisms for formation and growth of secondary organic aerosol. This research is funded through the EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cost effective new methods to quantify emissions of trace gases benefit society, because pollution poses a costly risk to human health. For example, wildfires are important for ecosystems, but are also a major source of airborne smoke and pollution that poses a risk to human health and property; yet difficulties to quantify fire emissions arise from limitations with access to plumes that often travel decoupled from ground-level, complex terrain, plume heterogeneity, and uncertain plume rise and transport.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project explored Solar Occultation Flux (SOF), based on infrared absorption spectroscopy from aircraft, as a high risk and potentially transformative approach to study biomass burning emissions using aircraft. An early airborne SOF prototype, developed at the University of Colorado at Boulder, was successfully flown on research aircraft. The use of SOF to quantify emissions of harmful ammonia (NH3), an aerosol precursor, and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) from agricultural soils was further demonstrated using a ground-based prototype. Better knowledge about emissions is pre-requisite to protecting society from the harmful impacts of pollution. It is shown that NOx emissions from agricultural soils, most likely due to microbial activity, are missing in National Emission Inventories. Such unaccounted NOx sources are likely to gain relative importance in the future as other sources continue to decrease. Further, the emissions of NH3 were underestimated during our case studies. Airborne SOF is a versatile tool that in principle is capable to measure many other gases.&nbsp;</p> <p>Professor Volkamer, an academic professor and CIRES Fellow who lead the project, spent a productive sabbatical stay in Europe. In collaboration with KIT, Germany his research group explored creative new ways to quantify and disentangle methane emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources by relatively low-cost COCCON type networks of column sensors, and simultaneous measurements of chemical tracers by CU SOF. In a proof-of-concept study it is shown that the relative contributions of different source sectors can be disentangled using small networks designed for longer-term operation on regional scales.&nbsp;</p> <p>Furthermore, in collaboration with Dr. Michael Hoepfner at KIT, infrared emission spectroscopy was used to detect NH3 in the free troposphere (FT). There are no previous&nbsp;measurements of NH3 in the upper troposphere, where even small amounts of NH3 can form ammonium sulfate aerosol, and have potential to strongly modify new particle formation and growth at cold temperatures in the upper troposphere.</p> <p>Aerosols are harmful to human health, and their properties can modify clouds and rain fall. The oxidation of sulfur dioxide and isoprene in cloud droplets were studied at the CLOUD simulation chamber at CERN, Switzerland, in bench-top experiments in Boulder, and through modeling. We have measured Setschenow salting constants of glyoxal and methyl glyoxal, and estimated that of isoprene epoxide. These three&nbsp;molecules are formed from isoprene, and are deemed responsible to form aerosol mass from multiphase chemistry in suspended droplets (aerosols and clouds) over forests. The laboratory findings were incorporated into the CMAQ model (collaboration with Professor Carlton, now UC Irvine), and suggest that anthropogenic sulfate could regulate biogenic aerosol formation in ways not presently included in atmospheric models. In collaboration with Professor Amman at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, surface reactions of light absorbing products from glyoxal multiphase chemistry were shown to be a source of radical species at aqueous interfaces. Finally, fatty acid photochemistry as a source of small oxygenated volatile organic carbon (OVOC) molecules found over oceans were explored in a photochemical reactor that simulates the ocean surface in collaboration with Dr. George at IRCELYON, France.&nbsp;</p> <p>The broader impacts of this project are that a principal investigator engaged new disciplines through collaborations with experts&nbsp;in infrared spectroscopy, aerosol formation and growth, and photocatalysis. Five graduate students, one postdoc, and one undergraduate student received training on the development of instrumentation for use from mobile platforms (ground, aircraft), conducted field observations and laboratory research as part of interdisciplinary teams, engaged novel disciplines, and interacted with researchers in National Laboratories in Germany, France, Switzerland, and the US. The project has contributed to the development of a globally engaged work force in environmental science, and provided training beyond the laboratory bench that is useful for careers in academia, government and/or industry.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/18/2017<br>      Modified by: Rainer&nbsp;M&nbsp;Volkamer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452317/1452317_10325434_1513622802994_1513619224934--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452317/1452317_10325434_1513622802994_1513619224934--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ARISTO16 test flights"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452317/1452317_10325434_1513622802994_1513619224934--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ARISTO16 test flights"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Graduate student Natalie Kille is visiting the cockpit of the C130 during ARISTO16 test flights of the CU SOF prototype</div> <div class="imageCredit">Pavel Romashkin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rainer&nbsp;M&nbsp;Volkamer</div> <div class="imageTitle">ARISTO16 test flights</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452317/1452317_10325434_1513358613881_CUSOFconcept--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452317/1452317_10325434_1513358613881_CUSOFconcept--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CU SOF measurement concept"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452317/1452317_10325434_1513358613881_CUSOFconcept--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CU SOF measurement concept"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Concept of the CU Solar Occultation Flux (CU SOF) instrument.
