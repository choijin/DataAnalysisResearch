<AbstractNarration>Marine communities along the western Antarctic Peninsula are highly productive ecosystems which support a diverse assemblage of charismatic animals such as penguins, seals, and whales as well as commercial fisheries such as that on Antarctic krill. Fjords (long, narrow, deep inlets of the sea between high cliffs) along the central coast of the Peninsula appear to be intense, potentially climate sensitive, hotspots of biological production and biodiversity, yet the structure and dynamics of these fjord ecosystems are very poorly understood. Because of this intense biological activity and the charismatic fauna it supports, these fjords are also major destinations for a large Antarctic tourism industry. This project is an integrated field and modeling program to evaluate physical oceanographic processes, glacial inputs, water column community dynamics, and seafloor bottom community structure and function in these important yet little understood fjord systems. These Antarctic fjords have characteristics that are substantially different from well-studied Arctic fjords, likely yielding much different responses to climate warming. This project will provide major new insights into the dynamics and climate sensitivity of Antarctic fjord ecosystems, highlighting contrasts with Arctic sub-polar fjords, and potentially transforming our understanding of the ecological role of fjords in the rapidly warming west Antarctic coastal marine landscape. The project will also further the NSF goal of training new generations of scientists, providing scientific training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. This includes the unique educational opportunity for undergraduates to participate in research cruises in Antarctica and the development of a novel summer graduate course on fjord ecosystems. Internet based outreach activities will be enhanced and extended by the participation of a professional photographer who will produce magazine articles, websites, radio broadcasts, and other forms of public outreach on the fascinating Antarctic ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve a 15-month field program to test mechanistic hypotheses concerning oceanographic and glaciological forcing, and phytoplankton and benthic community response in the Antarctic fjords. Those efforts will be followed by a coupled physical/biological modeling effort to evaluate the drivers of biogeochemical cycles in the fjords and to explore their potential sensitivity to enhanced meltwater and sediment inputs. Fieldwork over two oceanographic cruises will utilize moorings, weather stations, and glacial, sea-ice and seafloor time-lapse cameras to obtain an integrated view of fjord ecosystem processes. The field team will also make multiple shipboard measurements and will use towed and autonomous underwater vehicles to intensively evaluate fjord ecosystem structure and function during spring/summer and autumn seasons. These integrated field and modeling studies are expected to elucidate fundamental properties of water column and sea bottom ecosystem structure and function in the fjords, and to identify key physical-chemical-glaciological forcing in these rapidly warming ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this interdisciplinary project we studied the biodiversity and ecosystem of a glacial fjord, Andvord Bay, on the Antarctic Peninsula. In contrast to its Arctic counterparts, Andvord Bay showed a great amount of biodiversity, especially in the bottom-dwelling organisms. We found rapidly flowing glaciers (3-7 meters/day) delivering large amounts of ice into Andvord Bay. However, these steeply descending glaciers are not yet subject to large amounts of surface melting. This lack of freshwater runoff limits the amount of sediment that is carried into the fjord and that can bury marine organisms, enabling a thriving ecosystem.<br /><br />During our cruises we found phytoplankton blooms very early in the Austral summer. These eventually settle in centimeters-thick layers on the ocean floor, where they form an important nutrient source for bottom-dwelling marine organisms. We documented the biodiversity of these organisms at several stations along the fjord and found it to be greatest in the immediate vicinity of the outlet glaciers.<br /><br />A thorough characterization of the physical characterstics of the fjord showed a relatively quiet system with weak currents and turbulence, due to the weak freshwater supply from the glaciers. However, water mass properties did change significantly on a seasonal scale. We believe that katabatic winds, strong wind events descending from the plateau of the peninsula, drive water exchanges between the fjord and the outside ocean.<br /><br />The Antarctic Peninsula has been subject to some of the highest degree of warming on the planet. This has not yet led to widespread melting on the steeply descending glaciers of the Western Peninsula. However, we hypothesize that further warming would lead to such melting, and this would lead to increased levels of water flow along the glacier base and hence higher rates of sediment production. This will dramatically change the physical conditions for the fjord ecosystems. We coupled a of the physical oceanography with an ecosystems model to assess these potential changes.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Martin&nbsp;Truffer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1443733/1443733_10359282_1567640402286_IMG_0641--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1443733/1443733_10359282_1567640402286_IMG_0641--rgov-800width.jpg" title="LMG in Andvord Bay"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1443733/1443733_10359282_1567640402286_IMG_0641--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="LMG in Andvord Bay"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The R/V Laurence M Gould in Andvord Bay, photographed from a glacier timelapse camera location</div> <div class="imageCredit">M.
