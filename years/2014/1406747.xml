<AbstractNarration>The project aims to develop accurate statistical methodology for correlated data,  which applies without stringent assumptions about how data may arise.  Current statistical methodology often relies on specifying an adequate model for correlated data, which can be a difficult task, and any inference drawn from a mistaken model can be unreliable.  A direct benefit of this research is to provide alternative, model-free tools for statistical inference that are not susceptible to model choice and can advance data analysis in scientific areas such as environmetrics, economics, astronomy, etc., which encounter different forms of complex dependent data.  Additionally, climate predictions are increasingly relevant for mitigating natural disasters and planning the use of social/economic resources.  Research goals include developing new assessments of regional climate models to understand how scale differences in such models may impact climate forecasts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research targets development of model-free resampling and nonparametric likelihood methods for different types of dependent data structures, temporally and spatially.  Three main research problems are:  (1) Investigation of optimal implementations of empirical likelihood for time series (as performance is linked to tuning parameters in currently unknown ways); (2) Study of spatio-temporal resampling methods to assess the concept of "scale" in geophysical and environmental processes, with interest in evaluating regional climate models; (3) Development of new resampling methods for irregularly located spatial observations, based on data-transformations, to advance inference with spatial data.  Such nonparametric methods can provide valid inference and assessments of dependence structures under mild distributional assumptions, and such methodology can also be helpful for informing model selection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed project focused on the development of appropriate nonparametric (model-free) statistical methods for dependent data, which may exhibit complex and unknown correlation structures.  Current statistical methodology often relies on specifying an adequate model for describing such dependent data, which can be a difficult task.  Direct modeling can presuppose some knowledge on the part of the practitioner about the nature of dependence in data, which may be challenging.  A compounding danger is that any inference drawn from a mistaken or mis-specified model is likely to be unreliable and potentially misleading.  This research project aimed to provide alternative, model-free tools for valid inference which are not susceptible to model choice or model misspecification.  In particular, this funded project led to the development of alternative tools based on nonparametric or model-free methods that give valid statistical inference without requiring knowledge of a model or the exact data dependence structure.  The investigation also included an examination of the statistical properties of such methods, including their optimal implementation, in order to inform better statistical practice.   For providing answers to a large class of statistical problems without stringent model assumptions on the data-generating process, three important and modern computer-intensive approaches are:  boostrap (resampling), subsampling, and empirical likelihood.  This project made contributions in developing novel versions of each of these approaches which can be applied to dependent data collected over time (as in financial applications) or space (as in environmental studies). In particular, the areas of knowledge advancement included:  1. New versions of bootstrap and (convolved) subsampling for time series.  2. Novel approaches for empirical likelihood for spatial data.  3. Improved resampling and simulation-based techniques for spatial observations under Markovian structures.   4. New techniques of model-free spectral density estimation under long-range time dependence, with applications to resampling strongly dependent series.   5. Resampling advances to enhance random forest predictions.   6. Developments of resampling methods to quantify the scale of predictions of regional climate models in order better understand, or compare, forecasts from competing climate models.  The project also directly promoted training of five different PhD students (four being American citizens).  In particular, the project fully sponsored one PhD candidate in statistics (a female American) as a research assistant and led to the completion of a PhD in statistics based on successful research in resampling.  Additionally, several publications produced for dissemination had the abovementioned students as first authors as a product of supporting and guiding student research.  The project also involved mentoring of a graduate exchange student (from Germany) as well as the development of new graduate coursework (PhD level) involving computationally intensive, state-of-the-art resampling methods for spatial and time series data analysis.  The course represents a full semester 3-credit graduate elective, which fills a gap in common course offerings and in professional training at the graduate level regarding these advanced resampling methods for dependent data analysis.  The course ran in Spring 2016 (the overall course rating: 4.75/5.0, st.dev.=0.46, n=14) and will continue to promote graduate training in the future (next course offering being Spring 2018).
