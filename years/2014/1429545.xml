<AbstractNarration>1429545&lt;br/&gt;Eggleston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports the development of an atomic force microscope (AFM) capable of in situ imaging of mineral dissolution and growth in aqueous solutions at unprecedented hydrothermal conditions of temperature and pressure (up to 200 degrees C and 20 bars) and will advance molecular-scale imaging capabilities afforded through new scanning probe tip design.  The development builds upon a previously successful hydrothermal cell AFM (HAFM) that has the proven capabilities to imagine mineral surface processes in solution but at more limited P/T conditions (P = 12 bars; T = 150 degrees C).  The higher P/T space that should be achievable with a so-called next generation HAFM (ngHAFM) will allow for study of the processes of dissolution of aluminosilicates and other refractory phases in aqueous solution under hydrothermal conditions as well as observation of any precipitation of new fragile mineral surface overgrowth phases given that dissolution and mineralization kinetics should be rapid enough to achieve stable AFM imaging to observe these processes.  Application to study of host rock demineralization and mineralization consequences of subsurface carbon dioxide sequestration, study of mineral extraction processes, characterization of the robustness of solar panel photovoltaic materials under extreme conditions and studies of material corrosion processes should be advanced by this technology.  The development will engage collaboration between an academic institution (the University of Wyoming) and a commercial sector partner (Asylum Research) and will train a postdoctoral researcher in instrument design, fabrication and testing.  The potential for patentable technology resultant from this development project is significant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
