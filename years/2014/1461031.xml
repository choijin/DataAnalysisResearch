<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Wayne State University (WSU) focuses on offering unique summer research experiences in the challenging field of sustainable manufacturing to local and national undergraduate students, especially underrepresented minorities, from two and four-year institutions.  This REU Site resides in the Southeastern Michigan Manufacturing Community, which has recently been selected by the Obama Administration as one of the first 12 manufacturing communities under the national Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP) inititative. The objective of this program is to introduce undergraduate students to the forefront of sustainable manufacturing research and to provide students with the skills and pathways to pursue four-year and graduate programs so they can become knowledgeable and capable engineers in the manufacturing industry of the future. The program addresses NSF national priority areas of advanced manufacturing and sustainability and is designed to guide students to participate in inter-disciplinary undergraduate research projects under the co-supervision of a group of well-accomplished faculty mentors from WSU Engineering Departments. This breadth in expertise will enable the Site to address challenging issue in advanced manufacturing while providing a deep understanding of the broader impacts of sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program will offer a 10-week intensive summer research and professional development/training experience, for a total of 30 students, over a three year period. Research projects will include: 1) nanocoating and lightweight materials and manufacturing, 2) energy storage materials, batteries, and inversion devices, 3)remanufacturing and sustainability assessment, and 4) chemical-energy-water-nexus. The program will include individual research projects with faculty research mentors, research skill seminars,  local manufacturing plant visits, lecture series on the fundamentals of engineering sustainability, discussion sessions, and a research symposium intended to cultivate dialogue skills. These activities will ensure that REU Site students obtain the skills necessary to succeed in future sustainable manufacturing or other STEM academic careers and activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The REU Site: Summer Academy in Sustainable Manufacturing established a ten week undergraduate summer research program at Wayne State University for undergraduate students to experience research laboratories, dive deep into sustainable manufacturing technology challenges, and develop skills essential to pursuing careers in sustainable manufacturing research and industry practice. Sustainable manufacturing is defined as the creation of manufactured products that use processes that minimize negative environmental impacts; conserve energy and natural resources; are safe for employees, communities, and consumers; and are economically sound. Developing sustainable manufacturing principles in next-generation manufacturing researchers and practitioners enhances the US manufacturing global competiveness and strategic vision. The summer academy's metropolitan location in midtown Detroit, MI and its vicinity to the heart of US automotive manufacturing offered participants a unique experience, allowing participants to experience the resurgence of Detroit, MI; interact with historically significant manufacturing companies; and research sustainability issues facing manufacturers.</p> <p class="NSFBodyText">The summer academy received significant interest from undergraduates across the US from more than twenty engineering and non-engineering disciplines. In total, the summer academy received 365 applications from 162 universities and higher education institutions from across the nation. Approximately half of all applications were from underrepresented minorities in science and engineering and those with little to no access to undergraduate research opportunities in sustainable manufacturing. Selected participants were excited about the opportunity to live and study in Detroit, MI for a summer. Outside of laboratory research and summer academy group meetings, participants explored surrounding areas and cities such as Toronto, Ontario-Canada, Chicago, Illinois, and visited local museums such as the Detroit Historical Society, Detroit Institute of Arts, and the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. Group cultural activities cultivated the Wayne State REU community, which served to enhance weekly group meetings where participants learned the skills to confidently present their research to peers and academia. While feedback from summer academy evaluation surveys was overwhelmingly positive, the following quote may best exemplify the desired outcome of the Summer Academy in Sustainable Manufacturing and the impact the program, and others like it, can have on individual students.</p> <p><em>"The REU program was so worthwhile to my professional and personal development. Not only did I learn a lot about the research process, but I learned a ton about myself. Because of this program, I am much more open with my communication. I never thought I would be the type of person to go to graduate school, but after this program, I realized that it is now my goal to go to graduate school and eventually become a professor instead of just working in industry for my whole career. Without this program, I would probably still be a very shy person, and a student who knew she liked chemical engineering, but not what she wanted to do with that. I also would have never had the confidence to apply for my current co-op position."</em></p> <p>Student development and exposure to graduate level research was only part of the outcomes of the summer academy. Undergraduate researchers worked diligently in faculty mentor labs to make sustainable manufacturing research contributions. A partial list of these contributions include; robot programming to capture surface geometry with laser line scanners for remanufacturing, atom based simulation models to predict environmental fate impacts of perfluorocarboxylic acid, data analysis methods to extract emissions date from utility providers, fracture testing of advanced high strength steels used in automotive and other transportation applications, developing new methods for design of coal-biomass based bio-diesel manufacturing, and creating new energy models to estimate energy efficiency in manufacturing. To date, these undergraduate research project outcomes have resulted in three journal publications (undergraduate researchers listed as co-author), one conference publication (undergraduate researchers listed as co-author), and ten research poster presentations at national and international conferences. Participants have been awarded two best student poster awards and seven National Science Foundation (NSF) student travel awards for the International Conference on Sustainability Science and Engineering (ICOSSE), which enabled summer academy participants to travel and present their research in Suzhou, China and Barcelona, Spain. Talks on the design, execution, and outcomes of the entire Summer Academy in Sustainable Manufacturing program were given at ICOSSE, the American Society for Engineering Education's Annual Conference and Exposition, NSF Engineering Education Centers Grantees Conference, and the Institute of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineer's Annual Conference.
