<AbstractNarration>Plasma acceleration is a cutting-edge technique for accelerating charged particles such as electrons using the electric field associated with a plasma structure, such as an electron plasma wave. The plasma structure is created using either ultra-short laser pulses or particle beams. This technique offers a way to build high performance particle accelerators of much smaller size than conventional accelerator techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will further develop Laser-Plasma accelerators (LPA). Applications of LPA electron beams require capture, transport, and manipulation of the electron beam following exit of the plasma accelerator. This award will investigate two aspects of beam dynamics following the plasma accelerator that are critical to future applications:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Coupling of the LPA beam into conventional beam transport systems.&lt;br/&gt; 2. Beam decompression to enable light source applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will benefit most applications of LPA beams, in particular for high energy physics and light source applications. The production of high-energy particle beams for particle physics applications requires the staging of multiple LPAs, and the proposed research will directly impact the design of the LPA beam coupling system between stages. An LPA driven Free Electron Laser (FEL) is considered one of the most promising near-term applications of LPA technology, and this research will lay the groundwork for the first proof-of-principle demonstration of an LPA-driven FEL generating coherent, high-peak brightness x-rays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this award lies in the development of practical LPA applications such as future high-energy physics beams for exploration of new physics. This will be done by exploring solutions to the two issues mentioned above. First, the use of tailored plasma profiles will be investigated to reduce the beam divergence, enabling improved coupling to a conventional beam transport system. Second, by exploring Free-Electron lasers (FEL). LPAs deliver high peak current beams, and, hence, it is natural to consider LPA beams as drivers for FELs. Although the FEL application is presently hindered by the energy spread (few percent) of the LPA electron beam, application of LPA beams to FELs may be accomplished using experimentally-demonstrated LPA beam properties by beam phase space manipulation following the LPA. This project considers decompression of the femtosecond LPA beam, reducing the beam slice energy spread, enabling FEL lasing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Particles accelerators are some of the most successful and widely used tools in science, medicine, and industry.  Owing to the breakdown of the metal cavity in a conventional accelerator at high fields, the energy of the particle beam is limited by the practical considerations of size and cost of the accelerator facilities.  Over the last two decades, a new type of accelerator that uses plasma (ionized gas) instead of metallic cavities has been developed that overcomes this breakdown limit and provides accelerating fields that can be a hundred to a thousand times larger than conventional machines.  This plasma accelerator technology enables much more compact accelerators that could be used for a wide range of applications, including radiation sources.   This new paradigm for particle acceleration uses the radiation pressure from an intense laser to excite a wave in a plasma.  A charged particle beam can be accelerated by the plasma wave, like a surfer riding a wake.   In addition to ultrahigh accelerating fields, the plasma wave naturally produces ultrashort beams that are a few femtoseconds in duration, opening new possibilities for the observation of ultrafast processes.   Manipulating the plasma-accelerated beams presents a challenge for conventional beam transport techniques.  The goal of this grant was to develop techniques to transport and manipulate the beam from the plasma accelerator to the applications.   In particular, early capture of the beam following the plasma accelerator is required to preserve the excellent beam quality.  Since the beams are a few microns in diameter, strong focusing elements are needed.  A major accomplishment of this grant was the development of the active plasma lens.  An active plasma lens uses a discharge in a gas-filled-capillary to generate focusing fields that are symmetric in both transverse planes, easily tunable with the discharge current, and an order of magnitude larger than conventional focusing elements (e.g., magnetic quadrupoles).  These properties make the active plasma lens ideally suited to capture and focus laser-plasma-accelerated beams.    The success of this project enables a path toward a compact laser-plasma-accelerator-driven source of intense, femtosecond, soft x-ray pulses.  Such a source would be a novel scientific tool for the study of ultrafast dynamical processes, opening opportunities for a broad range of experiments in the chemical, biological, and physical sciences.   Based on this research, active plasma lenses have been adopted and are actively being researched at several major European laboratories developing plasma accelerators.
