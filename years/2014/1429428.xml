<AbstractNarration>Non-technical:  The acquisition of a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer at the University of North Florida (UNF) is expected to benefit the entire Northeast Florida region, through research and educational collaborations with several primarily undergraduate institutions, research universities, community colleges, and local high schools. The team's research projects span many STEM disciplines, including chemistry (inorganic/materials chemistry, organic/organometallic chemistry, and chemical education), condensed matter physics, and the general area of materials science and engineering. The pedagogical impact of this instrument is also extensive because of its incorporation in a) both the chemistry and physics undergraduate curricula (i.e. in advanced labs and in various undergraduate research projects), b) outreach activities both for the general public and for high school students, and c) teachers' education events on the UNF campus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:  Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) is the ultimate structural characterization method for chemical compounds and solid-state materials, providing information about bond lengths and angles and the 3D picture of molecules and extended systems. For solid-state materials it probes missing bonds, structural changes, and anisotropy, which is important information for understanding/tweaking the materials' properties. Pressure-induced structural changes are probed with SC-XRD under pressure, with applications in macroscopic post-synthetic properties manipulation in materials. As such, the team uses SC-XRD in interdisciplinary investigations of a) magnetic and correlated materials, b) multiferroics, c) high temperature superconductors, d) molecular magnets and polynuclear clusters, and e) organic/organometallic compounds as drugs and catalysts. Enhancement of these efforts is expected from the microfocus x-ray source and/or the  SC-XRD under pressure (&lt;50 GPa) capabilities of the instrument. Incorporation of SC-XRD in the chemistry and physics curricula and through undergraduate research is expected to enrich the experiential learning opportunities offered to UNF undergraduates and expose them to modern materials research. This facility is projected to benefit the entire Northeast Florida, through research and educational collaborations with at least three primarily undergraduate institutions and two research universities. Additionally, incorporation of SC-XRD in teachers' education events and field trips to UNF is poised to expose local high school teachers and students to cutting edge research and strengthen UNF's bonds to the community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The single-crystal x-ray diffractometer acquired with this NSF-MRI grant is being used for interdisciplinary research at the University of North Florida (UNF). This instrument has the ability to provide an exact picture of the materials studied, including how the atoms are bonded and arranged in space. The single-crystal x-ray diffraction instrument is in full time operation since its installation, and has lead to over 300 data sets on different crystalline materials. The information from the data sets, including bond distances and angles, as well as information about the crystal symmetry is vital for scientists to understand the properties of the materials synthesized. Using this instrument several different materials have been studied, including molecular complexes (zero dimensional), as well as 1D, 2D, and 3D materials. The types of systems studied include molecular magnets, coordination polymers, molecular transition metal and lanthanide clusters, organic molecules, biomimetic molecules (molecules resembling the active sites of enzymes), modified DNA bases, and solid state materials.</p> <p>The PI&rsquo;s group alone has presented 19 posters and 12 oral presentations that included data collected using the x-ray diffractometer. The proposing team has produced seven peer-reviewed journal publications, as well as an article in the periodical of the American Crystallographic Association, &ldquo;ACA Reflexions&rdquo;. In the aforementioned papers, 13 different UNF undergraduate students were listed as coauthors. Many more publications are to be expected as a result of this instrument.</p> <p>The acquisition of a diamond anvil cell (DAC) was also part of this proposal. The DAC allows the application of pressure on crystalline samples, up to 20 GPa, which is equivalent to the pressure deep in the of the earth's crust. This is accomplished by placing the sample in-between the culets (flat surfaces) of two diamonds, and pressurizing the DAC by pressing on the opposing diamonds. Using the DAC acquired as part of this grant, the x-ray structure of a number of samples has been studied under pressure.</p> <p>Several students have been trained on the instrument, including two undergraduates who are the group&rsquo;s crystallographers. The use of the instrument has also been incorporated in teaching, and the PIs have designed several experiments incorporating x-ray diffraction for the Inorganic Chemistry and Advanced Physics Lab courses at UNF. The instrument is always featured in UNF recruiting events, advertising materials, and facilities tours of the departments of Chemistry and Physics. In 2016 Dr. Lampropoulos hosted an international crystallography meeting at the UNF campus with about 40 participants from around the globe.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Christos&nbsp;Lampropoulos</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1429428/1429428_10326238_1509404566812_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1429428/1429428_10326238_1509404566812_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="x-ray lab at UNF"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1429428/1429428_10326238_1509404566812_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="x-ray lab at UNF"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Picture of the x-ray lab at UNF which is result of this NSF-MRI grant.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lampropoulos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christos&nbsp;Lampropoulos</div> <div class="imageTitle">x-ray lab at UNF</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1429428/1429428_10326238_1509404482946_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1429428/1429428_10326238_1509404482946_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bruker users meeting at UNF"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1429428/1429428_10326238_1509404482946_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bruker users meeting at UNF"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Bruker international users meeting organized by Dr. Lampropoulos at the UNF campus with ~40 participants from around the world.
