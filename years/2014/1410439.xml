<AbstractNarration>The southeastern USA is botanically rich, with areas of high global biodiversity in both the Appalachians and the coastal plain.  Millions of plant specimens have been collected from this region over the past four centuries, and these specimens and the information they contain currently reside in museums, or herbaria, at universities across the area.  Scientists study these specimens intently; however, it is difficult to retrieve information at broad geographic and taxonomic scales without pipelines to move the information electronically from the specimen to an accessible pool of data.  SERNEC, or the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections, is a large regional network of botanical experts and collections that has, through an NSF-sponsored research coordination network (RCN) project, developed critical skills in biodiversity informatics.  The current project will allow the SERNEC group to make data available for over 3 million specimens using the latest photography and information capture tools and to engage citizen scientists and students to assist in transcribing and georeferencing this large dataset.  The research generated through this project can help regional planners, land managers and communities to manage their natural resources in our ever-changing environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction of scientists, citizen scientists, and students will provide a synergy to build a research tool of an unparalleled scale and scope.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an imaged and databased set of over 3 million specimens from over 100 herbaria in one of the most floristically diverse regions in North America and a global hotspot of plant diversity. This will represent a valuable data source for research on the response of vegetation to climate change, human development, and rapid migrations of introduced species. This region has been a biodiversity hotspot for 100 million years and this project should encourage research on changes over time to develop better predictive models as areas of biodiversity change. By partnering with Symbiota, Notes from Nature, GEOLocate, Adler Planetarium, iPlant/TACC, and Specify, the project will develop ways to best integrate various efforts for data accessibility. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has had amazing impacts on the research and conservation communities in the Southeastern United States and areas beyond.  Availability of images enhances taxonomic progress in understanding the rich, imperilled, and relictual Southeastern flora, with the images contributing literally every day to the description of new species.  The Southeastern United States is a biodiversity "hotspot", with many species having intrinsic values as well as current or potential economic values, and theaccurate  documentation and understanding of this flora is important to the people of the region, the country, and beyond.    Better, more detailed, and more accurate depiction of the ranges of southeastern United States plant species enhances studies of biogeography, climate change, and conservation needs of the Southeastern United States flora.  These data are reflected in better data for use by federal, state, and local land management agencies, by scientists in universities and non-profit organizations, and by the public.  The digitization has revealed many previously unrecognized distribution records for the flora, as well as 'retracting' records based on erroneous records. Higher quality and more accurate information is important for researchers, conservation efforts, and the public.  At the various institutions, undergraduate students, graduate students, research associates, and staff, all received training in the digitization and appropriate recording of archival data from museum specimens.  Careful and methodical data capture is a valuable skill, transferrable to many occupations.       Last Modified: 02/21/2020       Submitted by: Alan S Weakley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
