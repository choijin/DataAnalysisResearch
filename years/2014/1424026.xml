<AbstractNarration>Large numbers of people in the US and around the world are bilingual. How are words in a speaker's two languages represented and processed in their minds? Do they treat parts of words similarly in the two languages? Does bilingualism pose any special challenges? This NSF funded workshop brings together researchers from multiple disciplines to discuss recent findings about how bilingual speakers learn, process and represent the internal structure of words. Presentations from two internationally recognized researchers and 10 selected presenters will set the scene for a discussion about what the minds of bilingual speakers tells us regarding the mental representation of human languages. Participants will assess the larger social repercussions of this emerging field for a society with increasing levels of bilingualism, specifically for accurately diagnosing speech problems, and for the design of educational curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of bilingual morphology presents unique insights into how the mind represents and processes complex words, how the representation of those words interact with one another, and how they are put together to form sentences. Researchers have proposed different possible ways in which morphology (the inner structure of words) works. Bilingual speakers provide a fertile testing ground for these different models, because bilingual speaker deal with languages with potentially very different ways of constructing words. Additionally, many studies suggest that morphology plays an important role in explaining why people learning a second language don't always have the same degree of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From an applied perspective, the study of morphology has important implications for clinical and educational professionals. For example, many of the clinical tools developed to assess children's speech development rely on how well they are able to parse the internal structure of words. At the same time, normal bilingual development has shown similar patterns to atypical monolingual patterns, leading to inadequate over- or under-diagnosing of difficulties in language development among bilinguals. For this reason, it is essential to establish a baseline for bilingual children with typical acquisition of lexical morphology in order for clinicians to be able to distinguish them from bilingual or monolingual children with symptoms of language disorders. This is particularly important because learners of English as a second language are at higher risk than other children for educational under-performance, making the accurate diagnosis of language impairments in this group essential for their educational prospects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An NSF grant (1424026) was awarded to fund the "Bilingual Morphology at the crossroads" workshop in conjunction with the International Symposium on Bilingualism, organized by the Bilingualism and Second Language Acquisition program at Rutgers University and held in New Jersey on May 20-24, 2015.  The grant proposal aimed to foster our understanding in three specific areas related to bilingual morphology: a) the representation and processing of complex words in the mind, b) the role of morphology as a potential explanation for differential outcomes in acquisition processes across bilingual speakers and c) the impact of morphological assessment and evaluation of language development in typical (bilingual) and atypical (bilingual and monolingual) populations for clinical and educational professionals.  The workshop included 3 presentations on issues related to morphological development and evaluation in typical and atypical populations (including two keynote speakers by Lisa Bedore and Joanne Paradis), 6 presentations about morphological processing in several language pairs and a study on compounding and derivation.  The workshop, which was open to the public, attracted 134 registered participants, including several K-12 teachers and speech therapists, in addition to graduate students and faculty from all over the world. NSF funds provided travel grants for participants with limited means.  Further dissemination of results is planned through publication of the papers presented at the conference as two separate issues of major journals in the field.
