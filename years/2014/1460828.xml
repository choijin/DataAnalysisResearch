<AbstractNarration>This award supports the continuation of the REU program in physics at the University of Arizona. Students may choose from a wide variety of forefront physics activities, under the direction of senior faculty members from the Department of Physics at the University of Arizona, or also from in research groups located in several other university academic units including Astronomy, Chemistry, Optical Sciences, Lunar and Planetary Studies, and Atmospheric Sciences. The primary source of participants is students who have completed the equivalent of the first or second year curriculum in science or engineering at Pima Community College, in preparation for transfer to a 4-year degree program (although all undergraduate students are eligible to apply). Graduate Teaching Assistants from the physics department serve as mentors for the participants. Special orientation and skills activities are individually tailored to enable the students to make significant contributions to the research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are trained for research in an intensive training camp for 1.5 weeks at the start of the REU. Here they learn essential lab skills such as machining, digital electronics and computer interfacing, taught by trained faculty and graduate mentors; they take part in team-building exercises such as scientific speaking and a catapult competition; and they tour the various research labs offering summer REU work. Participants are matched to research labs according to student preferences and skills, for a research experience lasting 8.5 weeks, culminating in a half-day REU symposium. Students are closely guided by the graduate mentors during the research period.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our REU program has a strong success record, spanning 26 years, for  turning community college students into young scientists and engineers.  In the current funding cycle, we have funded summer research stipends  for a total of 41 students (five of these in 2018).  They have learned  valuable research skills such as machining, digital electronics and 3D  modeling, successfully applied these skills to a 9-week research  project, and presented their results at the end of the summer.  While  REU activities are not expected to lead immediately to publications in  the  9-week period, many of the participants continue to  work long-term  with their faculty advisors.  From the 2015-18 funding period, former  REU students have co-authored 14 scientific publications with their  research groups.  Over the 26-year lifetime of our program, our  participants have published papers, given research talks, been  awarded  NSF Graduate Fellowships, traveled to Fermilab for the D0  experiment,  tested for toxins at Superfund sites, fabricated complex   nanotechnological devices, worked to reclaim wastewater at remote   locations, and have generally become happy and productive contributors   to the scientific enterprise.  They are a source of pride for the   University of Arizona, for Pima Community College, and for the local   community of which the students are a part.  91% of our REU participants transfer to a 4-year university (compared to 21% for the parent population of PCC students) Approximately 22% of participants are Hispanic and 35% women  (compared to 8% Hispanic and 20% women for the parent population of  physics and engineering students) 77% of REU participants complete a 4-year degree in natural science  and engineering (compared to around 42% persistence rate at 4-year  universities) 82% of the REU?s underrepresented minority population completes a  4-year degree in natural science and engineering (compared to 27%  persistence at 4-year universities)           Last Modified: 05/28/2019       Submitted by: Srinivas Manne]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
