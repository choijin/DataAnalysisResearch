<AbstractNarration>NRT-DESE: Computational Materials Education and Training - Bridging Methods and Applications (COMET)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of new materials offers solutions to pressing technological problems facing our society.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award prepares Ph.D. students at Pennsylvania State University with the skills to contribute to national efforts to discover and develop advanced materials with greater efficiency and lower cost.  Density functional theory, a theory based in quantum mechanics that can accurately predict materials properties, is a core pillar of the effort.  Addressing a need for density functional theory literacy across science and engineering, the program will bridge a gap between fundamental advances in density functional theory and its application for materials design.  As capstone projects, trainees will learn to develop online teaching materials that will be available worldwide.  Through internships with industry, interdisciplinary team projects, and international workshops, trainees will develop the combination of fundamental and applied research on a variety of tools that will promote collaborative innovation---across industry and academia, and across the globe.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program involves faculty from three colleges and six departments focused on interdisciplinary research on oxide interfaces, nanomaterials, organic electronics, and force-field development.  The research and training will provide graduate students with a firm foundation in density functional theory based computational materials science in all its aspects, ranging from the development of density functional theory methods to its direct use to solve problems in materials science, to its integration into multi-scale modeling involving theory, empirical force-field development, and simulations.  Additionally, this program will develop new coursework as well as a Computational Materials Science track within the Computational Science graduate minor and establish a professional development seminar series that will ultimately be available to all science and engineering graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

To achieve these aims, two new classes were developed to teach the theoretical underpinnings of DFT (in the Chemistry department) and the application of DFT via various software packages (in the Physics and Chemical Engineering departments).

After several stages of refinement, the DFT classes are now officially recognized as Penn State graduate electives and they are taken by both CoMET trainees and other Penn State students.  For example, in the latest offerings, the applications of DFT class had 11 students in 2020 and the fundamentals of DFT class has 17 students in 2021.  A new graduate minor in Computational Materials Science was established to recognize students' training in DFT and other aspects of computational materials science.  Currently, 20 students are enrolled in this minor. CoMET trainees also developed on-line educational materials on various aspects of their research. A 10-day International Summer School on Basics and Applications of Density Functional Theory was held at Centre Europaen de Calcul Atomique et Moleculaire (CECAM) in Lausanne, Switzerland,  the foremost international center for promoting research on advanced computational methods.  In addition to the National Science Foundation, CECAM, the European Psi-k Network, and Penn State University provided support for this school. The school involved 22 expert lecturers from the US and Europe and 35 students attended this school:  16 from the US and 19 from Europe, Asia, and Australia.  In addition to education, CoMET trainees performed research on a diverse range of topics in materials science.  To date, CoMET trainees published 93 papers in refereed scientific journals and gave over 60 presentations at scientific conferences.  To facilitate interdisciplinary research and its dissemination, a weekly seminar series was held throughout the duration of the CoMET program.  Trainees took turns presenting their research and various outside experts also spoke about scientific writing and presentation skills, including conference presentations, posters, and "elevator pitches".  Trainees, faculty, and outside visitors attended these seminars to learn about CoMET research, as well as to critique student presentations.  Another vehicle for research discussion was the DFT Cafe'.  Various different formats were tested and the DFT Cafe' eventually became a student-run activity.  CoMET provided many different professional development activities, mostly through the weekly seminar series.   In addition to oral and written research presentation skills, experts presented seminars on how to develop a web site and on data visualization.  A series of seminars was presented by outside experts on various aspects of the job search process:  developing a resume, networking, taking advantage of campus career development resources, interview skills, and special aspects of a virtual job search during the pandemic.  Several outside speakers (including CoMET alumni) described various post-PhD jobs and aspects they felt were needed to find and function successfully in these jobs.  Finally, CoMET held an annual seminar on stress management during graduate school.  The various professional development activities were assessed and the most successful are being continued in various departments at Penn State, as well as in Penn State's Materials Research Science and Engineering Center.  In summary, tangible legacies of the CoMET program are established interdisciplinary DFT coursework and a Computational Materials Graduate minor.  Another legacy is entrenchment of professional development activities in various departments and programs at Penn State.  Overall, more than 50 graduate students have been CoMET trainees.   Perhaps the most important legacy is crystallization of a community of researchers, with shared students and co-funded research projects that have significantly elevated the graduate experience in computational materials research at Penn State.
