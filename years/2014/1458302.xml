<AbstractNarration>This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Simpson College located in Indianola, Iowa will contribute to the national effort to produce more STEM graduates by establishing a cohort of 15 academically talented and Pell-eligible students.  Scholars will receive academic support while they pursue degrees in actuarial science, computer science, mathematics, or physics.  They will participate in a variety of enrichment activities such as (a) a one-week bridge program prior to their freshman year, (b) a mentored relationship with leaders from local industry, (c) a first semester computational modeling colloquium, (d) and a one-credit course on solving industry-generated problems provided by their mentors. Scholarships for academically strong STEM students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, have an impact on the number of graduates prepared to help national, regional, and local companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goals are well-defined and the methods outlined for achieving them are scaffolded to maximize student learning.  Activities like Campus connect (a first year orientation for skill building, including early exposure to computational modelling and writing), the Simpson Colloquium (a course that builds on modelling skills with real-world problems), and the Bridge to Success course are grounded in the literature and should lead to high academic achievement and retention of the participants.  The project will be evaluated on four criteria, Scholar GPA, participation in internships, first to second year retention, and placement in STEM graduate programs or careers upon graduation.  The evaluator will gauge the evolution of the scholars' perception of STEM careers through the Views About Science Survey at the beginning and end of the project.   Thus, project performance will be compared to national standards.  Students will also be surveyed about all aspects of the project.  Summative evaluation will rely on an analysis of the data in aggregate.  Results will be disseminated internally via faculty development workshops.  They will also be presented at appropriate regional venues including the Joint Mathematics Meeting and MathFest and at American Association of Physics Teachers,  American Physical Society, Council on Undergraduate Research national meetings.  This effort is expected to add to the knowledge base on development of recruitment and retention strategies for science and mathematics majors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Almost fifty percent of undergraduate STEM majors decide to switch their majors (Chen, 2013).  In order to retain highly-qualified students in STEM fields, many colleges and universities have developed bridge programs to support students (Ashley et al., 2017).  One of the reasons students choose to stay with STEM fields is a sense of belonging (Maton et al., 2016).  The Carver Bridge to STEM Success Program at Simpson College, funded by the National Science Foundation from 2015-2020, had this goal in mind. The Carver Bridge to STEM Success program was designed to engage a cohort of 15 Pell grant eligible undergraduate students in Biochemistry,Environmental Science, Computer Science, Actuarial Science, Mathematics, and Physics with a mentorship program throughout their undergraduate experience.  Additionally, students engaged in research and internship experiences in businesses and academia.      Intellectual Merit: According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2011), there is a need for mentoring studies that follow student cohorts and a need for mentoring research linked to outcome measures such as successful graduation, time-to-degree, and entry into the STEM workforce or graduate school. The Carver Bridge to Success program added to this research and found:    14 of the original 15 students graduated from Simpson College in December 2019 (3.5 years) or May 2020 (4 years).  This four-year graduation rate of 93.3% far exceeds the College?s six-year graduation rate of 69.6%. The only student who did not graduate from Simpson College left the institution to pursue nursing in her home city.   At the end of their 3rd year, Carver Bridge students achieved an average grade point average of 3.31/4.00 in comparison to a group of students who would have been eligible for the program whose average was 3.17.      At the end of their 3rd year, 80% of Carver Bridge students persisted in a STEM major in comparison to a group of eligible students who persisted at a rate of 40%.   Two of the cohort?s original 15 students left the program to pursue non-STEM majors. Simpson retained both.      Qualitative research on the program shows:   Students felt the program anchored them to campus, viewing it as their home base.    Students valued their relationships with faculty inside and outside of the program.   Students shared the Carver Bridge program scholarship gave them the peace of mind, and the monetary ability, to dedicate time and energy to pursuing their interests inside and outside the classroom.        The students in the program also added to the intellectual merit. Below are a few highlights:   Carver Bridge students have engaged in high-impact practices such as:    95% participated in academic competitions (mathematical modeling, physics modeling, and/or computer programming).   80% have completed at least one summer research experience or STEM internship.   Seven students presented at regional and national conferences in STEM or STEM Education.    Four students submitted four articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals in Biology and STEM Education.    57% studied abroad compared to 37% of Simpson students generally.    57% conducted undergraduate research compared to 16% of Simpson students generally.          Broader Impacts: The most significant broader impacts were afforded through the Carver Bridge to STEM Success Seminar, a one-credit seminar that ran each semester from Spring 2017 - Spring 2020.  The seminar enabled 100% of Carver Bridge students to research in small groups partnered with mentors in business, industry, and government.  The seminar model was informed by Simpson College?s participation in the NSF-funded PIC Math program starting in Summer 2018.  In Spring 2020, the seminar was offered in the Simpson College Honors Program. With the seminar connected with the Honors Program, we plan to run the seminar every year post-NSF funding. A list of sample projects completed includes:   Working with Koppers, Inc. to develop a cost-benefit analysis for customized inventory using historical sales data.    Working with Blank Park Zoo to analyze behavior data for the Zoo?s macaque troop.    Working with PowerPollen to develop an Android mobile application to allow collection and centralized reporting of data in agricultural fields.    Ashley, M., Cooper, K. M., Cala, J.
