<AbstractNarration>Researchers propose to develop software for determining the extent of flooding following dam or levee failure.  In current models and software, flows are assumed to be one-dimensional flows, which is not valid for natural channels (especially those with flood plains), and the dam is assumed to fail instantaneously, which is not true on real-life projects. Therefore, the results computed may not be accurate and the resulting plans are unreliable. The research team has developed numerical procedures for two-dimensional dam-break flows and compared the computed and experimental results. Small and large scale laboratory tests on gradual failure of dams are being conducted. The proposed software will be user-friendly, utilize state-of-the-art numerical procedures, allow interactive data input and provide options for graphical output and can be used by authorities and consulting engineering firms to develop emergency preparedness plans for possible dam and levee failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the Teton Dam Failure in 1976, all the owners of high dams have been mandated by the US Federal Government to prepare emergency plans for possible dam failure. The proposed innovation can be utilized to simulate flooding resulting from accidental dam and levee failures and planned levee breach to mitigate flood hazards. The proposed model can be used to prepare emergency plans for a catastrophic flooding event and save a significant amount of money and lives and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Preventative measures need to be taken to develop a better estimate of a dam or levee failure flow and our software can provide inundation maps of potential flooded areas for the development of emergency action plans by dam owners and first responders. An extended version of the model will be suitable for simulating flood flows from rainstorm and snowmelt, failure of other hydraulic structures, avalanches and mud flows, and simulation of possible geomorphic environmental impacts.</AbstractNarration>

Following the Teton Dam Failure in 1976, the owners of high dams have been mandated by the US Federal Government to prepare emergency plans for possible dam failure. Presently available software (HEC-RAS) for such studies was developed for steady flow by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in the mid-sixties, with an unsteady flow part added recently.

In addition, the dam is assumed to fail instantaneously, which does not occur in real-life situations. Therefore, the results computed by the model and the resulting emergency plans are inaccurate. Using the proposed two-dimensional model, more robust and realistic results could be determined. This updated model could be used to prepare emergency plans for catastrophic flooding, mitigate adverse environmental impacts, save money, and most importantly, lives. The proposed software will be user-friendly, utilize state-of-the-art numerical procedures, allow interactive data input and provide options for graphical output.   The I-CORPS project consisted of a seven-week course, from the beginning of January to the end of February 2014.  Two three-day seminars were held at the University of California Berkeley at the beginning and at the end of the course.   Each week during the course, there was an online meeting with all team members of all participating teams.  During these online meetings, the Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) gave a ten-minute presentation on the teamÆs findings from the interviews of that week. During the I-CORPS course, there were lectures and tutorials on how to determine value propositions for each customer and essentially the price they would be willing to pay for the product.  The instructors encouraged the team to get out of the academic environment and seek industry input.  The project provided the EL with a unique opportunity to interact with the end users, to discuss the current software and determine gaps and needs that could be met with the proposed model.  Over the course of the project, over 100 interviews were conducted.  In each 20- 30 minute interview with industry practitioners, we discussed the hydraulic software they were currently using and the overall satisfaction with the existing models.  The feedback indicated that the currently available software is outdated and there is a need for a new model. Therefore, it was determined that a comprehensive two-dimensional model for dam-break and levee failure model and the inclusion of hydrologic component for real-time simulation of floods would overcome the shortcomings of the presently available models.  Typical users of the proposed software will be engineering consulting firms and governmental agencies, such as FEMA, Department of Homeland Security, or the US Army Corps of Engineers.  The prediction of dam-break and levee breach flow is essential for the development of countermeasures, for the preparation of evacuation plans, and for the design of preventative infrastructure.  Discussions with numerous FEMA and NOAA employees indicate that the incorporation of hydrologic component to include rainfall data based on weather prediction will be incredibly beneficial.  NOAA uses HEC-RAS for their flood prediction models, but they find that the computed flood zones are inaccurate and the model takes too long to run.  This is unsatisfactory for issuing real-life flood warnings and for notifying first responders and affected populations.  There is a need for a more accurate model that is not computationally intensive and is user friendly.   Our plans are to seek input and support and possible sponsorship from organizations, such as NOAA and USACE....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
