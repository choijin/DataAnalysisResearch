<AbstractNarration>This research project will examine the degree to which mosses may serve as an alternative for stream bank stabilization in environments where there has been limited success by other riparian vegetation.  Stream bank erosion often results in the loss of valuable land resources and a degradation of environmental quality because stream sediment and nutrient loads increase while water quality gets reduced.  Stream bank erosion also affects infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and buildings, by impacting their very foundations.  Riparian vegetation plays both hydrological and mechanical functions on stream banks by increasing the tensile strength of soils and intercepting surface runoff and precipitation to potentially reduce bank failure.  Perennial herbs and woody plants, including shrubs, are the two major vegetation types that traditionally have been used to help control stream bank erosion, because their deep root systems promote bank stability and reduce the rates of bank erosion.  This project will evaluate the ecological condition of mosses and their effects on soil characteristics and bank erosion in different experimental settings.  Project findings will provide new perspectives regarding how the presence or absence of moss carpets affects soil pressure and consequently the rates of bank erosion.  The project will contribute new understanding about integrated relationships among fluvial geomorphology, riparian vegetation, ecosystem restoration, and biogeomorphology.  Project results will provide information and insights that will assist decision makers, governmental agencies, and resource managers in adopting effective and sustainable approaches to stream bank stabilization.  They also will be useful to those engaged in restoration activities by providing perspectives about alternative approaches to stabilize stream banks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will focus on analysis of the effectiveness of mosses for stream bank stabilization through a comparative analysis for study areas in the Chesapeake Bay and Upper Mississippi River watersheds.  They will analyze biogeomorphic relationships and feedbacks between mosses and stream banks through a series of in situ and laboratory experiments over a three-year time frame.  The experiments will survey multiple sites using terrestrial LiDAR, traditional geomorphic methods, and bioecological techniques.  Geospatial data for the study areas, including digital elevation models (DEMs), satellite imagery, stream network, and land cover, will be integrated with information from field surveys for a detailed biogeomorphic analysis.  Project findings will provide new perspectives about stream bank stabilization projects and the understanding of relationships between riparian vegetation and fluvial geomorphology for similar environmental conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>This project tested moss as a less traditional type of biomass on stream banks where more common woody and herbaceous plants have limited success. It included a series of field experiments on stream banks of two low order streams: Thompson Creek and an unnamed stream. Thompson Creek is located on the Mason Neck Peninsula in Fairfax County, Virginia. The second study site is an unnamed stream in the Ira and Reatha T Post Wildlife Sanctuary located near Colchester in McDonough County of West Central Illinois. Both streams have comparable watershed areas and landcover types. Our field investigations revealed that both streams are different in many geo-physical conditions due to their respective eco-regions. In each stream, we selected a total of 56 sites (28 sites per stream) by walking through each channel in Illinois (Vishnu Sprigs) and Virginia (Thompson Creek). At each site, we identified four experimental plots with different scenarios such as naturally moss-covered plots, naturally bare plots, plots where we introduced moss, and plots where moss was removed from. These experimental plots were surveyed twice each year over a duration of three years. An approximate overall rate of 50% establishment of moss in the nearby habitats of both sites suggest their successful colonization. However, the presence of leaf litter and bank collapse can limit their colonization. The statistical analysis of topsoil moisture from different types of plots revealed that moss covered plots had significantly lower topsoil moisture as compared to bare plots. Similarly, addition and removal of moss cover seemed to modify the topsoil moisture. Therefore, the presence of moss cover is likely to moderate the topsoil moisture suggesting more stability of banks. Each field plot was scanned with a laser scanner during field visits. The resulting point clouds of each plot were analyzed using the Cyclone Suite and compared over time to determine the topographic change over time. While field observations suggest a promising role of moss in stabilizing stream banks, statistical analysis is inconclusive to determine the extent of topographic influence of moss on stream banks. A more elaborate future analysis will further help explain the bio-geomorphic effects of moss on stream banks.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/27/2021<br>      Modified by: Ranbir&nbsp;Kang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
