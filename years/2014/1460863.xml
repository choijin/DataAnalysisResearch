<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL PART:  This project continues the Interfaces and Surfaces REU site at Clemson University focused on providing student researchers the opportunity to conduct research that will improve current scientific understanding of materials interfaces and surfaces.  The research and program activities have been designed to help participants have a positive research experience, and to encourage them to pursue graduate studies and research oriented careers.  The PIs will focus on recruiting a diverse group of students to apply for and participate in the program.  Each accepted student will have an obtainable summer research goal that is embedded within their faculty mentor's established research program.  All REU students will also participate in a workshop series designed to enhance their laboratory experience by focusing on professional skills and knowledge: navigation of scientific literature, laboratory documentation, and career path options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL PART:  The Interfaces and Surfaces REU site has four clearly defined programmatic goals:  (1) providing students with the opportunity to conduct independent research with an obtainable summer research goal using state-of-the-art characterization tools and testing equipment commonly used in materials science graduate school and research careers, (2) improving student awareness of the importance of developing a research network and identifying career mentors, (3) providing students with the training and guidance to present their work in a professional manner at a well-attended poster session, and (4) encouraging students to consider research careers and find a graduate program that fits their interests and goals. Faculty mentors have been selected based on their technical research merit and their demonstrated commitment to mentoring undergraduate researchers.  Program assessment will focus primarily on the program's impact on participants' career plans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thirty-one undergraduate students lead a research project focused on controlling and characterizing material surfaces and interfaces during the 2015-2018 summers. Each undergraduate researcher was paired with both a faculty advisor and a graduate student mentor who helped guide the student through the research process, which included navigating of scientific literature, documenting their research thoughts and actions and disseminating their findings to the larger research community.  In addition, all the undergraduate researchers also took part in a professional development seminars that helped them to reflect on their career path options, the skills needed to become a professional scientist/engineer and how to transition into their chosen career paths.  One of the program's goals was to encourage the participants to consider attending a science or engineering graduate program that fits their interests and goals.   At the end of the program, 64.5% of the participants indicated that they intended to go directly to a science or engineering graduate program after completing their bachelor?s degrees.  All particpants presented their research results at a large undergraduate poster symposium open to the general  university community and some also disseminated this work at national conferences or as peer reviewed articles.     To understand the impact of the program, the administrators surveyed the participants to understand how the program influenced their career goals, self-efficacy related to research tasks and identify which program aspects (such as time with advisors, research project success) played a role in student satisfaction.  While survey items related to career goals and programmatic aspects have been well documented previously, the administrators focused on refining the research self-efficacy items.  It should be noted that many of the activities that participants take part in during the program have been experienced by the participants before attending the REU (such as reading scientific journal articles). However, participants highlighted in their survey responses that the research experience and related programming helped them understand the need for these skills and strengthened their confidence.
