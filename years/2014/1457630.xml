<AbstractNarration>Evolutionary change involves both the addition and loss of traits. Much attention has been paid to those traits that are added over time, but far less is known regarding the loss of traits. Cave-dwelling animals, such as the blind Mexican cavefish, powerfully illustrate this phenomenon since they completely lack eyes and pigmentation. This study applies cutting-edge genetic tools to understand why traits are lost in nature, and will balance our understanding of how evolution shapes and molds organisms to their environment, yielding the enormous diversity found in nature. This project includes outreach activities to engage the public with this remarkable creature. Through partnerships with local schools and the Cincinnati Zoo, the Gross lab will introduce both students and the broader community to this intriguing animal. Additionally, this research project will provide training and research opportunities at the high school, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels. Further, this project will continue to facilitate interactions with the international Astyanax research community through collaborations and scientific meetings. This work will therefore have positive societal impacts for the American public as well as the international scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to uncover precise genetic changes underlying evolutionary phenotypic loss. Parallel transcriptomic and genomic approaches will evaluate genetic alterations (coding versus expression levels) implicated in pigmentation loss in a powerful cave model system, Astyanax mexicanus. This freshwater fish harbors two distinct morphotypes, an "ancestral" surface- and multiple "derived" cave-dwelling forms. Some cave populations descended from an 'older' stock, and some descended from a 'younger' stock of surface-dwelling ancestors. These natural replicate experiments allow us to investigate how genetic changes are impacted by diverse influences, such as the amount of time that has passed since the colonization of a cave environment. Recently available genetic and genomic resources now enable high-resolution studies of both known and unknown pigmentation genes for structural, expression and functional analyses. This project will inform how pleiotropy and the age of independent cave populations influence the genetic changes accompanying trait loss. Ultimately, this work will help clarify our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms (selection versus drift) leading to regression in the natural world.</AbstractNarration>

Using a surface-cavefish comparative approach, we discovered one gene in particular, <em>Mc1r</em>, has evolved substantial regulatory differences in older cave populations associated with reduced expression (Stahl &amp; Gross, 2015). By combining QTL, genomic and transcriptomic data, we discovered a novel role for two genes, <em>Pmela</em> and <em>Tyrp1b</em> in multigenic pigmentation regression (Stahl et al., 2018). Through analyses of the draft cavefish genome, we also discovered a novel tandem duplication of <em>Mc1r</em> in <em>Astyanax</em>, and this locally-duplicated allele also demonstrates a rare loss-of-function mutation in cave, but not surface, fish (Gross et al., 2017). In collaboration with a team of colleagues, we characterized the role of cave-to-surface gene flow in the recurrent evolution of cave-associated traits (Herman et al., 2018); and, at the physiological level we discovered that certain hybrid cave/surface fish individuals demonstrate 'hypermelanism', substantial epithelial darkening owing to a pleiotropic interaction between vision loss and over-activation of the 'background adaptation' reflex (Gross et al., 2016). Additionally, we generated the first developmental transcriptome of cave and surface morphs, through which we discovered: a) similar genetic functional profiles associated with trait loss evolve through different mechanisms, and b) widespread convergence on two 'master regulators' of pigmentation loss, <em>Otx2</em> and <em>Mitf</em>, in geographically-distinct cave populations (Stahl &amp; Gross, 2017). Our recent publication explicitly tested the notion that regressive evolution is accompanied by widescale accumulation of insertion-deletion mutations (Berning et al., 2019). This work revealed previously unappreciated changes to the cavefish genome impacting blood physiology, growth, and epigenetics. Our most recent publication, found that rearing cave and surface morphs under their 'natural' photic conditions reveals novel gene expression patterns associated with olfaction and, again, blood physiology (Sears et al., 2020). These results, in turn, suggest that many traits evolving through regressive loss, likely impact other (seemingly unrelated) physiological systems. This intriguing finding lays important groundwork for future studies examining how intense selection for adaptive phenotypes (e.g., sensory structures) can impact features that are 'dispensable' to an organism (e.g., vision), given their new environment. In sum, this productive funding period provided novel insight through the integrative analysis of evolutionary mechanisms of trait loss, cavefish demography, and the accumulation of genetic mutations. <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts of NSF Support</span></em></strong> The Gross lab is passionate about public scientific outreach, and actively fosters engagement among all of its members. This is reflected in our open-access publication of an engaging, interactive 'evolution' curriculum for kindergartners (Gross et al., 2016). This program was developed collaboratively with UC undergraduate students, and has been led by undergraduate, graduate and high school students for the past four years. Owing to the popularity of the program, we have adapted it for a broader audience - delivering it to several K-3 students since 2015 (34 classrooms, ~800 students). In addition, we have supported four high school students for summer research assistantships in 2017 and 2018, through our NSF-sponsored RAHSS supplement. Our students have gone on to other undergraduate programs (University of Chicago, Tulane, Cornell, Vanderbilt) where they are continuing their research careers. We have supported four female undergraduate students through the UC Women in Science and Engineering Program (WISE) and departmental STEM fellow programs. The Gross lab is a collaborative member of the <em>Astyanax</em> research community, actively participating in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 biennial <em>Astyanax</em> International Meetings wherein Dr. Gross served as a session moderator; we have provided transcriptomic and genomic sequencing data to colleagues in advance of publication; and we have contributed to the development of several shared community resources (e.g., a webpage, a techniques database, the draft genome). Gross lab research in craniofacial and sensory biology has been showcased twice in the journal <em>Science</em> (June 24, 2016; January 4, 2019). This project also catalyzed Dr. Gross' efforts in the classroom, evidenced by: A) a published, open-access article detailing adaptation of 'active-learning' approaches for an upper division course (Gross &amp; Carlson, 2018); and B) source material used in delivering a graduate course, 'Genes and Adaptation' in 2017 and 2019. Since 2014, the laboratory has participated in 48 presentations at local, regional, national and international conferences represented by four graduate students, twelve undergraduate students, and two high school students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/13/2020<br>      Modified by: Joshua&nbsp;Gross</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
