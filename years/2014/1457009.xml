<AbstractNarration>During animal development, cells increase in number as the overall body and each part of the body grow in size and complexity. The processes that coordinate growth, shape generation, and final size are essential to ensure the correct body pattern is made and key features such as limbs are properly formed. In this project, the fruit fly wing will be used as a model to study limb growth. By studying the wing at the beginning of development, when the tissue is simpler, the direct effects of genes that regulate cell growth can be tested. The research will use important resources that have been developed in the nationally funded genome projects and will involve molecular biology, genetics and microscopy. It is expected that a comprehensive view of how a limb is established from the earliest stages will emerge. The genes used in limb development in fruit flies are conserved with other animals, including humans, so that general principals will be learned. To increase public understanding of science, an animated movie will be made in conjunction with the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design. The movie will highlight the beginning of fruit fly genetics, which started a field of research that has fueled the fundamental understanding of animal biology for more than a century.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As animal body parts and organs grow in size and complexity, cell proliferation must be linked to cell fates so that the final structure has the correct pattern and proportions. A major goal in developmental biology is to understand the link between patterning and growth (scaling) at a mechanistic level. In the proposed work, the small group of cells comprising the wing disc, which become the fly thorax and wing, will be studied as they increase in number from about 30 to 150 cells. In this short time window the major pattern is established. The mechanisms that operate here encapsulate those typical of all growing systems and involve conserved growth factors in the Dpp and Egfr pathways. By studying the regulation of cell-cell signaling and determining how cell fate is linked to domains of cell proliferation, the work is expected to both fill a gap in knowledge about early development of the Drosophila wing and provide insight into fundamental processes shared in all animals. In an effort to broaden public understanding of genetics, the story of the pioneer Drosophila geneticist, Morgan, will be documented in a biographical film. In partnership with ACCAD (Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design), a state-of-the-art graphic film will be made that describes the discovery of the first Drosophila mutant - the famous white-eyed fly. The film will be posted on YouTube for broad dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
