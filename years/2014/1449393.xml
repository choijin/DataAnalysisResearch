<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks support for a UC Biomedical Research Acceleration, Integration, and Development (UC BRAID/CAI) I-Corps Hub consortium, a coordinated effort among the UC medical campuses with the goal of facilitating translation and accelerating promising technologies at the UCs. The campuses include: Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco. The program will implement a training and education curriculum in order to train entrepreneurs on the UC BRAID campuses by leveraging the infrastructure of the UC Center for Accelerated Innovation (UC CAI) housed at UCLA, along with the NSF-approved LLP curriculum - through accessing the experience and knowledge that helped draft the initial Lean Launch Pad for Life Science/Healthcare (that was hosted by UCSF). The course will provide real world, hands-on education and training on what it is needed to start a scalable company.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps Hub will leverage UC CAI's training and education emphasis and be able to provide: 1) world-class scientific and clinical research that generates a flow of technologies which are potentially on the brink of commercialization; 2) leadership in NSF I-Corps education for life science/healthcare that will help deliver a strong offering to its component campuses; 3) utilization of the infrastructure built by the UC CAI to deliver education and training components across the UC campuses (as well as across departments and schools) to attract entrepreneurs at all levels; and 4) robust and proven curriculum that encourages entrepreneurship, networking, interdisciplinary team building and world-class teaching and mentorship to all levels of interested entrepreneurs.</AbstractNarration>

The following are a few examples of outcomes four-months post-course completion. Anecdotally, two teams have been accepted into accelerators.  iSonoHealth, a collaborative team between industry, Stanford and UCSF roots, has just been accepted into one of the countryÆs most competitive accelerators, Y Combinator.  Enable Biosciences, a team from UC Berkeley, is at StartX/QB3, an alliance between StanfordÆs accelerator and biotech labs managed by QB3.  Admission into these accelerators is a major achievement given the intensity of competition for these slots. Several teams have applied for SBIR grants that are currently under review, and a select number of promising teams that are ready to fundraise continue to be actively mentored.  Translation from academe by identifying promising biomedical product opportunities to the commercial world can produce substantial benefit for the economy and society.  By providing researchers with tools they need to successfully move products to commercialization, the gap between technology and the marketplace for products that provide health benefits to society will be decreased.
