<AbstractNarration>This project aims to acquire a supercomputer cluster that will in turn enable data-intensive research in many diverse fields such as bioscience, geoscience, imaging, and vision. Specifically, the acquisition responds to the need to transform campuses' supercomputer resource provisioning practices with federated, hybrid cloud services that can seamlessly orchestrate the provisioning of local and remote resources (e.g., cyber-enabled scientific instruments, public clouds) to meet data-intensive research and education needs of users. The project focuses on application workflows considering connectivity and communications necessary for interdisciplinary research and education collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supercomputer cluster augments existing facilities (e.g., Science DMZ 'network instrument' connected to the Internet2 Innovation platform, Transmission Electron Microscope, Federated-IAM 'entitlement service') and the core on-campus supercomputer resources. The project leverages advanced tools for central processing units and graphics processing units (CPU/GPU) as well as network visualization from existing funded projects for configuration of experiments with the instrument to develop 'custom templates' for diverse data intensive web-based applications. These custom templates will abstract the high-level policy and performance throughput requirements of data-intensive applications and 'personalize' them to lower-level control specifications implementable in an on-demand manner by virtualization technologies such as OpenStack and OpenFlow. Furthermore, the investigators will assess how the next-generation supercomputing user service models with custom templates can be composed to allow campus IT staff to sustainably and seamlessly support hybrid cloud use cases in research and education. Specifically, the instrument services&lt;br/&gt;- Hybrid Cloud Computing,&lt;br/&gt;- Bioinformatics and computational biology, &lt;br/&gt;- Multi-modal data analytics, and &lt;br/&gt;- Next generation HPC user services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation supports 16 researchers and their external collaborators in diverse data-intensive science fields such as bioscience, geoscience, imaging, and vision. It also supports the delivery of high-performance computing and Big Data analytics courses to more than 500 students at this institution and those around it. Participation of underrepresented and underserved groups will be accomplished utilizing the current NSF REU site as well as the institution's EPSCoR activities. Best practices to streamline the engineering/operations of hybrid clouds for data intensive applications, technologies/tools, policies and service models will all be disseminated. The instrument supports undergraduate and graduate courses and various other education and training activities, including REU programs. The proposed projects advances computational science research, research training, and curriculum development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF MRI grant (Award #1429294) came at an opportune time at the University of Missouri - Columbia (MU).  In 2014, the campus infrastructure was well past end of life in terms of the hardware and of the underlying software and supporting infrastructure.  This grant was a key factor for the successful transition and the continued growth of the high-performance computing (HPC) and high-throughput computing (HTC) infrastructure at MU.  The cluster went from 90 active users a month using 400,000 core hours (November 2014) to 170 active users a month using 4,000,000 core hours (August 2018). Over ten times growth in computation in under four years.  Intellectual Merit  This HPC/HTC computing cluster has been enabling computational, biological, medical, plants, and STEM researches. Many of the scientific advancement could not be done without the computing capacity built on this innovative hybrid cloud environment.  The research results in 61 publications in the formats of book chapters (3), PhD dissertations (4), MS theses (6), refereed conferences (14), and refereed journals (31). Moreover, there are US patent applications from the research results on this infrastructure.  Broader Impacts  This MRI infrastructure also provides a state-of-the-art framework for MU educators to develop curriculum in Data Science and Analytics from data carpentry, big data analytics, visualization, to storytelling. There are more than 352 undergraduate students and 183 grdauate students used the education nodes of the cluster from 32 institutions (REU trainee's home institutions and surrounding non-doctoral granting institutions) through 8 courses which were either newly created or added with HPC/HTC modules.  In addition to providing compute resources to the identified researchers associated with the grant (participants), the NSF MRI grant was also key in developing the following capabilities:  Training of HPC/HTC administrators.  The early phase of clusters played a key role in training most of the current research computing staffs and leadership in how to build, operate, and manage a HPC system in a controlled environment. The development and refinement of the current deployment and configuration system used in the current cluster (Puppet and Razor). The development and early use of a HDFS filesystem along with Hadoop and Spark in a HPC cluster configuration.  . Campus wide GPU cluster capability. GPU utilization at the University of Missouri has grown over the years and the grant capacity allowed the community adopt this new technology. A Community investment model with specialized governance. A continuously evolving cluster at rack scale to meet the growing needs of researchers without multiple clusters or large transitions.  The rack scale model provides a balance between growth, flexibility, scale, efficiency, and economies of scale.   This NSF MRI project provides MU a solid cyber infrastructure for future growth in data-intensive and data-driven research with a well thought-out self sustainable plan.
