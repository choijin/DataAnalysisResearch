<AbstractNarration>This award to the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will provide technical assistance to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) to facilitate successful participation in the NSF HBCU-Undergraduate Program and the NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. Five workshops will be held for faculty from HBCUs; three of these workshops will include faculty from other MSIs. Workshops will focus on enhancing the ability of faculty to prepare competitive proposals to the NSF HBCU-UP and MRI programs. Experienced consultants will assist QEM in the conduct of the workshop series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will involve a minimum of 160 STEM faculty from HBCUs and 90 STEM faculty from other MSIs to provide a strong foundation for institutions to pursue and successfully receive support for HBCU-UP implementation projects, targeted infusion projects, broadening participation research projects, research initiation award projects, and NSF MRI projects. The anticipated outcome is the increased potential for faculty from MSIs to strengthen their research portfolio and improve their research infrastructure at these institutions. The longer term broader impact is the production of the Nation's next generation of highly qualified and diverse STEM educators and researchers.</AbstractNarration>

QEM conducted a series of five workshops for faculty from HBCUs&ndash;&ndash;three of these workshops included STEM faculty from other MSIs. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">overall goal</span>: to enhance the ability of faculty to prepare competitive MRI and HBCU-UP proposals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>QEM received a supplement to this award to conduct a sixth workshop, focused on increasing the competiveness of HBCU faculty in the NSF Education and Human Resources (EHR) Directorate&rsquo;s Core Research (ECR) Program, to engage HBCU faculty in education research focused on STEM teaching and learning. The QEM HBCU-UP/MRI project&rsquo;s STEM-focused proposal and professional development workshop series enhanced skillsets and increased the potential for faculty from MSIs to strengthen their research portfolio and improve the STEM research and education infrastructure at these institutions. <strong>Over 290 participants, representing 69 institutions [55 HBCUs, 1 Tribal Colleges, 12 Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and 1 other MSI], attended the workshops.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The workshops focused on: proposal development in HBCU-UP program tracks and the MRI program to support STEM research and education capacity-building; dissemination of effective strategies for involving underrepresented students in STEM research; and professional development for junior faculty to increase/enhance their STEM scholarly productivity and teaching effectiveness. QEM consultants with expertise in a range of STEM fields and NSF project management assisted participants in developing their proposal ideas and project summaries as well as drafting career advancement/mentoring plans. The consultants also made presentations to support topical agenda items, including education research fundamentals, the NSF Merit Review Criteria and Proposal Guide, involving/mentoring undergraduates in research, and evaluating success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>QEM staff and consultants conducted follow-up activities with participants to assess impact and provide additional technical assistance to the faculty, as needed, to facilitate/encourage their completion and submission of HBCU-UP and MRI proposals. An enhancement to previous QEM workshops included the conduct of a technical assistance webinar facilitated by QEM Consultants. PIs of funded NSF projects interacted with workshop participants through panel presentations, networking, and special sessions. The 2015 RIA workshop participants as well as RIA grantees were invited to attend a February 2016 QEM HBCU-UP workshop focused on Research Mentoring for early career faculty.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Workshop participants engaged in discussions with peers to address STEM capacity-building challenges faced by their institutions as well as explore collaborative efforts. Workshop agendas, with live links to presentations, and E-Resource Files were sent by e-mail to participants and also posted to the QEM website to facilitate dissemination to other faculty as well as the general public. URL: <a href="http://www.qem.org/hbcuup/">http://www.qem.org/hbcuup/</a>. QEM strongly encouraged them to share information and materials received at the workshops with colleagues on their campuses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>IMPACT </strong></p> <p>At the end of each workshop, participants completed evaluation questionnaires to provide feedback regarding their overall rating of the workshop. Of the 272 questionnaire respondents (91% response rate), 96% gave the workshops an overall rating of &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; or &ldquo;very good.&rdquo; Evaluations revealed that workshop participants gained a better understanding of how to involve students in research; integrate research findings into teaching; enhance STEM collaborations; and establish, manage, and sustain a viable research program.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>QEM staff conducted follow-up surveys with the participants, by e-mail and telephone, to assess impact. Proposal submission rates ranged from a low of 17.4% for MRI participants in MRI/RIA joint workshop #1, held August 2015, to a high of 81% for RIA faculty, also from workshop #1. Project staff also reviewed the NSF Awards databases, to determine participant post-workshop proposal submission success.</p> <p>An April 2018 review of recent awards showed that<strong> 41 participants from the 2015-17 HBCU-UP/MRI workshop series have received a total of 55 NSF awards since attending one of the workshops.

Successful RIA proposals will enable junior faculty to establish a research foundation and develop career advancement/mentoring plans to support their retention and persistence in academic careers at MSIs.
