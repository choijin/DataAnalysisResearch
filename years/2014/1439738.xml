<AbstractNarration>This Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship capacity building project will investigate ways to promote and support engineering education for three groups of learners: i) engineers and engineering students, ii) students in middle and high schools - especially from underrepresented groups, and iii) current math and science majors pursuing teacher certification, who desire to be prepared to teach engineering principles to students in grades 6-12.  Currently, there is little engineering in many teacher certification programs for individuals interested in becoming a STEM teacher; but the need has changed with the roll-out of the Next Generation Science Standards.  Teachers are most often certified to teach math, science, or technology, but rarely have sufficient background to adequately teach engineering principles.  Engineers, on the other hand, have expertise in engineering principles, but lack the knowledge and skills to effectively teach students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the increasing demand for teachers qualified to teach the engineering concepts included in the Next Generation Science Standards, this project will produce skilled STEM educators through three newly developed programs; first a minor in education for students studying engineering.  Second, a certificate in engineering education for STEM majors who are pursuing teacher certification, and third, a post-baccalaureate certificate in engineering education for engineering graduate students.  The project will also provide professional development opportunities for current STEM educators.  Finally, the project will select groups of university students to be trained to present hands-on workshops in local schools serving underrepresented groups with the intent of enticing these students to consider future studies in STEM related fields.  The project will contribute to a transformative change in STEM educator preparation, while providing outreach services to high need schools and attracting these students to STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
