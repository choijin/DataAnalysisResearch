<AbstractNarration>The research conducted under this grant will study the interface between two fields of mathematics:  homotopy theory and algebraic geometry.  Since the introduction of motivic homotopy theory by F. Morel and V. Voevodsky, it has been possible to use homotopy theoretic methods to study schemes (rigid geometric objects controlled by algebraic equations, important to topics as far-ranging as the theory of numbers and the laws controlling our physical universe).  Meanwhile chromatic homotopy theory and topological modular forms provide tools for transferring algebro-geometric data into topology and homotopy theory.  This research will work at the intersection of these fields, using algebraic geometry and homotopy theory to inform each other.  By incorporating portions of this program into the thesis curriculum at Reed College, this research will enhance the educational experience of Reed's students, exposing a diverse population of undergraduates to research-level mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ormsby proposes a four-fold program for studying chromatic and motivic homotopy theory.  First, furthering joint work with J. Heller, he will explicate the fashion in which Galois theory controls a particularly tractable part of the stable motivic homotopy category.  Second, continuing joint work with M. Behrens, N. Stapleton, and V. Stojanoska, he will use bivariable modular forms and the Adams spectral sequence to study cooperations in topological modular forms.  Third, he plans to study the convergence properties of the motivic slice spectral sequence over infinite-cohomological dimension fields, ultimately leading to computations in stable motivic homotopy sheaves.  Finally, he plans to introduce a theory of spectral presheaves with framed transfers and study their relation to foundational questions about the stable motivic homotopy category.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Kyle Ormsby pursued research at the interface of algebraic geometry and algebraic topology through the NSF award "RUI: Structure and computations in motivic and chromatic homotopy."  In addition to publishing research articles on equivariant homotopy, motivic homotopy, and derived algebraic geometry, Ormsby led two summer research programs for undergraduate students.  Ormsby's first research project focused on the role that field extensions play in motivic homotopy theory through their automorphisms.  This led to a proof (joint with Jeremiah Heller) that stable homotopy theory generalizes the classical Galois correspondence over the real numbers.  Also with Heller, Ormsby studied the (tensor triangular) geometry of the stable motivic homotopy category, realizing intricate structures over the spectrum of the ring of endomorphisms of the unit in this category.  With Behrens, Stapelton, and Stojanoska, Ormsby completed the first comprehensive study of co-operations in the topological modular forms spectrum at the prime 2.  Finally, Ormsby completed a major publication with R&ouml;ndigs and &Oslash;stv&aelig;r in which he exhibited an infinite vanishing range for the bi-graded homotopy groups of the motivic sphere spectrum.  In summer 2015, Ormsby led the "K-group," consisting of five undergraduate students pursuing research in K-theory and quadratic forms.  This led to two publications: Riley Thornton determined the spectrum of homogeneous prime ideals in the Milnor-Witt K-theory ring, and Ricardo Rojas-Echenique proved new results about the trace homomorphism from the Burnside ring of a finite Galois group to the Grothendieck-Witt ring of quadratic forms over the base field.  In summer 2017, Ormsby led "Project Project," a mathematics visualization group with the Project of Projecting mathematical ideas into the physical realm.  The group's work is recorded on its website where the five participants wrote blog-style articles describing their 3d-prints and computer visualizations.  Notable outcomes include Cameron Fish and Jalan Ziyad's realization of solids of constant width with perscribed symmetry groups (in terms of the invariant theory of spherical harmonic functions), and Henry Blanchette's 3d-prints of fibers of the Milnor fibration for torus knots.
