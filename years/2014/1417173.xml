<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will demonstrate and evaluate a novel film-based proof-of-concept Thermoelectric Energy Conversion (TEC) device.  This research will advance the energy landscape through an innovative technology with a superior combination of efficiency, power density, and cost.  TEC devices represent a zero emissions and zero operating cost technology.  About 60-70 quadrillion British thermal units (BTUs) of domestic heat energy are wasted per year.  Harvesting even 20% of this waste heat will supply as much power as 10-20 new nuclear power plants.  By scavenging waste heat from residential and industrial sectors (such as chemicals, manufacturing, oil and gas, refrigeration, transportation, and power plants), the technology will have a resounding impact on the energy sector and the economy. Finally, this effort will expand the current TEC market of $350 million to encompass a much greater share of the total $4 billion energy harvesting market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to traditional thermoelectric devices, the proposed design produces orders of magnitude higher temperature differentials utilizing micron-scale films, with a highly scalable manufacturing process. This is a transformative shift from the current design practice with bulk (millimeter-scale) materials. Even with inferior values of ZT (0.15, compared to the bulk figures of 0.5-1.0), the proposed design yields 9.8% efficiency at 200 degrees C, triple that of conventional designs.  At 600 degrees C (the temperature of typical engine exhausts), the efficiency (28%) becomes viable and the power-to-weight performance is superior to competing devices. Unlike conventional TEC devices, no forced cooling of the cold end is needed to maintain the temperature differential. The most promising aspect is that this innovation will replace today's serial and laborious manufacturing process with a scalable and high-throughput method.  This will increase power density and lower product cost in a similar fashion as has occurred in the semiconductor industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary of Project Outcome: Thermoelectric is a technique that converts heat to electricity that can be used to harvest waste heat. It has attractive features such as zero emission, maintenance and operation costs. However, it has very low energy conversion efficiency that is a major barrier to sustainable applications. Current products yield 5% efficiency around 250&deg;C temperature differential between the hot and cold ends.  In reality, merely putting the existing products on a hot surface does not develop a large temperature differential. Typically, all products are specified with an externally imposed temperature differential by cooling the cold end with forced convection (air or water). When the power input is taken into consideration, current technology is not zero operating cost.  The objective of this STTR Phase I project was to validate a novel concept and to demonstrate a laboratory prototype thermoelectric energy conversion device that does not need any auxiliary cooling unit to maintain a large temperature differential. The target performance was 3- 5 times higher efficiency compared to state of the art technology under the same boundary conditions (i.e., no external cooling). The motivation is due to the fact that most real life applications do not come with controlled hot and cold ends. For example, the automobile exhaust or the overheated computer chips have a hot surface only.  The last objective was to evaluate the market potential by probing potential customers, investors and industry experts.  We have developed and demonstrated a planar, freestanding thick film based thermoelectric energy conversion device that exploits the micro/nanoscale size dependence of heat transfer to achieve high efficiency and power output. We have shown our product to yield 3 times the Carnot efficiency of the existing products. The impact of our design is very large temperature differential without changing the material or any additional cooling system. Compared to existing products, which need controlled cold end temperature, our technology is truly æplug and playÆ type with no attention needed on the cold side. This is a tremendous advantage since auxiliary systems require operating and maintenance costs, which reduce efficiency when accounted for the overall cost benefit analysis.  We have performed a cost analysis to show that the new product would cost at least 3 times less than the existing products. We have developed manufacturing processes, where direct labor is the only major cost. Our estimates show that the cost can be 10 times lower if manufacturing is automated.  Our market evaluation showed tremendous interest, and a degree of disbelief that thermoelectric products can be developed to work without an auxiliary cooling system. Our design allows miniaturization and batch production, which can reduce cost compared to existing products.  Intellectual Merit: The principal discipline for this project is thermoelectric energy conversion. This project has a major impact on this discipline through the introduction of a new class of device design &ndash; planar freestanding thin film based thermoelectrics. Not a single study exists in the literature on freestanding thin film based devices.  The project connects thermal and electrical transport together, and the contributions impact these disciplines in addition to thermoelectrics. The notable impacts are:  1. Size dependence of natural convective heat transfer impacts the thermal transport area. The same way our thermoelectric elements lose heat can be exploited in cooling of microelectronics.  2. The developed technique for interfacial thermal contact resistance will impact engineering systems where thermal transport is involved, such as microelectronics, heat exchangers, sensors and actuators.  Broader Impact: The phase I project demonstrated 3 times increase in Carnot efficiency of thermoelectrics which has not seen any appreciable improvement in the last six decades.
