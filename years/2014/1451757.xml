<AbstractNarration>Children whose parents are knowledgeable about their children's activities tend to have better outcomes, with reduced delinquency.  It is commonly believed  that most parental knowledge about their children's activities comes through active efforts of parents to monitor or solicit information from their children.  Recent research indicates that voluntary disclosure of information, not parental monitoring or solicitation, is most predictive of how much parents know about their children's activities.  The current research investigates two additional questions about how disclosure within families relates to adolescent well-being. First, do siblings within a family show similar patterns of disclosure with their parents? Second, does disclosure between siblings, as well as between children and parents, impact adolescent well-being? Parent-adolescent relationships do not occur within a vacuum; the broader family system and adolescents' roles within it may influence these processes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the use of a three-year longitudinal study of first- and second-born siblings during adolescence (and their parents), the research team aims to investigate the developmental processes involved in adolescent disclosure within the broader family system.  Specifically, the differences in frequency of disclosure and the topic domains about which adolescents disclose to parents versus siblings will be examined, as well as family demographic and sibling relationship variables which may influence this process.  Possible positive and negative individual adjustment outcomes associated with adolescent disclosure to siblings, separate from those associations with disclosure to parents will also be examined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will also conduct family communication workshops through partnerships with local PTA and community groups within the mid-Missouri area. The sessions will focus on how best to create a family environment that encourages adolescents to disclose information about their daily lives and activities.  Such an environment should increase trust within multiple family relationships, generally strengthen the family bond, and be protective for adolescent adjustment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project entitled "Adolescent Information Management with Parents and Siblings" was conducted over 4 years.  During this time, we collected questionnaire, interview, and parent-child and sibling interactions with 123 families with at least two (pre)adolescents and followed up with these families one and two years later via questionnaires assessing family relationship qualities (including, support, positivity, conflict, and communication) and youth adjustment (including depression, anxiety, risky behavior, and self-esteem).  Data collection was the primary effort of the entire 4 year funding period, therefore, findings from the project are just now beginning to emerge.  Previous research on adolescent information management (which includes disclosure and secrecy of information) has primarily utilized self-reported questionnaires from adolescents and parents regarding how much information adolescents disclose to parents, keep secret from them, and over what issues.  This project, however, advanced this research area in multiple ways.  First, we examined what adolescents disclosed vs. kept secret from mothers, fathers, and siblings.  This information was collected with self-reported questionnaires, but also via interviews and observed parent-child and sibling interactions.  Previous research in this area has found that adolescents are more likely to tell their parents information about their activities when they have a trusting and supportive relationship with them.  Additionally, the more adolescents disclose to parents about their activities, the less likely they are to get in future risky behavior trouble.  While we are just beginning to analyze the data from the current project, we have found one interesting advancement to the previous research due to our inclusion of observed, real-time adolescent discussions with parents.  We found that when adolescents were rated (by themselves or their parents) as being highly involved and communicative during their actual discussions, the more likely they were to report disclosing a wide variety of topics to their parents.  However, when parents were rated (by themselves and their adolescents) as being highly involved and communicative during their real-time discussions, adolescents reported disclosing LESS to their parents.  While it is surprising that parents who are displaying engagement and involvement in a conversation would be associated with their teens telling them less information, it is possible that this isn?t what teens are looking for out of their parents when they are disclosing information to them.  Perhaps, they feel as though parents are over-involved or over-managing them, and thus, are less willing to disclose information to them.  These findings are important for identifying parent education and training opportunities for better ways to support their adolescents.  We are currently coding and analyzing this data further to better help us understand: 1) whether or not these processes differ for first-born and second-born youth within the same family, 2) whether disclosure to siblings works similarly or differently from disclosing to parents; specifically, can it be protective against risky behavior, particularly in the case of compensating for poor parent-child relationships, and 3) whether observed parent behaviors during parent-child discussions can be identified that are particularly encouraging (or discouraging) of adolescent disclosure.  Findings from these in-progress studies will aid in the creation of a Family Communication Workshop for parents of adolescents.  The primary investigator, Dr. Campione-Barr, has spent the project period participating in various community outreach events specific to parenting adolescents (e.g., expert panels following documentaries and films on adolescent experiences; presentations to parents on developmental milestones of adolescence), but is utilizing the findings of the present project specifically to develop scientifically-based recommendations for how, when, and over what topics parents should approach their teens about to better protect them from risky behaviors and mental health concerns.
