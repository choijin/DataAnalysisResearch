<AbstractNarration>The symposium will be attended by both prominent and young scientists in computational mathematics and computational fluid dynamics from around the world, who will be discussing future directions of research and research challenges that, if addressed rigorously, would have a strong impact in technology. Better computational modeling of fluid dynamics in complicated geometries can lead to improved understanding of a number of engineering problems in aerospace and naval applications, biomedical applications, wind energy production and energy conservation, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks funds to partially cover travel expenses of speakers and student participants to the conference entitled, "2015 International Symposium on High-Order Methods for Computational Fluid Dynamics", to be held in San Diego, CA, during July 26-30, 2015.  This international symposium emphasizes the fundamental development of high-order computational mathematics methods for solving fluid problems with complex geometry. The meeting will emphasize the development of methods for robust and accurate methods for shock capturing; efficient methods for turbulence modeling (Large Eddy Simulations and Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations); high-order computation mesh generation with curved elements and resolving wall flow physics; moving and deforming grids to enable high-fidelity simulation of fluid-structure interaction; implementing high-order methods using more efficient computer architectures and GPU systems; and using high-order methods for predicting new flow physics.</AbstractNarration>
