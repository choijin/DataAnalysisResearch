<AbstractNarration>Governments around the world spend large shares of their budgets on the public provision of private goods. Understanding the tradeoffs between redistribution in cash and in kind is thus central to government policy. For example, redistributing in-kind may potentially reduce choice and thus lower recipients' welfare, but may increase taxpayers' welfare if they have paternalistic preferences and care more about preventing hunger than about the other aspirations of the poor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose a rigorous experimental study to estimate (i) beneficiary preferences over equally-valued cash and in-kind transfers, (ii) the relative impact on nutrition of cash and in-kind transfers, and (iii) beneficiary valuation of in-kind benefits. This design allows one to measure both beneficiary preferences (using the take up rate) as well as the causal impact of cash vs. kind benefits on nutrition (using the random assignment of the offer to estimate both intent-to-treat and treatment-on-treated effects on nutrition). Further, the PIs offer additional randomly selected households the option to exchange their in-kind benefits for an experimentally varied cash transfer, which allows to estimate the demand for the status quo at various prices and to quantify the consumer surplus (or loss) beneficiaries obtain from in-kind benefits relative to cash transfers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methodologically, the PIs integrate in one design the two paradigms that have dominated modern policy evaluation, one based on impacts, the other based on revealed preferences. In addition, by measuring take-up at randomly varied prices, the PIs are among the first to estimate individual-level beneficiary valuations of publicly-provided private goods using experimental data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The revealed preference approach is unique in enabling one to understand and accommodate heterogeneity of beneficiary preferences over cash and in-kind benefits, thereby reducing the political and ethical risks of policy experimentation in a critical area such as food security for the poor</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To implement the design outlined in our proposal, we conducted multiple pilot studies on beneficiary demand for cash transfers in lieu of subsidized food grains provided by the Public Distribution System (PDS) in India.  A first set of pilots was conducted in Bihar in 2013-2014 and a second one in Rajasthan in 2015.  These pilots led to both working papers and policy reports.    Three key achievements enabled by the pilots undertaken with the NSF grant include:  1) Sharing of the pilot results in several fora with senior policy makers, including the Chief Economic Adviser to the Govt. of India and the Vice-Chairman of the NITI Aayog (the principal think-tank of the Govt. of India)  2) A $5M grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to set up a "Payments and Governance Research Program" to continue this line of work by providing inputs to policy makers into the design of social sector reforms (such as replacing in-kind benefits with cash grants) and generate evidence on their impacts  3) A formal Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Food of the Govt. of India and the NITI Aayog to provide such support for reforming the delivery of food security through the PDS.
