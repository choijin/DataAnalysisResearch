<AbstractNarration>This project funds a workshop on mobile community measurement infrastructure to respond to the growing needs for increased visibility into network behavior to enable cutting-edge research in mobile computing.  The workshop will bring together the top researchers in both academia and industry, as well as policy makers from government, to discuss the requirements for such an infrastructure and identify the concrete steps to make progress towards the identified goals. Given the diverse research topics within mobile computing, we will ensure that different research areas and all the important network layers (e.g., physical, MAC, network, transport, and application) are adequately represented at the workshop to ensure a productive outcome from the discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flexible measurement infrastructure support for experimentation are critical for enabling and supporting research work with strong experimental components to help validate ideas and evaluate the design in practice.  Mobile computing research work must be evaluated in as realistic network settings as possible to help researchers understand how various factors such as signal strength, network load affect the performance and energy metrics of interest.  Currently, there is no environment that enables network visibility from an end-to-end perspective of the cellular network protocol stack: from the end-device all the way to the network server traversing through various network elements.  The lack of such an integrated measurement infrastructure greatly hinders the innovation in this important research field.  Because it is not trivial to design instrumentation to support diverse needs of researchers in mobile computing, the workshop helps define the goals and requirements of a mobile measurement infrastructure that is designed to last at least 10 years to support cutting-edge research in this space.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has successfully supported the first NSF workshop on Mobile Community Measurement Infrastructure discussions. The goal of this workshop was to identify the key requirements for designing and developing a mobile community measurement infrastructure to support cutting-edge research in mobile computing, going beyond the current research interests to support experimentation in next-generation mobile networks such as 5G.  Today’s mobile systems are deployed with ad-hoc measurements providing limited visibility into network behavior; however, we need integrated, cross-layer scalable, and flexible measurement infrastructure to enable transformative and bold research endeavours. In particular, most commercially deployed mobile network infrastructure are completely closed to researchers, making it difficult to experiment with or understand the impact of today’s systems or future technologies.  Some of this work has lead to NSF sponsorship of the latest wireless networking testbeds such as POWDER/RENEW.     During the workshop, the following challenges for designing the mobile community measurement infrastructure have been addressed and discussed.   Identifying key network functionality to monitor and instrument. Support for measurement from all layers of the stack, from spectrum to base stations, protocol behavior to application behavior. Ability to support programmable measurements in the mobile network infrastructure, e.g., eNodeB. Integration of measurement systems and research infrastructure to facilitate experiment deployment and analysis. Ability to evolve measurements to new protocols, explore cross-layer interactions. Sustainability across multiple generations of network protocols and technologies. Ability to support data as a part of the infrastructure. Interoperability with existing testbeds by augmenting their functionality. Support to instrument software-defined networks (SDN), virtualized network functions, and cloud offloading.
