<AbstractNarration>Oceanographers and paleoclimatologists use various proxies to study the past history of ocean temperature and salinity.  Many of these are recorded in the marine sediments, but sedimentation rates are so small that the time series that can be estimated from them only resolve changes that occur on decadal time scales or longer.  When clams and other bivalves grow, they incorporate, in their shells, geochemical signatures from the water in which they live.  They also lay down growth rings, like tree rings, in their shells.  By studying the chemistry of adjacent rings in long-lived clam shells the principal investigators (PIs) of this project expect to be able to reconstruct the annual temperature and salinity variations of near surface waters in a region offshore of northern Norway.  They will focus their efforts on the Medieval Warm Period (1000 AD to 1200 AD), the Little Ice Age (1200 AD to 1850 AD), and the modern era (1850 AD until the present).  The resultant histories of temperature and salinity variation will be useful for understanding how the ocean conditions changed during these known periods of climate variation and for validating or constraining climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs? immediate goal is to reconstruct annual hydrographic variability during key climate intervals within the last millennium along the strategically located Arctic islands of Ingoy and Rolvsoy. They will hindcast changes in annual sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS). They will also establish the baseline variability in the marine radiocarbon reservoir effect. The modern near-surface oceanography along the islands is influenced by the physical properties of the Norwegian Coastal Current, while the relatively deep hydrographic conditions predominately depend on Atlantic inflow. Pilot data from the study site demonstrate a strong link between shell-based records and regional SST/SSS conditions. Hence, Ingoy and Rolvsoy seem situated in an ideal location to study marine climate change during the late Holocene. Hypotheses and objectives have been developed to test the relative influence of dominant climate modes on the regional oceanography near northern Norway during the last millennium.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: Develop near-surface annual shell-based records (master shell chronology and isotopes) to reconstruct regional hydrographic variability (SST and SSS) along the northernmost coast of Norway during intervals of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Little Ice Age, and for Modern Climate.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2: Develop relatively deep-water (200 m) annual shell-based records (master shell chronology and isotopes) for the last 100 years to characterize the role of the North Atlantic Current on hydrography at the site.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3: Establish a decadal record of the surface marine radiocarbon reservoir effect since AD 1600 to estimate changes in source water contributions at Ingoy.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 4: Estimate the relative influence of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation, the surface Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation on regional hydrography (at Ingoy) and shell-based records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international partnership for studying Arctic marine climate change will be developed with colleagues from the Akvaplan-niva (Norway), Iowa State University (ISU) and Bates College (Maine). Outreach, public engagement, and dissemination of the results will be accomplished through engagement of two K-12 teachers in the field work, through classroom interactions with K-12 students, through a K-12 teacher workshop, through citizen-based science (via interactions with native Norwegians at Ingoy), and via a photo-journalist who will join the PIs for one field season. At least one female PhD student and approximately five undergraduate students will be supported by and involved with the project. The PIs will use data and ideas developed in this project for several courses at ISU and Bates College relating to climate change, paleoclimate and oceanography. PI Wanamaker will facilitate a public lecture series on climate change at the Ames Public library and continue to act as co-chair of Edwards Elementary Science Night, which has impacted &gt; 1,000 students and community members since 2012.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our&nbsp;<strong>major goals&nbsp;</strong>were to reconstruct year to year marine hydrographic variability during intervals within the last millennium along the Arctic islands of Ingoy and Rolvsoy&nbsp;(northern Norway). This location is sensitive to large-scale ocean circulation dynamics and is influenced by changes in the North Atlantic Current and the Norwegian Coastal Current. The strength and position of the North Atlantic Current is related to the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which greatly influences global climate. In order to do this research, we used the marine bivalve Arctica islandica which grows in annual layers, much like tree rings. Because these clams produce annual layers in their shells, the variability from year to year growth can be used as a ?bar code? to match growth patterns between individuals. Similar to dendrochronology (tree ring research), modern specimens with known dates of collection can be matched with dead collected shell material from the same location in order to extend the shell growth series back in time. Using the method of crossdating, robust growth series can be generated when a population of clams respond to the same environmental forcings. Once a growth series is established, we sample the individual growth layers when the exact calendar year is known. The calcium carbonate powder from these shells is then analyzed for its isotopic composition. In particular, oxygen isotopes from the shell material reflect seawater temperature and is related to changes in salinity. Stable carbon isotopes in these shells can reflect productivity dynamics and can be used to track different water masses through time. Additionally, we used the radiocarbon signature from the shells to estimate the date of death. Once these shells were crossdated into our growth chronology, we could use the radiocarbon signature as a water mass tracer. In other words, at this location, we could determine if the seawater was entirely from the North Atlantic waters or if Arctic waters were present.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Summary of findings: </strong>We produced a 563 year long master shell growth chronology spanning from CE 1450 to 2013. This is the second longest crossdated shell growth chronology from the global ocean. Shell growth at this location was highly synchronous indicating that some environmental factor was driving shell growth. At this location, it was determined that food quality and seawater temperature were the main factors controlling shell growth. Based on the growth data, year to year variability was highly variable. Additionally, multidecadal variability was prevalent throughout the record that may be related to changes in large scale ocean circulation dynamics. From the master shell growth chronology, we sampled the annual growth layers for radiocarbon, oxygen isotopes and stable carbon isotopes. Oxygen isotope values indicate that the waters at this location have warmed and/or become less salty. This trend is especially obvious after CE 1950. The coldest interval in the last millennium likely occurred between CE 1780 to 1860 during the late Little Ice Age. The transition from the Little Ice Age around CE 1850 into modern climate is prominent in our records. Decadally-resolved radiocarbon values from the master shell growth chronology reveals a fairly stable mixture of water masses at this location. However, there have been times when the water mass mixture at this site was fairly different than modern condition. At times, evidence for fresher conditions existed in the record around CE 1640. This might mean that the Norwegian Coastal Current was more prominent at this time or that there was more fresh water in the upper ocean. Conversely, around CE 1750 to 1780, there was evidence of waters originating from the Arctic. It is unclear if these waters were recirculating from the Arctic and entrained in the North Atlantic Current. Regardless, despite having a fairly consistent mixture of North Atlantic Water at this location, occasionally waters from the Arctic or freshwater associated with the Norwegian Costal Current become more important. Stable carbon isotopes were generally stable throughout the record, however, from CE 1750 to 1800 they indicate a large change in productivity dynamics and/or a different water mass at this location. This shift is coincident with noted changes in the radiocarbon values in the shells. Together, this is strong evidence for a different proportion of Atlantic and Arctic waters in northern Norway. Modern marine conditions (last 50 years) from far northern Norway are becoming warmer and less saline compared to the previous 500 hundred years. We routinely shared the results of this research with the general public both in Norway and in the United States. PI Wanamaker co-developed a three-part series on climate change at Ames Public Library in Iowa. This event was well-received and more than 150 people attended. Many of the other outreach events involved directly working with K-12 students. Additionally, four peer-reviewed articles have been published thus far and at least two others are in the final stages of preparation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Alan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Wanamaker Jr.</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417766/1417766_10329544_1572720454946_Chronology--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417766/1417766_10329544_1572720454946_Chronology--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Master Shell Growth Chronology"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417766/1417766_10329544_1572720454946_Chronology--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Master Shell Growth Chronology"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Top Panel: Master shell growth chronology.
