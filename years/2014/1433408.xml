<AbstractNarration>The future of global rainfall patterns under 21st century climate change scenarios is highly uncertain, due in part to major uncertainties in how tropical Indo-Pacific climate modes (e.g., the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation) respond to greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. Climate models project significant changes in the global hydrological cycle in response to GHG forcing, yet the short instrumental record of precipitation precludes a robust assessment of potential anthropogenic trends. Paleoclimate proxy data and model simulations can be useful in this endeavor by helping to illuminate the Indo-Pacific response to GHGs and other climate forcings in the recent geologic past. During the past 500 years, a combination of changes in solar irradiance, volcanism, and atmospheric GHGs drove global climate out of the "Little Ice Age" (LIA; 1450-1750 C.E.) and into the modern era of warming. Hydroclimate proxy records, many based on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation, surface waters, and seawater, document enormous Indo-Pacific hydrological changes from the LIA to present. While the causes of these anomalies are poorly understood, new developments in both "isotope-equipped" climate modeling and paleoclimate data synthesis provide new, promising tools for understanding these changes by directly comparing paleoclimate data with model output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the postdoctoral research fellow will investigate the response of the Indo-Pacific hydrological cycle to climate forcings during the past 500 years using an integrated paleoclimate modeling and data synthesis framework. Existing "single-forcing" simulations of Last Millennium (850-2000 C.E.) climate with the fully-coupled Community Earth System Model will be used to force new simulations with an isotope-equipped atmospheric model, enabling a characterization of volcanic, solar, and GHG-induced changes in the Indo-Pacific hydrological cycle and associated water isotopic signatures since 1500 C.E. Simultaneously, a synthesis of hydrologic and water isotopic proxy data from the past 500 years will be performed to isolate robust hydrologic and isotopic patterns in the Indo-Pacific since the LIA. Emerging "best-practice" techniques for paleoclimate data synthesis and model comparison will be used to characterize the response of the Indo-Pacific hydrological cycle to individual and combined climate forcings. Results will advance our understanding of how natural and anthropogenic climate change impact the tropical hydrological cycle -- a key source of uncertainty in future projections</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The cycling of water through the tropical atmosphere, land, ocean, and biosphere has far-reaching impacts on global climate patterns. Recent work has suggested that climate forcings such as greenhouse gas concentrations or variations in the Earth's orbit might impact the tropical water cycle in different ways, but these impacts can be difficult to disentangle when they occur at the same time. Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in environmental waters such as rainwater and seawater (also called "water isotopes") have long shown promise as water cycle tracers and are preserved in a number of paleoclimate proxy archives such as lake sediments, corals, ice cores, and tree rings. Under this postdoctoral fellowship, I utilized a combination of water isotopic paleoclimate data and climate model experiments to assess whether changes in the tropical water cycle in the recent geologic past carried distinctive fingerprints of individual climate forcings. A total of ten individual- and combined-forcing experiments were carried out with isotope-enabled components of the Community Earth System Model. A subset of these experiments incorporated water tagging, a valuable but computationally intensive technique that quantitatively tracks how moisture from different source regions contributes to precipitation around the planet. In addition, paleoclimate records based on water isotope archives from the past 2,000 years were collated into a new global database with customized metadata designed to facilitate comparison between proxy data and climate model experiments. The results of the climate model experiments and data synthesis were interpreted with the aid of a new framework, developed under this award, that helps to disentangle the various influences on precipitation isotopes at different sites in the tropics. These datasets are already shedding new light on how climate forcings impact the tropical water cycle, and helping to contextualize changes that are occurring today as well as those that have occurred in the geologic past. For example, some forcings can have strong impacts on circulation patterns, which are detected by isotopes in precipitation even when changes in precipitation amount are minimal or subtle. A synthesis of water isotopic paleoclimate data suggests numerous shifts in circulation during the past 2,000 years and especially during the past several centuries, adding a "hydro" component to the community's growing understanding of recent climate change. This fellowship supported the advancement of the career of a female geoscientist, now a professor, by facilitating research collaboration and mentoring across international paleoclimate data, modeling, and observational communities, and supported the advancement of women and minorities in STEM through mentoring of undergraduates from underrepresented groups in the Front Range of Colorado.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/05/2018<br>      Modified by: Bronwen&nbsp;Konecky</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
