<AbstractNarration>Core-collapse supernova explosions from massive stars and collisions of neutron star mergers are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe. In these explosions and collisions, the key chemical elements of live (oxygen, carbon, iron etc.) and all heavy elements, including the rare earths metals, are synthesized and expelled into the interstellar medium. The goal of this PRAC project is to simulate core-collapse supernovae and the remnants of neutron star collisions at unprecedented physical detail. The investigators will use high-resolution three-dimensional simulations that include general relativity, fluid dynamics, radiation transport of neutrinos, magnetic fields, and a sophisticated description of the properties of the ultra-high density matter present in the cores of supernovae and neutron star collision remnants. The simulations will yield a deeper understanding of the processes occurring as a star turns from collapse to explosion and will elucidate the role of magnetic fields in both core-collapse supernovae and in the evolution of collision remnants. This will, in turn, yield better predictions for signals (in gravitational waves, neutrinos, and electromagnetic waves, and synthesized elements) from these phenomena. Astronomical observations can then be used to test theoretical models and constrain present uncertainties in nuclear physics and astrophysics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><pre>In this project petascale simulations on Blue Waters was used to better understand important physical processes in core-collapse supernovae and, when applicable, the resulting hyper-massive neutron star.  Some of the main intellectual merit outcomes of the project are:  1) We have investigated the effect of the nuclear equation of state on the gravitational wave signal produced by a core-collapse supernova. We found that the signal produced by the bounce is largely independent of the equation of state but that the post bounce oscillations (and hence the gravitational wave frequencies) have a stronger dependence on the equation of state.  2) In a core-collapse simulation, neutrino transport is a very important factor in the energetics and determines whether the star explodes or not. We have therefore carefully compared two different approximate neutrino transport schemes in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of either scheme in different regimes of the simulations. We find remarkable overall agreement but were also able to pinpoint important differences.  3) In continuation of 1), we have investigated more specifically how the inclusion of a hyperon phase transition, which softens the equation of state, can affect the post bounce gravitational waveform. We find that the effect on the gravitational wave frequency is minimal and that instead the the equation of state softening is encoded in the gravitational luminosity and phase evolution. Hence this could potentially be detectable with second or third generation gravitational wave detectors.  4) We are developing a new relativistic astrophysics code, SpECTRE, that combines the discontinuous Galerkin method with task based parallelization (provided by Charm++). The use of task based parallelization allows for better scaling than conventional domain decomposition MPI methods in order to take full advantage of current petascale and future exascale computers. After a first proof of concept implementation showed remarkable good scaling on Blue Waters, a complete redesign and rewrite of the code (for better extensibility and ease of use) are well underway.  Some of the main broader impacts of the project are:  1) The training of a couple of handfuls of young scientists (graduate students and post doctoral scholars) in computational science methodologies. As numerical simulations become a more and more important part of scientific exploration, it is very important for young scientists to develop computational expertise. All of the young scientists also got direct hands-on experience with carrying out petascale simulations on Blue Waters and other large high performance computers.  2) Results have been disseminated to the larger scientific community through invited and contributed talks at conferences and seminars at many university departments and through publication of articles in peer reviewed journals. Dissemination of results to the public at large have been done in a YouTube video channel, https://www.youtube.com/SXSCollaboration.  3) The project is at the interface of multiple sub-disciplines in astrophysics, physics and computational science. Our computational science, radiation transport, and fluid dynamics research crosses discipline boundaries. The development of new computational methodologies (parts of it contributed to the open source Einstein Toolkit, parts of it developed in SpECTRE) will benefit researchers in other fields.  4) The project aims at answering important questions about the workings of core-collapse supernova that is of great interest to the general public. Since ancient times people have had a great interest in the heavens and, in particular, stellar explosions.</pre><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/08/2019<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;Diener</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
