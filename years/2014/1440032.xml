<AbstractNarration>Core-collapse supernovae dramatically announce the death of massive stars&lt;br/&gt;and the birth of neutron stars, pulsars, and black holes. They are the&lt;br/&gt;sites where most of the heavy elements of Nature are created.  Viewed as a&lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics laboratory, core-collapse supernovae produce some of the&lt;br/&gt;highest densities and energies in the Universe, and during this violent&lt;br/&gt;process a combination of nuclear physics, turbulent hydrodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;radiation transport, and neutrino physics determines whether and how the&lt;br/&gt;star explodes. However, to date the puzzle of the precise mechanism of&lt;br/&gt;explosion has not been cracked.  A thesis of this team is that a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental impediment to progress over the last few decades may have been&lt;br/&gt;the lack of access to codes, computers, and resources with which to&lt;br/&gt;properly simulate the collapse phenomenon. This could explain the&lt;br/&gt;agonizingly slow march since the 1960's towards demonstrating a robust&lt;br/&gt;mechanism of explosion. However, with the state-of-the-art computer code&lt;br/&gt;this team has recently developed, the time may now be ripe to make a final&lt;br/&gt;assault on this central problem in astrophysics. Going to fully&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics and employing the best&lt;br/&gt;neutrino and nuclear physics may together be the keys to demonstrating and&lt;br/&gt;understanding the generic core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;Since these supernova simulations lend themselves easily to public and&lt;br/&gt;school outreach, the team plans to generate video products for public&lt;br/&gt;talks and web-based distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core-collapse supernovae probe the nuclear and particle physics of matter&lt;br/&gt;at super-nuclear density, high temperature, and at extremes of isospin.&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the experimental nuclear physics program of the NSF&lt;br/&gt;by exploring nucleosynthesis in astrophysical explosions, the properties&lt;br/&gt;of the neutrino, and the equation of state of nuclear matter. The &lt;br/&gt;numerical simulations connect directly with the lower-energy programs of&lt;br/&gt;FRIB and FAIR, the high-energy experiments carried out at RHIC and the&lt;br/&gt;LHC, and the hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon programs of JPARC, GSI,&lt;br/&gt;JLAB, and NICA. In addition, a solution to the core-collapse supernova&lt;br/&gt;problem will benefit ongoing efforts of observers and instrument&lt;br/&gt;designers in the U.S. and around the world engaged in projects to&lt;br/&gt;determine the origin of the elements, measure gravitational waves (LIGO),&lt;br/&gt;and interpret laboratory nuclear reaction rate measurements in light of&lt;br/&gt;stellar nucleosynthesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Core-collapse supernovae are the most common type and occur when the iron core of a massive star collapses to a neutron star.  Releasing its gravitational energy as neutrinos, the protoneutron star, for a few seconds, outshines the rest of the observable universe. Capturing a small fraction of this energy is thought to power the explosion, though detailed calculations proving this paradigm are still lacking. Furthermore, core-collapse supernovae are responsible for creating most of the elements in Nature and the neutrino signal they emit carries information about dense nuclear matter. In this project, we are conducting three-dimensional numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the goal of determining the mechanism of explosion, using the newly-developed and tested code Fornax.  A solution to the core-collapse supernova problem would benefit ongoing efforts of observers and instrument designers in the U.S. and around the world engaged in projects to determine the origin of the elements, measure gravitational waves, and interpret laboratory nuclear reaction rate measurements in light of stellar nucleosynthesis.  The new code we are employing for this project, Fornax, is a new departure from those employed in the past.  Importantly, it is 5t least times faster than the previous generation of code, enabling a series of multi-dimensional simulations with a given supercomputer resource allocation, rather than one heroic, though resource-intensive, calculation.  This allows a research group to explore multiple possibilities, to better narrow down the character of the explosions and their physical agency.
