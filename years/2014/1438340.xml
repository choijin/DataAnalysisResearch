<AbstractNarration>PI: Ioana Pavel Sizemore/Adam de la Zerda&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1438340/1434465&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Wright State University/Stanford University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative proposal: Developing a battery of methods for the study of the trafficking mechanisms and transformations of silver and gold nanomaterials in human cells &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extensive use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in consumer products and industry and the use of many kinds of NPs in healthcare as diagnostic and therapeutic tools require an understanding of their potential toxicities. However, as observed by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, there are only a limited number of techniques that could expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which nanomaterials influence cell behavior. The main scientific goal of this project is to fill these knowledge gaps by developing a battery of tools for the study of the trafficking mechanisms and transformations of environmentally representative AgNPs and biomedically relevant gold nanorods (AuNRs) in human cells. Key parameters, which will be considered in order to test the efficiency and practicality of the proposed methods, will include nanomaterial shape, surface charge, dose, and exposure time. The methods that are to be developed will be captured and shared through Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). In addition, the knowledge gained from the proposed research will be used in setting up new course modules and will be disseminated into the broader community, e.g., through interactions with a local museum and development of two hour hands-on laboratory modules for over 100 K-6 through K-9 students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A battery of interdisciplinary methods (ICP-OES/TFF, Raman-SERS/MatLab codes, and electron microscopy /bioassays) will be used for the study of the trafficking mechanisms and transformations of environmentally representative silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and biomedically relevant gold nanoparticles (AuNRs) in human cells. Key parameters that will be considered to test the efficiency and practicality of the proposed methods will include nanomaterial shape, surface charge, dose, and exposure time. To accomplish their goals, The PIs propose two specific aims. In Aim1, the PIs will characterize the physico-chemical properties of NPs, according to the U.S. EPA standards, before cellular exposure and then at various benchmark times during cellular trafficking. In Aim 2, using their suite of tools, the investigators will study the trafficking mechanisms of AgNPs and AuNRs in human cells as a function of nanomaterial shape, surface charge, dose, and exposure time.</AbstractNarration>

These measurement tools will serve regulatory agencies and researchers by identifying the risk assessment and control associated with the heavy use of noble nanomaterials in consumer products and biomedical applications.  Intellectual Merit:       The newly developed analytical- and imaging-based methodologies were successfully tested in the identification of key pharmacokinetic parameters: the cellular Absorption (A), Distribuion (D), Metabolism (M), and Elimination (E) of spherical AgNPs (positively and negatively charged) and AuNRs (aspect ratios of 2-5). Several of these ADME methodologies were then translated from in vitro (animal and human kidney cells, human red blood cells (RBCs), cord and adult blood) to in vivo models (Sprague Dawley rats).  (A) Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS)-based methods were implemented in conjunction with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-endorsed quality control methods for the low ppb quantification of the total amount of Ag or Au within whole cells or organelles. In kidney cells, both AgNPs+ and AgNPs- of 10 nm in diameter interacted with cells, but AgNPs+ exhibited a stronger (~25-fold) cellular affinity than AgNPs- at any exposure time or concentration. The absorption of AgNPs+ and AgNPs - followed zeroth- and first-order rate law, respectively, for the 300 &mu;g mL-1 exposure in the 4-24 h time period.

The in vivo and in vitro toxicity of AgNPs has been largely related to the Ag+ released from AgNPs, and oxidative stress associated with both AgNPs and Ag+.
