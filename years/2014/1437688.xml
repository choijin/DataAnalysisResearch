<AbstractNarration>1437965 (Zimmerman), 1437595 (Beckman), and 1437688 (Soh). Biomass has potential to meet many of society's energy and chemical needs, replacing the need for fossil fuels, while minimizing environmental impact. In this project, a biorefinery approach will be explored to achieve viable and sustainable utilization of biomass for fuels and valuable co-products. Analogous to petroleum refining for a wide spectrum of products, biorefining maximizes utilization of all fractions, reducing economic and environmental barriers. In addition to fuel, some of the components also represent a palette of higher-value, non-fuel products such as nutritional supplements and feedstocks for bioplastics. There are orders of magnitude differences in the value of products that can be produced depending chemical structure and intended end-use (i.e., fuel, fine chemicals, nutraceuticals). Advances in selective, efficient, and sustainable technologies for the extraction and conversion of lipids from crude biomass are essential to enhance a transition to a biobased economy. This project will develop separation and processing techniques that are robust, selective, and tolerant of varying biomass compositions, to gain economic and environmental benefits through a biorefinery approach.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The overall aim of this work is to fundamentally understand the system variables for extraction, fractionation and transformation of minimally processed biomass to produce fuel and other value-added co-products using a carbon dioxide and methanol mixture for efficient processing and separation. The work will model the fundamental system properties based on experiments with representative compounds and in turn the model will be used to control processing of real world wet biomass samples. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Ascertain and model the phase behavior of systems consisting of methanol, CO2, trans-esterification reaction substrates (reagents, intermediates, and products/byproducts), with or without water, to better understand the necessary operating conditions for conversion and fractionation of fatty acid methyl esters; 2) Evaluate and optimize heterogeneously catalyzed trans-esterification in CO2-methanol for selective conversion of model lipids and recovery of specific methyl ester fractions; 3) Apply experimentally determined parameters and model outcomes to optimize conversion and fractionation of real world biomass feedstocks including pre-extracted oils, waste feedstocks, and wet algal biomass; 4) Perform process design, life cycle assessment, and techno-economic analyses for informing system design to integrate this technology into a biorefinery setting. As such the efforts of this collaborative research will provide information on system fundamentals as well as the broader economic and environmental impacts of the system if implemented effectively. The project intrinsically provides student-learning opportunities in terms of high level research as well as educational resources regarding sustainability. The design approach modeled in this project provides an example of life cycle thinking mitigating the potential for unintended consequences. Graduate student researchers will have the opportunity to translate experimental results into educational materials, to be delivered on campus, in the community, and also globally via online curricula. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited through campus programs that support students from groups that are historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The project will be used in undergraduate process design courses, integrating sustainability and green design into the core chemical engineering curriculum. Further, a short-course will be developed between the collaborators in the topic of green engineering and sustainable design, using this project as an example platform with developed materials made publically accessible. In terms of K-12, the project will be used to expand on established relationships serving underrepresented populations. Efforts will range from "greener" school competitions for Grades 6-8, to a focused experience for early high school students associated with a 3-week program in residence on campus. A new course, "Energy and Sustainability" will be designed and implemented to reinforce scientific principles that students will have learned in their 9th grade physical science class and to prepare these students for their 10th grade biology and 11th grade chemistry classes while introducing concepts of green design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The use of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as a solvent in an integrated biorefinery is advantageous because it is environmentally benign, non-toxic, recoverable, scalable to an industrial scale, and can be used to extract food grade products.  Ongoing research in the food industry seeks to extract nutraceutical compounds not only through a sustainable process, but with solvents and techniques safe for human consumption.  CO2 can be used for a enhanced extraction and reaction mediation.  Controlling the extraction processes to enrich for compounds most suitable for biodiesel and/or other value-added compounds would negate further downstream processing and additional unit processes.  Furthermore the use of CO2 in reactions can lead to high yields, selective reaction, and improved reaction kinetics.  As a whole, the research has taken both experimentally and theoretically approaches towards applying carbon dioxide as a solvent in an integrated biorefinery setting.    The use of carbon dioxide was shown to improve reaction kinetics of triglyceride (TG) conversion using a reaction catalyzed by a solid acid catalyst (Nafion).  This CO2 mediated reaction was performed with a variety of different model feedstocks.  Variables of triglyceride and free fatty acid chain length were tested to compare the effective yield of each component in mixed systems.  The presence of common oil feedstock contaminants, water and free fatty acids, were also evaluated to test their affect on system performance.  These contaminants did not impair the reaction, and  the presence of water actually seemed to improve the reaction kinetics.  Furthermore, the system fundamentals were explored by using TG of varied chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation.  The differing structure/property relationships were showed that changing system parameters may have a differential effect of various TG and potential enable the formation of fuels with varied properties.   This research also provides understanding towards the use of scCO2 in a biorefinery setting to simultaneously extract, fractionate, and enrich different classes of triglycerides (TG), including mono and poly unsaturated fatty acid glycerides, from microalgae. Evidence is presented that solubility for a given TG can be enhanced or diminished in the presence of other, dissimilar TGs due to solute-solute interactions and scCO2 densities. These modified solubility parameters, alongside the tunable density of scCO2, provide a control handle to enrich extraction mixtures minimizing downstream separation and purification processes. Using a form of the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) modified to include a polar term and group contribution parameters, it has been shown that the phase behavior of the reacting biodiersel system can be modeled from the initial stage of the reaction (TAG, methanol, CO2) to the final stages where fatty acid esters, residual methanol, CO2, and glycerol are found. The number of phases and their compositions can be predicted without additional parameters, providing insight as to how phase bevahior imopacts the course of the reaction.  Energy impacts for downstream purification provided insight to the potential trade-offs of over and under enriching certain TAGs during the biomass extraction process.  Both the experimental and modeling results demonstrate the potential of scCO2 to be used as a green technology whereby the associated energy and economic costs of downstream processing, such as distillation, can be reduced providing a significant step towards a viable biorefinery and ultimately a biobased economy.  Additionally, the work presented here demonstrates how scCO2 can be tuned to enrich the extract from the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis for lipids and the carotenoid astaxanthin, a high value anti-oxidant nutraceutical compound.  By bridging the fundamental behavior of TG and astaxanthin solutes, via Kamlet-Taft solvatochromic behavior, with the extraction behavior of the solutes from microalgae, scalable operational controls for the valorization of both types of compounds was shown.  Specifically, using a single vessel, continuous extraction enrichment of TAG?s followed by the extract enrichment of astaxanthin.  Pressure, temperature, and solvent flow rate were tuned to target TG then pressure adjusted to target astaxanthin from a single batch of microalgae.  By utilizing dynamic conditions for a single, continuous extraction, fractionation of the two compounds types was achieved on a bench scale apparatus.  Such value-added compounds and eventual commodity chemicals from a sustainable feedstock offers a potentially viable alternative to fossil feedstocks for a wide variety of applications in addition to biodiesel.   In addition to research outcomes, the work has supported the training and educational outcomes.  Research opportunities and training has been made available to 3 doctoral students, 2 postdoctoral researchers, and 8 undergraduate students.  Furthermore, the PIs have collectively started a new short course as well as each introduced new modules and materials into existing classes.  The work has been highlighted at workshops and conferences and has led to the publication of at least 8 peer-reviewed journal articles and 1 patent.
