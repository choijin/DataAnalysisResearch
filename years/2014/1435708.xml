<AbstractNarration>In this project, an investigator participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will establish the concentrations, chemical speciation, and cycling processes of arsenic and selenium in the Arctic Ocean. In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. The metalloid elements arsenic and selenium to be studied in this project are toxic to many marine plants and animals, and their cycling in the Arctic is not well known. Thus, this project will have important implications for increased knowledge on the chemistry of these potentially toxic elements. Results from the project will be shared through outreach to Arctic residents and through a PolarTREC teacher who will participate in the cruise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The metalloid elements arsenic and selenium have dynamic marine cycles that affect the microbiology of the water column and in turn are affected by it. Both exist in multiple oxidation states and inorganic and organic species within an oxidation state. This chemical speciation affects their reactivity and biotic uptake and toxicity. As shown in lower latitude waters, the concentration and speciation of dissolved arsenic can control the abundance and types of primary producers. In the Arctic virtually nothing is known about arsenic cycling, although there are possibly enhanced anthropogenic inputs from Canadian rivers and atmospheric deposition. In contrast, data from the high latitude North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea strongly suggest that anthropogenic selenium from coal combustion is entering the Arctic and enriching its concentration in at least one top predator. The goal of this project is to qualitatively describe the input, removal, and internal cycling processes affecting the speciation and concentrations of arsenic and selenium, and determine rates of inputs and outputs of these processes using both direct measurements and computations. The study will greatly expand knowledge about arsenic and selenium cycling, with strong implications for the changing Arctic.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Lately, chemical oceanographers have been studying trace elements like iron that are beneficial to life and others that are the opposite. Arsenic is famously toxic to people, but it is also toxic to microscopic marine plants, the phytoplankton. This occurs because arsenic is almost chemically identical to the essential element phosphorus and when the concentration of dissolved phosphorus is the same as or lower than arsenic, it can affect the growth of marine phytoplankton. If these abundant phytoplankton are not growing, they cannot take up carbon dioxide, which then means more of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and the whole planet is adversely affected. To make this a bit more complicated, it turns out that the toxicity of arsenic to phytoplankton depends on its chemical form &ndash; arsenate or As+5 is just like the nutrient form of phosphorus, phosphate, and hence is toxic. However, arsenite or As+3 is not toxic at all, nor are organic forms of arsenic. Interestingly, we have found that some marine phytoplankton can change the chemical form of arsenate to detoxify it; they convert it to arsenite and methyl arsenic.</p> <p>If a trace metal like iron is always good and arsenic is always bad, are there elements that can switch, good at one level and toxic at another? Indeed, the trace element selenium is one of these &ndash; essential for many enzymes at one concentration and chemical form, but then toxic when it is too high or the wrong chemical form. Thus, plants in the ocean are affected by not only light and nutrients, but also trace elements like iron, arsenic, and selenium. Interestingly, coal has high arsenic and selenium levels, and studies in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans show that coal combustion enriches these elements in the oceans. But, what about the high latitude Arctic Ocean, what are arsenic and selenium doing in this rapidly changing ocean? It turns out that they have never been studied here, but there are two compelling reasons why we should: first, it is changing fast and in this century it could be more like the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans &ndash; are arsenic and selenium cycled differently in the present Arctic and will it change in a new Arctic? Secondly, there is evidence that fossil fuel combustion in Asia is enriching at least selenium in the Bering Sea, so could this increase the concentration of this element in the current and future Arctic? These and many other questions were addressed in the 2015 US GEOTRACES Expedition to the Arctic Ocean aboard the US Coast Guard Cutter Healy, our only research ice breaker capable of transiting all the way to the North Pole. We left Dutch Harbor, Alaska on 9 August 2015, made it to the North Pole on 6 September, and returned to Dutch Harbor on 11 October; the route is shown in Figure 1.</p> <p>Although we sampled the water column from top to bottom, surface water data illustrate how selenium and arsenic behave differently in the current Arctic (Figure 2). First, essential phosphate concentrations were pretty uniform across the more productive, ice-free shelves to the ice-covered deep basins. Not shown is nitrate, but it was at very low to non-detectable concentrations, implying that it was bio-limiting and allowed phosphate to remain elevated. These higher phosphate concentrations then minimize arsenate uptake and toxicity, although arsenate does vary along the transect. Nevertheless, the detoxification products like arsenite had unusually low concentrations except for monomethyl As (Fig. 2). &nbsp;Surface concentrations of arsenate were approximately 15% higher than other ocean basins, so if the future Arctic has higher phytoplankton growth and lowers phosphate, the toxicity of arsenic may increase as in other oceans. The concentration of total selenium only varied slightly along the 6000 km transect (Fig. 2), but unlike other oceans, its concentration was about 25% higher. Further, the most bioavailable form of selenium, selenite (SeIV), was elevated in surface waters, even on the more productive shelves. While we cannot rule out slow biological uptake to explain selenium&rsquo;s higher levels, data for selenium in atmospheric aerosols taken during the cruise show the highest concentrations in the western (return) leg of the expedition (Figure 3) and could deposit into the Arctic. To establish the source of atmospheric selenium, either dust or emissions from fossil fuel combustion, we normalized the Se data to aluminum that only comes from soils; this gives the enrichment factor (EF). If the selenium is soil-derived, the EF is one, but the addition of gaseous selenium from coal combustion raises it. The EF values in Fig. 3 are 5,000 and above, documenting a likely pollution source for selenium that deposits into the Arctic Ocean. If the Arctic has less sea ice in the near future, this selenium, and other elements, could be directly transferred into the water column.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/23/2019<br>      Modified by: Gregory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Cutter</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1435708/1435708_10323417_1556002371367_ArcticTransectMap--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1435708/1435708_10323417_1556002371367_ArcticTransectMap--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1435708/1435708_10323417_1556002371367_ArcticTransectMap--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2015 US GEOTRACES Arctic Cruise Track, 9 August ? 11 October 2017, USCGC Healy.
