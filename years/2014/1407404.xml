<AbstractNarration>This project, submitted in response to the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) announcement, is jointly funded by the Condensed Matter Physics and Ceramic Programs in the Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project has a number of objectives.  The first objective is to involve up to 40 undergraduate students in publishable research in glass science over the duration of the project. New oxide glasses are being prepared using novel techniques such as fast cooling, laser heating and new chemical pathways.  As well, they are examining the intermediate range order of glass on the level of a handful of atoms.  Finally they are producing glasses that have new technical applications.  For example, one family of glasses is being developed to detect neutrons for medical and national security purposes.  The project has broad impact by training undergraduate students in many aspects of glass research, ~75% will continue to graduate school; running workshops to inform colleagues how to conduct high level research at small colleges, and inviting high school students to join this work and working with pre-college students of all grades in eastern Iowa on science programs at Coe College and in local schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: It is likely that the most transformational part of this work concerns the determination of the intermediate range order of oxide glasses of up to ten atoms or so.  This outstanding scientific problem concerns such phenomena as ionic conduction, the mixed-alkali effect, and viscosity and relaxation effects.  The experimental means for this study include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with a focus on boron using both of its isotopes separately as well as isotopic dilutions and boron Double Angle Rotation NMR, neutron scattering, dual atomic force microscopy/Raman spectroscopy, and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Physical property determinations complement these measurements.  Simultaneous to this work is the development of novel glasses using rapid cooling, laser levitation, and alternative chemical means.  One application for this is the development of semiconducting lithium borovanadate glasses for neutron detection. Broader impacts include the thorough training of up to 40 undergraduate students in research, including their daily use of many state-of-the art instruments, the involvement of high school students and their teachers in research, outreach to younger students, and leadership service within the glass science field. A new and important component of this project is the mentoring and hosting of workshops for colleagues at other colleges interested in doing high-level research with their students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Several dozen Coe College students, high schoolers, middle schoolers and other college students have done research on glass over the past four years supported by this grant.  These students did the experimental and modelling work reported here, helped write papers, they gave presentations in large numbers in the United States and abroad, they trained their successors and they interacted closely with the three PIs for the grant.  They met weekly in subgroups dedicated to certain aspects of the research to review the scientific ideas.        Other broader impacts include significant outreach at local schools as well as at Coe College.  Last October we hosted 1500 students in our 15th annual Playground of Science.  Over 60 science demonstrations were performed in a single day by Coe students and faculty including glass making.  A special outreach event occurred in the fall of 2018 in which research students showed 200 Maquoketa (IA) High School students how to measure the charge on the electron using the Millikan oil drop method.  This high school's most notable alum was Robert Millikan, Iowa's only Nobel laureate in physics and 2018 was the sesquicentennial of Millikan's birth.  Coe College research students raised the money to give this school the actual oil drop apparatus.  Another highlight was working with Linn Mar (IA) middle schoolers on a project involving heavy metal oxide glasses that could be woven into space suits for a hypothetical trip to Mars.  A further broader impact was our hosting of a two-day workshop on how to do undergraduate research on glass.  Fifteen faculty joined us for the event. Yet other broader impacts include writing a chapter for the abot to be released Springer Handbook of Glass and service to the American Ceramic Society as an editor, service on multiple committees, and recent election to the Board of Directors of the Society.     Tellurium dioxide glass was produced in gram quantities to characterize property and structure. The techniques employed were Raman spectroscopy, 125Te and 17O NMR, and X-ray scattering performed at the Advanced Photon Source (as well as an earlier neutron scattering study).  The results have left us some answers and some structural questions.  An example is: is tellurium in this glass former four-coordinated or an admixture of three and four coordinated tellurium with an average coordination of Te of 3.7?    We have launched an international collaborative spectroscopic study of sodium silicate glasses from 20 to 70 molar percent soda.   This will be the most robust structural effort undertaken to date.  We are using NMR, including 13C and 29Si NMR, Raman spectroscopy, as well as x-ray and neutron scattering. The purpose of employing 13C NMR on glasses enriched in 13C, is to study the structural environment of the retained carbonate in these glasses.  This occurs above for soda contents above the metasilicate composition. Clear evidence for this retention occurs in the Raman spectroscopy and in the x-ray and neutron scatting experiments.     Considerable progress has occurred in making bactericidal glasses, this part of the project has now moved to the creation of composites including glass and plastic.  Embedding glass into epoxy creates a new material that is strong a, shapeable, and quite durable.  Possible uses could include countertops, kitchen utensils, animal feeding and housing fixtures.     Much computation and modelling work has taken place including molecular dynamics simulations, use of Mauro's topological constraint theory, modelling detectors made of glass for medical and high-energy physics uses, and refinements to our own spectrafit program that computes quadrupolar broadened 10B NMR powder patterns that include distributions of the quadrupole parameters.     Our laser levitator continues to create new glasses and has the ability to measure density, surface tension and viscosity as a function of temperature.  Recent work has explored silica glass with and without low dopant concentrations.  In another project we continue to develop crystals that show long fluorescent lifetimes.     Highly conducting vanadate glasses have been made and tested for conductivity as possible detector materials.  Over the past couple of summers we have investigated the electrical properties of glass ceramics.      Furthermore, medical detectors fabricated from glasses have been simulated in our new cluster computers (two clusters each about 120 cores).  This includes detectors based on neutron absorption in 10B and 6Li enriched glasses doped with terbium for scintillation.  Experimentally, we have made these glasses and measured their scintillating and radiation properties.       Last Modified: 03/13/2019       Submitted by: Steven A Feller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
