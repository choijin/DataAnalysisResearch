<AbstractNarration>Teacher retention is one of the biggest challenges facing the improvement of STEM education. Across all grade levels and disciplines, studies show that almost 50% of new teachers leave the profession in the first five years and secondary STEM teachers are not an exception.  The Phase II Noyce Scholarship Monitoring and Evaluation project at Saint Joseph's University (SJU) will explore the factors that influence secondary STEM teacher retention. High teacher turnover is a fact in many high-need schools and understanding how teachers make the decision to stay or leave may help develop solutions to this problem. This research will provide a better understanding of the process of identity development and its relationship to the decision to stay or leave a high-need STEM classroom. This in turn can be used to inform undergraduate teacher preparation programs and companion efforts to support teachers in their early years of teaching, thus ultimately having a positive impact on teacher retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research suggests that a strong identity as a STEM teacher in a high-need school will be correlated with a decision to continue and this grant would support a rigorous investigation of the process by which the Noyce Scholars construct, or fail to construct, these identities.  This project will begin with eight SJU Noyce Scholars already employed in public, charter and private schools in the city of Philadelphia. More scholars will start teaching at the beginning of this project and several more are still in their pre-service (undergraduate) program. The teaching commitments mandated by their Noyce Scholarships will begin to be satisfied during the next three years and SJU seeks a better understanding of the motivation of why they choose to continue or not to continue in their positions beyond this commitment. Research activities will include regular classroom visits and extensive one-on-one interviews with the SJU Noyce Scholars.  The Noyce Scholars will also keep journals, and common themes will be identified that are associated with whether teachers remain or leave. These findings will in turn inform SJU teacher preparation programs and early career professional support efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research investigated the relationship between social interaction, teacher identity and commitment to staying on as math and science teachers in high-need urban schools.  Working with twelve Noyce Scholars during their beginning years of teaching, this study monitored the development and strength of their emerging identities.  In terms of recruitment for scholarship programs such as the Noyce Scholarship Program, this study suggests that there is strong benefit to having teachers that are committed to social justice issues and high-need areas.  However, this study suggests that initial commitment to high-need schools should not necessarily be a precondition for a scholarship, as there can be variation between initial and emerging commitment due to the outcomes of solidarity-producing social interactions within schools.   Specifically, teachers who perceived support from colleagues and supervisors, had confidence in the school?s system for evaluating teachers, had some degree of autonomy in planning for instruction and were allowed to prioritize relationships over rules were able to develop new commitments to STEM teaching in high-need schools.     This study also suggests there are particular supports that may be beneficial in order to facilitate new experiences, identities, and commitments. Teacher candidates who have student-focused identities yet may not be initially committed to high-need areas could be provided with opportunities in high-need schools that could build chains of positive interactions prior to their first teaching position. Given that the generation of internal solidarity is aided by "ingredients," the role of non-evaluative mentoring at all stages is a crucial element.  Further, additional career counseling may be helpful in order to assist teachers in finding a better match for their teaching philosophies if their first position leads to intolerable identity conflict.    In terms of implications for school structures, the results show that school policies, systems of evaluation, and supports for teachers have a strong role in the degree of identity conflict experienced by new teachers, the quality of interactions, self-talk and subsequent retention.  The teachers whose commitment increased over time tended to be those who had more autonomy in their curriculum planning and classroom management strategies.  For some of the teachers, the prevalent use of policies in urban schools that require strict discipline and an emphasis on measurement posed obstacles for teachers who embrace the emotional practice of teaching and strive to maintain strong relationships. Further, any policy that reduces teacher autonomy in classroom management neglects the role of positionality, such as the intersection of gender and race, in facilitating particular types of relationships and teaching strategies.   This study also suggests a strong benefit from participation in professional communities, particularly those centered around particular instructional approaches.  For one of the teachers who stayed, a distance community focused on student-centered reform provided an outlet for his interest in student-centered practices even when he was not getting as much support in his own schools.   In addition, this study suggests that there may be a benefit in specifically addressing the impact of self-talk in both pre-service and in-service supports.  Given that some of the teachers had positive ingredients in the form of support of mentors and recognition from supervisors, yet still experienced frequent "mulling-over" self-talk that led to questioning teaching identities, perhaps they would benefit from professional development specifically focused on self-talk in response to struggle.  Developing these internal resources that can support their agency may be an additional source to foster retention.  The results also suggest a connection between positive self-talk and teachers? inclination towards reducing deficit thinking and increasing culturally responsive practices.  For several of the teachers, self-blame and negative views of students were tied together, whereas identity-affirming self-talk was coupled with increased understanding of students? perspectives and needs.    In pre-service preparation, teacher candidates might benefit from attending to self-talk and its impacts, and practicing the repetitive, planning-oriented statements that can affirm their teaching identities.   In addition, practice with self-talk strategies that reframe students? statements in ways that do not pose identity threats may be beneficial.  The possibilities for professional development that focuses on self-talk could be an area for future investigation.
