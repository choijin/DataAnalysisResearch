<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative grant is to support US students to disseminate their research results and interact with international researchers at the Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference in Montreal, Canada from May 31-June 3, 2014. Due to its geographical location outside the US, it has been difficult for US students to attend the conference. The approach to overcome this difficulty is to use this grant to partially support the travel costs for the student attendees, plus other contributions from the departments across the country and the Institute of Industrial Engineers, so as to increase students' participation. This grant will help promote student research activities and active involvements in international conferences. By attending this conference, students can present their recent research developments, attend tutorial sessions to learn advanced research methods, join panel discussions, participate in student paper/simulation competitions, and socialize with scholars and students from other universities. These activities will significantly help and motive students to explore research frontiers and consider joining academia as one of their career paths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this award will help US and international students to communicate and learn from each other the most frontier research progress. It provides an excellent opportunity for US students to network with potential employers and to explore collaborators for their future research. This grant will also support underrepresented students to attend this conference.</AbstractNarration>
