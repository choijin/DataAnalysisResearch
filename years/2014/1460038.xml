<AbstractNarration>This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) will provide mentored research opportunities for U.S. undergraduate students to investigate native maize resilience to hybrid and genetically modified corn varieties.  Students will participate in the Rocky Mountain Sustainability and Science Network (RMSSN) Summer Academy prior to their six week research experience in Mexico.   The IRES program will involve six U.S. undergraduate students per year in mentored research projects.  These projects will provide students opportunities to work with international research partners and develop best practices for addressing regional environmental sustainability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentored projects will focus on lysine methlytransferase expressed in maize.  Students will be exposed to cutting edge epigenetic tools, molecular genetics, and different maize production systems through these research projects.  They will also have access to the unique research facilities of the Autonomous University of the Yucatan in Mexico.</AbstractNarration>
