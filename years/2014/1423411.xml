<AbstractNarration>This project advances the boundaries of network theory by analyzing spreading processes over multilayer and interconnected networks, which abound in nature and man-made infrastructures, and about which many interesting questions remain unanswered. Multilayer networks are an abstract representation where multiple types of links exist among nodes. Interconnected networks are an abstract representation where two or more simple networks, possibly with different and separate dynamics, are coupled to each other. The rationale for this project is that viral-spreading dynamics over multilayer and interconnected networks exhibit behaviors that cannot be attributed to single-network characteristics and play a highly relevant role in practice. The first part of the project extends the concept of the epidemic threshold value, which determines the conditions for outbreak, to the threshold curve for interconnected and multilayer networks. This research further develops measures for quantification of coupling strength in interconnected networks and seeks optimal interconnection designs for them. The second part of the project aims at predicting competitive spreading over multilayer networks and possible emergent phenomena. This research analyzes transient dynamics and steady-state behavior of multiple-virus competitive spreading in multilayer networks, and investigates competition policy in a game-theoretic framework. This project will use rigorous mathematical tools from network science, spectral graph theory, nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes, control theory, game theory, and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will greatly advance the state of the art in network theory, with specific, relevant applications in communications and information technologies leading to more efficient and robust design of these complex networked systems. In a broader view, this research will contribute positively to society through a better understanding of how to prevent large-scale catastrophes, including cascading failures in power grids, financial contagions in market trading, infectious disease pandemics, and outbreaks of computer malware. Furthermore, the investigators will put forth significant effort to involve students from under-represented groups, and disseminate project outcomes in both general society and academia through publications, webinars, and public webpages.</AbstractNarration>

The generalized epidemic modeling framework (GEMF) develops a class of epidemic models as stochastic processes at the node/ individual level, where nodes interact through different layers -- multilayer networks. The implementation of this algorithm, GEMFsim, is publicly available in our webpage in popular scientific programming platforms such as MATLAB, R, Python, and C. GEMFsim facilitates simulating stochastic spreading models that fit in the GEMF framework. We have used GEMFsim to study the transmission of several infectious diseases such as Zika, Ebola, syphilis, and Japanese encephalitis.</p> <p>2) We studied the <strong>epidemic threshold</strong> of a model where each node has a default contact neighborhood set and switches to a different contact set once she becomes alert about infection among her default contacts. Since each agent can adopt either of two possible neighborhood sets, the overall contact network switches among an exponentially-large number of possible configurations. Notably, a multilayer network representation with two layers can fully model the underlying adaptive, state-dependent contact network. The epidemic threshold for the presented adaptive contact network belongs to the solution of a nonlinear Perron-Frobenius (NPF) problem, which does not depend on the contact adaptation rate monotonically. Furthermore, the network adaptation model predicted a counter-intuitive scenario where adaptively changing contacts may adversely lead to lower network robustness against epidemic spreading if the contact adaptation is not fast enough. This original result for a class of NPF problems facilitate the analytical developments of this work and can be useful to solve many other similar problems.</p> <p>3) We found the <strong>exact coupling threshold</strong> of interconnected networks uncovering network topologies with unexpected behaviors. An interconnected network features a structural transition between two regimes: one where the network components are structurally distinguishable and one where the interconnected network functions as a whole. As a consequence, an emergent phenomenon appears concerning the vulnerability of interdependent networks: below the coupling threshold, failures stay localized in the originating network layer, while beyond this threshold, failures will invade across layers and lead to whole-scale catastrophic failure. We were able to determine the exact value of this critical threshold. Furthermore, we showed conditions under which superdiffusion can occur despite the network components functioning distinctly. Moreover, we find that components of certain interconnected network topologies are indistinguishable despite very weak coupling between them.</p> <p>4) We solved the problem of finding an <strong>optimal weight distribution</strong> for one-to-one interlayer links of interconnected networks under a budget constraint. We showed that for the special multiplex configurations with identical layers, the uniform weight distribution is always optimal. On the other hand, when the two layers are arbitrary, increasing the budget reveals the existence of two different regimes. Up to a certain threshold budget, the second eigenvalue of the supra-Laplacian is simple, the optimal weight distribution is uniform, and the Fiedler vector is constant on each layer. Increasing the budget past the threshold, the optimal weight distribution can be nonuniform. The interesting consequence of this result is that there is no need to solve the optimization problem when the available budget is less than the threshold, which can be easily found analytically.</p> <p>5) We developed a framework to <strong>infer missing links </strong>among nodes of an epidemic network. In our approach, we use the state of nodes through time as the input. Moreover, since we are using a Bayesian inference method, we can incorporate different prior information about the links in the inference problem. This is particularly useful when the trace of nodes' state does not include enough information.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project's goal was to develop analytical tools and results for spreading processes over multilayer and interconnected networks.  Multilayer networks are an abstract representation of interconnection among nodes representing individuals, where the interconnection has multiple nature (see figure).  Interconnected networks are abstract representation where two or more simple networks, possibly with different and separate dynamics upon them, are interconnected to each other.     Studying multilayer and interconnected networks is an important topic in network science, with numerous potential applications to realistic social, biological, and technological networked systems.     Among the numerous results obtained during the project,  in the following, we summarize the most important ones:  1) We developed an algorithm --GEMFsim-- for exact, continuous-time numerical simulation of GEMF-based processes.
