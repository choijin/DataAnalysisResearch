<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Hannah Landecker, post-doctoral scholar Nadine Levine, will carry out a two year laboratory ethnography focusing on the impact of big data on the science of metabolism. This study of  metabolomics, the post-genomic study of the molecules and processes that make up metabolism, will serve as a case study for the role and impact of big data in biomedical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings of this project will contribute to science policy discussions on the key opportunities and challenges facing the increasingly prominent field of metabolomics, as well as other fields of data-intensive research. Moreover, the findings of this project will provide collaborative and educational resources, which will enable students, researchers, and members of the public to understand how,and with what consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of disease, new understandings of metabolism are being generated with big data.</AbstractNarration>

Invocations to the power and value of data are ubiquitous in contemporary biomedicine, as research is increasingly carried out with computerized tools and databases, and as knowledge about bodies and populations is generated through the management and interpretation of large data sets. We are at a moment in time where data seems central to understandings of and interventions into disease, through fields like genomics and epigenetics, and through paradigms like translational research and precision medicine. And yet, data?s practices, questions, and effects on society are far from settled.    This project examined how so-called "big data" intersects with biomedical research to give rise to new ways of understanding and intervening into metabolism.
