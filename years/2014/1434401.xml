<AbstractNarration>Chronic pain is a multidimensional problem that affects nearly 40 percent of the United States population and is estimated to incur $560-$635 billion in incremental healthcare costs and costs related to rehabilitation and lost productivity annually. With a growing number of treatment options and new medications, formulating an evidence-based, individually-tailored treatment plan has become increasingly complex. This research project develops new statistics-based optimization methods for adaptive interdisciplinary pain management that use patient data to recommend an interdisciplinary treatment regime for controlling pain outcomes. The research involves an interdisciplinary research team from the University of Texas (UT) at Arlington and uses data from the UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Because UT Southwestern uses a prevalent and standardized dataset, the research will be applicable to approximately 100 pain centers across the nation and will influence how interdisciplinary pain management is implemented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses four major topics in statistical optimization. One, the research studies how to coordinate the development of statistical meta-models and optimization algorithms. Specifically, several meta-models will be developed, which are accurate representations of the underlying system and can be globally optimized. The second major topic involves using a learning method to impute missing values in which the missing locations are in a block-wise structure. Three, the research develops an inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimators method for complex data. Finally, the research evaluates treatment solutions found from optimizing one prediction model with the other prediction models using simulation. Although this research is on pain management, the developed methodologies of this project can potentially be generalized to create complex adaptive treatment regimes for ailments other than pain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chronic pain is a multidimensional problem that affects nearly 40 percent of the United States population and is estimated to incur $560-$635 billion in incremental healthcare costs and costs related to rehabilitation and lost productivity annually. With a growing number of treatment options and new medications, formulating an evidence-based, individually-tailored treatment plan has become increasingly complex. In order to mitigate the growing dependence on opioids for treating chronic pain, state-of-the art treatment facilities practice interdisciplinary pain management that brings together medical experts for all the dimensions of pain, including psychological and quality of life impacts.  An interdisciplinary pain management program employs cognitive and physical therapy options along with nonaddictive pharmaceutical and procedural options.  The myriad of options and the variety of patient characteristics raises the need for tools that can efficiently explore the options and recommend treatment for an individual patient during the timeframe of a doctor?s appointment.     The methodology developed in this project created the optimization tool for adaptive interdisciplinary pain management shown in Figure 1. The tool uses patient data to recommend an interdisciplinary treatment regime for controlling chronic pain outcomes.  In order to study the range of treatment options, statistical patient outcome prediction models are built based on real patient data.  To enable a treatment recommendation within 7 minutes, the prediction models are specially constructed to work efficiently within the treatment optimization.  The research involved an interdisciplinary research team from the University of Texas (UT) at Arlington and used data from the Eugene McDermott Center for Pain Management at UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.  Patient pain management data are complex for several reasons.  First, there are missing and incorrect values due to human error in data entry.  Second, there are several metrics used to assess the different dimensions of pain, including the Pain Drawing Analogue, the Oswestry Pain Disability Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Short-Form 36 Physical Component Summary, and the Short-Form 36 Mental Health Component Summary.  Third, there are many characteristics monitored to describe a patient, including gender, race, past diagnoses, past treatments, etc.  Fourth, while there are many different treatment options to consider, historical pain management data tends to exhibit an unintentional pattern of treatment, called endogeneity, that primarily stems from the treatment preferences of the prescribing clinician.  Finally, although there are many quantitative and qualitative components to the data, as mentioned above, there are only a modest number of patients that complete an interdisciplinary pain management program.  These issues were addressed in the project for both the statistical modeling task and the optimization task.     To handle missing and incorrect values, a data mining algorithm that iteratively corrects and completes the data was developed to pre-process the data.  To address the many quantitative and qualitative variables monitoring pain status, patient characteristics, and treatment, the statistical prediction modeling approaches analyzed the relationships in the data to identify those variables that were critical for creating individualized treatment.  This depends on the ability to empirically identify causal relationships that specify how the different treatments affect a patient?s pain.  Unfortunately, endogeneity inhibits a statistical modeling method from properly modeling causal relationships.   Existing methods for endogeneity only address one treatment option.  Hence, a key contribution of the research was an approach to handle endogeneity when there are many treatment options.  After completing pre-processing step and addressing endogeneity, the prediction models can more effectively represent the relationships needed by the optimization.     For faster computation within the treatment optimization, the prediction models create functions composed of linear pieces.  This enables the use of efficient algorithms based on linear programming, which can be solved within 1 minute. Using treatments from the optimization is significantly more likely to achieve normal levels of the pain assessment metrics compared to the treatments in observed data.     Because UT Southwestern uses a prevalent and standardized dataset, the research will be applicable to approximately 100 pain centers across the nation and will influence how interdisciplinary pain management is implemented. Furthermore, the developed methodologies of this project can potentially be generalized to create complex adaptive treatment regimes for ailments other than pain.
