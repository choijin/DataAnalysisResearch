<AbstractNarration>Support for this proposal, "NUE: Teaching as a Learning Experience in Nanotechnology", at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), under the direction of Dr. Chitanya Ullal, will enable the institution to develop, pilot and implement a new course in which ~550 undergraduate engineering students per year at RPI will learn and use core concepts in cutting edge nanotechnology research being conducted by faculty at the Rensselaer Nanotechnology Center (RNC) to create, build and teach hands-on, household material based design challenges for K-12 students and their parents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPI undergraduate students will conduct family science courses for students from schools that primarily serve communities underrepresented in engineering. By learning, distilling and communicating concepts in nanotechnology research, undergraduates will not only derive multiple educational benefits, but will also serve to connect researchers with the broader population. Synergistic deliverables include integration of the most effective design challenges into the curriculum of a widely accessible online K-12 science education portal; introduction of new curated demos into a core engineering course at RPI; and documentation of the training,&lt;br/&gt;resources, curriculum development and best practices for replication of the course at other universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NUE project established the educational benefits experienced by undergraduate students upon the incorporation of K-12 outreach elements into an undergraduate level nanotechnology course. The traditional lecture and exam format was complemented by lab sessions in which undergraduate students researched a topic of their choice in nanotechnology, and subsequently designed, built and taught engineering design challenges suited for late elementary and middle school students in a family science setting. The undergraduate students first learned to explore new topics while performing a literature review on their nanotechnology topic. They then distilled core concepts and societal and technological implications of their topics as they designed their pre-college engineering design challenges. Finally, students learned to communicate these ideas as they formulated detailed lesson plans and taught school students and their families. Improved undergraduate student interest in research/teaching, and self-perceptions of teaching and leadership skills were observed. Overall satisfaction with the course was high, with practice assignments and classroom lectures being identified as most beneficial for topics outside their own chosen topics, and teaching their own lectures and literature reviews as most beneficial for their chosen topics. Nanotechnology Family science activities from the implementation of the course have been incoporated into an online informal science education portal, and results disseminated to communities of interest.
