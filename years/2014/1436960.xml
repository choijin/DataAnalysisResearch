<AbstractNarration>Massive populations, or swarms, of low-cost autonomous robots have the potential to collectively perform tasks over very large domains and time scales, succeeding even in the presence of failures, errors, and disturbances.  It is becoming feasible to create robotic swarms in practice due to ongoing advances in computing, sensing, actuation, power, control, and 3D printing technologies.  In recent years, the miniaturization of these technologies has led to many novel robot platforms for swarm applications, including micro aerial vehicles.  However, it remains a challenge to reliably control arbitrary numbers of such resource-constrained robots in unknown environments where global information and communication are limited or undependable.  This research project aims to overcome this challenge by developing a rigorous framework for the scalable control of robotic swarms in realistic environments.  The framework combines techniques from the fields of fluid dynamics, signal reconstruction, control theory, and optimization.  This work provides a theoretically grounded approach for automatically programming robotic swarms to perform a diverse set of tasks of wide benefit to society, including environmental monitoring and exploration, disaster recovery, security operations, and even biomedical imaging and targeted cancer therapies at the nanoscale.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project develops a formal methodology for analyzing and controlling the spatiotemporal dynamics of robotic swarms that are to be deployed in complex unknown environments. The designed robot control policies incorporate stochastic behaviors such as random encounters with environmental features and produce target collective behaviors within a specified degree of confidence. The confidence estimates are computed using a novel application of vortex methods, originally derived for fluid dynamic models and recently adapted to obtain continuum limits of discrete swarm models that incorporate pairwise interaction rules for maintenance of group structure. The control approach uses new computational algorithms for compressive sensing to reconstruct scalar environmental fields from sparse robot sensor data and to design efficient strategies for robot data collection.  The methodology is demonstrated with a case study on designing control policies for micro aerial vehicles that are tasked to pollinate a crop field.  Both computer models and testbed field experiments are used to validate theoretical predictions for the confidence estimates on system performance. Beyond robotics, the project provides analytical tools for a deeper understanding of the complex macroscopic behaviors of systems that can be represented with similar models, including non-well-mixed chemical reaction networks and natural swarms such as social insect colonies.</AbstractNarration>

Such tasks include environmental monitoring, exploration and mapping, automated pollination, disaster recovery, security operations, and even biomedical applications at the micro-nanoscale such as molecular imaging, targeted drug and gene delivery, therapeutics, and diagnostics. In recent years, many novel robot platforms such as micro aerial vehicles have been developed for swarm applications. However, it remains a challenge to reliably control large numbers of such resource-constrained robots in unknown environments where global information and communication are limited or unavailable.</p> <p>This research project aimed to overcome this challenge by developing a rigorous framework for the scalable control of robotic swarms in realistic environments. The framework is based on a novel integration and application of techniques from the fields of fluid dynamics, control theory, and optimization. This work provides a theoretically grounded approach for automatically programming swarms of robots to perform mapping and coverage operations and to allocate themselves autonomously among a set of tasks. We validated our framework with computer simulations and through experiments with small, low-cost robots. The specific intellectual contributions and broader impacts of the project are described below.</p> <p>We developed new analytical approaches to solve the inverse problem of robotic swarm control for distributed coverage tasks: defining a target metric of coverage activity and deriving robot controllers that provably achieve this objective. These approaches rely on the correspondence between continuum (ordinary or partial differential equation [ODE/PDE]) and discrete (individual-based) models of a robotic swarm. We estimated the error between these models for swarms whose spatiotemporal behavior is described by advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) PDEs and applied these estimates to select swarm parameters that guarantee spatial coverage within specified bounds. This rigorous analysis, previously absent from work on control of stochastic multi-agent systems, provides a formal validation of novel "top-down" control strategies that we developed, in which the PDE model is used in an optimization problem to compute <em>a priori </em>the robot controllers or design parameters that will yield a desired spatial distribution of activity. We also proved new results on the controllability of swarms described by ADR PDEs under realistic conditions of a closed environment and bounded controllers.</p> <p>In addition, we designed new mathematical and computational methods that use limited feedback to characterize the environment or estimate the swarm's progress, enabling redesign of the robot controllers to improve the collective performance. This feedback includes external observations of the swarm, if possible, and data collected by the robots that is processed offline or on the robots in real-time. We developed novel techniques for reconstructing scalar fields from data on a subset of the swarm distribution; mapping the geometry of the boundary or interior of a region of interest using only robots' encounter times with the region; and attaining a target swarm task allocation with stochastic task-switching that stops once the allocation is reached.</p> <p>Finally, we synthesized new control strategies that use implicit robot coordination and minimal global information to reshape a swarm and guide its movement. We designed communication-free schemes in which one or two "leader" robots with localization capabilities control the formation of a swarm of unlocalized robots with limited sensing or confine and herd the robots along a trajectory.</p> <p>This project provided funding for one Ph.D. student, who plans to graduate in Spring 2019.&nbsp; He will then begin a postdoctoral research position in applied mathematics at UCLA, supervised by co-PI Andrea Bertozzi, where he will expand on the research conducted during this project.
