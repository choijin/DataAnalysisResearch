<AbstractNarration>1400901&lt;br/&gt;Bock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports facility operations of the Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center (SOPAC) over a four year period.  SOPAC activities include the collection archiving and dissemination of some 800 GPS stations worldwide that are not currently available through the UNAVCO archive.  In addition SOPAC provides daily GPS satellite orbit corrections as Global Analysis Center for the International Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Network that benefit geodetic studies worldwide through improved reference frame determinations.  SOPAC activities also support non-academic users requiring precise (real-time and post-processed) positioning and reference system data including government agencies, the commercial sector, and local, state, federal, and international agencies (e.g., surveying, GIS, agriculture, intelligent transportation, engineering infrastructure).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

Our research group, the Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center (SOPAC) has developed over the past 25 years the capability to locate a position with an accuracy of less than a 10th of an inch compared to several meter accuracy for civilian applications. The primary purpose is to monitor the tectonic motions at plate boundaries for an improved understanding of the physical processes that drive earthquakes as impact to seismic risk assessment. Our group provides GPS data from 1000's of monitoring stations distributed globally and at plate boundaries such as the San Andreas fault in California (see attached Figure). The data are used by scientists the world over for this type of research, as well as other scientific applications that require high accuracy such as hydrology, meteorology, polar studies, climate research and structural health monitoring.&nbsp; Our archive has also been used for civilian applications that require precise locations for fixed or moving platforms. For example, land surveyors and transportation engineers require this accuracy for geographic information systems and in self-driving vehicles. Therefore, the data also support economic and infrastructure development in the public and private sectors. Over the five-year project we have supplied about 200 terabytes of data to thousands of users. These include in the U.S..com, .edu, .gov, .mil and .net domains as well as many international domains.
