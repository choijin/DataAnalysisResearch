<AbstractNarration>1433101&lt;br/&gt;Jaffe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new pathway for ammonium oxidation coupled to iron reduction in the absence of oxygen and nitrate/nitrite has recently been described by the PI and co-workers for wetland soils in New Jersey, by researchers from UC Berkeley in tropical rainforest soils, and by researchers in Japan in a bioreactor, and has been referred to as Feammox. Further Studies have been conducted in incubations of NJ wetland sediments, confirming that Feammox is a biological process, and that an Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6, previously unknown, is responsible for it. Samples have been enriched and the PI has isolated the pure Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 strain. Preliminary results from augmenting an anoxic bioreactor with ferrihydrite and Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 have shown that there is a potential to exploit this process for anaerobic biological ammonium oxidation. Having isolated the Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 raises the potential to determine the functional gene responsible for Feammox and to gain new fundamental insights into this process and its applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtually all wastewater treatment plants in the developed world as well as in many developing countries oxidize ammonia to nitrate ion, before discharging the treated wastewater. This is done to decrease oxygen demand in the receiving waters. Biological ammonium oxidation is conduced by aerobic (in the presence of oxygen) nitrifying bacteria and requires aeration, the step with the highest energy input in wastewater treatment plants. An alternative is the partial nitrification + Anammox system, which has been implemented in some treatment plants over the past 15 years, with the goal of saving energy costs, since only half of the ammonia is converted to nitrite ion aerobically, while the rest is converted to nitrogen gas anaerobically via Anammox. However, these Anammox-based wastewater treatment systems need to operate at temperatures between 28 and 35 Celsius. In contrast, we have shown that the Feammox pathway is still active at below 10 Celsius. Hence, a Feammox-based process could result in further energy savings, by requiring no aeration or heating of the wastewater water in temperate climates, although the cost of an Fe(III) source will have to be taken into account. Furthermore, N excess in near-shore environments has been identified as a major environmental problem leading to eutrophication and anoxia (Chesapeake Bay, Gulf of Mexico, etc.). Therefore legislation is being drafted which will require conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas in conventional wastewater treatment plants. Potentially the Feammox process could achieve N removal in a single stage reactor with low energy utilization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) under iron reducing conditions, is referred to as Feamox, and has been described in recent years by several investigators.  One effort of this research was to gain an understanding into the environmental characteristics in which the Feammox exists in order to determine this processÃ† contribution to the nitrogen cycle.   In this study, though extensive sampling, soil chemical analyses, serial culturing experiments, analysis of microbial communities, and using a canonical correspondence analysis, it was found that the soil acidity, as well as its iron and ammonium content were the most important factors controlling the distribution of Feammox bacteria. Under the conditions that favored the presence and activity of Feammox bacteria and their oxidation of ammonium, denitrification bacteria were also active, however the presence of nitrous oxide (a powerful greenhouse gas) reducers was limited under these conditions. Therefore where the Feammox is active, conditions might result in higher nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas ratios as the nitrogen transformation end products.  Another emphasis of this research was to determine if the Feammox process can be applied for waste water treatment.  Membrane reactors, inoculated with Feammox bacterium were run.  Ferrihydrite, a common iron oxide was added as the iron source, and ammonium removal was monitored.  Since the reaction requires 6 irons per ammonium removed, and the buildup of reduced iron slows the reaction, the membrane reactor required significant addition of iron and reaction stopped when reduced iron built up.  Hence, a microbial electrolytic cell (MEC) reactor was tested.  Here the electron is transferred to the anode instead of to the iron.    By running the MEC with an external potential of 0.7 mV we were able to show that the Feammox reaction is possible in an MEC and potentially also in a microbial fuel cell.  Optimization of the MEC process is still in progress.   In addition, full sequencing of the Feammox bacterium Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 was conducted.  The bacterium does not have any of the known sequences responsible for ammonium oxidation, but we identified a novel oxygenase that appears to be key in the Feammox process.   Oxygenases have been shown to epoxidize and hence degrade tri- and per chloroethylene (TCE and PCE, respectively).  We tested the stability of both TCE and PCE in vials where Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 was growing while oxidizing ammonium and reducing iron, and have shown that both degraded over a two-week period, while both, TCE and PCE remained stable in the autoclaved samples.  Hence, Feammox might have possible applications in the insitu remediation of these common pollutants.  Results of part one do explain under what environmental conditions such remediation might be feasible.             Last Modified: 07/09/2015       Submitted by: Peter R Jaffe]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
