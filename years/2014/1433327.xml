<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), Georgia Technical Institute, and Georgia State University will develop and test a model curriculum for grades 3-6 that aligns with ISTE's standards and computational thinking goals. The strategy is to leverage three existing computational environments (Scratch, Alice, and MAD-learn) to build upon the activities and materials for them that exist, to create an elaborate curricular guide. Teachers will collaborate regularly over three years with computer science mentors and science educators to iteratively create this curricular guide, which will be based on their own efforts and experiences implementing the computer science activities in their classrooms.  The activities will aim to teach students computational thinking, as well as increase their motivation and interest in computer science related fields.  Each year the program will culminate with an annual fair at which student products will be displayed.  The population of the charter school where the project will be implemented includes a majority of students from underrepresented groups and from low-income families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This curricular effort will be augmented with mentor networking among teachers and students with professionals in computer science industries. Research will be of two forms: (1) Design research approach will collect quantitative and qualitative data on the curriculum development process, including summative measures of learning and attitudes toward science as well as general academic ability. Data will also include qualitative results of an existing observation protocol for instruction that supports computational thinking, qualitative ethnographic field notes of meetings and classroom instruction, and video recordings of select events. (2) Data from quantitative instruments will be compared to another school with similar demographics that employs a project-based curriculum but does not use the technological environments or curriculum developed here. This project has potential for considerable impact, first immediately on the 452 students that will experience this innovative program, and then indirectly on others based upon the documented results of this innovative effort to integrate computational thinking support into elementary education, and to document curriculum and instruction that achieves this.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Integrated Computer Science Project (iCS) was a three-year effort to explore integrating computer science concepts (CS) and computational thinking (CT) into the curriculum of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades through project-based learning (PBL) in a conversion charter school in the southeastern United States. Based on current educational and industry demographics, the iCS Project focused heavily on exposing and attracting under-represented groups (African-American and female students) to the field of computer science. The most noticeable change to the project site and staff suggests that iCS was successful in broadening participation in Computer Science.</p> <p>Georgia State University partnered with the Georgia Institute of Technology, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), and field experts in PBL (CreatomBuilder, WorkReadyGrad) to offer monthly professional development about CS and CT. This professional development supported grade-level teacher teams as they planned projects for their students based on curriculum content, state standards, and ISTE standards. The created projects integrated CS and CT concepts through programs like Scratch. Teachers mapped out projects over several weeks or months. The projects were then presented to an audience of peers, experts, and community members. The projects were not limited to isolated content areas such as science and math, rather, integrated content across all subject areas. For example, the 3rd grade social studies projects covered historical figures such as Katherine Johnson, an African-American woman and mathematician who broke race and gender barriers at NASA. Students were tasked with programming Scratch characters and scenes to depict Johnson with sound and text informing the audience of notable facts and accomplishments. Throughout the development of such projects, teachers received feedback from PBL experts as well as critique from ISTE representatives.</p> <p>As the teachers participating in the iCS project implemented the projects in their classrooms, they were encouraged to connect with content experts to provide practical examples, resources, and inspiration to students. WorkReadyGrad, an organization that matches high school students with industry professionals, worked with the teachers to provide content specific experts for class visits and networking events. Project leaders also facilitated the teachers&rsquo; presentations and attendance at relevant professional conferences. Interviews with participating teachers revealed how participation in professional conferences bolstered their confidence while integrating CS and CT. Teachers reported that they felt as though they were on the &ldquo;cutting edge,&rdquo; suggesting that their experience was transformative.</p> <p>The most significant challenge during the project was the rate of teacher turnover. Teachers at the school received intensive training on PBL. However, very few of the teachers participated in multiple years. Over the course of 3 years, 25 individual teachers were observed teaching. Only one of these teachers was observed all three years. An additional six teachers were observed two years and the remaining 18 were observed one year. Teacher observations from 2015 to 2016 showed great improvements in student engagement and technology use. While the 2017 data continued to show high levels of student engagement, the improvements in technology use did not maintain the change. Student demographic data shows that almost 1/3 of the student population is affected by homelessness and therefore is a transient population. The analysis of students who were in the project multiple years revealed gains in both reading and math, which can perhaps be attributed to the effects of the iCS Project. In addition, the school was removed from the state accountability oversight due to increases in math and reading performance in grades 3-5.</p> <p>The iCS Project leadership team observed a shift in the school&rsquo;s administrative and organizational climate as the project matured. These observations manifested in pedagogical shifts such as the creation a PBL Core Team (an internal team of teachers tasked to support the faculty) as PBL was adopted in grades K-8 (all grades in the school). of a school&rsquo;s measured College and Career Readiness Performance Indicators (CCRPI). The CCRPI is a statewide accountability system that measures schools and school districts on a 110-point scale based on multiple indicators of performance including student achievement on the statewide tests. The school increased its score by over 20 points on the CCRPI for 2017. The school&rsquo;s score is 82.7, with a score of 80.8 for middle school, and an overall school score of 82.3. This was a 21.6 point increase from the 2016 score of 60.7. The project site school outperformed the district score of 68.3 and state score of 75, achieving the academic benchmarks as outlined in its charter agreement while meeting the needs of a diverse group of learners including the economically disadvantaged students with disabilities, and students who are learning to speak English. While the iCS Project cannot be statistically tied to the increase in the school&rsquo;s CCRPI score, the targeted effort of the project to increase the capacity and affinity for computer science and STEM fields is a positive component of the schoolwide mission.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/13/2018<br>      Modified by: Rachel&nbsp;Fiore</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536689494454_iCSTeacher--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536689494454_iCSTeacher--rgov-800width.jpg" title="iCS Teacher"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536689494454_iCSTeacher--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="iCS Teacher"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An iCS teacher teaching :)</div> <div class="imageCredit">A member of the iCS Team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rachel&nbsp;Fiore</div> <div class="imageTitle">iCS Teacher</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536690660488_iCSPBLCoreTeam--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536690660488_iCSPBLCoreTeam--rgov-800width.jpg" title="iCS PBL Core Team"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536690660488_iCSPBLCoreTeam--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="iCS PBL Core Team"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The school recruited a "PBL Core Team" from the faculty to support project planning and implementation.</div> <div class="imageCredit">A member of the iCS Team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rachel&nbsp;Fiore</div> <div class="imageTitle">iCS PBL Core Team</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536687896688_iCSClassroom--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536687896688_iCSClassroom--rgov-800width.jpg" title="iCS Project Classroom"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536687896688_iCSClassroom--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="iCS Project Classroom"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A participating classroom at the iCS Project site.</div> <div class="imageCredit">A member of the iCS Team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rachel&nbsp;Fiore</div> <div class="imageTitle">iCS Project Classroom</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536856664737_iCSProfDev--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536856664737_iCSProfDev--rgov-800width.jpg" title="iCS Professional Development"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536856664737_iCSProfDev--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="iCS Professional Development"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Kathy Fritz of CreatomBuilder facilitates a professional development session for an iCS grade level team.</div> <div class="imageCredit">A member of the iCS Team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rachel&nbsp;Fiore</div> <div class="imageTitle">iCS Professional Development</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536856839079_iCSProfDev3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536856839079_iCSProfDev3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="iCS Professional Development"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1433327/1433327_10334499_1536856839079_iCSProfDev3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="iCS Professional Development"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Chris Thompson of CEISMC facilitates an iCS professional development session.</div> <div class="imageCredit">A member of the iCS Team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rachel&nbsp;Fiore</div> <div class="imageTitle">iCS Professional Development</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
