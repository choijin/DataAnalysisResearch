<AbstractNarration>With funding from the Capacity Building track of the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this project will build the framework for a new STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) teacher preparation partnership program between the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) (a strong engineering school) and the University of Northern Colorado (UNCO) (a strong teacher education school).  The new teacher preparation program will produce more highly qualified STEM teachers in Colorado, with special emphasis on middle and high school teachers.  This program will provide an alternative path for CSM students who may wish to become a science or mathematics teacher.  The project will provide insight in how to increase recruitment and retention of STEM majors while also addressing the shortage of STEM teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborating institutions will develop new and revised courses that will best address the integrative nature of STEM learning that is emerging in K-12 education by preparing secondary science and mathematics teachers with the skills to integrate scientific inquiry, technological design, engineering problem solving and mathematical analysis into cohesive and meaningful learning experiences for their students.  The program design will focus on recruitment and effective preparation of future teachers by providing the teacher candidates with strong content knowledge, early field experiences, and supervision of their student teaching by content faculty.  This ultimately will have a positive impact on the students of these future teachers and an increase in science literacy within the greater community.  The innovative model for collaboration between these two universities will be transportable to other similar situations where engineering schools are looking for ways to enable their students interested in teaching as a career to complete their training and certification.  Project evaluation will be conducted primarily through tracking forms developed for each project goal and its corresponding objectives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The TEAM-UP Project: A new STEM teacher preparation program between two universities.  How do you get two universities to collaborate on a common problem &ndash; the preparation of more highly qualified STEM teachers?  The TEAM-UP (Teacher Education Alliance, Mines-UNC Partnership) Project developed a new STEM teacher preparation partnership program between the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) (a strong engineering school) and the University of Northern Colorado (UNC) (a strong teacher education school). This program now provides an alternative path for CSM students that may wish to consider teaching science or mathematics, instead of engineering, as a profession.  Students complete all their content coursework through CSM and start taking education courses through UNC (mostly online or on the CSM campus).  Then after graduation with a BS from CSM, they have one more semester of student teaching supervised through UNC to meet the requirements for teacher licensure.  The collaboration itself was a case study for how two universities can combine their respective strengths to address the needs of students and meet the national need for a more comprehensive preparation of secondary science and mathematics teachers that have the skills to integrate scientific inquiry, technology design, engineering problem solving and mathematical analysis into cohesive and meaningful learning experiences for their students.  In Fall 2015 we enrolled our first cohort of students, and in Fall 2017 the third cohort is starting.  The program is now well established and supported by the administrations of both CSM and UNC.  The ultimate product of this project is a program that will produce more high quality STEM teachers that will have a greater impact on the students that they teach.
