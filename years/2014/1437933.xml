<AbstractNarration>1437933&lt;br/&gt;Williams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary Emissions and Atmospheric Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation from Coal Combustion and Coal-Biomass Cofiring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been recently discovered that along with known emissions from coal combustion and coal-biomass cofiring (e.g., greenhouse gases, refractory particles), organic aerosol can also be directly emitted as primary organic aerosol or produced in the atmosphere as secondary organic aerosol from aging of volatile organic compounds emitted from inefficient combustion/pyrolysis processes. Atmospheric organic aerosols have a significant impact on human health and global climate, and increased emissions in developing nations will have transport-driven implications, even for those nations that have employed improved emissions technologies. Before a prediction can be made on the extent of future organic aerosol emissions, it is first required to understand associated particle formation mechanisms and secondary organic aerosol formation potential at a fundamental level across a range of fuels, combustion efficiencies, and photochemical atmospheric ages; this understanding is the objective of this project. To meet Missouri's need for increased science and engineering education (MO is an EPSCoR state), a novel STEM-based Peer Mentoring Pipeline Program will be established to activate Grade 6 through PhD level research and education of ambient air quality and control technologies. Research projects involving air sampling (using custom sampling kits) in the presence and absence of a control technology (portable air purifiers) and subsequent sample analysis, data processing, and reporting will educate all participants on the science, technology, and impact of pollution and control technologies. Here, students gain mentoring experience and observe the strength and impact of outreach activities, increasing their likelihood of incorporating these types of activities in their careers as they move up the mentoring pipeline. A new Peer Mentoring Pipeline Program for research and education on air quality and pollution control will be implemented for underrepresented youth in St. Louis schools. Research and outreach results will be broadly disseminated through: national conferences, student groups, and graduate/ undergraduate courses in Aerosol Science &amp; Technology / Atmospheric Science / Climate / Thermodynamics, and results will be made publicly available through peer-reviewed publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives of this project are aimed at characterizing new particle formation mechanisms from combustion/pyrolysis of coal and coal-biomass mixtures, determining associated secondary organic aerosol formation potential and organic aerosol evolution in the atmosphere, and to increase education and awareness of the need for pollution control technologies. Methods involve a novel suite of lab-scale furnaces/flames operating together with a novel suite of chemical and physical measurements on gas and particle emissions for a range of fuels and combustion/pyrolysis conditions. Additionally, a photochemical reactor will be employed to test the secondary organic aerosol formation potential of emissions over a range of atmospheric ages. Models for new particle formation and atmospheric oxidative evolution will be constructed. At the conclusion of this project, metrics will be available for new particle formation in combustion/pyrolysis systems operating with various fuels and at various degrees of efficiency. Atmospheric secondary organic aerosol formation potentials and regional/global climate impact will be better understood for a major global source of emissions that has not been previously investigated at this fundamental level, yet evidence for its strong environmental impact has already been observed and will continue to increase in developing regions of the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was focused on the improved physical and chemical characterization of the emissions from coal and coal-biomass combustion over a range of fuel sources and combustion conditions, and a characterization of the transformations these emissions experience when transported and aged in the atmosphere.  A majority of the studies were performed in the laboratory using various efficient combustion systems (e.g., drop-tube furnace) all the way to inefficient combustion systems (e.g., cookstoves).  A mixing and oxidation chamber was modified and characterized in detail for this work, as well as the modification of several instruments and the creation of a new research tool to measure the ability of resulting particles to take up water and participate in cloud formation downwind of their emission region.      We identified more organic aerosol production in the primary coal combustion process than previously reported, and observed the ability for new secondary organic aerosol to form as organic gases oxidize in the atmosphere.  We have identified new chemical tracers that can be used in future work to track these emissions and their atmospheric changes downwind of pollution sources.  We also identified the production of enhanced nitrogen-containing organics from high sulfur coal.  These detailed observations of organics, inorganics, and metals through a range of combustion sources and combustion conditions can be utilized to develop improved emissions control technologies.     Overall, accomplishments include 8 peer-reviewed papers to date, dozens of conference presentations, and the training of many graduate and undergraduate students.  High school students participated in a new Peer Mentoring Pipeline Program designed to engage high-school students, undergrads, and grads in mentoring, designing, performing, and presenting results from community-based research projects related to atmospheric pollution and control.  International collaborations, student exchanges, workshops, and class modules were developed throughout the course of this project.
