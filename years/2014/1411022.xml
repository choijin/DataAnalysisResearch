<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: This collaborative research project studies an underexplored semiconductor materials system that involves boron incorporation in the four-element alloys of BAlGaN. These materials are a new generation of III-V alloy system compared to the AlInGaN alloys that have been developed to provide high-efficiency lighting. The solid-state illumination and lighting technology, based upon AlInGaN alloys, has found wide practical applications in automotive, liquid-crystal-display back panel, mobile communications and signage illumination, and will soon dominate in general lighting.  However, there are still important limitations for AlInGaN alloy materials. This research project explores the advantages of incorporation of boron into these alloys with the ultimate goal to achieve better strain matching in heterostructures, higher efficiency and potentially p-type doping in the new alloy system. The research is integrated with the educational activities including research training for graduate and undergraduate students in the growth, characterization, and processing of these novel materials, and various outreach programs at both Georgia Institute of Technology and Arizona State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The primary focus of this research project is to study the physical, chemical, and electronic properties of high-quality thin films of boron-containing III-nitride semiconductor ternary and quaternary alloys in the technologically important range of compositions and to develop an in-depth understanding of fundamental materials science for improved optoelectronic device designs. The research team uses advanced metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) epitaxial film growth systems, and performs in-depth studies of the effects of growth conditions, substrate materials, substrate orientation, and doping. The materials properties are studied in detail using state-of-the-art nanoscale characterization tools: the crystal structure is studied using atomic-resolution aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy; the electronic band structure is determined by electron holography; and the optical properties are measured by cathodoluminescence with high spatial- and temporal-resolution. Exploring the effects of compositional homogeneity, phase separation, and piezoelectric fields is also included in the research. The microstructural properties are correlated with the optoelectronic properties to understand the role of growth parameters on overall device performance.</AbstractNarration>

Dupuis2  1 Department of Physics, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287-1504  2 Center for Compound Semiconductors and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0250  Project Outcomes Report  The BAlGaN compound semiconductors (B-III-N) are being evaluated as a new alloy system for the next generation of photonic and electronic devices. Incorporating boron into the AlGaN system provides possibilities to further optimize the band gap energy and the lattice parameter, independently of each other, in order to minimize the effects of lattice mismatch.  Examples of applications are as follows: BGaN can be lattice-matched to AlN and to SiC substrates. BGaN micro-islands have been used as substrate for GaN overgrowth in order to achieve a low threading dislocation density. High reflectivity deep-ultraviolet distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) based on BAlN materials can potentially surpass the performance of conventional AlGaInN DBRs in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. And BGaN thin layers have been introduced in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors to provide an electrostatic barrier to electrons and to improve the confinement of the 2-dimensional electron gas.  Flow-modulated epitaxy (FME) is a useful method of producing III-V semiconductors, where the supply of group-III and group-V sources are injected alternately into the growth chamber without interruption. In a layer-by-layer growth mechanism, FME causes complete surface coverage of the group-V atoms, thus increasing the diffusion length of group-III atoms.  The intermittent supply of III vs V elements suppresses parasitic reactions in the gas phase, thus enhancing the metal incorporation in the film. We reported previously on the growth at 910 oC and 1010 oC of 100-nm thick single-phase wurtzite BAlN with boron content over 10%.  In this project we have investigated the microstructure of BxAl1-xN films grown by flow-modulated epitaxy at 1010 oC, with B/(B+Al) gas-flow ratios ranging from 0.06 to 0.18.  The boron content obtained from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns ranges from x = 0.02 to 0.09.  On the other hand, boron content deduced from the aluminum signal in the Rutherford backscattering spectra (RBS) ranges from x = 0.06 to 0.16, closely following the gas-flow ratios.  Transmission electron microscopy indicates the sole presence of wurtzite crystal structure in the BAlN films, and a tendency towards columnar growth for B/(B+Al) gas-flow ratios below 0.12. For higher ratios, the BAlN films exhibit a tendency towards twin formation and finer microstructure.  Electron energy loss spectroscopy has been used to profile spatial variations in the composition of the films. The RBS data suggest that the incorporation of B is highly efficient for our growth method, while the XRD data indicate that the epitaxial growth may be limited by a solubility limit in the crystal phase at about 9%, for the range of B/(B+Al) gas-flow ratios that we have studied, which is significantly higher than previously thought.
