<AbstractNarration>The use of outsourcing in silicon manufacturing has rendered hardware susceptible to malicious bugs, called Trojans, that can cause an Integrated Circuit (IC) to fail in the field, similar to the way viruses manifest themselves in software. While there has been significant inroads into Trojan detection and diagnosis in the recent past, high-resolution Trojan detection has been hampered by the increased variability in silicon manufacturing processes, allowing Trojans to hide behind the design guardbands necessitated by process variability effects. The key objective of this research is to develop techniques, algorithms and support infrastructure for detecting, diagnosing and mitigating the effects of Trojans in a variety of circuits that can cause system malfunction after deployment in the field, in the presence of process variability effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The underlying Trojan detection techniques for both mixed-signal and digital circuits use test stimulus optimization algorithms that maximize the sensitivities of the tests applied to the presence of malicious hardware Trojans. Such algorithms are supported by hardware for delivering the tests to vulnerable hardware designs in the field. Since the nature of bugs inserted maliciously into chip designs is not known apriori, the investigators use on-the-fly learning algorithms to refine the applied tests to expose the effects of inserted Trojans. In addition, precomputed and side-channel tests are applied to increase overall test effectiveness by up to 30X over existing methods. These techniques will enable significantly increased security of US industrial and government intellectual property and prevent tampering of US chip designs by external third parties.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p class="Abstract">Insertion of malicious Trojans into outsourced chip manufacturing generally results in increased capacitances of internal circuit nodes that have been tapped for node controllability and observability by malicious circuitry. Current path delay measurement and side channel Trojan detection techniques are unable to detect Trojans that present low loading to such tapped circuit nodes, especially in the presence of large manufacturing process variations. A high-resolution Trojan detection method for digital logic based on pulse propagation was developed. The method exhibits 25X &ndash; 30X higher diagnostic resolution (ability to measure small capacitive loads on internal circuit nodes) as compared to current path delay based Trojan detection techniques <em>in the presence of significant manufacturing process variations</em>. Further, a key benefit is that theoretically, as opposed to path delay measurement based methods, the diagnostic resolution of the test approach is <em>independent of circuit logic depth</em> over and above the benefits already mentioned above. Test methods and test infrastructure compatible with existing scan based techniques are described. Simulation results are presented to prove the viability and effectiveness of the proposed Trojan detection scheme and especially for circuits with large logic depths (35-70 gates) suffering from worst case process variation effects.</p> <p class="Abstract">The above pulse propagation based Trojan detection is independent of logic depth in the path. As the logic depth increases however, the&nbsp; Trojan detection scheme&nbsp; loses some accuracy. Though the scheme appears simple, it is not so straight forward to generate and apply the pulse inputs on chip at the desired locations and capture them at designated locations with high accuracy in presence of high fan out nodes in the design. Aa very high resolution current sensing scheme to detect pulse propagation through logic gates was developed. A single sensor can sense pulse at multiple locations. The entire scheme of pulse based Trojan detection has been integrated into JTAG boundary scan scheme with minimal area overhead to provide a complete solution for detection of hardware Trojans.</p> <p class="Abstract">With regard to mixed-signal, the test generation problem for analog/RF circuits has been largely intractable due to the fact that repetitive circuit simulation for test stimulus optimization is extremely time-consuming. As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to generate tests for practical mixed-signal/RF circuits that include the effects of tester inaccuracies and measurement noise. To offset this problem and allow test generation to scale to different applications, we propose a new approach in which <em>FSM models</em> of mixed-signal/RF circuits are abstracted from <em>hardware measurements on fabricated devices</em>. These models allow accurate simulation of device behavior under <em>arbitrary stimulus</em> <em>and thereby test stimulus generation</em>, <em>even after the device has been shipped to a customer</em>. As a consequence, it becomes possible to detect process shifts with fine granularity and regenerate tests to <em>adapt to process perturbations</em> in a dynamic manner without losing test accuracy.
