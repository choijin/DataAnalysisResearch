<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the commercial availability of the reconfigurable antenna product for the mobile market.  The reconfigurable antenna can provide enormous benefits including power savings, improve signal reception, bandwidth, link budgets, reduce drop-calls and improve overall call quality, improved gain/range and increasing the number of devices served by the same wireless infrastructure.  The potential opportunity is at least $2 billion as the cell phone market alone accounts for more than 1 billion antennas per year.  Smart phones would be the most relevant portion of the market.  The percentage of smart phones is climbing every year and already exceeds 1 billion units annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will develop a miniaturized reconfigurable antenna that will enable portable wireless devices to continuously operate at optimal efficiency, improving bandwidth, range, energy efficiency, capacity and overall performance of portable wireless devices. The proposed antenna addresses the efficiency and linearity shortcomings of competing approaches.  The proposed project will focus on RF MEMS integration, optimization, and experimental verification.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The first-ever polarization reconfigurable antenna using RF-MEMS switches was developed.  Specific unique advantages of this prototype when used instead of traditional commercially-available mobile phone antennas include:  - improved signal reception (i.e. more 'bars' on your phone, even in basements or areas of low signal strength, by up to an estimate of ten times (10x) in a 'best case' scenario),   - extended range of coverage (e.g. the covered area under appropriate phone orientation can increase by up to an estimate of three or four times),   - most importantly it can reduce the amount of power consumed by cell phones for wireless communications by up to an estimate of ten times (10x), especially when the orientation of the phone results in its signal being highly cross-polarized compared to the base station's signal.   - improve the overall user experience of the mobile phone users through a reduction of dropped calls, reduction of signal and sound fading, improvement of sound quality in general, and faster data transfer speeds (which is particularly useful in future 5G applications), particularly in areas with weak signal reception.   This cell phone antenna is a first step towards more sophisticated systems that will increase signal reception based on the mobile device's orientation and are likely to become adopted by the mobile phone industry in the future.
