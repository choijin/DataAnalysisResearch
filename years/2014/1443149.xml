<AbstractNarration>This project will support 1) international travel of 10 US scientists to attend the 6th International Workshop on Science Gateways (IWSG 2014) that will take place 3-5 June 2014 in Dublin, Ireland and 2) the cost of publishing the proceedings in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. IWSG 2014 is the 6th workshop of the successful IWSG workshop series and the partner workshop of the US workshop Science Gateway Institute Workshop (SGIW). It is an interdisciplinary workshop that brings together researchers and industry partners from various scientific domains, e.g. life sciences, chemistry, physics, digital media, along with science gateways developers&amp;#8232;and science gateway providers. It forms an international platform for discussing problems and solutions in the area, identifying new issues, shaping future directions for research; fostering the exchange of ideas, standards and common requirements, and pushing towards the wider adoption of science gateways in e-Science. The resulting proceedings as well as abstractsand talks will be made publicly available. Additionally, authors of best papers will be invited to submit significantly extended and updated version of their papers to a special issue on science gateways in the journal "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience". The special issue will be jointly organized with SGIW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New technologies, simulations and experimental methods have enabled researchers to create huge amounts of data in extremely short times. The demand for compute power and storage is met with a rise in provision of distributed computing infrastructures (DCIs), such as grid and cloud infrastructures. Despite the increasing availability of resources, the broad uptake of these facilities and infrastructures is not following the same pace. The main reasons for this lie in the complexity of the human interface to these infrastructures. A science gateway is an approach to offer easy and intuitive access to computing infrastructures irrespective of their location. Science gateways are community-specific sets of tools, applications, and data collections that are integrated together via a web portal or a desktop application, providing access to resources and services for distributed data management and DCIs. They offer the potential to open the utilization of DCIs to wider audiences by providing a customized and intuitive user interface to access large computational and data resources. The complexity of the underlying infrastructure can be completely hidden from the end-users by a suitably tailored interface. As interest in science gateways has accelerated in the past few years, an increasing number of new user communities can utilize grid or cloud computing resources in a convenient manner. An important factor for creating successful science gateways is the collaboration between users, science gateway developers, and science providers. This meeting will bring together international experts from research domains and experts representing DCIs such as XSEDE, EGI, OSG, PRACE and others.</AbstractNarration>
