<AbstractNarration>Technical description: The goal of this project is to test three models of faunal change in response to biotic and abiotic forcings during the transition to the modern grassland ecosystem in the Great Plains over the last 4.5 My: the Red Queen, the Court Jester, and the Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography. In doing so, we will answer four specific research questions: 1) Do long-term changes in local habitat or climate control taxonomic diversity dynamics? 2) Does climate change associated with the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at 2.5 Ma impact diversity dynamics or the ecological structure of communities? 3) How do catastrophic events (major ashfalls) impact diversity dynamics and ecological structure of communities? 4) How are immigrant species accommodated in the ecological structure of the contemporary community? We will analyze diversity dynamics with an existing database of species occurrences in the Meade Basin, SW Kansas in relation to reconstructions of local paleoecology, paleoenvironment, and paleoclimate.  We will characterize ecological structure of communities with body sizes estimated from tooth dimensions and trophic categories reconstructed from carbon isotope compositions of tooth enamel using laser ablation isotope ratio mass spectrometry and a novel combination of morphometric analyses based on high resolution microCT scans. Interpretation of paleodiet proxies will be constrained by isotopic and morphometric analyses of modern species with known diets and habitats from existing museum collections and live trapping in grasslands around Meade, KS. Paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstructions will be based on a comprehensive suite of proxies measured on paleosol carbonates and bulk sediment samples collected in stratigraphic association with known fossil sites and major ashfalls: carbon isotope ratios of bulk organic matter, carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf wax n-alkanes, lignin phenol ratios, plant phytolith assemblages, carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry, and paleosol elemental geochemistry and mineralogy. Paleoclimate proxies and isotopic data will be compared to output of regional scale, isotope-enabled paleoclimate simulations under various forcings. Finally, we will construct ecological niche models for modern mammal species and genera in the region and use paleoclimate model output to test how climate change may have forced range shifts and taxonomic turnover in the Meade record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical description: Understanding the origin of modern communities is a fundamental goal of ecology, but reconstructing the history of communities that include species with stratigraphic durations on the scale of hundreds of thousands to millions of years necessarily requires data from the fossil record. Similarly, inferences about the paleoecology of past communities are most robust when informed by data from both living and fossil populations of extant species. Despite the logical connections between ecology and paleoecology, relatively few studies have bridged the gaps in the characteristic observational timescales and methodologies of these disciplines to achieve a comprehensive view of the long-term evolution of specific modern communities.  The need to bridge these disciplinary gaps is increasingly pressing in the face of anthropogenic climate change and uncertainty about the magnitude and direction of responses by local communities. This project will examine the ecological, environmental, and climatic context of the origin of the modern small mammal community in the grasslands of the central USA over the last five million years. We will test the effects of both biological and non-biological factors on long-term taxonomic turnover and ecological change in a stratigraphic sequence of local communities using a combination of ecomorphology, biogeochemistry, paleoclimate modeling, and biogeography. This project will link evolution, ecology, and paleoecology with biogeochemistry to trace the emergence of a modern ecosystem over geological time.</AbstractNarration>

Oxygen isotopes from paleoproxies show a decreasing trend and an increasing variability from mid-Miocene to Pleistocene in the Southern Great Plains of the US, where carbon&nbsp;isotopes indicate an overall increase of C4 plants during the same time period. Using isotope-enabled GCM simulations, here I explore the causes of the long-term trend and variability of oxygen isotopes.

The isotopic composition of winter precipitation varies more than that of summer precipitation and depends strongly on temperature, or more precisely on the contribution of snow to total precipitation. I conclude that the long-term isotopic composition of precipitation decreases because of gradual cooling and varies more because of lower and more variable winter temperature in a colder climate in response to fluctuating orbital configuration.&nbsp;This study implies that C4 grassland in the Southern Great Plains region expanded along with global cooling, probably resulting from the decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration.</p> <p>From various numerical simulations mentioned above, we unintendedly found out the possible causes of why the glacial pace changes in the mid-Pleistocene.

Using climate model simulations, here we demonstrate that the pace of the glacial cycle depends on the pattern of hemispheric sea ice growth. In a cold climate the sea ice grows asymmetrically between two hemispheres with changing Earth&rsquo;s orbital precession and eccentricity, because sea ice growth potential outside of the Arctic Circle is limited. This difference in hemispheric sea ice growth leads to the asymmetry in absorbed solar energy for the two hemispheres, even if the annual average insolation is similar. When the southern polar region receives less solar energy, more sea ice grows, and increased sea ice in the Southern Ocean should trigger positive feedbacks in CO<sub>2</sub>, energy balance, and air-ice-sea fluxes that can lead to the growth of terrestrial glaciers. In a warmer climate, the hemispheric asymmetry of the sea ice decreases as mean Arctic and Antarctic sea ice decreases, diminishing the precession and eccentricity signatures and explaining the dominant obliquity signature (40-kyr) before the mid-Pleistocene transition, about one million years ago.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/14/2016<br>      Modified by: Jung-Eun&nbsp;Lee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1415464/1415464_10265411_1478199430210_winter_fig7--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1415464/1415464_10265411_1478199430210_winter_fig7--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The contribution of snow determines the annual average isotopic composition of precipitation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1415464/1415464_10265411_1478199430210_winter_fig7--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The contribution of snow determines the annual average isotopic composition of precipitation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The relationship between the contribution of snow (a) and winter precipitation (b) to total precipitation and the ?18O in annual mean precipitation.
