<AbstractNarration>From microscopic DNA to massive solar flares, string-like objects are replete in nature at every scale. These objects can be entangled and transition between different types of knots. Sometimes nature needs to eliminate this knotting, such as when enzymes called type II topoisomerases cut and reattach strands of DNA to release interlinking during replication.  These type II topoisomerases are targets for some chemotherapy drugs, as well as the antibiotic Cipro which is used to treat anthrax poisoning.  At other times, knotting is created for a purpose, such as in the folding of some proteins into their functional knotted native state.  While the exact function of the knotting in these proteins is unknown, determining the function could make it possible to manipulate proteins or design new proteins for medical applications. At still other times, changes in knotting are the product of natural deterioration.  For example, as sub-atomic glueball particles decay through their lifetimes, they change between different types of knots.  Indeed, knotting in nature is a dynamic process and the transitions between different types of knots reveal properties of the physical systems.  In this project, the PI, a multi-disciplinary group of collaborators, and undergraduate students study knotting transitions for topoisomerase II, proteins, and glueballs to gain insights into the role of knotting in these systems. This project has broad educational objectives. Several undergraduate students will be supported directly by the grant. They will be trained by the PI and contribute to the projects, gaining both content knowledge and experience in the research process.  The students will participate in professional meetings and disseminate their findings in talks and posters. These research experiences are essential in training the next generation of science and mathematics educators, researchers, and practitioners. To reach a wide-audience, the PI will continue to be active in giving presentations to students, non-specialists, and multi-disciplinary audiences. The results will be published in mathematics and science journals. The PI will organize interdisciplinary conference sessions to bring together scientists from traditionally disparate fields and create new interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers across the world. In addition, the research results, data, and software generated as a part of this grant will be made publicly available via the world wide web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the mathematical study of knotting has focused traditionally on closed loops, much of the knotting in nature occurs in objects with free ends (i.e. open chains). This project will establish a firm understanding of open knotted structures, including knotted substructures within open chains and closed loops. This knowledge will be applied to classify the knotting in proteins and the data will be made publicly available. Relationships between knotting, geometric structure, and the amino acid sequence in knotted proteins will be determined to establish the function of the knotting in knotted proteins. Modeling knotting transitions due to the action of type II topoisomerases will lead to a better understanding of their effectiveness in untangling DNA strands. A similar analysis will be used to determine how subatomic glueballs decay through knotting. Together, these projects will reveal fundamental insights into knotting in nature.  More specifically, the main objectives of this grant are to 1) decompose complicated knots into their essential elements, 2) reveal the function of knotting in knotted proteins, 3) determine where type II topoisomerases perform their cutting and reattaching action, and 4) understand the decaying process in glueballs. A combination of new and established models and computer applications will be used to analyze these physical systems.  In addition to the scientific goals, this project has broad educational objectives. Several undergraduate students will be supported directly by the grant. They will be trained by the PI and contribute to the projects, gaining both content knowledge and experience in the research process.  The students will participate in professional meetings and disseminate their findings in talks and posters.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Modern life is filled with tangled strings: garden hoses, computer cables, etc.  This entanglement can help us (e.g. shoelaces) or frustrate us (e.g. earbud cords after being jammed in one's pocket).  Entanglement plays a similar role in the life of many microscopic biological chains, e.g. DNA and proteins, sometimes helping and sometimes hampering systems.  The PI, his undergraduate student researchers, and an international group of collaborators studied the role of entanglement in several natural systems, with applications in both biology and physics.  For example, during DNA replication, strands of DNA become entangled and enzymes called topoisomerases use a cut-and-paste strategy to detangle the strands.  Topoisomerases are targets for some chemotherapy drugs and antibiotics, although some of the detangling mechanism is still not well understood.  This grant funded work to determine where and how topoisomerases act.  The PI and collaborators found that supercoiling in simulated bacterial DNA created certain geometric features which could be distinguished by topoisomerases.  The action of topoisomerases at these features leads, preferentially, to a simplification of entanglement, and thus it was proposed that bacterial topoisomerases act at these geometric features.  Entanglement has also been discovered in proteins.  While the exact function of the entanglement is still under debate, it has been established that the entanglement provides some utility to these proteins.  Understanding the entanglement could lead to medical applications, such as drug development or new drug delivery systems.  Proteins form open chains (i.e. have two free ends, like an unplugged extension cord) whereas the traditional study of knots is for closed chains (i.e. form loops, like an extension cord plugged into itself).  This grant funded the development, analysis, and implementation of techniques to identify entanglement in open chains, for example the techniques used to find knotting in proteins.  In particular, the KnotProt and LinkProt websites, which provide information about entanglement in proteins to the public, were developed and enhanced in collaboration with the PI as a part of this grant.  In biological systems, knotting often occurs under some confinement.  In particular, when one packs a chain in a small space, that chain tends to get more entangled than a similar length chain which is not confined.  We see this behavior in everyday life with strings of holiday lights, earbuds, and the many cables we have tucked behind our electronics.  This phenomenon has also been observed in viruses, where DNA packed in viral heads form very complicated knots.  The PI and collaborators completed several studies to understand how such confinement affects closed knots, and how these two factors affect the spatial structure of the chains.  In particular, they determined how the knotting, the length of the chain, and the confinement affect how the chains twist and turn.  They found, for example, that tight confinement makes certain classes of knots more likely and that long chains appear to require some organization to form simple knots (perhaps akin to the coiling of cables we perform in everyday life).  For biological systems with confined entanglement, these insights can be used to understand the mechanisms in play that suppress or enhance entanglement.  Beyond the research, the grant had a number of broader impacts.  Providing deep research experiences for STEM students was a central objective of the grant.  Thirteen undergraduate students were involved in the research.  These students participated in nine professional conferences, giving a total of 40 posters and presentations over the course of the grant.  Furthermore, the PI organized two multidisciplinary conference sessions to bring together researchers interested in entanglement in nature.  These sessions led to new cross-disciplinary collaborations, both for the PI and for the other researchers involved.
