<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funding to continue operation of the Tudor Hill marine-atmospheric sampling station in Bermuda. The Tudor Hill facility has served as an observation and monitoring station of the marine boundary layer since 1988. The continued operation and maintenance of the Tudor Hill site will facilitate research concerning the chemistry and physics of the marine troposphere and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes -- topics that are central to predicting and mitigating the effects of anticipated future climatic and environmental change. This project will make significant educational contributions at a number of levels, including undergraduate education opportunities through the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program and through courses taught at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The troposphere plays important roles in the global cycling of many elements, the global radiation budget, and in the global distribution of organic compounds, nutrients, microbes, and pollutants. At present, many aspects of atmospheric composition, transport, and atmosphere-ocean exchange remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of future climate change. Central to improving our understanding of these topics is the ability to observe and sample the marine boundary layer. By virtue of its location in the western North Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda has been a key location for numerous field studies of the marine troposphere. With this renewed support, researchers will continue the collection and archiving of meteorological, aerosol, and rain samples/data, and other atmospheric collections for analysis by external investigators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since March 2003, with support from the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Sciences (BIOS) has been operating the Tudor Hill Marine-Atmospheric Observatory as a site for research activities conducted by BIOS and visiting US and international scientists. The facility consists of a 70? walk-up research tower equipped with instrumentation and sensors, and three laboratory containers: one housing instrumentation and data facilities, the second providing laboratory facilities for sample handling, and the third providing overnight accommodation and dining facilities.  Owing to its remote geographic location in the western subtropical North Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda has been a key sampling location for numerous studies of the marine atmosphere. Measurements of various chemicals in the atmosphere have been made on Bermuda since the mid-1970s. Longer term measurements of air and rain chemistry began in the early 1980?s under the Western Atlantic Ocean Experiment (WATOX) program, and in 1987 the tower was erected at Tudor Hill, Bermuda, as part of the Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE), an international long-term study of the atmospheric transport of aerosols and gases in the North Atlantic region. This facility is one of only a few marine atmospheric observatories that exist worldwide and it provides the ability to make year-round, complex measurements of the atmosphere over the ocean without the use of a research ship or buoy moorings.  The continuing operation of the BIOS Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory has ensured the ongoing availability and use of the facility by a diverse range of US and international scientists and agencies. Currently the facility supports research and monitoring activities supported by NSF, NOAA and NASA, in addition to two foreign university project and one foreign government agency project (Environment Canada).  Over the three year period of the current grant, 20 peer-reviewed scientific publications were generated by work conducted at the facility.  The facility is also widely used for BIOS education activities and in the past three years has supported US students engaged in the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program and other students undertaking internships and residential educational courses at BIOS.
