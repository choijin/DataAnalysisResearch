<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Jeffrey Meier is "Low-Dimensional Topology: Exceptional Dehn Surgery, Knot Concordance, and Doubly Slice Knots." The host institution for the fellowship is Indiana University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Charles Livingston.</AbstractNarration>
