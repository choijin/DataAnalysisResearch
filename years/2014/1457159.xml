<AbstractNarration>People who regularly use more than one language in their daily life, bilinguals, seem to easily switch back and forth between languages without any obvious difficulty. However, recent research studies demonstrated subtle but reliable differences between bilinguals and monolinguals on a variety of tests including both tests that measure linguistic ability and tests that measure other cognitive skills (e.g., the ability to avoid distraction). Such differences have potentially significant implications in all settings where testing occurs, including educational and medical settings. In some cases, bilinguals might appear to be less fluent than monolinguals because they know some words in one of their languages but not in the other. It might seem that allowing bilinguals to switch back and forth between languages during testing should eliminate any testing disadvantage associated with bilingualism. However, language switching can itself introduce disadvantages in some testing situations (e.g., slowing of responses). It is important to identify how people might be affected by their diverse linguistic experiences both for practical reasons related to academic goals and for scientific reasons related to developing an understanding of the human capacity for acquiring and maintaining language skills. Such knowledge will affect an increasing number of Americans as more than 1 in 5 currently speaks a language other than English at home and this number is growing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies will compare young to aging Spanish-English bilinguals in a series of behavioral experiments designed to identify 1) how bilingualism and aging jointly affect test performance, and 2) when language switching may enhance the ability to rapidly and fluently produce words and sentences.  A driving hypothesis underlying the current work is that language selection is sometimes implemented relatively automatically but at other times requires effort. This hypothesis will be tested by asking how language switching ability changes as bilinguals get older; whereas automatic processes should stay the same in aging, processes that require focused effort should decline. These studies will clarify the relationship between bilingualism and test performance and will specify a well-articulated theoretical model of bilingual language production that may lay the groundwork necessary to develop theory-driven optimization of experience for bilingual individuals in educational and medical settings.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Bilinguals -- people who regularly use more than one language in their daily life -- seem to switch back and forth between languages without any obvious difficulty. Indeed, in some linguistic communities or settings, bilingual speakers of all ages, including young and older bilinguals, switch languages frequently in spontaneous conversation without any apparent thought or effort. The apparent ease with which bilinguals switch languages across the lifespan is surprising, given that other switching tasks seem to be noticeably more difficult in aging, leading aging individuals to sometimes be described as less flexible. The proposed studies aimed to characterize what makes language switching easy in young and aging Spanish-English bilinguals in a series of behavioral experiments. A driving hypothesis underlying the work is that choosing which language to speak is sometimes relatively automatic (and therefore does not change in aging) but at other times requires effort. The results revealed some circumstances in which aging does in fact reduce the ability to navigate back and forth between languages, and leads aging bilinguals to speak an unintended language by mistake more often than young bilinguals. When bilinguals produce such slips in spontaneous conversation, they typically produce just one word or short phrase in the unintended language. The results we report revealed that these slips likely reflect momentary lapses in memory for which language (the whole language, not a single word) they meant to produce, and failure to internally notice the mismatch between intended speech and planned speech. One reason why language switching might be better preserved in aging relative to other forms of task switching is that bilinguals can rapidly and automatically exploit even totally random cues in the environment as to which language should be spoken, and in this respect some forms of bilingualism may be easier to maintain. Specifically, bilinguals who speak pairs of languages that are very different in form, writing system, and grammar might be less likely to switch by mistake than bilinguals who speak two similar languages. Finally, while bilinguals are relatively accurate in judging which language is relatively more proficient on the whole, mistakes in judging absolute proficiency level are common, and therefore it is preferable to obtain objective proficiency measures when seeking to identify in which language a person is likely perform best. These results have scientific implications for developing an understanding of the human capacity for acquiring and maintaining language proficiency, and practical implications as they begin to identify how diverse linguistic experiences can affect academic and economic goals as well as cognitive health in aging.
