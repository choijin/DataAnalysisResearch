<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Magnetotelluric and Seismic Investigations of the Distribution of Magmatic and Hydrous Fluids Beneath Yellowstone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yellowstone volcanic system in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming has produced three massive volcanic eruptions in the past 2.1 million years, the most recent 640,000 years ago.  Smaller eruptions followed until 70,000 years ago, and today, Yellowstone's volcanic system hosts a dynamic hydrothermal system with thousands of small magnitude earthquakes occurring annually. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Oregon State University is deploying a network of sensitive magnetotelluric (MT) equipment, which record natural variations in Earth's geomagnetic and geoelectric fields, in and around Yellowstone National Park.  The team is using MT data to sense small changes in conductivity of the crust and mantle and, by combining MT and seismic measurements of the structure beneath Yellowstone, the team will infer the distribution of fluids in the magmatic system; how magma is stored at Yellowstone; and how mobile it is within the region. This has implications for future volcanic activity at Yellowstone and potential hazards such activity might pose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also fostering the career of principal investigator Ninfa Bennington, an early career female scientist, and involves field work by both graduate and undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups.  The team is creating outreach materials that will be shared with more than 40,000 people per year via interactive kiosks at the Geology Museum of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and is developing a smartphone app to share this content with an even broader audience.  In addition, they are working with Yellowstone National Park to create content detailing the field work carried out, and the results of the project, for the National Park Web site. These efforts will ensure the results from this project reach a wide audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description of Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) studies of the crust and upper mantle beneath Yellowstone (YS) have provided insight into the origin and migration of magmatic fluids into the YS crustal volcanic system. However, important questions remain concerning the generation of magmatism at YS and the migration and storage of these magmatic fluids within the crustal volcanic system.  The research team has developed three competing hypotheses describing active volcanism at YS, which include different explanations for: 1) the origin and location of magmatic fluids at upper mantle/lower crustal depths 2) the preferred path of migration for these magmatic fluids into the mid- to upper-crust, 3) the resulting distribution of the magma reservoir, 4) the composition of the magma reservoir, and 5) implications for future volcanism at YS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To evaluate these hypotheses for active volcanism at YS, the team is conducting a high-resolution MT survey in the YS region, and is combining those observations with existing data to invert for the 3D resistivity structure in the crust and upper mantle underneath YS.  The team is also separately inverting seismic data to determine the seismic velocity structure in the same region using multi-scale techniques.  The resulting models are sensitive to different properties of the subsurface (e.g., MT to presence of melt and seismic velocity to increased temperature), and therefore provide independent structural constraints.  The team will combine these independent, spatially coincident models through joint interpretations test their hypotheses about the distribution and behavior of magmatic and related fluids in the Yellowstone magmatic system.</AbstractNarration>

Smaller eruptions followed until 70,000 years ago, and today, Yellowstone's volcanic system hosts a dynamic hydrothermal system with thousands of small magnitude earthquakes occurring annually. In this project, a team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Oregon State University deployed a network of sensitive magnetotelluric (MT) equipment, which record natural variations in Earth's geomagnetic and geoelectric fields, in and around Yellowstone National Park (Figure 1). In preparation for the field work, a new sub-aerial (i.e., no-hole) method of MT station installation was developed to minimize impact on the local environment.</p> <p>The team used the MT data from their own observations and prior MT deployments to image variations in the electrical conductivity of the crust and mantle beneath Yellowstone and the surrounding region. Imaging along a pair of northeast-southwest profiles through Yellowstone (Figure 1) reveals three main conducting bodies (Figure 2). A large conducting body underlies all of Yellowstone caldera from 50 km depth to the base of the model, and extends further to the northeast, presumably representing the upper part of the hypothesized mantle plume. Two shallower and higher conductivity bodies underlie the Norris and Upper Geyser Basins and the Clear Lake hydrothermal area in the ~5 to 25 km depth range, which could be inferred to be the sources of heat at depth that is fueling these geothermal features at the surface. However, the data indicate that 2D models do not adequately represent the actual structure due to 3D variations. A preliminary 3D imaging effort did not yield satisfactory results due to significant noise in the data. This led to a collaboration with Dr. Paul Bedrosian of the USGS, who used an improved processing scheme to produce dramatically improved data (Figure 3) for subsequent inversion and imaging, which is an ongoing effort.</p> <p>A second line of research involved 3D seismic imaging (seismic tomography). This was the topic of the M.S. thesis research of UW-Madison graduate student Reagan Cronin, a female from an underrepresented group. She made use of P- and S-wave arrival times from earthquakes in the Yellowstone region from the University of Utah earthquake catalog along with differential times from pairs of earthquakes in a method known as double-difference tomography. Figure 4 shows a depth slice through the resulting P-wave velocity model, revealing a massive low-velocity zone beneath Yellowstone caldera. From her work, the estimated volume of this low-velocity zone is approximately 16,000 cubic km, with a partial melt fraction between 5 and 25 percent. Unfortunately, the S-wave data were insufficient to provide a reliable model.</p> <p>This project also fostered the career of the original Principal Investigator, Ninfa Bennington, an early career female scientist, and involved field work by both graduate and undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/04/2021<br>      Modified by: Clifford&nbsp;H&nbsp;Thurber</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1460061/1460061_10424110_1628081146224_MT_array_map--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1460061/1460061_10424110_1628081146224_MT_array_map--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1460061/1460061_10424110_1628081146224_MT_array_map--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map of Yellowstone volcanic system showing the geologic units.
