<AbstractNarration>This award funds collaborative U.S. - New Zealand research that will investigate the effects of earthquake-induced rockfalls on residential and small commercial structures.  The 2010-2011 Canterbury, New Zealand Earthquake Sequence included four major earthquakes that produced high levels of ground shaking in the Christchurch metropolitan region.  These earthquakes triggered thousands of rockfalls, which impacted several hundred buildings and resulted in both human and capital losses.  However, the impact of these rockfalls on structures varied widely.  In some instances boulders became enmeshed within a building's structural system, causing damage but preserving life-safety.  In other situations boulders fully penetrated building systems and caused structural collapse.  While a rockfall's interaction with a building system may be conceptually understood to be a function of both impact energy and structural capacity, it still remains unclear exactly how these factors govern a building's resistance to these impacts.  There is virtually no information on this in the engineering literature.  This work will be the first extensive, well-documented study of the subject and will be of immediate use to engineers in all parts of the world where rockfalls are a potential threat.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, this research seeks to acquire, process, and archive data pertaining to the impact of rockfalls on a series of common residential and commercial structures.  This study will be accomplished through geo-referenced, 3D, ground-based LIDAR scans and Structure from Motion (SfM) photographic acquisition at approximately 30 damaged buildings.  In addition to documentation at high detail, the resulting database will provide a substantial increase in the number of high-quality case histories of rockfall-structure interaction.  This work additionally aims to identify the factors that govern the resilience of a wide range of common structures through a preliminary series of coupled runout/structural impact model simulations of the rockfall process.  The project includes a range of broader impacts including most notably development of preliminary guidelines on building system resilience to rockfalls.  These guidelines will have important implications for building codes worldwide and more immediately will serve to inform local rebuilding and recovery efforts in Christchurch. The work will be done in close cooperation with researchers from GNS Science, New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>

These data provide a fundamental input for rockfall risk analysis and enable the losses from rockfall impacts to be better constrained. For example, results of this project have informed guidelines with important implications for building codes worldwide and more immediately have helped serve to inform local rebuilding and recovery efforts in Christchurch. Because dwellings in the Port Hills are typically simple timber framed structures with wooden or unreinforced masonry cladding the results are applicable to similar the majority of dwellings across New Zealand, North America, Australia, and elsewhere.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/19/2017<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Olsen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495237843626_ProjectOutcomesNZ_ScansFigure_comp--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495237843626_ProjectOutcomesNZ_ScansFigure_comp--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Examples of lidar scans of residential structures damaged by rockfalls"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495237843626_ProjectOutcomesNZ_ScansFigure_comp--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Examples of lidar scans of residential structures damaged by rockfalls"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image shows several examples of different residential structures damaged by different rockfalls that were surveyed and analyzed in this research.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Olsen, Oregon State University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Olsen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Examples of lidar scans of residential structures damaged by rockfalls</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495236853435_DataprocessinginCave--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495236853435_DataprocessinginCave--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Data processing in the GeoMAT VR system"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495236853435_DataprocessinginCave--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Data processing in the GeoMAT VR system"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Interaction with a dataset in a virtual environment to virtually extract measurements at one of the sites.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Matt O'Banion, Oregon State University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Olsen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Data processing in the GeoMAT VR system</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495237745423_RF14PotreeViewer--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495237745423_RF14PotreeViewer--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Web-based exploration of point cloud data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495237745423_RF14PotreeViewer--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Web-based exploration of point cloud data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Examples of point clouds in the open source, webGL viewer Potree for a residential structure damaged by rockfalls.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Olsen, Oregon State University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Olsen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Web-based exploration of point cloud data</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495236490920_FieldAcquisitioncomp--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495236490920_FieldAcquisitioncomp--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field Acquisition Technologies"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439883/1439883_10302020_1495236490920_FieldAcquisitioncomp--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field Acquisition Technologies"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Field acquisition using several geomatics technologies.
