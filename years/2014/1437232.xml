<AbstractNarration>Ultra-precision machines utilize single crystal diamond tools to manufacture lenses (optics) with dimensional accuracy that is on the order of a small fraction of the diameter of a human hair (approximately one ten-millionth of one meter).  New ultra-precision machine technology enables the manufacture of lenses (optics) of nearly arbitrary shape: freeform optics.  This freedom allows lens designers to think in entirely new ways.  As one of the enabling technologies for freeform optics, ultra-precision machining is poised to play a major role in an optical revolution.  A prime application area of this technology is the manufacture of lenses for thermal imaging and surveillance, thermal imaging and night vision systems (infrared imaging). This award supports fundamental research needed for the cost effective manufacture of freeform infrared (thermal) optics.  While the immediate impact area is infrared imaging, the research has broader application to many industry sectors critical to the U.S. economy including solar energy, healthcare, biomedical, aerospace, and automotive.  This research crosses the disciplines of manufacturing, mechanical engineering, materials science and optical science. The multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reports in the literature give numerous anecdotal examples of brittle materials that are machinable by diamond milling ("diamond millable") but are not generally considered "diamond turnable".  The difference may be due to the interrupted or non-steady state nature of the cutting process.  The objective of this research is to test the hypothesis that when diamond milling brittle materials, the characteristics of the surface and subsurface depends not only on the geometric parameters as in diamond turning, but also on the dynamic non-steady-state parameters such as the time-in-cut and the dynamically changing chip thickness.  Researchers from UNC Charlotte and Oklahoma State University will design and construct a simplified milling experiment with the capability to isolate and measure the response of materials in different geometries ranging from those typical to milling to high-speed nano-indentation.  The surface and subsurface characteristics will be measured with techniques ranging from atomic force microscopy to Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry.  The effort will target infrared (IR) optics manufactured in single crystal germanium and IR-transparent glass.  Research results will not only enable more productive machining of the targeted materials, but also provide a scientific basis for expanding the range of "diamond millable" brittle materials for optical and other applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research objective of this study was to investigate the machining of infrared transparent materials, for example, germanium, using single crystal diamond tools.   This study was an intense collaboration of UNC Charlotte, Oklahoma State University and Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The target application area for this collaborative research is freeform infrared (IR) optics which are used for thermal imaging, surveillance, night vision, medical imaging, and range finders for consumer cameras.   The intellectual merit of the work was to develop a fundamental understanding of the cutting process in terms of the forces generated and the nature of the resulting surface and subsurface.  Major findings include the magnitudes of the cutting forces over a broad range of cutting velocities, material removal rates (e.g., productivity), crystal orientations, and resulting surface roughnesses and subsurface damage to the single crystal material.  From a fundamental science perspective, an understanding of the practical process of machining these IR materials has led to new insights into basic material behavior.  Also, to our knowledge, this study has generated the largest data set for efficiently manufacturing IR optics.   The broader impacts of this work include decreased cost for IR optics in a $10B industry.  These results have the potential of translating to other industries such as visible optics and electro-optics.  The project has resulted in the development of human resources including the training of three PhD students and one post-doctoral researcher.   The work has also had an impact on physical resources that form infrastructure.  Because of the scientific understanding of and the experience with germanium machining generated by this NSF funded work, numerous companies have approached UNC Charlotte to manufacture (under separate contract) complex optics in germanium. This work has led, in part, to the purchase of a state-of-the-art diamond turning machine for freeform optics generation. This represents the only installation of such a machine in a US university laboratory.  The study has also contributed to impacts on society.  Specifically, the ability to create advanced IR optics in germanium may lead to new applications which society needs, e.g., thermal scanners for rapidly and accurately measuring human body temperature to assess illness.
