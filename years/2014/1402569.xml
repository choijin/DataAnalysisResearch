<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Free Probability and the Large N Limit IV" that will be held March 25-29, 2014, on the campus of the University of California-Berkeley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the fourth in a series of workshops that have focused on the subject of free probability, an important area closely tied to the theory of operator algebras. The meeting will bring together and foster collaborations amongst researchers from the following fields: free probability; operator algebras; random matrix theory; probability theory; subfactor theory; combinatorics. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
