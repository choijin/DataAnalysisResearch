<AbstractNarration>The project will provide financial support for NSF CAREER Awardees in Photonics to participate in a workshop to be held in San Jose, CA on June 13, 2014. The goal of the workshop is to bring together many recent CAREER Award winners supported by the ECCS division to discuss their progress in photonics and to promote development of their research careers. The workshop will be co-located with the Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO) 2014 meeting being held in San Jose, CA during June 8-13, 2014. CLEO serves as the premier international forum for scientific and technical optics, uniting the fields of lasers and opto-electronics by bringing together all aspects of laser technology, from basic research to industry applications. The main objective goal of the Workshop is to assist NSF CAREER Awardees in photonics to improve their experience as junior faculty members who are establishing their academic careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Workshop, recent NSF CAREER Awardees will present their research activities in photonics. Technical discussions will span a broad range of areas of photonics research, from materials to devices, including integrated photonics, non-linear optics, microstructure and specialty fibers, optical sensors, optical manipulators, metamaterials, and Mid IR photonics. The meeting will facilitate an open technical exchange to establish new collaborations, determine future research strategies and infrastructure needs as well as opportunities to pursue larger award opportunities, including NSF Engineering Research Centers. In addition, the workshop is expected to provide a special venue for NSF CAREER Awardees to interact with leaders from both academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  This award supported a workshop for CAREER Awardees in Photonics to address the following questions:  Is a budget of $400,000 over five years sufficient to meet fundable research objectives and the expectations of typical engineering departments and/or colleges? What nonfinancial support mechanisms can NSF provide to young faculty before and after receiving the CAREER Award to better promote success? What are the challenges of nontraditional candidates to receiving the CAREER Award and how can they be addressed? Are there merits to other junior faculty awards that can be translated to the NSF CAREER? What are the coming Grand Challenges for Photonics?   At the workshop, the following was determined:  The previous award of $400,000 is simply not enough to enable a PI to pursue competitive research in the field of photonics.  The impressive presentations from the workshop were based on research conducted by multiple graduate students supplemented with significant equipment and materials expenses, thus indicating that other awards were supporting the research.  Even at a level of $500,000, junior faculty must win other financial awards to assemble competitive research progress.   The 5-year duration has tremendous benefits.   The flexibility of the CAREER award has tremendous benefits.   Supplements are very important.   Other early career awards tend to be larger than the NSF CAREER.  The NSF CAREER is more transparent than other programs.  Potential applicants can serve on NSF panels before they submit a CAREER proposal.  They can complete workshops at their universities to learn how to write a CAREER.   The NSF CAREER award does not discriminate based on the prestige or size of university (many other awards do).   Many new faculty are not aware of the competitive level of the NSF CAREER award, especially in the area of photonics, and thus may not dedicate the required level of effort. Grand challenges were identified.   Broader impacts:  The detailed report of this workshop is expected to provide NSF program managers with a better understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities of the NSF CAREER award.  In addition, the identified grand challenges may influence the direction of future NSF awards.  Thus, the outcomes of the workshop are expected to have a significant impact on NSF's role in shaping and improving the state of photonics research in the future.
