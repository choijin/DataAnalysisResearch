<AbstractNarration>Portable wireless devices sold around the world number in the billions, and&lt;br/&gt;they are used daily because of their ability to provide connectivity by&lt;br/&gt;integrating processing power, touch screens, cameras, and motion sensors&lt;br/&gt;with multiple radios, many of which can run simultaneously.  Portable&lt;br/&gt;wireless devices used in close proximity to the human body have transmitter&lt;br/&gt;power constraints that are dictated largely by regulatory limits on a form&lt;br/&gt;of electromagnetic exposure called ``specific absorption rate'' (SAR).&lt;br/&gt;SAR, measured in Watts per kilogram, is a measure of the rate of&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic energy absorption by the body.  Many portable wireless&lt;br/&gt;devices sold today operate near the accepted human SAR limit.  This&lt;br/&gt;research examines how multiple transmitters on a portable wireless device&lt;br/&gt;can be modeled, analyzed, and used while subject to a SAR constraint.  The&lt;br/&gt;work looks at how to model the constraint, and how to realize the&lt;br/&gt;reliability and high data-rate advantages of multiple antennas subject to&lt;br/&gt;the constraint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because portable devices are generally small, transmitters will be&lt;br/&gt;physically close to one another and couple electromagnetically.  Hence, the&lt;br/&gt;research requires a blended effort in three distinct areas: (i)&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetics and near-field exposure modeling with multiple&lt;br/&gt;transmitters, (ii) wireless communication system far-field&lt;br/&gt;information-theoretic performance evaluation with a near-field SAR&lt;br/&gt;constraint, (iii) the design of SAR codes for optimum performance.  Code&lt;br/&gt;performance will be determined by simulation and by laboratory evaluation&lt;br/&gt;with microwave equipment for near-field SAR and far-field error-rate&lt;br/&gt;measurements.</AbstractNarration>
