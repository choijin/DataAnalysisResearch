<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this project will address the established and growing national need to improve quantity and increase quality of the high school teaching workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Augustana College in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, will work closely with partner institutions to build an infrastructure to: (i) recruit and educate students to become highly qualified STEM high school teachers, especially for high-needs schools and (ii) provide several levels of support for future and current STEM teachers. A particular focus will be to educate and support Native American students to become STEM teachers. The Project Team from Augustana College will work closely with personnel from partner institutions, which include tribal colleges Sisseton Wahpeton College and Sinte Gleska University as well as Iowa Lakes Community College to reach out to high-needs high schools in the Sioux Falls Public Schools and surrounding rural and remote districts to provide special opportunities for students from all of these institutions to become STEM teachers and then to place these teachers in high-needs areas. The process will include building capacity to provide educational, mentoring, and financial support for future STEM teachers and networking opportunities for current and future teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will take a comprehensive approach to restructure the STEM secondary education program at Augustana College to implement initiatives that feature two main components: (1) the recruitment and support of a diverse pool of talented high school and community college students with an interest in becoming high school science and mathematics teachers and (2) the development and inclusion of an innovative interdisciplinary STEM major that will allow any graduate to teach more competently across the STEM disciplines. The support component will include longitudinal mentorship and financial support throughout college training and into the professional classroom, and will also include the creation of STEM Teachers' Network to serve as a mentorship and professional development entity for both current and future teachers. The interdisciplinary program will include significant coursework spanning the STEM fields of biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics as well as a STEM disciplinary emphasis area in one of these fields. A critical aspect of student academic training in this program will be the inclusion of cultural competence for teachers to enhance a teacher's ability to navigate a diverse cultural landscape with empathy and introspection, and to evaluate and interpret cultural encounters with students, to lead to a better understanding of both verbal and non-verbal communication in a learning context. As part of this Robert Noyce Capacity Building project, the Project Team will begin the process of addressing data needs and conducting research on how cultural competency training for pre-service STEM teachers influence teaching and learning outcomes in the high school classroom, especially for rural areas and areas with diverse populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Augustana faculty members from the natural sciences and education designed the curriculum for a new STEM Composite Major curriculum, as the outcome of a year-long study of the science and math secondary teacher preparation program at Augustana University.  Students declaring the new major select two of four tracks (biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics), completing coursework in both disciplines as well as all courses required for teacher certification.  Students who elect the STEM Composite Major will gain a broad preparation in two STEM disciplines.  While the composite major, of necessity, sacrifices some depth in favor greater breadth of coursework, new teachers completing the composite major will be better equipped respond to needs of their future employers, as documented in the survey described below to teach classes in two fields.  The curriculum has been vetted by the University?s Curriculum Council, approved by the faculty, and accepted by the SD DOE for teacher candidates in the state.    To obtain one measure of the curriculum?s effectiveness, current students who have completed coursework required for the mathematics, biology, and physics tracks of the major have taken the PRAXIS exam, which is required in the state for teacher certification.  Their results indicate that the courses in the STEM Composite curriculum do sufficiently prepare students to pass the PRAXIS exams in biology and physics; results on the mathematics track are inconclusive.  Three students have declared the STEM Composite major during the first semester of availability (Fall 2016), including one journalism major, demonstrating the impact of the new major beyond the fields of education and the natural sciences.  A new course, Navigating a Diverse Society for Equity in STEM, was developed alongside the STEM Composite major, and will be taught during fall semesters of even years beginning in 2018. The course will be required for all students who declare the STEM Composite major. As space allows, the course will be available to other students on our campus, and recommended for education majors in particular.  The curriculum of the new course is designed with the goal of preparing new teachers to serve in high-need schools.  Augustana partnered with the South Dakota Department of Education (SD DOE) to survey middle and high school science and math teachers to identify factors, such as certification preparation, post-secondary education, professional development, and school district support, that help or hinder teachers in delivering science and math education.  Major conclusions drawn from the data include (1) even in the state?s largest districts, 20% of teachers report that they are called upon to teach at least one course outside of their field of certification; in smaller districts, this figure is more than 55%; (2) while most teachers are participating in professional development, a significant proportion report that little of the professional development is specific to STEM content areas; survey respondents indicated the desire for more professional development opportunities that focus specifically on mathematics and science.  The Augustana Noyce team designed and piloted an Induction Program for new teachers. In the fall of 2016, a small cohort of teachers in South Dakota was recruited to participate in the pilot. Lessons learned in the pilot program will inform the structure of future programs. Participants in the pilot of the Induction Program received mentoring from experienced teachers in their field.  In addition, one participating teacher and two mentors had the opportunity to attend the annual meeting of the South Dakota Council of Teachers of Mathematics and Science Teachers? Association in February of 2017.  Twelve Augustana graduates received startup funding support as they entered the teaching profession, to fund professional development or purchase classroom supplies.  Ten Augustana students received support to take the PRAXIS exam in fulfillment of licensure requirements in South Dakota.  The number of Secondary Education Majors planning to teach in the STEM disciplines has increased over the grant period. The enrollment figures are shown in the table below.
