<AbstractNarration>Building isolation systems placed between foundation and the structure are able to reduce shaking of the buildings and mitigate serious damage in earthquakes. However, recent earthquakes and large scale tests have shown that there is a large amount of damage to the interior of buildings (mechanical system, ceiling tiles etc.) and to the critical equipment in buildings (hospital and electrical equipment, telecommunication items etc.) leading to inoperability of buildings and high economic losses. These damages to the interior are primarily caused by vertical shaking of the ground in earthquakes. This project will pursue research in identification of the level of vertical shaking in buildings in earthquake and development of isolator that reduces the shaking to acceptable level. The proposed system will stack traditional isolation bearings for protection from horizontal shaking and new devices for protection from vertical shaking. The new device combines a weight bearing liquid spring and controllable damper into a single package. These isolators will have potential of use in other engineered systems where vibrations are critical. The researchers will recruit participation of underrepresented groups in the research and education efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, basic science will be advanced through an analytical study to understand the fundamental dynamics of three-dimensional isolation of rigid bodies and flexible structures, subjected to earthquakes.  Optimal properties of an effective three-dimensional isolation system will be determined. The proposed vertical isolation system uses liquid spring technology that is robust, ideal for supporting large loads and operating in harsh conditions. The novelty of the proposed system is combining the liquid spring stiffness and the controllable damping characteristics into a single, sustainable device for civil infrastructure application. The proposed system is fail-safe, such that even under power or control system failures optimal damping is retained in the passive mode since the spring action is passive. A one quarter scale device will be designed, built, and characterized in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Seismic isolation systems are known to be effective to protect building structures from the damaging effects of earthquake ground shaking. Seismically-isolated buildings are constructed on flexible isolators (rubber or friction bearings) that can &ldquo;isolate&rdquo; the building from the ground acceleration. High profile examples of seismically-isolated buildings include Stanford University Medical Center (Palo Alto, CA), Loma Linda University Medical Center (San Bernadino, CA), Cathedral of our Lady of the Angels (Los Angeles, CA), and Apple Campus 2 (Cupertino, CA) &ndash; all new buildings; and Los Angeles City Hall (Los Angeles, CA) and Utah State Capitol (Salt Lake City, UT), both seismic retrofits. However, conventional seismic isolation only protects the building from horizontal shaking. Recent large scale shake table testing of isolated buildings has shown that the building nonstructural systems (e.g. interior partition walls, suspended ceiling systems, and piping) and sensitive equipment can still be significantly damaged by vertical ground shaking. Thus, a worthy goal is to expand the seismic isolation concept to protect the building from combined ground shaking in both horizontal and vertical directions, or 3-dimensional (3D) shaking.</p> <p>One objective of this project was to develop fundamental understanding of how a building with devices for both horizontal and vertical isolation will respond under 3D ground shaking. This knowledge could be used to design physical devices for vertical or 3D isolation. Prior to this project, other researchers had explored the development of devices for vertical isolation, such as air springs. In some cases, the full system exhibited problems with rocking and bouncing, and required extensive rocking suppression systems. In this project, a simplified rigid block on multi-dimensional spring model was developed to study the system response. An extensive parameter study was performed to explore how the isolator parameters affect the system response. The study showed that the most effective approach is to design the vertical isolation devices for comparatively less flexibility than the traditional horizontal isolation devices. Both types of devices should provide adequate damping to dissipate energy to slow the vibration. With this approach, problems with rocking and bouncing are avoided. In addition, the computer modeling was extended to a realistic flexible frame building model, and the design approach was shown to be sufficient to suppress vertical vibration of the building floor system to a level that was previously shown to prevent the nonstructural system damage.</p> <p>A second objective of this project was to design, build and test a prototype device for vertical isolation. The device uniquely combines a bilinear liquid spring and magnetorheological (MR) damper (BLS-CMRD) into a single device. For this approach, 3D isolation would be provided by stacking traditional isolation bearings that protect against horizontal ground shaking on top of the BLS-CMRD (Figure 1). The device was designed with two different fluid-filled chambers on top and bottom that activated different stiffnesses as the shaft moved in different directions (Figure 2). The tension stiffness was designed to be 4 times the compression stiffness for an additional safeguard against system overturning, which is likely to be preceded by one or more devices being subjected to significant tension. The bottom chamber was filled with silicone oil to provide passive damping. The top chamber, filled with MR fluid, was split into two sub-chambers with a small flow gap in between that is surrounded by electromagnetic coils. When the MR fluid flows between the two sub-chambers, the electromagnetic current, as quantified by Amperes (A), can be varied to control the amount of damping in the system. In addition, the device was designed to transmit a transverse force perpendicular to the axial shaft of the device.</p> <p>A one-quarter scale BLS-CMRD was designed, fabricated, and tested in UNR&rsquo;s Large Scale Structures Laboratory (Figures 3 and 4). The device was subjected to controlled cyclic loading at different stroke amplitudes, frequencies, currents, and levels of transverse force, as well as representative earthquake loading histories. Compared to the full hysteretic (force-displacement) loops anticipated in design, the experimental loops exhibited some clipping that limited the amount of energy dissipation provided (Figure 5). This was believed to be a result of entrapped air, and could be remedied by alterations to the design. Further design modifications would be required to make a more compact and economical device that would be suitable for practical application.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2018<br>      Modified by: Keri&nbsp;L&nbsp;Ryan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437003/1437003_10318797_1545874683964_3DIsolationConcept--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437003/1437003_10318797_1545874683964_3DIsolationConcept--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1. 3D Isolation Concept"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437003/1437003_10318797_1545874683964_3DIsolationConcept--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1. 3D Isolation Concept"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Concept of 3D isolation by stacking traditional isolation bearings on top of BLS-CMRD.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sevki Cesmeci</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Keri&nbsp;L&nbsp;Ryan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1. 3D Isolation Concept</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437003/1437003_10318797_1546020457658_DeviceDrawing--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437003/1437003_10318797_1546020457658_DeviceDrawing--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2.
