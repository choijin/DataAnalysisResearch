<AbstractNarration>This week-long symposium is designed to help develop a long-term, collegial peer network of young polar researchers (those within 5 years of receiving their doctorates) who would benefit from mentoring and other interactions with established polar scholars through a common experience at a symposium.  Participants also will receive an introduction to communication, team-building and leadership skills, and elements of interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;The organizers expect to develop a core cadre of approximately 30 young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed symposium would build upon, and also act as a follow-on to, a similar symposium organized by the PI?s during the International Polar Year, the "IPY: Next Generation Polar Research (IPY NGPR) Symposium". &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goals of the 2015 NGPR Leadership Symposium were to provide a cohort of early career researchers with a collegial peer network and with an introduction to the skills necessary for engagement in planning large-scale community initiatives such as a future International Polar Year (IPY). The first NGPR symposium was held in early 2008 and was open to graduate students and new PhDs who conducted polar research during the 2007/08 IPY. The 2015 symposium built on this momentum and focused on PhD graduates who completed their degree between Jan. 1, 2009 and Oct. 31, 2014, to build a sense of history, community and purpose towards a future IPY. Applications were welcome from graduates conducting polar research in any field of science or engineering. While the focus was on U.S. research, citizens of all countries were eligible. Applicants were required to submit their Ph.D. dissertation abstract; 2-page resume; statement of their goals for polar research and community engagement; and two letters of recommendation.&nbsp; A total of 92 applications were received and selection was based on research excellence and community leadership potential. Forty invitations were extended and 35 participated including five from outside the U.S. Participant backgrounds included expertise in the physical and geosciences (24), biosciences (6), social sciences (3) and engineering (2); this distribution was representative of the number of applications in each area.

The Symposium also featured several breakout sessions, where small groups of participants and mentors discussed challenges and priorities related to disciplinary and interdisciplinary polar research, jobs, early career professional development and community activities.
