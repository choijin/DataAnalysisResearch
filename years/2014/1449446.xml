<AbstractNarration>Organizations in the U.S. and Canada collaborate extensively in collecting and sharing various types of cyberdata for purposes of border security, environmental management, economic production, health protection, and other shared goals. Organizations of all major types--governmental, private-sector, and non-profit (or NGO)--have responsibilities that involve major coordination with cross-border network partners.  Recent revelations about privacy breaches have led to concerns on both sides of the border about cyberdata privacy and security. The extant turmoil over cross-border cyberdata privacy makes this project a fit with the timeliness key element of the RAPID program. This research aims to examine how Canadian and U.S. workers in all major types of cross-border organizations handle cyberdata in their efforts to achieve both cyberdata privacy and security, and important inter-organizational (especially cross-border) goals. The study provides information about data privacy and security strategies useful to organizations, governments, and individuals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study have broad implications for theory and research, not just for knowledge of influences on cyber data privacy, but also for the broader national- and organizational culture, identity, and values lines of scholarship. On the practical side, the findings have bearing on education, policy-decision making, and training about cybersecurity practices and privacy protections at the cross-national, national, and organizational levels. The results may provide security, border-management, and border-spanning organizations with information and ideas relevant to creating technologies and systems that successfully integrate cyber-data collection and sharing by organizations, with privacy concerns and rights of individuals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SBE: Rapid: Cybersecurity at the Canada-U.S. Border   Annual Project Report  This project focuses on the cybersecurity behaviors of organizational insiders and the factors that promote security-enhancing practices and actions among them.  Substantial progress was made on the project.  A psychometric measurement instrument was developed, pilot-tested, and mounted on-line (via Qualtrecs); that instrument assesses individual-, team-, and organizational-level constructs that may influence behaviors by insiders that either protects or puts at risk critical organizational (including customer) cybersecurity.  The risk in question is that of outside parties either gaining unauthorized access to cyberdata; or beimg able to comprise the function of cyber systems critical to an organizationÃ†s ability to function.  Using our on-line measure, data were collected from 35 employees of a variety of border-spanning organizations.     Problems with the project also occurred, however.  First, due to a delay by the Portland State University Sponsored Programs Office in processing the award, the project started later than expected.  The PSU SPO did not have the grant funds account set up until the end of September 2014.  PSU also used a backchannel email exchange between the PSU SPO and Psychology Department Head to increase, after the grant budget was completed and submitted, the cost of a course release for the P.I.      Next, during the single grant year initially requested for the project, a Portland State University server that hosted the instructions and informed consent for the project was hacked.  The research team for the current project was not informed of this problem until we discovered it ourselves and the P.I. reported it to the Portland State University Information Technology office.  That cybersecurity breach (and associated shoddy reporting practices) brought data collection to a halt while we re-did text that had been altered (changed into Latin) to allow our data collection to resume.  The measurement instrument has now been moved to the P.I.Ã†s new institutional setting (the University of Arizona) and itÃ†s higher-quality security and IT services, and data collection is starting again.     Finally, when the P.I.Ã†s computer began having trackpad problems that sometimes resulted in files being unintentionally deleted, PSU told the P.I. that his (university-provided) computer was not eligible for replacement until the next academic year.  Altogether, the problems produced by ineffective (for, at least, actually supporting scholarship) systems at PSU, along the relocation of the P.I.to the University of Arizona (caused, in large part, by the inept systems at PSU) has caused delays in data collection such that I am requesting a no-cost extension of another academic year, during which the project will be completed.     A major scholarly and outreach activity during the single grant year of the project was a presentation by the P.I. about the project theory and importance at the Research in Securing Cyberdata (SERENE-RISC) annual meeting in Ottawa, Canada.  SERENE-RISC is organized by Professor Benoit Dupont of the University of Montreal with funding from the Canadian federal government.  Leading cybersecurity researchers and practitioners (e.g., representatives from cybersecurity providers such as FireEye and Kasperski; employees of Canadian, EU, and US government agencies involved in cybersecurity) from around the world attend the SERENE-RISC meeting.  The P.I.Ã†s presentation to them yielded substantial positive feedback about the importance of the focal project issue (i.e., insider cybersecurity-related behaviors), about the relative lack of attention to insider risks, and about the specific constructs being investigated in the research study.  Useful contacts were made that have aided data collection, as well as deepened the P.I.Ã†s understanding of issues and potential solutions.  The P.I. also did a presentation about insider risk...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
