<AbstractNarration>This award will support a three-year run of the Ohio River Analysis Meeting that is hosted by (in alternate years) the University of Kentucky and the University of Cincinnati; the first conference in this sequence will run in March of 2014 at the University of Kentucky. In 2015 the conference will run at the University of Cincinnati and in 2016 it returns to the University of Kentucky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual conference is centered on the recent developments in the field of Analysis, and in particular in the subfields of partial differential equations and mathematical physics. Through plenary lectures the conference will provide an opportunity for regional mathematicians, postdocs, and graduate students to attend state-of-the-art talks and to confer with leading researchers in the field of Analysis.  Through contributed talks the meeting will provide a venue for young mathematicians to present their results to a distinguished audience.  An overarching goal is to foster cooperation and collaboration amongst analysis researchers in the Ohio Valley region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The centerpiece of this project was to present the Fifth Ohio River Analysis Meeting, an annual mathematics conference specializing in the areas of Analysis and Partial Differential Equations.  The conference is an annual event joinly organized by mathematics faculty at the University of Cincinnati and the University of Kentucky.  The Fifth Ohio River Analysis Meeting took place in Cincinnati, Ohio, on February 28-March 1, 2015.  The conference objectives are: to maintain strong collaboration between the Analysis and Differential Equations working groups at both institutions, to provide a regional forum where faculty, students, and recent graduates can present their research, and to attract prominent scholars to give invited lectures.  It is a point of emphasis to seek out and encourage participation at all levels by women and minorities underrepresented in mathematics.  This includes the invited keynote lectures, contributed papers, and students attending the conference to learn more about the subject.  The Fifth Ohio River Analysis Meeting attracted 80 participants from the University of Cincinnati, the University of Kentucky, and 21 other institutions around the United States. Out of this total, 50 of the participants were current graduate or undergraduate students. They were not only the largest single group in attendence but also the most active, as 15 students gave presentations on their original research.  Recent graduates (with a degree in the past three years) were also very active at the conference.  These two groups of junior participants together combined to contribute two thirds of the research talks in the scientific program.  Participation by women ranged between 15-25%, whether one considers overall numbers of participants, numbers of research presentations, or invited keynote speakers.  The conference covered a broad array of topics within the general subject areas of Analysis and Differential Equations.  Research presentations touched upon Mathematical Physics, Calculus of Variations, Geometric Analysis, Integral Operators, and Complex Function Theory, among other subjects.  The organizers believe that gathering together experts in all these related fields highlights the connections between them and promotes collaboration on problems of common interest.  A small portion of funds supported participants traveling to the Fourth Ohio River Analysis Meeting, which was held in Lexington, KY on March 12-13, 2016.
