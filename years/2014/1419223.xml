<AbstractNarration>The project will examine how the area of Colorado burned in the 2012 High Park Fire was affected by the September 2013 storms that caused rainfall with estimated recurrence intervals of 200 to 1000+ years.  The goals of the project are to 1) characterize the post-flood landscape in two study watersheds burned in the High Park Fire, 2) characterize the magnitude of the precipitation and resulting peak discharge in the study watersheds, 3) quantify patterns of erosion and deposition resulting from the flood in the study watersheds at a variety of scales, and 4) relate these patterns of topographic change to patterns of flood hydraulic forces.  The project will utilize  LiDAR datasets collected prior to and after the September 2013 event, and will focus on well-instrumented catchments in the burned area.  Ground-based validation of the LiDAR-based observations is critical, and it is necessary to make field measurements before spring storms overprint or remove evidence of the rare September event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wildfires and subsequent large rainfall events can exact a major one-two punch to landscape evolution and to inhabitants of those landscapes.  This project aims to inform public understanding of the effects of fire and the post-fire storm on the landscape and on regional water resources. The work will be communicated to the community through presentations at regional events and seminars. In addition, this project will provide a graduate student with research and teaching experience. The student and PI will lead field trips to the study sites for undergraduate and graduate civil engineering classes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Between September 9th and 15th 2013, the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies experienced unusually persistent and widespread precipitation leading to all-time record or near-record rainfall totals across the region. This rainfall event occurred over the area burned by the 2012 High Park Fire, the third-largest wildfire in ColoradoÃ†s recorded history. Wildfires can dramatically change the hydrologic response of a watershed, leading to greatly increased peak flows and erosion rates for a given storm, and in Colorado the driving precipitation is typically short-duration, high-intensity rainfall associated with convective summer thunderstorms. The 9-15 September 2013 event, however, was an unusually long-duration, stratiform precipitation event, which provided an opportunity to contrast the hydrologic and geomorphic response of burned areas to different hydrological forcings.   Since the fire, our study site, the Skin Gulch watershed, has experienced two floods that resulted in very dramatic channel changes: the September 2013 storm, which lasted 6 days and rained 220-240 mm over the watershed with maximum 15-minute intensity of 25-32 mm/h, and a more typical summer thunderstorm in July 2012, which lasted a few hours and was geographically localized over a portion of the watershed that had burned at high severity where it dropped 45 mm of rain at a maximum 15-minute intensity of about 50 mm/h. We characterized the peak discharge of each of these floods using techniques ranging from simple calculations at individual cross-sections to two-dimensional hydraulic modeling of entire stream reaches. The primary outcomes from these calculations were that 1) despite its much larger storm total precipitation, the peak discharge for the 2013 storm was considerably lower than that of the 2012 storm; 2) both events rank among the highest rainfall-runoff floods per unit area ever recorded in the continental United States; 3) both peak discharge and event duration are important contributors to channel change during geomorphically-effective floods; 4) the coincidence of a recent, high severity burn with locally intense rainfall can produce truly exceptional hydrologic response and geomorphic changes; and 5) indirect estimates of flood magnitudes are subject to uncertainty associated with channel changes during the event, but this uncertainty is often overlooked and can be impossible to quantify.
