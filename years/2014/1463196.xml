<AbstractNarration>Sharing research data, essential to all science, is particularly challenging to Linguistics and the Language Sciences. How do children acquire language, any possible language or multiple languages, how does language acquisition and/or loss relate to brain development or degeneration?  Fundamental questions such as these require consulting large and diverse sets of language data from many sources across different languages and situations and many different learners.  Answering crucial questions such as these is essential to many social issues, such as those involving expanding multilingual populations in the US and across the world.  However, language data currently exist in many different formats, in many independent heterogeneous databases with divergent annotation schemes, making its access by collaborating researchers or other users across different languages, disciplines or fields such as medicine or education, very difficult.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to make large and diverse sets of language data accessible and interpretable, many conceptual and technical challenges must be met. This project convenes a workshop at the Linguistic Society of America Summer Institute consisting of an international set of scholars who are concerned with these challenges and working to confront them.  The planned workshop will integrate European scholars from the Open Linguistics Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation, with North and South American scholars, exploiting advances that have been made in Europe on the transformation of language resources into open (accessible to all) linked (relating each data item to others) data. It will address issues including development of computationally feasible annotation schemes, web interfaces, linkage technicalities, and principles of collaboration and sustainability. Scholars representing each of these areas will be represented. Researchers collaborating on the study of bilingualism and multilingualism in children will provide a test case, instantiating linked data needs.  Graduate students will be integrated.  Expected results include draft of a community-shared vision for the design, implementation, and sustainability of an infrastructure to make large amounts of data easier to share, available to students and researchers across countries and disciplines, and which can serve as a model for other areas of science. A collection of proceedings will be made available through the web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Workshop: Development of Linguistic Linked Open Data Resources for Collaborative Data Intensive Research in the Language Sciences&#894; University of Chicago, July 2015 (NSF 1463196)     OUTCOME:   The purpose of this project was to cultivate a multidisciplinary international community which could address the promises of a Linked Open Data dimension in Linguistics (LLOD) and the Language Sciences and to begin to discuss the conceptual and technical challenges that are necessary for the attainment of LLOD in the area of language acquisition. To that end, (i) we convened a workshop that integrated an already well developed LLOD community in Europe with scholars of the US and South America and (ii) we have now finished a book that represents the conclusions of the workshop and of provides a foundation for the development of LLOD in the language sciences.     HIGHLIGHTS OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS:  &middot;      We conducted a LLOD focused workshop at the 2015 Linguistic Society of America (LSA) Linguistic Summer Institute, on July 25-26, 2015 at the University of Chicago. The LSA Institute had the theme "Linguistic Theory in a World of Big Data". This workshop included linguists and developmental psychologist working on multilingual acquisition and or crosslinguistic data, researchers working on the generation and enhancement of the (LLOD) cloud, computer engineers with experience in interoperability problems, and computational scientists with expertise in the development of computational models of language and linguistic annotations, as well as experts in the area of standardization. &middot;      Based on prior NSF project results, we began to explore integration of new cybertool technology in the area of language acquisition with the goal of achieving a Linked Open Data framework. &middot;      We have now finished and submitted an Open Access edited volume to MIT Press representing the contributions and conclusions of the workshop.      BACKGROUND:  As the LSA Institute's call for workshop proposals articulated, there is "a growing interest within the field of linguistics to test theory with increasingly larger data sets, such as data from extensive linguistic fieldwork and documentation, data from crowd-sourcing over the web, and corpus data from archival recordings and/or written sources". The need to integrate large and diverse data sets is highlighted in the areas of multilingual acquisition and use which are essentially interdisciplinary. This challenge is accentuated because data in these fields range from naturalistic to experimental, they have different formats (audio, video, transcript form), and are organized by different metadata standards, they are annotated in numerous ways, and frequently involve comparisons across various cultures and languages. Deriving data from any one language is inherently complex and once data are analyzed and reused, the size of resulting databases grows exponentially. Each analysis provides a new markup which itself becomes data. The need to manage and use all these data sources leads researchers in the field to an interest in Linguistics Linked Open Data, that is, data that is accessible to users, created through open software and that is linked to other pieces of data inside a data source and across different data sources.     IMPACT:  The community we assembled in this workshop can advance the power of scholars to pursue the major research questions of the language sciences that require research collaboration, on the basis of shared, diverse, data from multiple languages. The LLOD agenda promises to empower research in the language sciences by creating access to large diverse language datasets so that they can grow, become usable and reusable by countless scholars across the language sciences, and by providing an infrastructure for research collaborations on the basis of shared data.   The LOD vision for linguistics assumes that data will be available electronically, increasingly crosslinked by means of RDF mechanisms (such as identifying web resources, people, institutions, etc. by means of suitable URI) and that it would be preserved and updated continuously. Clearly, this would reduce information redundancy, heterogeneity and disconnection, allowing better searching and browsing on the web.     BENEFITS:  Our workshop established basic communication and mutual understanding across researchers from different areas who use different terms often to refer to the same concepts and ideas, and who have different practices. The community involved in this workshop took the first basic steps of discovering each other's achievements and challenges, so that they can start working towards a paradigm for data management and sharing which can be generalized to other scientific fields. The concrete example of research in multilingual acquisition is both socially significant and central in cognitive science today.   The workshop itself united scholars from Europe, North and South America to discuss new possibilities for large scale research, teaching, and mentoring in areas related to the language sciences through the future creation of LLOD resources. The volume (in press) we are now publishing on the basis of the original workshop and the subsequent papers developed by workshop participants will provide wide access to workshop results.
