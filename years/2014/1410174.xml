<AbstractNarration>This award will fund a numerical study of circumbinary planets (those which orbit two stars instead of one) in order to provide a strong dynamical framework for understanding planet formation and interpreting data from ongoing and upcoming exoplanet surveys.  Roughly half the stars in the Galaxy are in binaries, and understanding how the planetary masses and orbits are different in these systems is essential to both a full theory of planetary formation and undestanding sites of habitability.  The PI and her team will train and mentor graduate and undergraduate students in research with a focus on computational astrophysics.  She will also provide educational resources to the University of Arizona Astronomy camp program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will study dynamical packing in multi-planet systems for a range of binary configurations, and will also carry out hydrodynamic simulations investigating planet-disk interaction in circumbinary systems.  They will develop tools to evaluate the role of multi-body resonances in setting stability timescales, implement new thermodynamic modules in FARGO, and predict transit signals that can be used to characterize circumbinary transit timing variations (TTVs).  They will use the model transit signals to predict the kinds of planetary systems which will be observable by future surveys.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant funded research into the origins of planets in binary star systems. In particular, the project was aimed at a special type of binaries that have an outsize impact on astronomy and even life on Earth. Our research was focused primarily on very close binaries, those that might ultimately interact and generate many heavy elements crucial to life on Earth. By studying the origins of planets in these systems, we both characterize unique planetary systems and learn about the formation of the host binaries. The noteworthy intellectual merits of our work are:<br /><br />1) Our work revealed that evolution of the orbits of planets in binaries should proceed in a mostly similar fashion as around single star systems. The notable exception is that planets in binary systems undergo far fewer collisions with other planets and the host star than their single-star counterparts. This could affect how polluted a star becomes with extra heavy elements, as well as the expected number of free floating planets in the galaxy.
