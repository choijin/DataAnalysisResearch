<AbstractNarration>The advance in technology enables researchers to investigate a dozen or more drugs simultaneously in a single experiment in order to identify novel drug combinations with high efficacy and low toxicity. This raises substantial new challenges to experimenters and statisticians, because the number of drug combinations grows exponentially as the number of drugs increases.  Researchers rely more than ever on large efficient experimental designs in order to successfully and efficiently identify a few important drugs and drug interactions among millions or billions possible drug combinations. However, few good designs and results are available in the literature. To address the growing needs from such large-scale drug combination experiments, this project aims at developing new methodology and constructing efficient factorial and composite designs.  This project will help shorten investigation time and reduce experimental cost tremendously in a wide variety of scientific researches. The applications to drug combination experiments will have an immediate impact on discovering novel treatments for various common diseases and hence help advance the national health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fractional factorial designs are cost-effective for screening important factors from a large pool of potential variables;  composite designs are indispensable for sequential experimentation, as well as for building response surface models. A systematic method is proposed for constructing multi-level nonregular fractional factorial designs using linear and quadratic functions.  A general theory is developed for obtaining important design properties such as resolution and aberration.  New tools are introduced for studying design structure under level permutations for quantitative factors.  Two classes of composite designs are introduced and studied thoroughly.  The first class consists of a two-level and a three-level factorial design; the second consists of a two-level factorial and a three-level definitive screening design.  These composite designs have many desirable features and are more effective than existing composite designs for factor screening and response surface modeling, especially for large-scale experiments.</AbstractNarration>

Several classes of maximin distance Latin hypercube designs are constructed via good lattice points and Latin squares for computer experiments. Some of them are shown to be optimal or asymptotically optimal under the maximin distance criterion.  Discrete choice experiments give insights on individual preferences for particular attributes and have wide applications in healthcare studies and other areas.  Blocked fractional factorial designs are proposed to estimate main effects plus select two-factor interactions in discrete choice experiments, as well as to maximize the number of models with estimable two-factor interactions in general.  A novel application of composite designs is reported to optimize lipid production of a cell-free system for algae.  A range of optimum combinations of three essential chemicals (nitrogen, magnesium and phosphate) are identified for lipid accumulation, which can lead to the potential of significantly expanding the use of biodiesel as a viable alternative to fossil fuels.  These results are published or under review in top statistical and interdisciplinary journals.
