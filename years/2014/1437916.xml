<AbstractNarration>1437916&lt;br/&gt;DeCarlo, Peter F.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate matter size and composition change in response to transport from the outdoor to indoor environment &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the field of air pollution, very little is known about how particle composition changes in real time when particulate matter is transported from outdoors to the indoor environment. The goal of this project is online real-time characterization of particulate chemical composition and size distribution outdoors, indoors, and in the building supply air with high time resolution (6 minute cycle of 2 minute sampling at each location). The research plan intends to fortify collaboration between outdoor air quality and an indoor air quality research. Boundary lines between these two disciplines are typically rigid, but much can be learned by two groups working in concert, as is proposed here. To facilitate this interaction, workshops will be convened on outdoor and indoor air quality, bringing together investigators in our region to define a research agenda with the goal of understanding the transformations occurring when outdoor air moves indoors. Insights gained will have the potential to improve our understanding of risk due to indoor environmental exposure to outdoor particles that are transported into the indoor environment and change in composition during that transition. Finally, public outreach opportunities are prevalent in the Philadelphia area. Events such as the Philadelphia Science Fair hosted by the Franklin Institute, offer an excellent opportunity for PI DeCarlo to showcase the results of this work to members of the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing the unique dataset, generated by instrumentation recently acquired through an NSF MRI grant (Award 1229298), this study will examine the effect of temperature and humidity gradients on dynamic partitioning behavior of particulate matter chemical composition and size distribution as it is transported from outdoors to the indoor environment. This study will ask several questions, for example: 1) How do the changes to outdoor PM size and chemical composition from typical processes (e.g. diurnal cycles, photochemical production, weather events, seasonal cycles) influence the size resolved chemical composition of indoor PM? 2) How do changes in environmental factors (gradients in temperature and humidity) influence the size resolved chemical composition of PM transported from outdoors to indoors. 3.) Are there additional chemical and physical changes to particulate matter induced in an occupied versus unoccupied room?  It appears that this is the first study to use any type of Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer in the indoor environment. Aerosol mass spectrometer instruments are commonly used in atmospheric particulate measurements, but they have not yet been utilized in indoor particulate measurements and research. Pilot study investigations demonstrated the feasibility of this experimental approach and the richness of the data generated. The initial observations show the need for high time resolution and chemical information provided by aerosol mass spectrometry. The full study will make use of the real-time measurements of particulate sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon and a variety of organics species using both positive matrix factorization and ion markers for specific compounds. It is expected that the results of this study will be an important contribution, unique in the indoor air quality field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Particulate matter also called "aerosols" refer to tiny particles (100x smaller than the width of your hair) is a mix of chemical compounds coming from both human and natural sources.  We study these particles due to their effects on human health and the climate system.  Research has shown that exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter leads to many negative health impacts including premature death, and respiratory illnesses such as asthma.  While these studies use measurements of outdoor particulate matter as an approximation for exposure, we spend the vast majority of our time (more than 90%) indoors.  Therefore the majority of our exposure to outdoor pollution occurs indoors!  Our study investigated the changes that outdoor particles experience when they are transported to the indoor environment.  By measuring the concentration and composition of outdoor and indoor particles simultaneously while also measuring the temperature and relative humidity indoors and outdoors we were able to understand the chemical changes that these particles undergo due to changes in temperature and relative humidity. Generally we saw that the indoor concentration of particles was roughly 1/2 to 1/3 the outdoor concentration, and that some chemical changes occurred in the aerosol with additional loss seen for some chemical species that can evaporate when the temperature increases.  This is particularly important in the wintertime when it is cold outside in Philadelphia, and the indoor temperatures are much higher.  In the summertime measurements we saw significant changes in the chemical components of the aerosol that are formed from chemistry occurring in the atmosphere which makes the components that eventually end up in the particles.  We call these chemical components "secondary aerosol" since they are not directly emitted to the atmosphere as particles.  In the summer,  higher temperatures make more of these secondary aerosols in the outdoor atmosphere.  When these are transported indoors, they also experience loss due to the operation of the ventilation system, and likely the water that condenses in the air conditioning units. But this isn?t all we found, in addition to tracking the changes to outdoor particles, we also were able to identify sources of particulate matter indoors, some of which were unexpected.  We were able to identify a chemical component of particles due to residual cigarette smoke (see video explaining that here: https://vimeo.com/268404346).  The unusual thing about that is that the classroom we were measuring in was a non-smoking classroom!  We also were able to determine that in rooms with a lot of people, a small fraction of the particulate matter is due to human emission, probably from reactions happening with skin oil! Moving forward, the results of this research will be able to help people who use computer models to predict indoor air quality.  Since it is nearly impossible to make detailed measurements in all indoor spaces, the general results we have found can be translated into computer models which can predict concentrations of different chemical species in the indoor particles based on temperature and relative humidity differences between outdoors and indoors, and information about the outdoor particle composition.  Ultimately, this should help in better understanding our exposure to particle pollution indoors and where it is coming from.
