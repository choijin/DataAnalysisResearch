<AbstractNarration>This project addresses needs for research outlined in the 2013 National Research Council report, Monitoring Progress Toward Successful K-12 Education: A Nation Advancing?, which proposed indicators related to improving STEM education.  Specifically, the project will address research on indicator 2, time allocated to teach science in grades K-5, and indicator 3, science-related learning opportunities in elementary schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, to be conducted by the University California, Berkeley, will address the issue of measuring instructional time and adequacy of resources for science education in grades K-5.  The project will review existing evidence related to time, type, and substance of science learning experiences in elementary schools, conduct interviews and surveys of key informants, convene an expert panel in order to approach consensus related to measurement strategy and implementation recommendations, document research findings and expert recommendations, and lay groundwork for next steps regarding implementation of measurement systems.  The project will advance the work of the Education &amp; Human Resources (EHR) directorate in fostering research on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.</AbstractNarration>

For the teacher survey, we found a number of ways to improve survey data collection. First, we show how to provide examples of the unit of measurement. We recommend retaining the "total minutes per week" but including a minimum range check on this indicator. Second, it is important that the actor or recipient is clear. Because some schools use a science specialist to offer instruction to elementary students, it is important to understand if the data refer to the number of minutes of science instruction that students receive, or that the teacher responding to the survey offers.

For the principal survey, our findings suggested that two main strategies would improve survey items. First, we suggest limiting the grade levels principals are asked to report about. Because science instructional time can vary widely between kindergarten and 5th grade, we opted, through recommendation of the panelist, to limit the question to two grade levels: 2nd and 5th. In addition, for information about opportunities to learn science, we created a single measure that was offered to principals about how frequently they had supplemental science activities at their school. Since these are school-wide (or at least school-supported) opportunities, collecting them at the school level seemed most appropriate.
