<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) support Dr. Codrina V. Popescu at Ursinus College for research in Mossbauer spectroscopy conducted with undergraduate students.  Research ranges from studies of small-molecule iron (Fe) compounds to the exploration of novel Fe sites in proteins.  The expected scientific outcomes of this research are: (1) elucidation of electronic structures for new iron-based hydrogen electrocatalysts and models for the hydrogenase enzymes, including low-spin Fe(I), for which spectroscopic benchmarks are scarce; (2) correlation of structural and spectroscopic changes in model complexes for the hydrogenases and other biomimetic compounds; (3) characterization of the active site of the dual function hemoglobin-peroxidase enzyme dehaloperoxidase from A. ornata and of models for catalytic intermediates in ring-cleaving dioxygenases.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron is the most abundant transition metal in biological systems.  Iron proteins and enzymes are involved in life processes, such as oxidation, detoxification, hydrogen and nitrogen metabolism.  Mossbauer spectroscopy can bring insight into the electronic structure of iron compounds, often allowing us to elucidate the nature of the active sites of enzymes directly, or by probing small-molecule models, which may be used as catalysts.  Frontier problems in fundamental research have implications for environmental problems, such as the need for cleaner energy sources and dealing with pollution.  From details of Mossbauer spectra we are attempting to learn how iron is used to perform vastly different feats of chemistry in environmentally benign ways.  These interdisciplinary projects are of broad current interest for fundamental science and potential technological applications, from alternative fuels (hydrogenase model complexes) to catalysis (biomimetics), and environmental bioremediation (dehaloperoxidase). Through its interdisciplinary collaborative nature, this research has impact on the projects of collaborators from four other institutions and allows the undergraduates at Ursinus College to interact with students and faculty from these other research groups.  The research promotes a close relationship between mentor and students, who are active in all the steps of scientific discovery, from generating hypotheses to interpreting the spectroscopic parameters needed to elucidate new electronic structures. This undergraduate research training and education program fosters the students' growth and independence through advanced degrees, preparing them for STEM careers in teaching and research.  It also provides interdisciplinary projects for a diverse pool of students, in which hands-on spectroscopy is applied to current scientific problems and results in external presentations and publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research accomplished under this award was conducted by Dr. Popescu and students at two small liberal arts colleges, Ursinus College and Colgate University.  The projects aimed to train undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary field of iron enzymes and novel iron-based catalysts for hydrogen production and substrate oxidation.  The intellectual merit of this research is the elucidation of structure - function correlations in novel biological and chemical catalysts, through M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy.  The themes of the research were the catalytic hydrogen production and the mechanisms of biological aromatic oxidation and detoxification by iron enzymes.  A third related concentration emerged during the funded period, namely the exploration of novel iron compounds capable of binding nitrogen gas.  These three research themes are recognized as strategic challenges faced by the scientific and engineering communities in our society, in search of sustainable energy sources and of ways to address industrial water pollution.  The outcomes are the training of young people in cutting edge science, the inclusion of under-represented minorities and students with challenging economic background, the advancement of fundamental science and dissemination of scientific discoveries.  During the period 2013-2017, eight students supported through this award, learned first-hand the theoretical background for spectroscopy, chemistry of enzyme active sites and aspects of electronic structure of molecules which cannot be covered entirely in a class-based undergraduate curriculum.  In addition, the research setting in the PI?s lab allowed a close mentoring relationship and students could design their own hypotheses and experimental strategies.  The research planned in the original proposal was conducted, the work was widely disseminated in four publications and four conference presentations and work continues in new directions.    A notable accomplishment is a study of the electronic structure of a series of three electrocatalysts synthesized in the laboratory of Professor Darensbourg at Texas A&amp;M University.  Undergraduate students who were involved at different stages of the work are co-authors of the publication in preparation.  This collaborative study revealed both through experimental determination and through theoretical modeling, that a structure that contains a spin-bearing unit linked through thiolate bridges is a working first-generation electrocatalyst for hydrogen production.  The larger relevance of this study for the field of Chemistry is to demonstrate the relevance of the spin-coupled structure and of the extended delocalization present in the [Fe]-hydrogenase, pointing out possible future development of catalysts for hydrogen generation.[1]   The broader impacts of this research are the collaborative work with five researchers at larger universities and the involvement of undergraduates in all the stages of discovery, collaboration and dissemination.  The synthesis and characterization of model complexes, as the purification of iron proteins are time-consuming and complex.  On the other hand, M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy is a complex technique, for which the PI is highly qualified.  Thus through collaboration between chemists (and biochemists) and the PI (spectroscopist) we were able to introduce M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy to all students involved (both graduate students, undergraduates and postdocs), design better experiments and answer deeper questions which otherwise were not approachable.  An early exposure to research and to spectroscopy stimulates students from all backgrounds to become lifelong learners, to pursue advanced degrees, and to communicate valuable scientific facts to society.  Thus, the former undergraduate students who worked on this research are now employed or pursuing M.D. and Ph.D. degrees.  Moreover, M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy is a broadly used technique for characterization of iron compounds and materials and training in this technique is an asset for future biochemists and chemists.   The award enabled the PI to conduct research not only in the funded projects, but also to serve as a collaborator to more members of the chemistry community.  Thus, the PI started collaborations with Dr. Julia Brumaghim at Clemson University, Dr. Charles Shulz[2] at North Carolina State University, Dr. Michal Mock at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory[3] publishing two papers with two of them during the award period.
