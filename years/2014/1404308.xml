<AbstractNarration>Ultra-high-energy neutrinos are unique astrophysical messengers that interact weakly with intervening matter and can therefore be used to probe the distant universe.  A small but theoretically observable flux of these ultra-high-energy neutrinos is expected to be produced by the interaction between high-energy "cosmic ray" charged particles and cosmic microwave background photons as the cosmic rays travel through the Universe. Observing these cosmogenic neutrinos would allow physicists to begin to study physics at energies beyond the standard models. The large volume of radio transparent ice covering the geographic South Pole in Antarctica has hosted several pioneering efforts to detect these high energies neutrinos using a radio Cherenkov "Askaryan effect."  The Askaryan effect describes the process by which ultra-high-energy neutrinos traversing the dense polar ice generate observable radio waves.  The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located at the South Pole Station, was designed to exploit this phenomenon to first detect and ultimately study these ultra-high-energy neutrinos.  This award provides funding to deploy two more ARA stations to the existing suite of three stations, and to continue observations.  The award will support the involvement of students, including undergraduate students, who will be engaged in on-site activities at the South Pole.  It will also support outreach efforts including activities with QuarkNet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARA is designed to be implemented in phases.  During the initial phase the ARA project deployed a testbed and three full stations that used equipment designed and built for the co-located IceCube Neutrino Observatory.  With this award the project will deploy two more stations and continue observations with all stations to demonstrate the technology, accumulate knowledge about radio frequency properties of the upper layers of the ice sheet at South Pole, and develop reliable hardware and software for deployable in-ice stations in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is a novel telescope currently operating in Antarctica near the geographic South Pole.  Unlike the familiar telescope used by Galileo, our telescope does not image the sky using light, but instead images the sky in neutrinos.  Distant cousins to the electron, neutrinos are one of the basic building blocks of the universe.  Unlike electrons, neutrinos do not have electric charge, and very little mass.  This makes them unique astronomical messengers.  Because they do not readily interact with matter, they can reach us from cosmic distances and allow us to peer into the dense cores of galaxies and gain insight into the engines that power them in a way that other particles can’t.  However, it is this very property that makes them so difficult to detect.  Because they interact so rarely, very large telescopes are needed to net even a few neutrinos.  Our telescope employs the South Polar ice cap, which is nearly 2 miles thick and exceptionally pure, as a "collecting dish".  Neutrinos traverse the polar ice cap and, in the rare instance when they are captured on a nucleus in the ice, it initiates a cascade of atomic particles, creating a brief electrical impulse and radio frequency (RF) emission.  This award allowed us to continue our effort to populate the icecap with clusters of RF antennas which allow us to detect these astrophysical neutrinos, and triangulate their direction.  In addition, we have analyzed our data to produce world leading results in this area.     What can astrophysical neutrinos tell use about our universe?  We have known since the pioneering experiments of Victor Hess, who in 1912 discovered "cosmic rays" during balloon borne experiments, that Earth’s atmosphere is bombarded with radiation from space.  Subsequent measurements have shown that individual cosmic rays, consisting of protons or atomic nuclei, can have a kinetic energy in excess of a professional baseball pitch.  Cosmic rays, however, have electric charge that cause them to bend in magnetic fields, so they do not point back to their source.  Since neutrinos do not have charge, they will travel in straight lines.  Furthermore, they are produced in the same dense, energetic environments where ions can be accelerated.  It is hoped that neutrinos may be an important component in a "multimessenger" approach to astrophysics in which correlated observations from different telescopes, each with unique capabilities, can be combined to produce a more complete picture.  The IceCube neutrino telescope recently identified a candidate source using observations that were corroborated by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope and others.  Our telescope’s RF detection technique allows the construction of a much larger telescope, potentially enabling the detection of even higher energy neutrinos than those seen by IceCube.  Furthermore, during the term of this grant, we successfully tested a new cluster design that increases the detection efficiency of our telescope.  Our instrument currently holds world leading sensitivity for the highest energy neutrinos, and we look forward to continuing to exploit this resource to build a greater understanding of the high energy universe.
