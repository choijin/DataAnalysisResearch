<AbstractNarration>Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities have been used in a variety of particle accelerators for quite some time. The ulra-low electrical resistivity of a superconductor material allows a radio frequency resonator (needed for an accelerator) to obtain a high quality factor (Q) which allows energy storage with very low loss. Future accelerators, important in many areas of science and medicine, will benefit from advances such as the techniques in this award. This award is for advanced studies of superconductors used in SRF accelerators. Superconductors used in SRF are limited by the fundamental surface resistance. The next significant breakthrough in the SRF cavity technology is only possible if the physics of surface resistance is fully understood. The main goal of this research is to provide an understanding of the origin of the various contributions to the power dissipation in superconducting niobium and in particular the origin of the non-linear behavior as a function of the radio frequency field. This award includes integrated experimental and theoretical parts to address the unresolved issues of the surface resistance of superconductors at high radio frequency field, and in particular how the surface composition and structure can be modified and tuned in order to reduce surface resistance. The theoretical work will guide the experimental work which, in turn, will provide feedback to further develop the theory. This research will be performed by two graduate students and thus contribute to the education of accelerator scientists, who are in extremely short supply. The successful completion of this work will be very beneficial for the ongoing R&amp;D of high performance SRF cavities. Addressing the outstanding problems of the residual surface resistance and the increase of the quality factor Q with the radio frequency field magnitude can help guide the ongoing R&amp;D of SRF cavities and evaluate possibilities of promising new materials as possible SRF materials. This work will have a significant impact on the application of the SRF technology in general, and to accelerators operating in continuous wave mode in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this award some of the unresolved issues in our understanding of the surface resistance of superconductors will be addressed, in particular: (1) the physics of the residual resistance, which can exceed 20% of the theoretical contribution; (2) mechanisms of the observed increase of Q with the field and the possibilities of using this effect to extend the increase of Q to higher fields to boost the cavity performance; (3) possibilities of increasing the Q factor by managing impurities; and (4) making SRF materials other than Niobium useful for low field accelerator applications at low temperature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Experimental and Theoretical Studies of Fundamental Limits of Surface Resistance of Superconductors for Next Generation Particle Accelerators  PI: Prof. Jean Delayen, Co-PI: Prof. Alex Gurevich Center for Accelerator Science, Department of Physics Old Dominion University     Applications of superconductors in linear accelerators has resulted in accelerating gradients ~ 30-50 MV/m at very low power consumption due to extremely high quality factors Q = 1010-1011 for the SRF Nb cavities @ 2K. The remarkable technological advances have produced Nb cavities in which most extrinsic materials limitations of the SRF performance have been eliminated so that the Q factors become limited by the fundamental surface resistance Rs of a superconductor in the Meissner state. The next significant breakthrough in the cavity technology is only possible if the physics of Rs is fully understood, given that several outstanding issues of Rs are still inconsistent with the current theories. In this research we have addressed some of these issues, particularly:  1. The physics of the residual resistance which can exceed 20% of the theoretical BCS contribution RBCS even in the best Nb cavities and be much higher in other promising materials like Nb3Sn or MgB2. 2. Mechanisms of the observed increase of Q(H) with the rf field and the possibilities of using this effect to extend the increase of Q(H) to higher fields to boost the cavity performance. 3. Possibilities of increasing the Q factor by the impurity management and surface nanostructuring. 4. Making SRF materials other than Nb useful for low field accelerator applications at 4.2K. We believe that the results of this work will provide guidance in the R&amp;D cavity technology to increase the SRF performance limits.     The main goal of this research was to provide an understanding of the origin of the various physical and material mechanism which contribute to the power dissipation in superconducting niobium and in particular the origin of the non-linear behavior of the surface resistance as functions of the rf field amplitude, frequency and temperature.      This research included integrated experimental and theoretical parts to address the unresolved issues of the surface resistance of superconductors at high rf field, and in particular how the surface composition and structure can be modified and tuned in order to reduce Rs.  The theoretical work guided the experimental work which, in turn, provided feedback to further develop the theory. The results of this research can be summarized as follows.     We designed and built two      niobium coaxial half-wave cavities operating between 325 MHz and 1300 MHz,      which is the frequency ranges of accelerators, and used them to measure      the frequency, temperature, and rf field dependence of the surface      resistance of niobium.  We performed theoretical      investigation of the field dependence of the surface resistance of      superconductors and, in particular, the effect of nonmagnetic and magnetic      impurities. We developed a new theory of the      surface resistance in the presence of a thin metallic oxide layer and      showed how the field-dependent surface resistance can be optimized and      reduced below its value for an ideal surface by tuning the thickness of      the normal layer and the contact resistance between the layer and the      superconducting niobium.
