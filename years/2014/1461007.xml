<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the Chicago Botanic Garden (Glencoe, IL) will support the training of 10 students over 10-week periods during the summers of 2015-2017. This REU Site's focus is on plant biology and conservation, spanning from genomic to ecosystem levels. Mentors are drawn from the Garden, Northwestern University, and partner institutions. Mentors' diverse areas of expertise enable students to conduct research on a variety of topics, including evolution, pollination, conservation, genetics, invasive species, soil science, and restoration ecology. Students participate in professional-development activities; field trips; and weekly discussions addressing topics like ethics, graduate school, and scientific communication. The REU program is integrated into a near-peer training continuum: participants are paired with graduate student co-mentors and high school mentees. Target participants include students from groups underrepresented in the sciences, those who are the first in their family to attend college, non-traditional students, veterans, and students who lack extensive research opportunities at their home institutions. Students are recruited nationally and are selected based on their academic record, statement, letter of recommendation, potential to benefit from the experience, interviews with prospective mentors, and program goals.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from groups underrepresented in the sciences and schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. In addition, the Garden hosts affiliated interns who add to the diverse research community experienced by REU participants. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. All participants will present their findings at a large, multiple-institution symposium.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are tracked to evaluate the effects of this research experience on their future academic and career paths. Information about the program is assessed through follow-up surveys, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.cbgreu.org or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jeremie Fant at jfant@chicagobotanic.org) or co-PI (Dr. Daniel Larkin at dlarkin@chicagobotanic.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For twelve years, the Chicago Botanic Garden's REU Site Program (http://cbgreu.org/) has filled a growing gap in botanical training in the United States. As universities offer fewer opportunities to study plant biology, the need for trained botanists to help understand, manage, and sustainably utilize the nation&rsquo;s natural plant heritage is on the rise. As one of only a few plant biology-focused REU programs in the country, we train the next generation of botanists, preparing students to pursue research-based graduate degrees while inspiring careers in conservation research and practice. We have trained a diverse group of new researchers who are able to move the field forward while engaging and communicating with a broad audience within and beyond the scientific community.</p> <p>During our 10-week summer research internship program, students are exposed to a wide variety of conservation careers, including academic as well as non-profit, land-management, curatorial, and resource-agency positions. Our program complements applied conservation and restoration action with rigorous research into restoring degraded systems, preserving plant species in seed banks, and supporting species diversity in human-dominated landscapes. We introduce students to these areas of inquiry through research opportunities ranging from fundamental questions in plant evolution to improving approaches for ecological restoration and plant conservation. Interns use study sites located at the Garden, elsewhere in the Chicago region, and far beyond, with work that encompasses molecular, organismal, population, community, and ecosystem levels of analysis. Student inquiry extends beyond plants to include plant interactions with animals (and other types of organisms) and the study of critical ecosystem services provided by plants. Over twelve years we have trained more than 180 students (2/3 supported directly through REU Site funds, with the remainder supported by outside funding), enhancing the diversity and capacity of the botanical research community to help tackle the nation&rsquo;s conservation challenges.</p> <p>The REU program is a vital component of the Garden&rsquo;s education program in plant biology and conservation, which spans from pre-K to Ph.D. and post-graduate students. Our REU Site links our pre-collegiate programs with our joint graduate program in Plant Biology and Conservation (PBC) with Northwestern University. This allows REU interns to mentor high school students from CBG&rsquo;s College First program. REU interns are themselves co-mentored by PBC graduate students. This near-peer mentoring approach benefits all participants by exposing them to both sides of the mentor-mentee relationship. This provides a less-intimidating atmosphere for interns to practice their scientific communication skills and helps them gain confidence in their academic abilities. Another important benefit is that these students are typically close in age, making them great sources of unfiltered information about working with advisors, adapting when projects do not go as planned, and balancing personal and professional demands.</p> <p>The final important achievement of the program is increased participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences. Over the twelve years of this REU site, there has been high participation by female students, students from home institutions with limited research opportunities, and other groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Participants in the program increased their confidence as researchers, presented their work at national meetings, co-authored manuscripts, and were exposed to diverse career opportunities in plant biology and conservation. Students also gained a more complete understanding of the scientific and ethical dimensions of complex environmental issues. The research that interns conducted contributed to applied issues such as ecological restoration, food security, management of natural areas and invasive species, and <em>ex-situ </em>conservation. The program contributed to biodiversity conservation and human well-being in the Chicago region, elsewhere in the US, and beyond.</p> <p>Key accomplishments and broader impacts include the following:</p> <p>-&nbsp; Over the course of the program, Garden REU participants have helped author 17 scientific manuscripts, 10 theses, and have contributed 74 presentations to scientific meetings.</p> <p>-&nbsp; Interest among undergraduates in participating in our REU Site has grown steadily. Under our most recent three-year grant, we received 769 complete applications for a total of 30 positions (10 per summer).</p> <p>-&nbsp; Over 50% of our participants each of the last three summers have been women, students from home institutions with limited research opportunities, and students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.</p><br> <p>            Last
