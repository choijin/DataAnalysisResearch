<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to make chemistry more accessible by developing a rugged, compact, LED-based photometer that communicates data to other devices via Bluetooth.  The photometer and data processing functions will be designed to work with the company?s simplified test kits for Green Analytical Chemistry.  The photometer will be sold at just above cost, estimated at $200, because it enhances the utility and value of company?s easy to use test kits.  The business model is inkjet printer (the photometer), with test kits as the cartridges.  The product development focuses on simplified test kits based on recombinant enzymes and no hazardous reagents.  These kits enable unskilled operators to obtain actionable data. The initial target market is the Technical Service Providers who advise agricultural producers on fertilizer application decisions, giving them a new value-added service to offer.  This project will produce a tool for enabling ?citizen science?.  Technical tools in the hands of many people can benefit scientific understanding and stewardship of the environment.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project integrates recombinant protein technology with advances in LED-based photonics and the power of portable computational devices.  The company was founded in 1993 to commercialize its founder?s basic research into enzyme structure and function, concentrating on the plant enzyme Nitrate Reductase (NaR).  It now develops and manufactures recombinant enzyme reagents and test kits for green analytical chemistry, replacing heavy metals and concentrated acids with environmentally benign proteins.  The company?s AtNaR is now a US EPA alternative standard method for nitrate analysis.  These simplified test kits are designed for onsite use by unskilled users.  The new enzyme-based kit for measuring phosphate content in soils yields results in the UV (260 nm) and requires a photometer, but there is no suitable device on the market (assay volume is one milliliter).  The customers in the agriculture sector need new technology for soil testing to optimize fertilizer applications, decrease wasting and damaging runoff while maintaining high yields.  They need data that that is compatible with commercial agriculture software packages, including GPS location and sample identification.  The photometer will read two wavelengths, 540nm for nitrate and 260nm for phosphate, send results in the users? preferred measurement unit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We developed a manufacturable, low cost, handheld photometer designed to work with NECi's enzyme-based test kits, including our product line of test kits for agriculture.  There are no such devices on the market capable of pairing with NECiÆs enzyme-based nitrate and phosphate test kits:  NECiÆs total reaction volume is one milliliter.  CompetitorsÆ devices are based on a round reaction vessel that holds at least 5 and up to 20 milliliters. Ours is designed for use with standard 1cm pathlength cuvettes.   The hardware is based on a fusion of the open source photometer developed by our STTR partner, Dr Joshua Pearce at Michigan Technological University, and the proprietary prototype developed by NECi.  The photometer optics are LED based, keeping power requirements low.  The absorbance information is sent via Bluetooth to any Android smartphone or tablet, using the computational power of the smartphone instead of duplicating these functions on the device.  Case and optical "bench" are made by 3-D printing.  Rechargeable cell phone batteries supply the power.  The Open Source application, called "Open Water", gives information on nitrate content of aqueous samples when used with common chemistries that yield a result at 540 nm (i.e, Griess reagent chemistry).  All parts are light in weight and low in cost so that the widest possible user base can afford the open source devices.  All instructions needed to make one of these photometers is available in the PLOS ONE paper:   http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134989  Software tailored to NECi's products will differentiate the open source version from the proprietary versions.  WeÆve added a second wavelength and "app" so that one device measures both nitrate and phosphate, key analytes for agriculture and for water quality monitoring.  NECi's devices will be attractive and tactile, on the assumption that something fun to use will be used more often; these will be sold at a higher price point.  We met our target, approximately $50, for the open source device.  WeÆre on target for pricing of $100 - $150 for the more attractive and sophisticated versions to be sold by NECi.
