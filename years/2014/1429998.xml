<AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for US graduate students to participate in the 2014 International School for Cosmic Ray Astrophysics to be held on July 4-11, 2014 in Erice, Sicily, Italy. The theme of the Course this year is "Exploring the High Energy Universe."  Topics of discussion will be the new experiments, new experimental results and the new understanding of them. The course will emphasize the multi-messenger approach to astrophysics, a cross-disciplinary effort that combines observations of electromagnetic radiation, measurements involving neutrinos, and measurements of other high-energy particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. Therefore, the School is important in the education of such young scientists not only because of the lectures they listen to, but also because during the School they directly communicate with the more experienced scientists who are the lecturers.   In addition, the international character of the School fosters the global interaction of these young scientists in this fundamentally global research endeavor.</AbstractNarration>
