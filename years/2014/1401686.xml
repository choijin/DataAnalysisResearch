<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of Chemistry supports a project by Professor Lisa F. Szczepura from Illinois State University to examine the chemistry of carbene ligands bonded to multi-metal systems (clusters), and enhancing involvement of underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines at Illinois State. The proposed studies are critical to the future use of these clusters in applications such as catalysis. Professor Szczepura and students will develop new methods for these clusters containing stabilizing carbenes.  In addition to developing new methods, there is an interest in determining the impact of these clusters in yielding novel light-emitting materials.  In addition, Professor Szczepura will engage in training and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, running a STEM fair for underrepresented minorities on campus, and administering a program aimed at improving the success rate of underrepresented students in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic methodologies will be developed for the preparation of hexanuclear rhenium selenide and molybdenum chloride clusters containing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands.  The impact the NHCs have on the physical properties and small molecule activation of these cluster cores will be of primary interest.  This award will also allow for an exploration into the viability of isolating supraoctahedral clusters containingthe more reactive Fischer and Schrock carbenes. Since the clusters with molybdenum and rhenium cores typically display interesting photophysical properties, the proposed research will enable these clusters to be adapted for applications such as sensors and luminescent materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The metal clusters studied in this project often display unique physical properties which make them suitable as sensors or catalysts or other material-based applications.  The intellectual merit of this work centered on exploring the fundamental organometallic chemistry of hexanuclear transition metal clusters.  We prepared several new cluster complexes containing C-donor ligands and investigated their reactivity and physical properties.  Our contribution to the development of new synthetic methodologies, and a deeper understanding of the chemistry and luminescent properties of these cluster complexes broadly impacts several disciplines within inorganic chemistry.     The Broader Impacts of this project led to the development and implementation of a STEM Social and a Workshop Program, both of which serve to increase retention of underrepresented students in the sciences.  The STEM Social, which is aimed at informing matriculated students from underrepresented groups of resources and opportunities on campus which will help them succeed in their STEM major, was offered for 5 years and has now become an institutional program.  We were also successful in obtaining funding for student scholarships which are tied to the STEM Social.  In addition, during the course of this award, 24 students from underrepresented groups participated in the Enrichment Workshop Program which parallels one of the general chemistry courses.  This program includes one-on-one mentoring and it is noteworthy that over half of the participants became involved in undergraduate research in biology, chemistry or computer science.   Training of undergraduate and MS level students was also a major component of this work.  A total of 16 undergraduate researchers were directly or indirectly involved in research pertaining to this project (one of these undergraduates, Andrea Bruck, received a prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for her doctoral studies).   A total of 5 MS research students contributed to this work, 3 have already moved on to PhD programs and a fourth will be entering a doctoral program next fall.
