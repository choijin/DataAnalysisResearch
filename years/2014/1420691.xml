<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project will study the effects of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) skills and training gained from high school through college on the career-long learning prospects of diverse groups of individuals and their adaptation to changing workplace experiences. Project investigators at the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and the University of Wisconsin-Madison will also contribute to the important research on STEM broadening participation issues, specifically the intersection of race, ethnicity, gender and disability with STEM education, STEM workforce development and STEM career success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will conduct interviews with individuals who originally participated in a U.S. Department of Education survey called the High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B) study.  The students were high school seniors when the data was initially collected in 1980.  Some of these students also provided additional survey data in 1982, 1984 and 1986.  Beginning with this longitudinal survey data, the researchers will study the STEM training that students acquired and the STEM competencies they developed in school.  Drawing on specific coursework, test scores, grades, degree attainment, and field of degree, the investigators will analyze how these competencies contribute to workforce success and flexibility in mid-life work for persons with diverse, intersecting attributes defined by race, ethnicity, gender and disability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new data set will be made available to the public and to researchers through the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. The project will use a large population sample, combining data from the sophomore and senior cohorts of the HS&amp;B study, in order to conduct theoretically grounded analytic modeling about the relationships between STEM training, workforce outcomes and diversity attributes.  The main theoretical focus of the work is examining the relative contributions of education as credentials (signaling theory) versus the relative contributions of what is learned in school and non-school settings (human capital theory).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study investigated how the STEM skills and training that people gain in secondary (high school) and postsecondary (college/university) school contribute to their ability to continue to learn and adapt to changing workplace expectations even after they leave school, thereby contributing to their workforce success in midlife.  The project accomplished two goals:  1. To re-interview members of the HS&amp;B senior cohort and produce a database for use by the broader research community to generate new knowledge on workforce development and broadening participation in STEM, including persons at the intersection of underrepresented groups.  2. To investigate the STEM training that students acquire and the STEM competencies they develop in schools from specific coursework, test scores, and grades to degree attainment and field of degree and analyze how these contribute to workforce success in midlife work for persons with diverse, intersecting attributes, including those who are underrepresented in STEM. The intersecting attributes of particular interest are: (A) Women and men of color (African American and Hispanic) and (B) Women and men who have disabilities.  The main research question addressed was: Do relationships between STEM training and labor market outcomes differ across historical dimensions of inequality defined by race/ethnicity, gender, disability and the intersections among these attributes?  The data collected will be distributed by the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) through its restricted data license program https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/licenses.asp .  Some of the more notable findings from the study’s research include:  Mathematics coursework enabled workers to adapt and to navigate the changing labor market demands.  Taking higher levels of math coursework in high school protects women from bad occupations and jobs over thirty years later, even when they do not attain a bachelor’s degree. Adolescent men who expected occupations that declined in labor market share during early adulthood are at increased risk of death by suicide or substance abuse in adulthood. Early life experiences in school, work, family formation, and the health care industry shed light on who files for bankruptcy years before filing and how those experiences predict bankruptcy operate differently by race. Adult deaths from suicide and drug poisoning were over two and a half times higher among those who planned for a working class job when they grew up, if their expected occupation declined in labor market share between 1980 and 1990. Students with a mental disability are significantly less likely to complete a bachelor’s degree than students without disabilities and students with a physical disability, net of students’ family and academic background. The educational attainment process is far from over for adults in their 30s and 40s, with more than six of ten continuing their formal training during this period and four of ten earning an additional credential. Educational and occupational achievement of children of immigrants is lower compared with their peers with native-born parents, even after accounting for academic skills. Students who do not expect to go to college have lower occupational wages. This effect is even more pronounced for men.
