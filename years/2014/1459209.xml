<AbstractNarration>Research on geoengineering has thus far focused on ethical frameworks, potential international governance mechanisms and public perception but has neglected both a deeper theoretical analysis regarding why geoengineering is emerging as a legitimate policy option, and the development of geoengineering policy in particular national contexts.  The understanding that human activity plays a crucial role in earth system processes has prompted important theoretical debates in geopolitics which is increasingly being understood as "earth politics" as planetary processes become central to these discussions.  This doctoral dissertation project will generate new knowledge in our understanding of geoengineering policy development and contribute to the literature in political geography on the role of experts in shaping geopolitics.  The student will work collaboratively with RAND Corporation, academic institutions, consortia, and non-governmental organizations to discuss geoengineering research and policy.  Providing a clearer understanding about geoengineering will help decision-makers, government agencies and non-governmental organizations to better understand its intricate and important policy landscapes.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of literature about geoengineering falls into four categories: scientific and technical questions; ethical concerns; discussion of international law, norms and governance; and public perception. In this project the investigators will address three core questions: (1) Why has geoengineering recently emerged as an increasingly legitimate policy option in a number of industrialized nation states? (2) What is the composition of the contemporary geoengineering policy landscape in the United States? (3) How are geoengineering policy discussions developing at think tanks and academic institutions?  The student will adopt a three-pronged approach that will include a macro-scale, theoretical exploration of the recent rise of geoengineering, a meso-scale discursive analysis that maps the geoengineering policy landscape in the US, and a grounding of these theoretical and discursive analyses at a finer scale through institutional ethnography and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with experts. Because this is an empirically rooted project that examines geoengineering policy development within a nation-state it will serve as a model for researchers in other national contexts thus broadening understandings of geoengineering policy around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project investigates the development of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) as solar geoengineering policy in the United States. Once relegated to the fantasies of science fiction, solar geoengineering &ndash; the intentional modification of Earth?s albedo to counteract climate change &ndash; is moving to the fore in a a range of influential climate policy institutions. SAI entails the injection sulfur dioxide into the lower stratosphere to reflect solar radiation prior to reaching Earth?s surface, inducing a cooling effect independent of reductions in CO2. Eliciting both captivation and revulsion, it has the capacity to quickly, cheaply, and effectively slow the rate of climatic change; yet, may increase the acidity of percipitation, deplete stratospheric ozone, alter the South Asian monsson, and portends the intentional management of the climate system, replete with unknown consequences. I explore the political economy of solar geoengineering through three interwoven projects:     First, through a systematic, detailed synthesis of recent work in political economy and nature-society geography, I construct a conceptual-theoretical framework contextualizing the emergence of SAI in intersecting ecological and economic crises &ndash; what I term the ?formal and real subsumption of the biosphere.? Second, an examination of politico-epistemological assumptions from International Relations (IR) theory undergirding SAI policy and governance debates via an examination of the National Academy of Science?s report on SAI (2015), and an in-depth case study of SAI research and policy development at Harvard University (through primary document analysis, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with key actors). Third, an exploration of  the connections between SAI and U.S. national security, through a case study of The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA. Through policy document analysis and semi- structured interviews with key experts at RAND, I argue that SAI fits logically into emerging security strategies predicated on the doctrine of preemption and can be enfolded into emerging geopolitical struggles over energy and climate change leadership.     My overarching argument is as follows: As the liberal-capitalist economy is running up against an interwoven mesh of biophysical, economic, and political limits, SAI is being increasingly considered as a climate management tactic because it can effectuate a preemptive spatio-temporal fix for emergent ecological crises. This analysis stems from theoretical frameworks in nature-society geography whereby economic crises can emerge through ever-increasing environmental degradation. The degradation of environments (the conditions of production) will eventually cut into accumulation and rates of profitablility in thee ways: the biophysical conditions of production that underpin economic processes are rendered increasingly non-functional (degradation of vital resources and despoliation of crucial pollution vents that reduce costs); the environments destroyed are necessary life-support systems for billions of people, thus social movements may emerge to challenge dominant power relations; ever-increasing surpluses must thus be spent on repairing the environment (either to restore profitable conditions of production, or via state/public mandate).     Hence SAI as spatio-temporal fix: altering the chemical composition of the stratosphere to reduce solar radiation essentially expands the atmosphere?s capacity for CO2 absorption without attendant warming (producing a "new" environment). This would slow the rate of change, thus enabling more gradual (and less costly) adaptation, deferring potentially massive financial losses. This analysis can inform: burgeoning debates over geoengineering in the social sciences; emerging discussions in geography concerning environmental spatial-fixes and the emergence of the ?planetary? as an analytical scale and realm of political contestation; and &ndash; as I focus on policy construction in the U.S. context - geoengineering policymaking and knowledge on solar geoengineering of interest to non-governmental organizaitons.
