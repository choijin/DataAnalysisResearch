<AbstractNarration>The tallgrass prairie of North America is an iconic landscape, central to America history.  The grasses from which the prairie takes its name are close relatives of those that make up the vast grasslands of eastern Africa.   The grasses provide food for livestock and wild animals, and habitat for birds; they also pull carbon from the atmosphere and bury it deep in the ground where it supports beneficial microbes that make the rich soil on which American agriculture depends.  This project is a collaboration between research scientists at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri, undergraduates at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, and colleagues in eastern Africa, and is aimed at unraveling the ways the grasses spread their pollen, how they provide their seeds with carbon, and how the seeds are dispersed across the landscape.  This information will tell us how the grasslands will respond in the face of current disturbance such as fire, urbanization, and conversion to farmland, and future disturbances caused by a changing climate.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on three major grass genera, Andropogon, Schizachyrium, and Hyparrhenia, plus a few smaller related genera, that together include some 250 species many of which are ecological dominants.  Researchers will first use DNA sequences to uncover the phylogenetic history of the group, and then use that history to trace how the seed-bearing portions of the plant have changed over evolutionary time and how they correlate with climate, fire, and moisture.  The seeds in these plants do not simply drop off the plant.  Instead they are released as part of a complex dispersal structure that includes pieces of floral stalks and leaf-like bracts. The dispersal structure varies between species in size, presence or absence of hairs, presence of male and female flowers, and presence or absence of awns (hygroscopic extensions of bracts).  The structure may be an adaptation for seed dispersal, for the control of germination in particular soil types, or for resistance to fire.  However, the same structures may also help with pollination.  In addition, many parts of the dispersal structure are green during development, and may provide photosynthate for the developing seed.  Thus the structure could be selected for functions at three different life history stages: pollination, grain filling, and dispersal.  This project will use both a historical phylogenetic approach and an experimental approach to test the current function of the dispersal structure.   The dispersal structure studied here is much like that of sorghum, sugarcane and Miscanthus, so the data will apply to those crops as well as to the major grassland species.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes report, DEB-1457748  In the course of this project we discovered new avenues for improving the crops maize (corn) and sorghum.  We took a novel approach by looking not at other corn and sorghum plants, but rather at their wild relatives in the prairies of North America (Fig. 1) and the great grasslands of Africa.  One major effort was to investigate the deep evolutionary history of maize.  Maize is part of the genus Zea; it has been known for decades that the genus is the result of an ancient (8-10 million years ago) hybridization event, or cross between two species.  The mystery was which two species were involved.  By extensive DNA sequencing, we found that the parents were similar to species that now grow in Africa, one of which (hippo grass) grows standing in water.  By identifying these ancient maize relatives our work points to species that can be investigated to study how maize can be improved to adapt to environmental challenges such as heat and flooding.               Most of the species we investigated have fertile flowers paired with sterile ones. The presence of sterile flowers is surprising because it would appear to be a waste of resources.  We have found that the sterile flower undergoes photosynthesis and exports carbohydrates to the developing seed, forming a sort of nurse tissue.  While we investigated several wild species, we also extended the study to cultivated sorghum and found that the sterile spikelets could be contributing a small but significant component to yield.               The species in the study group differ in tiny but consistent ways, suggesting that the structure of the flowers is genetically controlled and may have been shaped by natural selection.  We tested whether the size and shape of the floral parts could be explained by major aspects of the environment such as precipitation or temperature, but we found no correlation.  We are now developing new hypotheses to test for what conditions make different structures advantageous.               The project has led to extensive education and outreach, involving trainees from the US, Thailand, and Brazil.  We developed a partnership with Principia College, a faith-based undergraduate institution in Elsah, Illinois, and several Principia undergraduates have been active and significant partners in our research, as has their undergraduate advisor Dr. Christine McAllister.  Post-doc Dr. Michael McKain, now an assistant professor and curator of the herbarium at University of Alabama, developed computational tools that will speed up analysis of plant genomes.  We developed new techniques to make DNA extraction faster and easier, improving our ability to work with naturally diverse species.               In summary, the NSF funding from this project has led to education, publications, and insights into the biology of wild species and their agricultural relatives.
