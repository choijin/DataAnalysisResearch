<AbstractNarration>Atomic nuclei occurring in nature tend to have the same number of neutrons and protons. For larger nuclear masses, this is attributed to the symmetry energy, a contribution to the nuclear energy associated with neutron-proton imbalance, that becomes larger the larger the imbalance. Nuclei with large imbalance can decay to more energetically favored products and, when that imbalance is excessive, the nuclei cannot even be formed. Understanding the symmetry energy is essential for extrapolating from the properties of existing nuclei to neutron stars kept stable by gravity while at the verge of collapse to black holes. In their efforts, the inverstigators will rely on their complementary expertise and will benefit from the expertise in nuclear structure of other members of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) Nuclear Theory Group and from the expertise in nuclear astrophysics of the members of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA), housed partly at Michigan State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance our understanding of nuclear reactions, emphasizing aspects pertaining to the so-called nuclear symmetry energy. The symmetry energy governs average evolution of nuclear properties with neutron-proton imbalance that is now easier to vary experimentally given the modern existing and planned accelerators that can accelerate short-lived isotopes. The symmetry energy is important for extrapolating from the properties of the nuclei to those of neutron stars. The latter are macroscopic nuclear systems made stable, right at the verge of collapse into a black hole, by opposing forces of gravity and pressure tied to the dependence of symmetry energy on nuclear density. The symmetry energy at densities higher than normal for nuclei is studied using observables from central collisions of heavy nuclei, in particular charged pion ratios and collective flow. The investigators will improve on theoretical descriptions of those central collisions, by incorporating dynamic production of alpha particles into transport theory for the collisions. Because of large binding energy per nucleon and equal proton and neutron numbers, alpha particles are, on one hand, rather copiously produced and, on the other, they significantly change relative neutron-proton imbalance in their surroundings; hence their importance. The symmetry energy at normal and subnormal densities will be studied by simultaneously interpreting data from elastic scattering and charge exchange reactions, thus learning about differences in the neutron and proton distributions in those nuclei that have neutron-proton imbalance.  Finally, the investigators will extract optical potentials of neutrons and protons from many-body theory relying on fundamental interactions, paying particular attention to the dependence of those potentials on neutron-proton imbalance. The fundamental extraction can help to reduce ambiguities in the interpretations of peripheral reaction experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pawel Danielewicz and Filomena Nunes engaged in research in the area of nuclear reaction theory to learn about symmetry energy describing changes in nuclear matter with changes in neutron-proton imbalance, in particular between interiors of stable nuclei and interiors of neutron stars.  They utilized their  expertise in central and in peripheral reactions described, respectively, in terms of statistical transport models and few-body approaches.   In analyzing simultaneously nucleon elastic scattering and quasielastic proton-to-neutron charge exchange reactions on the same targets, they found large isovector auras surrounding target nuclei.  The auras are regions in the vicinity of nuclear surface where neutron-proton imbalance dominates as compared to the rest of the nucleus. The thickness of the auras, of about 0.9fm, see the figure, represent a significant portion of the overall size of the nuclei. Such thickness implies a strong density dependence of the symmetry energy and high nuclear pressure in neutron stars pushing there against gravitational collapse.   In an effort lead by the postdoctoral asscociate Jimmy Rotureau, they derived and calculated microscopically the optical potentials underlying nucleon elastic scattering and potentially quasielastic charge-exchange reactions such as in the other part of the effort. They found that the microscopic strategy produced a reasonable part of the potential for elastic scattering but not imaginary describing removal from the elastic to more complicated channels.  We understand that this is due to the lack of complicated states in the microscopic calculation, that may be improved with higher computational power.  In the area of central reactions, the researchers engaged in cross-comparisons of transport codes for reaction simulations and comparison of the codes against known limits under specific constraints.  The comparisons allowed to deduce best calculational procedures, improve codes across the field and improve faithfulness of theoretical predictions for central reactions.  In collaboration with experimentalists, the researchers made predictions for charged pion yields from central reactions, guiding experimental analyses aiming to learn about the symmetry energy at densities above those found inside nuclei, but momentarily produced in the reactions.
