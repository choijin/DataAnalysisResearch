<AbstractNarration>This project evolves and sustains human expertise in advanced networking technologies to support data-driven science applications at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and fosters a community of engagement, learning, and knowledge-sharing for cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity professionals throughout Alabama and adjoining states.  The campus CI Engineer plans and maintains the Science DMZ at UAH, identifying and addressing key campus network engineering and performance challenges, and building both a theoretical and practical knowledge base to contribute to the regional CI community, for which the CI Engineer acts as a resource.  UAH is hosting a workshop for local, state, and regional professionals to address the challenges and opportunities inherent in advanced networking technologies to support data-driven science applications. Specific workshop sessions cover emerging topics in data networking and security such as Software Defined Networking (SDN), federated network measurements including perfSONAR, network tuning, federated identity management (InCommon), and security and policy development. A regional digital knowledge warehouse hosted at UAH complements the workshop in supporting the regional community of practice.  This project augments and bridges outstanding activities and communities of practice elsewhere in the nation. The activities enable data-driven science of regional, national and international significance, and significantly augment the regional knowledge base of advanced networking expertise for the University of Alabama System Regional Optical Network (UASRON) and Alabama Research and Education Network (AREN), as well as for the entire University of Alabama system, with whom UAH collaborates via both a statewide CIO council, and a statewide Cybersecurity Council.</AbstractNarration>
