<AbstractNarration>All vertebrate embryos develop along recognizable axes: antero-posterior (head to tail), dorso-ventral (back to belly) and, even less obvious, a left-right (LR) axis characterized by the left or right position of internal organs. The embryonic structure responsible for generating the LR asymmetry has been identified recently, and its function has been analyzed.  However the mechanisms leading to its formation are poorly understood. These studies aims to identify and understand the function of novel essential players involved in that process and to characterize the molecular activities that are involved during the different developmental steps leading to the formation of the structure that produces the LR axis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The establishment of LR asymmetry in the zebrafish embryo depends on the activity of motile cilia, present on an epithelium inside a fluid-filled organ called Kupffer's vesicle (KV) that generates a vectorial leftward fluid flow. Formation and differentiation of the KV have been shown to be regulated by several signaling pathways but very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the formation and differentiation of the KV from its precursors, the dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs). This project will characterize the function of novel key players amongst the small set of transcription factors involved in the regulation of KV organogenesis. It will define the developmental step(s) in KV formation that require a functional TEAD1a-Vgll4l transcription complex and identify its relationship with signaling pathways and transcription factors that have been shown to be involved in the formation and/or function of the KV. This project will also generate a complete description of the transcriptome of DFCs and the KV at the different developmental steps of KV organogenesis. It will provide a detailed description of the temporal dynamics of gene expression as well as of the specific role of the transcription factors involved in the KV organogenesis, bringing us close to a complete description, at the molecular level, of the formation of a simple but essential organ of a vertebrate embryo.&lt;br/&gt;This project will offer one post-doctoral fellow and two undergraduate students opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research in Developmental Biology and will expose students at all levels of education to the scientific process. It will include: (a) outreach educational activities to local high school students (seminars, science fairs, biowebconferences, workshops at the lab), (b) research experience for undergraduate students and (c) postdoctoral training in a broad range of technologies as well as communication skills essential for career advancement. The scientific results coming out of this project will be communicated through publications in highly ranked journals, presentations at national and international conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In vertebrates, the establishment of Left-Right (LR) asymmetry results from the activity of a ciliated organ functioning as the LR Organizer (LRO). In zebrafish, this organ is composed of ~50 monociliated cells organized as a hollow sphere with motile cilia facing its lumen. Rotation of these cilia generates a transient counterclockwise fluid flow that directs asymmetric activation of a secreted factor, <em>Nodal</em>, that guides asymmetric morphogenesis of embryonic organs. The overall goal of this project was to understand how the expression of genes essential for the formation of the LRO is regulated before and during the formation of this organ. Using the zebrafish as a model system, we identified that two transcription factors (TEAD1a, TEAD3a) and four transcription cofactors (Yap, Taz, Vgll4b and Vgll4l) known to mediate or to regulate the outcome of the Hippo signaling pathway (a master signaling regulating organ size) play a pivotal role in controlling the expression of genes essential to the formation of the LRO. We found that disruption of each of these factors (either by mutation or by interfering with the synthesis of their protein) strongly affect the expression of genes essential for the formation of the LRO, including ligands and receptors of signaling pathways involved in this process and most of the genes required for the formation of the motile cilia. The outcome is the abnormal position of asymmetric organs within the body (e.g.: heart and pancreas on the left side or liver on the right). In addition, we discovered that Vgll4l, one of the transcription cofactors, regulates epigenetic programming (the heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence) in LRO progenitors by activating the expression of writers and readers of DNA methylation marks that tag the DNA and that can activate or repress genes. Disruption of these epigenetic factors by mutation or by interference with production of their protein results in disrupting the LR asymmetry associated with abnormalities in the formation of the LRO. Therefore, our study identifies another level of regulation of epigenesis during embryonic development through the tissue specific control of the expression of major epigenetic actors. The demonstration that Vgll4l regulates epigenetics in a temporal and spatial manner by affecting the expression of some of its major actors opens a new field of exploration for the understanding of the regulation of gene expression during cell differentiation.
