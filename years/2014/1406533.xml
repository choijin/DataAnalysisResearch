<AbstractNarration>This project will develop new universal control designs for Network Control Systems (NCS) such as the new distributed control systems needed for the smart grid and modern automotive systems. Unlike many traditional NCS systems, these will be designed from the start so as to maximize performance over time, fully accounting for communication delays in networks and unexpected events, as well as nonlinearities, continuous random disturbances and other issues which this PI has addressed in the past. He intends to develop rigorous mathematical proofs that these new designs will always lead to stable operation. He will also maintain a pipeline to immediate practical applications, through his existing Industry-University Center on Intelligent Maintenance. The designs are intended to be general, learning-based and massively parallel, in a way which may also help us understand how mammal brains can perform tasks beyond the scope of more traditional types of design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These designs will be an extension of work previously funded by NSF, described in the Handbook of RLADP, edited by Lewis and Liu. ADP, like linear programming, is a class of challenges, not just one specific method, though there are relations between the successful methods. ADP includes all the methods aimed at the general problem of multistage optimization in the face of nonlinearity and stochastic disturbance. In order to cope with general nonlinear tasks, this project will include neural networks which have been proved to be more effective as approximators of general nonlinear functions than more traditional systems.  The chief novelty here is the ability to combine these capabilities with the presence of communication delays and random discrete events, which are an important practical issue in most NCS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Many real-time systems  such as smart grid, network manufacturing systems, automotive control  systems are implemented as distributed control systems wherein the  control loops are closed through a real-time communication network.  Therefore they are referred to as Network Control Systems (NCS).  The interest for NCS is motivated by many benefits they offer as  the ease of maintenance and installation, the large flexibility and the  low cost. However, many theoretical issues such as the selection of transmission interval of the state and control vector and optimal  controller design for NCS have to be investigated before the benefits  can be harvested. On the other hand, in recent years, neural network  (NN)-based dynamic programming (NDP) is being investigated for the  design of optimal/suboptimal controllers. The delays and packet losses  in NCS can degrade the performance of control systems designed without  taking into account the effects of these network imperfections and can  even destabilize the NCS. Unfortunately, no work is currently being  attempted to develop online event sampled robust controllers where network imperfections such as delays, packet losses and quantization errors can be considered along with the transmission of state and control vector. Existing  adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)/NDP schemes render unsatisfactory  performance in the presence of delays alone as shown in the preliminary  effort. For the past few years, the investigators and  their students have developed a new framework for optimal controller  design for such NCS without using iterative methodology that is quite  common with existing mathods.  This novel fremwork allows the NCS to  operate in a forward in time even under uncertainties resulting from  network imperfections.  This framework is mathematically rigorous and  offers a breakthorugh in the design of optimal control since the  optimizarion is carried out in finite and infinite time. The control  methodology can be implemented using outputs alone relaxing state  measurements. This effort extends the optimal controller framework to incorporate event sampling, optimization and design of controllers for NCS.  As part of intellectual merit, the proposed research  presented  an opportunity to deal with a more powerful and unified  paradigm of  complex learning problems and envisions a brain-like controller. The approach taken here employs an adaptive estimator  &ndash;based  or a NN learning as a fundamental block within the proposed  framework, to  provide forward-in-time solutions to complex dynamic  optimization  problems for complex real-time application environments  such as cyber-physical systems where network imperfections  become part of the control loop.  Optimal  control of NCS is the first  step towards attaining such cyber-physical  systems.  This research will  advance the state of the art for optimal control by providing  rigorous mathematical analysis, stability and performance  guarantees in  the presence of unknown system dynamics, disturbances, delays and   packet losses for a class of nonlinear systems without using iterative approach.    Moreover, by applying the theoretical results to an emerging vehicle   systems, smart grid etc, NDP will gain wider acceptance.   As part of  broader impact, this research leads to significant advances in the development of advanced optimal control schemes for unknown linear and nonlinear NCS with  applications to smart grid, which has a direct impact on delivering the  energy  security for the clean environment and network enabled  manufacturing.  Within the controls research community, this work  will  push the advances of learning systems to the next level and will   inspire more theoretical results coupled with practical implementations.   The proposed work utilized several important dissemination  channels,  including software, material for courses, special  sessions, and  journals and conference publications.   A book has been edited and international collaborations pursued in this area from rseearchers in India resulted in additional publication and exchange of students.
