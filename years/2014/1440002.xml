<AbstractNarration>This award will fund 25 United States experts in advanced manufacturing to attend a workshop in San Antonio, Texas to discuss four specific topics in advanced manufacturing with a similar number of researchers from the Republic of Korea. The workshop will be held in May 28-30, 2014. The Republic of Korea delegation travel and hotel will be funded by the Korean National Research Foundation. The working meals for all participants will be funded by the United States National Science Foundation. This second workshop follows a similar workshop organized last year in May in Republic of Korea and hosted by the Korean National Research Foundation.  At the end of last year's workshop, it was decided that further discussion is needed on the four topics of industrial robotics, manufacturing mathematics, materials processing and sub-micron and nano-manufacturing. The goal of this year's workshop is to continue to identify additional research topics of mutual interest to academic researchers supported by National Science Foundation domestically, and by the Korean National Research Foundation in Korea. The workshop discussions will again focus in four topical areas: industrial robotics, manufacturing mathematics, materials processing and sub-micron and nano-manufacturing. Additionally this year the participants will also discuss very large manufacturing and bio-materials processing. The workshop will be preceded by tour of the Southwest Research Institute facilities. The workshop itself will be two days in duration. The result of the workshop will be a report detailing areas for beneficial collaboration between Korea and the United States with the expectation that it will be followed up with proposals for research in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will promote international collaboration in academic research, particularly in the four topic areas of the workshop. By so doing, it will accelerate research in these areas which is expected to lead to better products and economical products made with environmentally friendly advanced manufacturing processes. Further, it will help involved students gain an international perspective and broaden their educational experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the International Science and Engineering Section of OIIA through the Global Venture Fund.</AbstractNarration>
