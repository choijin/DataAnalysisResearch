<AbstractNarration>The project will construct a new computer-based Resilient Infrastructure Simulation Environment (RISE) to allow individuals, groups (including students), and experts to test infrastructure network design configurations and crisis response approaches in three socio-technical infrastructure systems: electric power, water, and roadway networks. Researchers will link social and technical analysis with human subject research to discover the adaptive actions, ideas, and decisions that contribute to resilience. The project comprises of two major parts. In Part I (Modeling), researchers will identify the structure, dynamics (functionalities), and vulnerabilities of the networks that make up water, roadway, and electric power systems in Phoenix, AZ and Indianapolis, IN. Researchers will analyze the resulting US-based network models in conjunction with those from international partners in Asia, Australia, and Europe to learn and adapt global resilience principles . The results will be combined with belief networks to develop realistic decision models for the RISE. In Part II (Simulation), researchers will construct the RISE to study how different experts, stakeholders, individuals, and groups act in simulated decision scenarios. Through observation, researchers will identify the problem-solving and response strategies that result in resilient action, and thus understandthe organizational and social processes of sensing, anticipating, adapting, and learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken together, this project will result in two principal research outcomes: 1) a measureable, testable description of resilience that fuses social, behavioral, and engineered elements for infrastructure system design, and 2) improved resilience among the students, managers, stakeholders and other participants participating in the study. The new knowledge will help policymakers design effective strategies to make America's water, power, and road networks more resilient.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary focus of this project was to examine diversity of urban infrastructure networks (roads, water distribution networks, sanitary/sewer networks) in multiple global cities, and to understand convergence of their functional topologies towards a common pattern (Pareto node-degree distribution) suggesting evolution of "scale-free" topologies. Our data analyses show that while cities are different in so many familiar ways (e.g., size, layouts; population, geographic settings; age; etc.), they are similar in surprising ways (common generating mechanism for scale-free networks).  Our project work also showed that urban infrastructure networks are geospatially co-located and inter-dependent, and such failures in one network can cascade to other networks and contribute to service failures in multiple networks. These findings have important implications for urban design to ensure delivery of critical services and for enhancing community resilience during service disruptions.  Cities are coupled, dynamic, complex systems, and subject to stochastic shock regimes, which can lead to "regime shifts". One of these couled systems (physical infrastructure) is non-adaptive, and designed to offer resistance from its designed robustness, redundancies, and flexibility. Two other systems (human, natural) are highly adaptive when confronted with internal or external shocks. Thus, the coupled urban system resilience arises from these adaptive systems.  Our analyses of data from and stochastic modeling of global cities showed that differences in urban community resilience in cities arise from variations in adaptive capacity (at management and households levels) and access to reliable infrastructure. Based on analyses of data from diverse global cities, we identify three archetype groups of cities: water-secure, but in a rigidity trap; water-insecure, and in poverty trap; and an intermediate group in transition between these two.  We also examined the link between urban sanitary networks with centralized wastewater treatment plants, discharging nutrients to river networks. In addition to diffuse sources of nutrients from intensively managed landscapes (e.g., agriculture), WWTPs serve as distributed point sources.
