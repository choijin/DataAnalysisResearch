<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support the "Digital Societies and Social Technologies Summer Institute" (DSST-SI), a five-day interdisciplinary training workshop designed to bring graduate students and young faulty together with established scholars working at the socio-technical interface between computer science, human-computer interaction, design studies, management information systems, and cyber-social science. The Consortium will enhance the scientific workforce in this emerging research area by developing a group of promising young researchers interested in socio-technical research and building a "community of inquiry and practice" that can address the mixture of technical, social and organizational challenges that characterize today's increasingly digital workplaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) promise significant advances across many domains of social and scientific interest; however, these technologies stand at an uncomfortable intersection of multiple scholarly and policy fields, "useful to many but central to none." The DSST Summer Institute seeks to convene and reinforce the community of social scientists, computer scientists, design researchers, and computational methods and data specialists, to begin building the missing intellectual and institutional infrastructure for sustained scholarship in this crucial but underdeveloped no-man's-land. NSF funding allows 30 doctoral students and early faculty to participate in the DSST Summer Institute program and become better integrated into the emerging DSST community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the 2014 DSST Summer Institute will focus on problems that are limiting the sociotechnical community's ability to build coherent interdisciplinary dialogues, develop collaborative research agendas, and nurture new generations of emerging scholars. The 2014 Institute will also equip participants with the cyberinfrastructure concepts, theories and tools needed to enlist computational and big-data research methods in pursuit of new and transformative agendas in sociotechnical design science. Beyond raising awareness of advances in tools and techniques, the DSST Summer Institute will also develop interdisciplinary networks of sociotechnical scholars focused on critical ICT challenges and on realizing the transformative potential of emerging computational methods and big data resources within the ICT studies domain. In addition, the workshops will also serve an educational purpose, providing graduate students and other early-career researchers with training, feedback, and opportunities to build collegial and mentorship ties beyond their home departments. Moreover, beyond these direct contributions to strengthening the community for sociotechnical ICT Studies, the Summer Institute will also contribute to the infrastructure for computational and data-enabled science and engineering more generally, by enhancing understanding of the continuities and transformations that occur when work processes -- including scientific work practices -- move from physical to virtual settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Between July 11th 15th, 60 researchers interested in social technologies and sociotechnical system came to University of Missouri for CSST Summer Institute.  For these 4 days:  27 junior researchers and 9 established scholars discussed the sociotechnical research landscape in focused mentoring sessions, participated in the development of workshops and discussions around the particular challenges faced by interdiscipilnary scholars in the job market, on the tenure track and in the funding and publishing worlds.  This year's institute also featured a team focused on the deep examination of Open Online Community data; a team focused on a tool called Scholarmap and the continued management of our website at http://www.sociotech.net; and a team of organizers and evaluators from NSF and the Research Coordination Network on Digital Societies.    Participants left with a better understanding of their research community, stronger networks, and the knowledge, skills, and resources that they need to do high-impact, sociotechnically informed research on the ways that digital technologies are changing our organizations, societies, and lives.  The concrete results from this project include:  *A fully formed Open Collaboration Data Factory team that successfully solicited and recieved NSF SAVI Funds  *27 Junior researchers added to an existing network of CSST Alumni an supporters, strengthening the integration of business, economics, pychology, computing, library science and other multi disciplinary research. Four workshops were presented by participants and organizers of the 2014 summer institute at major ACM Conference venues, including ACM Group and ACM CSCW.  *Engagement of a 67 person advisor board in the review of junior researcher applications.  *3 of the 27 junior participants graduated this past year and got tenure track jobs at major US iSchools.
