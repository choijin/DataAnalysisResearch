<AbstractNarration>This project provides participant support for the 2014 Transportation CPS Workshop, enabling a broad range of leading researchers spanning academia, industry, and government to develop an ambitious research agenda at the intersection of transportation systems and cyber-physical systems, together with a workshop report that crystallizes this agenda. The workshop addresses an important area of exploration problems of great impact to society: cyber-physical systems in the automotive and aerospace domains, including connected vehicles and their security, safety, and verification, stand to save time, fuel costs, and lives lost to accidents. The project supports community building and ensures multiple and diverse perspectives are included.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was for providing travel support for participants at the successful NSF Workshop on Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems held in the Washington DC area on January 23 and 24, 2014.   The objective of the workshop was to stimulate new thinking and ideas, and come up with bold new research challenges for transportation cyber-physical systems, where computing, communication, sensing and actuation technologies will revolutionize the transportation sector.   Vehicular networking and automated vehicles are two examples of how information technologies can transform the transportation sector and lead to significant reductions in traffic accidents, injuries and fatalities.  The workshop was very successful with a number of representatives from academia, industry and the government.    Invited talks were supplemented by a host of wide-ranging breakout sessions and report breakouts.      A report captures the wide-ranging set of discussions at the workshop.   The report comprises multiple parts.  The first part captures the state of today's transportation cyber-physical systems in terms of (a) its limitations and constraints, (b) future needs and requirements, (c) impact on safety, efficiency, mobility, productivity, environmental impact, (d) education and (e) grand research challenges posed by the domain.   The second part captures specific research and educational challenges for different aspects of transportation including (a) Connectivity and automation, (b) Aviation, (c) Infrastructure and cloud support, (d) Model-based design, verification, and validation, (e) Security and privacy, and (f) Environmentally-friendly approaches and personalization.  The workshop also provided plentiful opportunities for training and professional development.  Specifically, researchers from academia were exposed to a host of concerns and problems faced by practitioners, as well as directions that government officials were interested in pursuing for the longer term in transportation CPS.    The academics in turn are expected to influence their own research along these directions and problems while working with their graduate and undergraduate students.  The workshop and its events were widely publicized by the CPS Virtual Organization.   All materials related to the workshop, including program agenda and speaker presentations, are available at http://cps-vo.org/group/CPSTransportationWksp2014.  Transportation CPS and progress made along that front (perhaps most clearly exemplified by the increasing popularity of connected vehicle technologies and vehicle automation technologies) can be a model for other CPS communities and beyond to emulate.   The workshop is also likely to have seeded many new ideas in the minds of attending researchers, who in turn are expected to submit strong proposals to the NSF CPS program.  This in turn would likely produce stronger and applicable future results that have a chain impact on the development of human resources.One of the many themes discussed at the workshop was about having physical and infrastructural testbeds to test novel transportation CPS ideas.  In summary, the workshop helped the transportation CPS community to chart some new directions of research, articulate visions of the future where CPS can make transportation safer and more efficient, and obtain wide-ranging community inputs.
