<AbstractNarration>1421191&lt;br/&gt;Huang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for a workshop on sustainable manufacturing to be held in Wuhan, China, March 13-15, 2014.  This workshop is targeted to identify high-priority specific research objectives that can be pursued significantly better by collaborative U.S. - China research teams than by U.S. researchers and China researchers working separately without U.S. - China collaboration. In this workshop, U.S. and China researchers will define high-priority sustainable manufacturing research objectives and identify related collaborative research project areas that are potentially fundable jointly by the U.S. NSF and China NSF. The workshop is designed for broad and in-depth discussions of challenges, opportunities, and collaborations in critical areas of mechanical/chemical sustainable manufacturing. Participants from each country are leading/active scholars in mechanical, chemical, industrial, material, civil and environmental engineering. Thematic areas include (i) sustainable products and processes and (ii) sustainable manufacturing systems. These thematic areas will cover most frontier research topics, such as product design innovations for resource efficiency and effectiveness, manufacturing process and equipment design with minimum ecological footprints, smart manufacturing, fast and in-time green production, and sustainable supply chain and industrial ecology. This workshop should help greatly U.S. delegates to gain a clear understanding of research on sustainable manufacturing in China, and identify high-level collaboration opportunities with Chinese colleagues. As the workshop is designed for multidisciplinary discussions, it is targeted to lead to identification of cutting-edge areas in sustainable manufacturing and a plan for effective interdisciplinary collaboration. The U.S. delegation is formed of academic scholars of all ranks, including scholars from underrepresented groups. This award is co-funded by the Global Venture Fund (GVF) of NSF's International Science and Engineering section (ISE), as well as the CMMI and CBET divisions of NSF's Engineering Directorate.</AbstractNarration>
