<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this NUE project, An Interdisciplinary Practicum Approach to Nanotechnology Curricula Integration, at George Washington University (GWU) under the direction of Dr. Saniya LeBlanc are to develop cohorts of highly trained students using a two-year Nanotechnology Fellows Program comprised of undergraduate students who progress from trainees to experts on new nano-fabrication and characterization tools. 2. Integrate nanotechnology research and concepts into the curriculum across multiple disciplines and years through two new courses, Nanotechnology Devices &amp; Systems: How They Are Made, Measured, and Monetized and Connecting Nanotechnology to Your World. 3. Provide teaching and learning resources and experiences for college and 6-12 grade teachers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program targets students early in their undergraduate careers and brings together students from a wide range of disciplines including science, engineering, business, and policy. It provides these students with intense training on sophisticated equipment and engages them with nanotechnology research and applications. Pulling from multiple departments, it creates a community of students who undergo learning and training together while contributing perspectives from diverse disciplinary and personal backgrounds. The proposed courses would achieve integration of nanotechnology into multiple departments curricula without requiring extensive modification of core curriculum classes or adding significant credit requirements. Projects will increase student interest in nanotechnology and core curricula by providing real-world examples of how they are related. The proposed program uses undergraduate students as nanotechnology ambassadors who disseminate nanotechnology into the broader community through innovative, interactive resources which are shared with college and middle and high school teachers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities will create and prepare a future workforce to invent and implement next-generation technologies.  Student-developed teaching and leaerning resources will be disseminated across GWU, to other universities, and into the hands of teachers and students at all-girls and multicultural schools in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project addressed key problems in implementing nanotechnology education: (1) science and engineering curricula are already full; (2) practical, hands-on experiences require extensive training on complex, expensive equipment; and (3) necessary fundamental concepts and knowledge span multiple disciplines and are rarely taught at the undergraduate level. This project integrates nanotechnology research and concepts into the undergraduate curriculum through two new courses. The project also resulted in the creation of an undergraduate Nanotechnology Fellows Program to prepare the future workforce for emerging technologies. The program has technical training combining theory and practice, focused research projects, professional development, and outreach activities. Fellows receive intense, hands-on training on state-of-the-art tools in the GW Nanofabrication and Imaging Center, and they complete a research project specializing in fabrication or characterization. Fellows present their work at conferences, participate in research projects, and conduct outreach workshops with K-12 students. The program has had 26 undergraduates (including a veteran supported by an NSF Veterans Research Supplement), and program results have been presented at conferences and in peer-reviewed papers.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong> The project integrated emerging technologies and research into existing curricula across multiple disciplines. It provided a novel approach to seeding and stimulating interest in nanotechnology early on in students&rsquo; careers, and it delivered nanotechnology resources (equipment, infrastructure, and expertise) to audiences who otherwise are not exposed to nanotechnology.</p> <p><strong>Broader impact:</strong> The project fostered interdisciplinary collaboration of students and faculty with participation from seven different science and engineering departments. The Fellows were tasked with being &ldquo;nanotechnology ambassadors,&rdquo; and hundreds of high school and college students have been reached by the Fellows&rsquo; outreach activities (workshops for K-12 students, research showcase presentations, and presentations at national and international conferences).</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key Outcomes</strong></span></p> <p>An undergraduate Nanotechnology Fellows Program was created and included 26 undergraduate students (13 men, 13 women) from 7 disciplines (mechanical/aerospace engineering, electrical/computer engineering, systems engineering, biomedical engineering, civil engineering, physics, and computer science). Students were introduced to foundational nanotechnology topics (materials, fabrication, characterization, monetization) and hands-on training on nanotechnology equipment (electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, lithography). All students conducted research projects on nanotechnology topics.</p> <p>Seven graduate students served as laboratory and teaching assistants training undergraduate students on nanotechnology topics and equipment as well as mentoring the undergraduates&rsquo; research projects.</p> <p>Undergraduate students participated in academic skills and professional development workshops on creating and giving technical presentations, designing research posters, delivering an elevator pitch, improving resumes, and developing critical reading skills.</p> <p>Two undergraduate classes (Nanotechnology Devices &amp; Systems: How They are Made, Measured, and Monetized; Connecting Nanotechnology to Your World) were created and taught to 49 students.</p> <p>Outreach activities were done by undergraduate students to introduce K-12 students to age-appropriate nano- and micro-technology topics. These activities included scanning electron and atomic force microscopy demonstrations, microfluidics fabrication activities, material structure activities, smartphone microscopy activities, YouTube video about &ldquo;gowning up&rdquo; for nanofabrication facilities, webinars, and discussions about college (admissions, choosing a major, college life). Notably, students and teachers from a multicultural Washington, DC public high school participated annually. On National Nanotechnology Day, the Fellows created social media posts describing the impact of their nanotechnology program and research project experiences.
