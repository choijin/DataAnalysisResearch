<AbstractNarration>Despite the emphasis in public discourse on the value of a four-year college education, in 2011 only 30 percent of young adults in the United States had completed a bachelor's degree, a fraction that is expected to increase slowly over the next decade. Moreover, some of the fastest growing technical occupations, such as energy production technology and information technology, demand skills most often acquired in settings other than four-year college degree programs. This project is not only clarifying workers' options for preparing for middle-skill technical jobs but also identifying needed improvements in the management, coordination, and financing of such pathways, thus contributing to expanding opportunities for individuals and for employers in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Research Council (NRC) and the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) are collaborating to conduct a consensus study of the multiple education and training pathways to middle-skill technical jobs that do not require a baccalaureate or higher degree. The NRC and NAE are convening an expert committee to examine the coverage, effectiveness, and flexibility of these avenues of technical preparation and skill certification and the extent of coordination among them. In addition to reviewing the literature, the expert committee is convening a national symposium to gather evidence on these topics. The committee is authoring a consensus report with conclusions and action-oriented recommendations for improving the various technical education, training, and certification programs, creating a more coherent and effective system of workforce preparation, and communicating options to citizens interested in pursuing careers in such occupations. The report is expected to guide federal and state policymakers and administrators, educators, employers, labor organizations,and other stakeholders in preparing Americans for middle-skill jobs supporting middle-class livelihoods and in meeting employer needs for a skilled, competitive workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to recommendations to policymakers, employers, and other stakeholders, an important product of the project will be a road map to training, education and certification opportunities, useful to counselors but couched in terms accessible to individuals seeking to improve their skills and employment opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the NRC's institutional policies, the committee's report is being reviewed anonymously by experts who did not serve on the study committee but who represent a range of expertise comparable to that of committee members. In keeping with standard NRC policy, the sponsor does not have a role in the process but is informed of the conclusions and recommendations when the institution certifies successful completion of the review.</AbstractNarration>

Evidence indicates that the returns to investments in technical skills in the labor market are strong when students successfully complete their training and gain credentials sought by employers, but it noted that in many instances, workers either are not taking advantage of these opportunities or are failing to complete their training programs.

In this polycentric system, the committee writes, making better use of available resources and generating better outcomes requires improving coordination between students and educational or training institutions, between secondary and postsecondary institutions, and especially between training institutions and employers through a variety of public, private, and hybrid mechanisms.  The committee?s findings and recommendations are designed to help overcome some of the barriers identified in the report. The committee?s recommendations call for specific actions by Congress, federal agencies, state governments, employers, and civic organizations to improve the American system of workforce development.   Among the committee's recommendations were the following:  State and federal policy makers should support and enhance strategies that help students successfully complete their training for the skilled technical workforce. In addition, public policies should ensure that stakeholders, including students, workers, employers, and educational organizations, have the right incentives to improve the quality of technical education and training, encourage experimentation and collaboration, and improve the collection and use of relevant information.  An alliance of industry, trade, academic, and civic associations and labor unions, in cooperation with the U.S. Departments of Labor and Education, should organize a nationwide public&ndash;private communication campaign to raise awareness of the value of and demand for skilled technical workers and the return on investment for individuals preparing for these careers. This campaign should be customized to recognize local variations in skilled technical workforce education, training, and labor market requirements. Congress and state legislatures should improve oversight of public policies and resources, highlighting the implementation of reforms such as those called for in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). Reforms should be accelerated through targeted incentives. Congress, state legislatures, and agencies of the federal and state governments should improve the workforce labor market information system (WLMIS), labor market data, and research tools and methods, including by providing funding for such activities. Federal and state agencies should remove barriers to worker mobility, such as licensing and certification requirements that are not related to public safety. They also should improve labor market information on the changing requirements for skilled technical workers to help reduce imbalances in labor markets and to align workforce development with advances in science and technology. The Department of Defense should further integrate skills transition into military training rather than treating it as a separate component at the end of the service member?s career. While selected programs and policies from other countries have been adapted in the United States, federal agencies should further study the conditions under which particular attributes of apprenticeships or other programs can be effectively applied more broadly.
