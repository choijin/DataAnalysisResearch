<AbstractNarration>Adhesion is an important consideration in construction and repair. Organisms have evolved different adhesives for survival in nearly every environment on earth. In chemical adhesion the formation of chemical bonds and sharing of electrons create attractive forces between surfaces. For example, spiders utilize a sticky aggregate glue to keep their prey ensnared in their webs. This project will test how adhesion strength of aggregate glue varies based on surface roughness, hydrophilicity, and chemical composition. In collaboration with Dr. Tadashi Miyashita at the Unversity of Tokyo - the only researcher to have previously studied the silk of the spider Cytarachne - the research will be determined which surface characteristics have served as evolutionary pressures, leading to optimal glue adhesion. Identification of the chemical composition of glue droplets will be conducted. By studying spiders, it can lead to the utilization and mimicking of aggregate glue chemical compounds leading to substrate specific synthetic adhesive products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aggregate silk is composed of a glycoprotein core and an aqueous droplet of salts. The combination of salts and the glycoproteins act together to form a bond between the silk threads and prey. Spiders from the genus Cyrtarachne are specialized moth-hunting orb-weavers, only found within Asia and more commonly in Japan. These spiders have evolved to prey on moths by utilizing reduced orb webs with unusually large, viscous droplets of glue. Successful prey capture relies primarily on the prolonged adhesion between the glue and exoskeleton. Varying surface structures and chemical compositions may react with glycoproteins and hydroscopic salts differently resulting in scenarios in which Cyrtarachne aggregate glue under or over performs. Adhesion tests will be conducted by the pull-off method. Information will be gained on what chemicals they contain, and when they are strongest. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The previously described unique qualities found of Cyrtarachne silk have been verified and  further analyzed. The capture threads of this genus showed average tensile capabilities. Both toughness and elongation increased as humidity was increased. It is especially unsurprising since Cyrtarachne will only build webs at 80-90% humidity. The severe decrease in toughness/elongation at lower humidity helps explain why Cyrtarachne is so specific about its web building environment.  While it has been shown that silk can be restored nearly to new by re-hydration, Cyrtarachne aggregate glue seems to behave differently from other silks in this respect. It has been documented that capture threads can often stretch anywhere between two and ten times its original length. Cyrtarachne seems to be on the highly extensible end, and can stretch upwards of 8 times its starting length once rehydrated.  One of the key features of aggregate glue is its responsiveness to humidity. The droplets of aggregate glue of orb-weaver species have been shown to increase in diameter at increasing humidity. It is thus not strange that the droplets of Cyrtarachne also behave this way. It shows that even though aggregate glue quickly dries and undergoes an irreversible phase change, the salts in the droplets still function and expand.  Fresh silk had a much larger adhesion strength to that of its dried counterparts, however, it was shown that while small, the adhesion strength of rehydrate silk does exist. For fresh samples the work to release is equal to stronger species, Argiope, and up to 10 times higher than other commonly tested orb-weaving spiders. Cyrtarachne's glue droplets which are between five and 10 times larger than other species, and thus this makes the silk proportionally on par with other species.  These rehydrated glue values fall in line with the strength of other orb-weaver species, though it is important to note that these species generally utilize multiple strands of this strength to capture prey while Cyrtarachne relies on one or two. This hints at it being difficult or impossible for Cyrtarachne to capture prey once aggregate glue has undergone a phase change and might explain why it recycles its web nightly.  The strength of fresh aggregate glue while impressive does not seem explain how Cyrtarachne is able to catch moths so much easier than other orb-weaving species. A moth coming into contact with a single thread of this strength does not logically seem to be more advantageous than coming into contact with several weaker threads and being tangled in them. While proportionally weaker, the set up of normal orb-webs causes moths to strike a higher amount of strands and thus have higher amount of total adhesion.  We found that fresh droplets spread upon contact with a surface, as was expected. We compared this to observations during rehydrate tests which appeared to show that the droplets failed to spread during substrate contact. The material properties of these droplets are very different from other observed aggregate glues and lead us to conduct the NMR examination. Aggregate glue salt composition is only beginning to be analyzed so while we can comment on differences in composition and behavior, direct correlations cannot be drawn.  It may be because of the small sample size but Cyrtarachne seems to have a significantly smaller variety of LMWCs present in its glue.  The most interesting peak is that of C, which has not been currently found to be present in any other tested spider species. This compound might be responsible for the strange behavior of Cyrtarachne silk. Its identify is currently being evaluated.  It is possible that this aggregate glue might set faster or become stronger when comparing hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces and looking at glue strength on natural prey cuticle might hint at other unique properties of Cyrtarachne silk. Further tests will need to be conducted to determine at which conditions this glue preforms...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
