<AbstractNarration>The National Research Council in 2013 released the report Monitoring Progress toward Successful K-12 STEM Education: A Nation Advancing?, which outlined 14 Indicators as well as the needed research and development to create a system to monitor the quality of STEM education in the nation. This project is funded in response to a Dear Colleague Letter request for research in the Promoting Innovation in Measurement and Evaluation program focused on developing research and tools to advance the nation's capability to measure these indicators. The researchers in this project will engage an expert panel to identify key aspects of the science practices articulated in the new college and career-readiness standards, and develop and validate an instrument to be used as an indicator of science classroom coverage of content and practices as articulated in the new standards. This project will contribute to advancing knowledge about how to measure students' opportunity to learn in science classrooms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities will be carried out in three phases. In phase one, an expert panel will be convened in a modified-Delphi process to identify the key aspects of science practices at different grade bands and domains of science. The resulting framework will be used in phase two to develop selected-response survey items for measuring teachers? use of the practices. In phase three of the study, cognitive interviews, observations of teachers' classroom practices, and factor analysis of a pilot test of the items will be conducted to validate the measures. A user manual will be produced that includes evidence of the items' validity and scale reliability so that the instrument might be used by other researchers and contribute to future nationally representative studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Operationalizing the Science and Engineering Practices was funded as an EAGER project to identify key aspects of the science practices articulated in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and develop and validate an instrument to be used as an indicator of classroom coverage of the science practices.  Although the NGSS provide a description of what students should be able to do by the end of each grade band in relation to a particular practice, there is currently limited guidance for educators on what these practices should "look like" in the classroom and lack of instrumentation to measure classroom coverage of the science content and practices.  This project contributed to advancing knowledge about how the science practices could be integrated into science instruction, and how to measure student opportunity to engage in the practices.      In order to meet project goals, a literature review was conducted and an expert panel was convened in a modified-Delphi process to identify the key aspects of science practices in different grade bands and domains of science.  These results informed the development of selected-response survey items for measuring the opportunities teachers provide for students to engage in the practices.  Cognitive interviews and factor analysis of a large-scale pilot test of the items were conducted to validate the measures.      The project developed several products that can be used by (1) practitioners at all levels of the education system who are working to incorporate the NGSS into science classrooms, and (2) researchers who are studying the implementation of the NGSS.  The project developed a primer titled, What Does "Implementing the NGSS" Mean?  Operationalizing the Science Practices for K&ndash;12 Classrooms.  The primer describes how the practices were "unpacked" and important principles learned as a result of this process.  The primer also provides operationalized definitions and key elements of each practice, i.e., what students should be doing when engaging with each science practice.  Finally, the primer presents vignettes that illustrate how students might engage in the practices, as well as cross-vignette reflections that pull out for the reader how the practices are illustrated in the vignettes.     In addition, the project developed a selected-response survey for measuring teacher use of the practices, along with a user guide that includes evidence of the survey items? validity and reliability.  The user guide includes four main sections.  The first describes the item development process (unpacking the content domain, item writing, cognitive interviews, item revising).  The second provides details on the pilot.  The third section describes the measurement properties of the instrument, including results of the factor analyses and model fit statistics.  The fourth section provides information about appropriate use of the instrument.     Products from the Operationalizing the Science and Engineering Practices project are available at no cost on the Horizon Research, Inc. website:  http://www.horizon-research.com.
