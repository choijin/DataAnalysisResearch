<AbstractNarration>Military veterans hold tremendous promise for expanding and diversifying the engineering workforce. Given the diverse backgrounds of veterans, their increasing numbers, and the growing national demand for engineers, the timing is ideal to study the conditions under which veterans pursue and succeed in engineering education. Student veterans bring valuable assets to their engineering education, but more research is needed to understand their academic and social acculturation into campus life. Therefore, this project aims to (1) identify why veterans pursue bachelor's degrees in engineering, (2) illustrate veteran experiences in engineering education, and (3) advance knowledge on how academic institutions can further support veterans in engineering. This comparative case study of student veterans in engineering across four academic institutions will include interviews of student veterans and key stakeholders, as well as a content analysis of materials and websites related to student veteran issues and concerns. The interdisciplinary research team from engineering, sociology, and education brings expertise on veterans, gender, race/ethnicity, social capital, and persistence in higher education that provides a strong foundation for advancing knowledge in engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supporting more veterans to transition to successful careers in engineering is a vital service to the nation. Broadening the participation of veterans in engineering offers the potential to enhance diversity in engineering across multiple dimensions since, compared to civilian students, veterans are more likely to be older, first-generation college, disabled, African-American, or Latino. The study results will provide context and information for various applications, such as: development of new strategies to support student veterans' success, identification of overlooked areas to promote student veterans' participation in engineering, and generation of critical information for development of larger-scale studies for investigating student veterans in engineering. A comprehensive dissemination plan ensures that the study results, particularly the best practices for supporting veterans in engineering, reach diverse audiences interested in student veterans and engineering education. The advisory board includes a variety of stakeholders who have the interest, expertise, and commitment to act on the policy implications of the study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the Post-9/11 and Forever GI Bills, educational benefits for veterans have become more generous, encouraging more service members to pursue higher education.  At the same time, the United States has a critical need for engineering professionals and veterans represent a pool of potential engineers.  We interviewed 60 student veterans in engineering (SVEs) at four colleges across the USA to highlight their voices.  Our research project resulted in 4 journal papers published, 4 journal papers under review, and 29 presentations at conferences.  We received the 2017 Best Paper award from the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Military and Veterans Division.  We have shared our work with engineering educators, student affairs? professionals, the Student Veterans of America (SVA), social scientists, and the public.  We developed tip sheets for military services members considering college and considering engineering and for faculty interested in support SVEs.  https://www.sandiego.edu/engineering/programs/integrated-engineering/susan-vet.php.  Intellectual Merit:  Our study demonstrated that veterans have many assets that enable them to be successful students and valuable contributors to the engineering workforce.  Emphasizing the assets that student veterans bring to engineering education can help current military personnel to better recognize their potential as engineers, current student veterans to celebrate their successes, and military leaders to better support military-connected students.   Military service can be an important entryway to engineering.  Many SVEs described how military experiences contributed to their decision to major in engineering and discussed a direct connection between their military work and their engineering studies.  For some SVEs, their job in the military exposed them directly to engineering-related tasks.  In some cases, SVEs said they entered the military with a strong interest in engineering and that the military reinforced these interests.  The SVEs? experiences in the military often prepared them well for the demands of engineering education. Assets that veterans bring to engineering education include discipline, technical skills, teamwork, and leadership.  Academically, the transition to engineering education was easier for those who had prior training in technical fields.  The training that they received gave them a practical understanding of undergraduate engineering classwork and hands-on experience.  Students without a technical background still found that the discipline and other personal characteristics and professional skills instilled in them through their military service, such as persistence, respect for authority, and patience, were assets that contributed to their academic success.  Leadership and teamwork skills gained in the military contributed to some SVEs? academic success, as they applied these skills to promote team effectiveness and positive academic outcomes.  By focusing on understanding their peers? perspectives and serving as role models, SVEs not only helped strengthen the bonds between team members, but also contributed to the overall quality of their classmates? education.  Veterans followed diverse pathways from the military to majoring in engineering.  Some pursued a career in the military, retired, and then went to college.  Others served in the military for a shorter time, or started college after high school, and then went to the military and then back to college.  Some SVEs took college classes while in the military to better prepare them for the transition to full-time study at a four-year college.  Some transferred between colleges.   In the course of doing this research project, we developed qualitative research tools to help elicit stories from our student veterans. Tools such as an identity circle allow participants to describe the centrality of various identities (e.g., gender, race, combat veteran) to their core self and help the interviewer to broach more difficult topics such as disability or combat injury. A timeline allows participants to reflect upon and describe how various life events have impacted their engineering education experiences. These tools can be useful to other researchers seeking to understand the experiences of specific populations where direct questions may not be the best approach. We have shared this work via journal publications and conferences.  Broader Impacts:  Our study results can help military leaders and engineers more effectively support service members considering engineering careers and SVEs who have left the military to pursue engineering education.  Clarifying the connections between technical experience and academic engineering education could help service members and veterans identify with these fields and see their potential as engineers.  Service members with less technical responsibility in their military jobs may be more attracted to engineering by messages related to financial opportunities and job security in engineering fields.  Leaders can use an asset-based framework to help more SVEs translate their leadership skills to an academic setting.  This is beneficial for meeting the USA?s workforce needs.  Our study demonstrated that military service is an important entryway to engineering education. Military service provides invaluable training and leadership skills that are critical for the next generation of engineers, whether they end up working in the civilian or military sector.
