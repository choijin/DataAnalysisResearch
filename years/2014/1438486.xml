<AbstractNarration>Title: Control of Photopolymerization Kinetics and Thermodynamics in Self-assembled Surfactant Systems to Direct Polymer Nanostructure&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1438486&lt;br/&gt;PI: C. Allan Guymon&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Iowa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research has shown that nanotechnology, or the ability to control material structures at very small size scales, can provide unique and useful properties not accessible in traditional materials.  Controlling organic polymer structure in materials similar to plastics and contact lenses at the nanometer scale has shown great promise in improving performance. There have been recent advances in developing nanoscale structure in polymer networks using surfactant, or soap, have involved self-assemblies, which are of particular interest.  These surfactant (soap) molecules form lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) in the presence of water that organize into ordered nanometer scale features which can be used to direct, or template, polymer structures. Materials made up of polymers templated by LLC phases have shown great potential in their response to temperature.  They can be used as membranes and scaffolds to regenerate biological tissue.  Controlling the structure during the polymerization is still difficult with structures typically being much different than the original template, and thus less useful.  For this project the PI will use the speed of polymerization in systems with optimized stability to direct polymer structure evolution within LLC templates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal is to control photopolymerization kinetics and thermodynamics before and during polymerization, and surfactant/monomer chemistry to understand and direct the structural evolution of polymers formed using LLC media. The PI will modulate surfactant and monomer chemical structure and reactivity to reinforce thermodynamic stability of the LLC-self-assembly to improve interactions between the growing polymer network and the template. These systems will be modeled using computational methods to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of the templating mixtures. It is believed that the use of radical photopolymerization will play a pivotal role in successful completion of this work.  Photopolymerization provides the ability to polymerize in fractions of a second at a wide range of temperatures, thereby allowing kinetic trapping of otherwise thermodynamically unfavorable polymer nanostructures.  Polymer nanostructures formed from both traditional chain and thiol-ene step growth photopolymerization mechanisms will be investigated.  Critical for project success is the connection between the polymerization kinetics and polymer structure evolution.  Polymerization rate, conversion, and phase separation will be monitored in real time using photo-differential scanning calorimetry and through infra-red and Raman spectroscopy experiments. Thermodynamics and kinetics will be correlated to nanostructure before, during, and after polymerization using numerous characterization techniques (small angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, solid state and solution NMR). The PI believes that this research will outline the kinetic and thermodynamic factors necessary to direct and control the ultimate polymer nanostructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a relatively simple approach to controllably produce nanostructured organic polymeric materials. Polymers with controlled nano-scale geometries will exhibit unique transport properties and size selectivity, which are critical for advances in applications such as water purification, stimuli response, tissue scaffolds, and hydrogels. A prevailing theme for this research will be student education.  Extensive involvement of undergraduate and graduate researchers in a discovery learning environment will be emphasized.  Minority undergraduate and graduate researchers will be recruited as part of the NSF REU Program in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. Additionally, the importance of polymers, nanotechnology, and chemical engineering will be brought to high school students as part of two modules presented yearly to chemistry classes at both local and rural high schools.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ability to control structure on extremely small scales (e.g. nanometers, less than 1/100,000 the diameter of a human hair) allows for unique changes in material properties. Materials with nanostructure can be created using light as an energy source to induce the reaction to join multiple small molecules (monomers) quickly to form large molecules (polymers), a process called photopolymerization. Our project has focused on understanding the influence of the speed of photopolymerization and inherent structure stability on the ability to form polymer nanostructures in lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) systems. LLCs are simply formed using soap, or surfactant, molecules in water. Depending on the type of surfactant and concentration of water, a wide variety of nanostructures are formed. We have found that ordered LLCs structures (Fig. 1), can be used to template these same structures onto polymers (Fig. 2). Unfortunately, this nanostructure is typically lost during polymerization. To maintain polymer nanostructure, we have shown that the speed or rate of the polymerization reactions is critical. &nbsp;In fact, fast rates allow trapping of the LLC nanostructure in the polymer before the polymer, water, and surfactant can separate into different phases. The ability to tailor polymer structure from the nanometer to micrometer scale using widely available and inexpensive monomers makes photopolymerization within LLC solvents an attractive method for the development of polymers with a wide range of properties.</p> <p>This project has focused on constructing ordered nanostructured polymer network. A polymer network can be visualized by thinking of a spider web. Large distances between connections weaken the network. However, much as a spider does when spinning a web, a network with an ordered structure and regularly spaced connections will result in a stronger and more resilient network. When polymer networks are formed in a more controlled manner, the network can be stronger and stretch further. Our research has been able to prove that the type of building block, or monomer, from which the network is formed can lead to significantly different polymer structures and properties.</p> <p>Our research has been able to show the influence of this nanostructure on polymerization speed, or rate, and polymer size. The results showed that highly ordered phases cause a dramatic acceleration of the rate (Fig. 3) and polymer size compared to disordered counterparts. Fast polymerization results in ordered, homogeneous polymer structures, whereas slower polymerization yields a less defined and phase&#8208;separated structures. Moreover, the effect of the inherent stability of the LLC/monomer/polymer system has been examined through the incorporation of surfactant in the polymer network. These reactive surfactants not only become part of the LLC nanostructure but also participate in the polymerization reaction. This addition of reactive surfactants leads to significantly increased retention of the nanostructure after polymerization. Consequently, the nanostructured polymers show enhanced swelling along with increased molecular transport and mechanical stability. The observed increases in polymer properties are analogous to those seen in architectured ceramics and cellular foams. These results may be used to develop hydrogels with highly ordered nanostructures and property relationships for advanced biological and industrial applications, including catalytic supports, separations media, drug delivery systems, and artificial implants.</p> <p>Additionally, we have created improved hydrogels, i.e. polymers that swell in water, with controlled nanostructure. We were able to combine polymers that release water at higher temperatures (temperature responsive) with those that absorb many times their mass in water (super-absorbant) and still form ordered polymer networks. These polymers absorb significantly more water and release the water to a greater degree and much faster than similar unordered polymers (Fig. 4). Moreover, these ordered hydrogels are much more mechanically stable. These results could allow development and optimization of hydrogels with water swelling and release along with mechanical properties required for successful performance in applications such as artificial muscles, membranes, actuators, drug delivery vehicles, and chemical sensors.</p> <p>In summary, the roles of polymerization kinetics and thermodynamic stability of polymers have been determined in forming ordered polymer structures when templated by LLCs and photopolymerization. We have examined how the chemical structure and type of monomer along with the stability of the LLC and speed of polymerization influence the retention of nanostructure. This understanding and nanostructure control has enabled access to unique properties that have shown great promise in improving and expanding material applications to address societal needs and the problems of tomorrow.</p> <p>Additionally, the Principal Investigator, Professor Allan Guymon, has continued to encourage greater participation in chemical engineering and other STEM fields through this project. As ?Polymer Man? he has presented a two-day polymer module in an individual class setting to over 3000 chemistry students over the past 20 years. Through both lectures and demonstrations, students have gained valuable perspective and opened students to the great possibilities available in materials, chemistry, and chemical engineering.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Allan&nbsp;Guymon</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1438486/1438486_10307845_1596148859984_OutcomesFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1438486/1438486_10307845_1596148859984_OutcomesFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="LLC Phases"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1438486/1438486_10307845_1596148859984_OutcomesFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="LLC Phases"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
