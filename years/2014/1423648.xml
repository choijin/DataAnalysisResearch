<AbstractNarration>This project studies the information limits of communication through waves propagating in multiple scattering environments. Exploiting the physics of the wave propagation process, the main objective is to merge wave theory and information theory to reveal new perspectives that are not captured by the mainstream probabilistic models. Results will include information limits obtained by observing physical quantities at certain asymptotic scales where finite dimensionality emerges and observational uncertainties are averaged out. These asymptotic scales are both temporal and spatial and allow us to identify the fundamental tradeoffs in the practical design of communication systems that are directly connected to the physics of the propagation process. The project will build upon the rigorous notion of degrees of freedom of a waveform and study their limits in different asymptotic regimes and scattering configurations. This includes the study of sparse signals and attempts to characterize their information content in terms of degrees of freedom. We expect to draw connections between information theory, electromagnetics, and functional analysis. In addition, connections between information theory and the concepts of metric entropy and capacities for band-limited space-time waveforms will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project departs from the traditional research in wireless communication that has expanded the knowledge tree into an intricate forest of narrow cases. Starting from first physical principles it will attempt to re-order, reinterpret, and prune the knowledge tree, revealing its basic skeleton. In doing so, it will also provide insights into the design and operation of next-generation communication systems, including MIMO communication systems, imaging systems, remote sensing systems, and radar systems. Mathematical aspects include advancements in approximation theory, functional analysis, and harmonic analysis of square-integrable, quasi-bandlimited functions. On the education front, a new generation of students will be educated, and a new book will be published impacting broadly the graduate engineering curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Information theory seeks to determine the ultimate limits for the communication of information. Being a mathematical theory developed in an engineering setting, it abstracts out the physics, providing results within the context of a given mathematical model. This abstraction is certainly useful, and sometime necessary to handle the complexity of the design, but it also comes at the price of hiding physical insights.    The main idea at the basis of this project  has been to uncover  fundamental limits of information by  merging the mathematics with the   physical aspects of the communication process. In this way, information theory becomes broader, leading to many new and relevant results. We developed   a deterministic  approach to describe the amount of information carried by waves, which better suits the determinism describing the wave propagation process.   Deriving  information-theoretic limits  in a continous wave setting may seem problematic at first sigh, because  a wave can in principle have infinitely many configurations, carrying an infinite amount of information. However,  we have shown that physical constraints due to  the wave's boundary conditions impose a certain indetermination that precludes the possibility of observing the shape of the waveform with arbitrary precision.  This indetermination comes from the wave description directly, without relying on postulates or probabilities,it reduces to quantum indetermination in a precise limiting sense, and ensures that the amount of information carried by waves is always finite.  Taking   physical   limitations into account is crucial for characterizing the performance of next generation (5G) mmWave and massive MIMO systems. It has been repeatedly observed in  the literature that  a pure mathematical treatment of communication systems without consistent link to physical quantities   is questionable. Our project has contributed to providing this missing link.  A key outcome for the project has been to develop new methods for deriving information-theoretic results for these systems in accordance to wave-theoretic aspects.    Another  main outcome has been  to show that a   wave field treatment can reveal information-theoretic limits due to propagation in multiple scattering environment, as well as quantum information limits.  They can be computed for both point to point (by taking the time) and   MIMO (by taking the space) systems. One basic result has been that the the amount of information carried by the field is proportional to the area of the   the system enclosing the sources rather than to its volume.  It follows that placing more than two  arrays in parallel constitutes a redundant system, even if they are separated from each other by many wavelengths.   A more detailed description of the obtained results  can be found in several conference and journal publications in the field that were a direct outcome of the project.
