<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to University of Virginia's Mountain Lake Biological Station, located in Giles County, Virginia, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2019. The project supports guided but independent, self-motivated original biological research in field-based ecology, evolution, and behavior. Students live and work full-time at the biological field station. They participate in formal training in the design and conduct of research, scientific ethics and professional behavior, writing and presentation techniques, and other matters of scientific and academic life. Students prepare written and oral proposals and final reports. Participants are included in the rich, supportive, collaborative, and stimulating intellectual and social life at the field station. Mountain Lake has hosted a NSF REU-Sites program since 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 50 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. A high proportion of program alumni publish their work (33%) and matriculate in graduate programs (44%). The program includes women (72% in past years), students from small colleges (39%), and participants from groups underrepresented in science (35%). The project partners with three outside groups: Hampton University (HBCU), University of Puerto Rico, and the Ecological Society of America's SEEDS program. Students are recruited nationwide via a nearly 1000-member list of personal and organizational contacts and partner pre-screening. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://mlbs.org/reuprogram or by contacting the PI (Dr. Eric Nagy at enagy@virginia.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Butch Brodie at bbrodie@virginia.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Mountain Lake Biological Station (MLBS, University of Virginia, mlbs.org/reuprogram) offers ten students each summer an opportunity to conduct independent, self-motivated, interdisciplinary, and original biological research in experimental, field-based ecology, evolution, and behavior. Under the close supervision and guidance of a research mentor, and the program coordinator, students design, execute, analyze, interpret, and present a self-contained research project within the ten weeks of the summer program. Students participate in weekly seminars and several intensive workshops on the design and conduct of research, scientific ethics, writing and presentation techniques, and other matters of scientific and academic life. Students prepare written and oral proposals and final reports. Many student projects are published in leading peer-reviewed journals. Participants also take advantage of the rich, varied, and stimulating intellectual and social life at Mountain Lake Biological Station. MLBS hosts two formal research seminars per week, which include both in-house and invited speakers. All Station residents eat meals together in the common dining hall, and most daily activity revolves around the central lab building where all research programs are housed. And since field sites are often within walking distance, interactions among all Station users occur constantly, resulting in a remarkably supportive and collaborative environment. Researchers from large universities and small colleges return to the Station year after year &ndash; some for ten, twenty, even thirty years. Sixty-to-eighty principal investigators, course faculty, post-docs, graduate and undergraduate students are in residence at the Station throughout the summer. MLBS has hosted an NSF REU-Sites program since 1993 and has graduated 299 students, 46 in this five-year project. Over half of these students have gone on to pursue graduate training in biology. 12 scientific papers were written, and 22 professional presentations and posters were given. The program is very successful at attracting women (72%), members of underrepresented groups (39%), and students from small colleges where research may not be a focus. A historically black college (HBCU), a national minority-focused student training program, and a Puerto Rican university are active partners in the program.</p> <p>Complete program information, past projects, potential projects for future summers, and on-line application material are available at mlbs.org/reuprogram.
