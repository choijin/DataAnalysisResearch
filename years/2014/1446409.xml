<AbstractNarration>This award support a workshop on Computational Challenges in Future Mobile Health (mHealth) Systems and Applications.  Recent advances in mobile technology have opened up enormous opportunities for scientific advances and new tools that may improve patients' health and well-being. mHealth technologies offer real-time monitoring and detection of changes in health status, support the adoption and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, provide rapid diagnosis of health conditions, and facilitate the implementation of interventions ranging from promoting patient self-care to providing remote healthcare services. To realize the potential of mHealth, however, significant innovations in computing are needed. These innovations, however, must be closely integrated and informed by close collaboration with health researchers for them to contribute to improving human health. Due to the rich and unique challenges inherent in mHealth, there is an opportunity to advance computing methods in the process of advancing mHealth. A systematic discussion is needed among mHealth thought leaders to outline a grand vision for computing research in mHealth and identify the major hurdles and opportunities for advancing mHealth.  The content of workshop presentations, speeches, and discussions will be made available on the web so they may be shared freely, with the expectation that the use of these materials in published work will credit the original author/source. It is anticipated that, by providing a forum that facilitates crosstalk among thought leaders from the range of stakeholders interested in mHealth, a signature contribution towards NSF?s interests in this broader scientific agenda will be made.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of the project was in developing a computational research agenda to spur mHealth research in the CISE community. This project convened a 1-day workshop (called "National Workshop on Computational Challenges in Future Mobile Health (mHealth) Systems and Applications") of mHealth thought leaders at the NIH campus on October 29th 2014, a day prior to the Wireless Health conference. In addition to attracting leading computing researchers working in mHealth, the workshop was attended by researchers from a variety of other discplines (including, but not limited to, medicine, behavioral science, statistics, nutrition, and nursing) working in academia, industry, and public sector. The attendees ranged across all career stages (e.g., assistant professors, associate professors, full professors, program directors, institute directors, etc.). Research agenda for 15 different topics covering the three goals were developed, which were summarized in an IEEE Computer article and a book chapter.  This workshop inspired a new introductory book on mobile health (called "Mobile Health: Sensors, Analytic Methods, and Applications" by Springer) that provides a gentle introduction to newcomers to mHealth and provides key research directions to pursue doctoral dissertation works.   The broader impact of the work was in involving all the relevant disciplines that must work collaboratively to advance mobile health. The project provided a forum for a multidisciplinary stakeholder community to come together and develop future research agenda. In addition, the project supported the participation of predoctoral and young investigators to participate in annual mHealth Training Institutes, an immersive training experience where the trainees are provided with a core educational grounding in mHealth perspectives and methodologies and help inculcate the intrapersonal and interpersonal skills and attitudes necessary for transdisciplinary collaborations.  For continuous and wide dissemination a comprehensive collaboratory website called mHealthHUB has been set up that archives videos from all the mHealth training institutes. In addition, mHealthHUB posts news, job postings, and new research results. It also provides example IRB languages for new research studies on mobile health and some example data sets, together with links to download MD2K software for mHealth data collection and analysis.
