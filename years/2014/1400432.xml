<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is currently an intense worldwide movement to explore the role of the electron spin (a quantum-mechanical magnetic property of the electron) in addition to the electron's charge in contemporary electronics, with an eye on increasing the functionality of electronic microchip devices, particularly in the realm of computation. This award supports a project aimed at addressing this issue by employing state-of-the-art techniques to fabricate and characterize a series of novel semiconductor nanometer scale structures in which the role of the electron spin is enhanced by incorporating magnetic ions. By training graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge semiconductor fabrication techniques as well as in designing multi-functional materials, the project is expected to have broad impact far beyond its immediate purely scientific goals. Skills in these areas of materials science are in wide demand in U.S. Industry, National Laboratories, and Academia. Additionally, the Notre Dame team collaborates with many scientists (currently with more than thirty-five other institutions) either by providing research samples or by carrying out joint experiments. This activity of dissemination and sharing of results and know-how (which has the added benefit of exposing students to inter-institutional and inter-disciplinary team collaborations) is expected to further expand as new spin-based electronic materials are developed in the course of the present project.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports a project that focuses on two new but complementary areas involving spin phenomena in low-dimensional magnetic semiconductor systems. (a) The study of changes in the properties of ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors as their size approaches nanometer dimensions; and (b) exploratory research on growth and properties of phosphide-based FM semiconductors, such as GaMnP and InMnP. Area (a) is motivated by the expectation that, as the physical size of a magnetic semiconductor such as GaMnAs approaches the nanometer scale and becomes comparable to, e.g., the width of ferromagnetic domain walls or the free carrier depletion length, its magnetic properties will significantly change. This becomes especially important as one considers applications of FM semiconductor devices in nanotechnology. Using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) followed by lithographic techniques, the Notre Dame team proposes to explore the consequences of such reduced size by magnetization measurements, magneto-transport, magneto-optical studies, and ferromagnetic resonance. Area (b) is focused on developing comprehensive research on MBE growth of phosphide-based ferromagnetic semiconductors, followed by a systematic investigation of their spin-based properties. Although the spin properties of alloys such as GaMnP, InMnP and GaMnAsP are expected to be highly promising, and offer a range of important new opportunities, surprisingly little work has been done on this family of materials as compared to the effort given to, e.g., the GaMnAs or InMnAs alloys. Extending the proposed studies to this new family of FM semiconductors is expected to significantly advance the understanding of ferromagnetic semiconductors generally. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ General objectives:    Advances in today?s technology depend critically on developing new materials, and on discoveries of new effects which occur in these materials. Leading these advances are discoveries relevant to storage and manipulation of information; and strategies for miniaturization of device architectures in which these processes are implemented.  Traditionally, storage of information involves magnetic systems (i.e., systems involving electronic spin); and manipulation of information involves semiconductor materials (e.g., the semiconductor chip). However, traditional magnetic materials are distinct from semiconductors, so that one requires two different systems to achieve both storage and manipulation of information. The objective of the present project was to develop materials which combine both semiconductor and magnetic properties, which can then be used to achieve both these functionalities ? information storage and manipulation ? in a single monolithic chip, thus leading to enormous advantages in device size, processing speed, and storage capacity.   Specific outcomes and their intellectual merit:    To address the goals outlined above, a systematic program was launched in this grant to design, develop, and study semiconductors such as GaAs and InSb, which can be made magnetic by introducing magnetic ions into their crystal lattice. In parallel with this, another family of materials with unique spin properties ? so-called topological insulators ? has also surfaced, and has been included into our program because of their enormous promise for technology. Our program as a whole consisted of three main thrusts:  of exploring the crystal growth of these combinatorial materials by the process of molecular beam epitaxy, whereby the desired magnetic semiconductor alloys (e.g., GaMnAs) and topological insulators are achieved by atomic layer-by-layer deposition; of systematic studies of the resulting materials using structural, electrical, magnetic and optical techniques; and of combining materials developed in these investigations into structures intended to serve as prototypes for future applications based on spin properties identified in this program.  One of the bottlenecks of achieving practical devices based on such materials is the fact their attractive magnetic properties occur only below room temperature. In this project significant advances were made to raise this limiting temperature closer to room temperature, both by gaining theoretical understanding of the process by which these spin-based systems become magnetic; and by developing strategies to optimize crystal growth and device design aimed at higher temperature operation. Major progress has also been made in understanding physical effects that govern the phenomenon of spin injection, one of the key processes which are expected to govern the operation of future spin-electronic (?spintronic?) devices.  A number of prototype devices were constructed based on materials studied in this program, including magnetic tunnel diodes and devices designed to operate beyond the standard binary logic. In parallel with the efforts aimed at optimizing the properties of magnetic semiconductors that were already known when this program began, new magnetic materials had also been successfully obtained as part of this project, including the alloy ferromagnetic semiconductor GaMnAsP, which is attractive for high-density spintronic integration; and magnetically-doped topological insulators, in which spin properties can be controlled by the presence of magnetic ions introduced into their crystal lattices.   Additionally, it was recognized that attractive spin-electronic phenomena can be obtained by combining semiconductors with magnetic metals into hybrid architectures, and considerable effort has been made in this project to develop such hybrid combinations.  It was discovered that in certain cases structures of excellent crystal quality can be formed in this way, and exhibit certain unprecedented functionalities that hold promise in device applications. Finally, a great deal of attention has been given to the question of how spin properties depend on device size, an issue that is directly relevant to integrating nanometer-scale devices.  Broader Impacts:  In addition to developing and optimizing materials for research on spin effects in solids, and to reporting the specific results of our investigations, the impact of our work on our principal discipline has been to act as a resource for the U.S. semiconductor community in terms of supplying research materials to other groups, with emphasis on systems whose properties depend on electron spin; and in sharing our understanding of these complex systems acquired in the course of this project and its predecessors. In the past 18 months we have further expanded this role by also providing so-called  2D materials (graphene-like compound systems) and topological insulators to our collaborators.
