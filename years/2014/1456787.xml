<AbstractNarration>White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) is a devastating disease that has killed around 6 million bats in the US since its discovery in 2007.  The disease has spread across North America and has the potential to drive several native bat species to extinction.  In addition to ecological damage, the disease is predicted to seriously impact the agricultural industry, as insectivorous bats are critical for the control of insect pests.  The cause of WNS is the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which is highly invasive causing significant tissue destruction particularly to the membranous wings of bats.  Little else is known about the biology of this fungal species or how it is able to cause disease in bats.  This project will focus on identification and characterization of protease enzymes, which are catalysts in protein degradation, secreted by P. destructans that may promote the invasion and destruction of bat tissue.  In particular, the presence of proteases will be evaluated as these represent important virulence factors in several mammalian fungal pathogens.  The blocking of protease activities may therefore represent a therapeutic strategy for the prevention of WNS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach used in this proposal will first define the proteins secreted by P. destructans during laboratory culture, with a particular emphasis on identifying secreted proteases.  Cutting-edge approaches will be used for the identification and subsequent characterization of proteases, including a multiplex substrate profiling technique coupled with iceLogo analysis to reveal the cleavage specificity of secreted proteases.  Preliminary experiments using this approach have led to the identification and partial characterization of a novel subtilisin-like protease from the conditioned medium of P. destructans.  This activity has been named Destructin-1 as it is able to degrade collagen, the major component of animal connective tissue.  Additional proteases will be identified in P. destructans and compared to those in non-infectious species to identify potential virulence factors. To test if these proteases contribute to disease in the bat, inhibitors of proteases will be defined and these inhibitors tested in infection models to see if they block the progression of WNS.  New genetic tools will also be developed for this fungal species to enable analysis by deletion of target genes.  Together, these approaches will provide new insights into the biology of the P. destructans fungus and the means by which it causes disease in the mammalian host.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project extensively examined the biology of the bat fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of White Nose Syndrome in North America.  This fungus has caused the death of millions of bats and continues to afflict bats in multiple states in both the US and Canada.  Our research looked to examine the proteins secreted by P. destructans versus those produced by related (non-pathogenic) species to identify proteins that potentially promote bat infection.  We particularly focused on secreted proteases, as these have been shown to promote virulence in fungal pathogens of other mammalian species.  We were successful in purifying two different P. destructans proteases and showing that one of these proteases can degrade components of the extracellular matrix.  We therefore speculate that this protease could help the fungus invade into the bat skin or other tissues, and so promote the progression of White Nose Syndrome (WNS).  This protease is also now being further examined by other groups to determine whether bats can be vaccinated against WNS, at least in part, due to expression of this protease. The forced expression of this protease in bat cells could promote resistance to WNS due to an increase in antifungal immunity.  Our group also examined whether wax moth larvae could be used as a surrogate for infection with P. destructans.  The larvae succcumbed to infection over the course of several weeks and could be rescued by treatment with antifungal drugs.  In this manner, larvae could potentially be used in the future for high-throughput screening of antifungal compounts that combat P. destructans.  Finally, we also examined the metabolism of P. destructans compared to related non-pathogenic fungi and observed, as have others, that the pathogenic species exhibits clear metabolic differences relative to its non-pathogenic relatives.  It is currently unclear whether these metabolic differences are directly related to the ability of P. destructans to cause disease in bats, but do indicate fundamental differences in the wiring of metabolic pathways between pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungal species.
