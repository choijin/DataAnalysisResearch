<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Bethune-Cookman University seeks to enhance undergraduate education in the biology department by developing a curriculum that focuses on quantitative expertise.  Students will be taught how to work with large data sets to understand biological systems and to solve problems in biology. Assessment metrics that integrate quantitative literacy, scientific literacy and strategic learning will be developed as part of the overall evaluation of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to provide learning experiences for undergraduate biology majors to develop quantitative and computational skills for biological discovery and analysis. The project has two specific objectives: 1) to infuse data science competencies in research-oriented courses and 2) to develop three new courses.  The project will infuse concepts of data flow, data analytics and data curation in a series of five research-oriented biology core courses. The new courses will be in the areas of bioinstrumentation, cloud computing and computational genetics. Bethune-Cookman University will undertake critical activities to create an adoptable model for core curriculum improvement in biology undergraduate programs. These activities include development and assessment of course resources and learning strategies; evaluation by students and faculty; disciplinary education research by students and faculty; and dissemination.</AbstractNarration>

The National Science Foundation award titled "Targeted Infusion Project: Developing Quantitative Expertise in the Undergraduate Biology Curriculum (QEUBiC)" from August 2014 to July 2018 was designed in response to the need to developing biology graduates who can address societal challenges using bio-based solutions (Figure 1).     Outcome 1 - Curriculum that Integrates Deep Expertise in Biology Disciplines with Computational and Quantitative Skills:  The project facilitated faculty collaboration to integrate evidence-based teaching and learning approaches to develop a new undergraduate biology curriculum (Figure 2) at Bethune-Cookman University, located in Daytona Beach, Florida.  The four-year 124 semester hours biology undergraduate curriculum at Bethune-Cookman University became effective in August 2018. The design of the curriculum promotes comprehensive student academic success. Students are supported to become expert learners and gain professional expertise in biology. In addition to the General Education courses, the new biology curriculum at Bethune-Cookman University includes:  (1) Three-course series on fundamental principles of biology;  (2) Four-course series of seminar courses to shape career intentions;  (3) Second-year courses for entry into diverse sub-disciplines of biology;  (4) Courses for biological research methods, internship in biology and biological research experiences; and  (5) Third- and fourth- year courses for developing deep expertise in sub-disciplines of biology.  The project facilitated the development and introduction of three new courses designed to equip students with computational and quantitative skills. The curriculum is available at   https://catalog.cookman.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=33&amp;poid=3298     Outcome 2 - Infusion of Learning Technologies and Advanced Computing Resources  Learning technologies, including internet-based intelligent tutoring systems, are now integral components of several courses to promote learning behaviors that ensure long-term retention of biological knowledge and the transfer of learning to career settings. Diverse types of faculty collaborations such as interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations were established and sustained.  External collaboration with the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) and the LearnLab at Carnegie Mellon University enabled access to advanced computing resources and learning technologies (Figure 3).     Outcome 3 - Expansion of Research Facilities for Aquatic, Plant and Computational Biology  Research facilities for aquatic biology, plant biology and computational biology were expanded, thereby providing the premise for year-round research experiences for students. Faculty-student collaborations are contributing to the understanding of diverse biological topics of societal relevance.  These topics include (1) clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease; (2) transmission of Ebola viruses; (3) microbial transformation of mercury in the food sources and water bodies; (4) health of trees in urban settings in hurricane paths; (5) effects of algal blooms on quality of water bodies; (6) gene activity in the human placenta; (7) survival mechanisms of Toxoplasma parasite in human cells;  (7) oyster population in Halifax River; (8) native plants in Florida's biodiversity; and (9) habitat-defined diversity of traits in Caribbean Anolis lizards.  Project findings have been disseminated including scientific journals, presentations at professional conferences, student conferences, community events, and news releases (Figure 4).     Outcome 4 - Impacts beyond Biology Program at Bethune-Cookman University  The QEUBiC project has had broader impact outcomes beyond the biology program at Bethune-Cookman University. New collaborations were established with biology faculty and B-CU faculty in other academic programs beyond the initial scope of the award. Supplemental funding from the National Science Foundation enabled the QEUBiC project to foster collaborative data learning beyond biology sub-disciplines as well as public participation in biology research.  The academic collaboration has expanded to include faculty in other disciplines including business and entrepreneurship, computer science and engineering, criminal justice, health sciences, math, and physics. The public participation in biology research engaged local citizen science organizations in defining societal issues for infusion in biology courses at Bethune-Cookman University. Collaborative projects were established with other colleges in Volusia County, Florida, namely Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona State College, and Stetson University (Figure 5). The QEUBiC project provided the basis for B-CU faculty collaborating with on research projects led by other institutions equipped with advanced computing resources.     Outcome 5 - Establishment of Trandisciplinary Data Scholars Development Program    The Transdisciplinary Data Scholars Development Program (TDSDP) was established and implemented with the goal to provide learning experiences that develop participants into professionals who are capable of working effectively with data. The Transdisciplinary Data Scholars Development Program is an academic and career development program designed as a multi-stage program that consists of pre-college, undergraduate, graduate, faculty and professional components.  Altogether, the community to emerge is a Transdisciplinary Data Expertise Community of Learners, Discoverers and Innovators (Figure 6).
