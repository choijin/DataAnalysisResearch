<AbstractNarration>This research examines the ways in which authoritarian systems negatively characterize protestors in order to protect their own legitimacy and justify the use of harsh repression. While research has examined how social movements articulate their grievances, this study will make a contribution by analyzing how repressive systems frame their messages and the implications those frames have for citizens. This project focuses on the historical case of popular resistance to a 1953 currency reform in Czechoslovakia, one of the first uprisings against Communism in the Eastern Bloc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will draw upon extensive examination of archival legal documents and in-depth interviews with protest participants, to analyze how characterizations of protesters served to legitimate state interests and influence repression. The findings will have relevance for understanding how other authoritarian systems have historically repressed citizens and quashed public protest. The research will result in the creation of large data sets that will be available to educators, scholars, and the public via the Internet. This study has important educational impacts, as its findings will contribute to the development of college level courses in sociology and history, and it will provide hands-on training in research and collaborative opportunities with the principal investigator for students at North Carolina State University.</AbstractNarration>

The currency reform had devastating consequences for the population, including the extreme devaluation of personal savings and reduced pricing subsidies for food.

This study analyzed how officials characterized protestors in order to protect the state&rsquo;s legitimacy and justify their use of harsh repression.

By answering these questions, we learned more about how authoritarian regimes legitimate their rule, especially when faced with popular protest. Drawing on over 6,000 pages of government archival documents, we constructed a dataset of how state officials characterized, or framed, the protesters and protests.

Importantly, we found that court officials then relied on these frames when sentencing individual participants, which highlights how elite framing efforts can have serious repercussions for protester repression.
