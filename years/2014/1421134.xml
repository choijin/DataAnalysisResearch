<AbstractNarration>This project develops the first material camera, or MatCam, that outputs a per-pixel label of object material and its properties that can be used in visual computing tasks. In the everyday real world there are a vast number of materials that are useful to discern including concrete, metal, plastic, velvet, satin, water layer on asphalt, carpet, tile, wood, and marble.  A device for identifying materials has important implications in developing new technologies. For example, a mobile robot may use a MatCam to determine whether the terrain is grass, gravel, pavement, or snow in order to optimize mechanical control.  In e-commerce, the material composition of objects can be tagged by a MatCam for advertising and inventory.  The potential applications are limitless in areas such as robotics, digital architecture, human-computer interaction, intelligent vehicles and advanced manufacturing. Furthermore, material maps have foundational importance in nearly all vision algorithms including segmentation, feature matching, scene recognition, image-based rendering, context-based search, and object recognition and motion estimation. The camera brings material recognition to the broader scientific and engineering communities, in a similar way that depth cameras are currently used in many fields outside of computer vision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research brings high accuracy material estimation out of the lab and into the real-world for fast high-accuracy per-pixel material estimates.  The program has three technical aims.  First, a material appearance database is captured and stored with an exploration robot viewing surfaces from multiple angles.   This large, structured and actionable visual dataset is then used to develop computational appearance models.  A novel methodology using angular reflectance gradients is integrated for characterizing features of surface appearance.  Using the training data and statistical inference methods, these models are designed for hardware implementation. The final aim is the material camera implementation as a near real-time prototype of point-and-shoot material acquisition that extends RGB-D cameras to RGB-DM cameras that provide color, depth, and material.  The hardware implementation of the material appearance models utilizes FPGA and SoC (system-on-chip) technology.</AbstractNarration>

We have developed a suite of  algorithms for material recognition as part of this project. These algorithms can be run in near real-time and therefore can be used as a material camera to see and recognize real world materials. Our work has been accepted to premier conferences (e.g. IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) with low acceptance rate and a peer-review process that requires demonstrating that an algorithm works better than the state of the art.   In order to support this algorithm development, we have collected several novel and large visual datasets with ground truth material that can be used not only for our algorithms but also to check and support future algorithms.  These databases and our algorithm code have been made publicly available.   The algorithm set that we have developed are as follows:  1)  Reflectance Disks and Reflectance Hashing: We present a database of reflectance images comprised of twenty different diverse material classes including wood, velvet, ceramic and automotive paint with 10 spot measurements per surface and with three different surface instances per class. Measurements include three on-axis illumination angles and ten random spot measurements over the surface.

We develop Differential Angular Imaging for a sparse spatial distribution of angular gradients that provides key cues for material recognition. We collect  The GTOS (Ground Terrain for Outdoor Scenes) Dataset with ground terrain imaged by systematic in-scene measurement of partial reflectance instead of in-lab reflectance measurements.
