<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a new type of general multiagent system for management and control of complex systems, in which the agents work together in a fully cooperative way to maximize global performance over time, in the face of nonlinearity and complexity. As a testbed to prove the value of the new approach, they will simulate the challenges of: (1) earthquake response, representing a class of disasters with very rapid occurrence, short lead times and restricted geographic extent; and (2) drought-induced famine relief, representing the class of disasters with longer forecast and lead times, and larger geographic extent. The results will be widely disseminated and will feed into programs for education and outreach, including a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at Duke and the NSF-funded IGERT on Wireless Intelligent Sensor Networks, feeding into summer schools and international partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key challenge here is to develop a new version of adaptive, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) which is fully distributed,&lt;br/&gt;to address the case of multiscale dynamical systems. The work builds on recent work of the lead PI on Distributed Optimal Control (DOC),&lt;br/&gt;and includes development of optimal restriction operators for dimensionality reduction in parts of the system, and exploitation of methods from the field of partial differential equations (PDE) and stochastic differential equations (SDE).</AbstractNarration>

This is where the work performed under this proposal becomes important: we use modern data mining / manifold learning tools to obtain simpler, macroscopic, reduced, "effective" models of the processes that produce the data &ndash; and it is through these models that tasks like prediction, parametric analysis or control become computationally feasible. We have used data mining techniques like diffusion maps to obtain such reduced, effective descriptions of complex models &ndash; interacting particle models, heterogeneous network models, large discretizations of partial differential equations. We have especially worked in cases where we have agnostic, disorganized "input-output" observations from a problem, in the form of time series measurement windows, and were able to construct realizations of the system that are consistent with the data &ndash; models that, given the system inputs will produce accurate approximations of the system outputs.

We were also able to work with cases where even the independent variables (space and time) were not explicitly known, and we were able to recover useful "emergent" spaces in which to embed the data and formulate models.  Overall, we believe that the linking of traditional engineering modeling and scientific computation with these emergent data science-motivated, machine learning techniques, will provide the frontier of mathematical modeling activities in the sciences and engineering for the near future.
