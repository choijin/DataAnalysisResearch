<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Jennifer Ogilvie from the University of Michigan and colleagues Stephen Forrest, Kevin Kubarych, Theodore Norris and Vanessa Sih will develop a multispectral multidimensional non-linear (MMDS) spectrometer to enable studies of dynamical processes in atomic, molecular, and material systems spanning femtoseconds to seconds, from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR) regimes. This will allow insight into DNA photodamage and repair mechanisms and metalloenzyme function. The ability to mix and match infrared, visible and ultraviolet wavelengths will be a novel and potentially very powerful technique. The investigators will create modules that will serve for outreach activities to K-12 students. Importantly, participation of students and postdoctoral associates in this project will serve to educate a new generation of instrumentalists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as the study of complex condensed phase systems. The instrument will also be used to probe the dynamics of the building blocks of biological matter: amino and nucleic acids, to gain insight into DNA photodamage and repair mechanisms and metalloenzyme function and will provide a tool for studying the physics of nanostructures. It is also noted that the instrument would address key questions relevant to improving the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices.</AbstractNarration>
