<AbstractNarration>As part of NSF's Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, Science Learning+ is a partnership among US and UK foundations. Science Learning+ makes grant awards that take transformational steps to inform, improve, and advance the knowledge bases, practices, and design of informal STEM learning experiences and environments. The long-term SL+ goals are to broaden participation in STEM and to better understand, strengthen, and coordinate STEM engagement and lifelong learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Science Learning+ planning project that will develop a research plan for investigating how applying the principles of embodied cognition to the design of informal learning environments can support young children's (ages 2-6) engagement with, and understanding of, science topics and concepts. While it has been fairly well established that cognition is intertwined with the body's interaction in the physical world, the precise means of applying these ideas to the design of effective learning environments is still emerging. Experimenting with various embodied cognition activities and physical learning configurations to understand what conditions are optimal for informal learning environments for early learners is a major objective of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the planning grant period, the project will identity additional practitioner/research collaborations and will develop research plans for a suite of studies to be enacted by multiple teams of informal learning practitioners and cognitive scientists across the US and UK and that will be submitted as a Phase 2 research. The primary activities of this planning period include organizing a series of workshops that bring together informal learning educators and embodied cognition researchers to engage in deep discussion and design experimentation that will inform the development and refinement of research questions, protocols, and measurement tools. These discussions will be informed by observations of young children as they interact with the River of Grass, an exhibit prototype in which principles of embodied cognition are embedded in its design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning period will be led by a collaborative team of informal learning practitioners and cognitive scientists from the US and UK. This group will also oversee plans for the development of a new model for informal STEM research in which a constellation of practitioner/research teams across multiple organizations investigates topics of importance to informal learning practice and research that have the potential to result in a robust body of research that informs the design of informal learning spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Move2Learn  The Move2Learn planning effort was a collaboration between museum practitioners and researchers in the United States and the United Kingdom, who represented the spectrum of science education, embodied learning, interactive exhibit designers and technology specialists. The overall goal was to begin the process of identifying relevant research questions related to the design of physical and digital exhibits for young children, examining the role of bodily engagement in informal science learning settings. The project tested a new model of collaboration to bridge theory and practice.  Project outcomes included:  Increasing the capacity of informal science institutions to be more intentional in the application of insights from embodied learning and technology research to the design of exhibits and programs.   Raising awareness of the need for the research community to work with practitioners to articulate exploratory and experimental designs that involve full body interaction exhibits in informal learning spaces.   Sharing promising strategies and practices that practitioners and researchers can and are using to better understand the role of body movement and action in learning.   Beginning to establish a network of research/practice teams interested in investigating the role of whole body interactive exhibits in the development of young childrenÆs STEM concepts across different contexts and perspectives.   Project activities focused on the planning, preparation, and execution of two interdisciplinary convenings held at the Frost Science Museum in Miami, Florida (April 21-23, 2015) and the University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh, Scotland (June 29-31, 2015).  The events were facilitated by the projectÆs leadership team, comprised of Frost Science MuseumÆs PIs Judy Brown and Cheryl Ju&aacute;rez, Drs. Robb Lindgren and H Chad Lane from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Dr. Andrew Manches from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland and Dr. Sara Price, from the UCL Institute of Education, London. Workshop attendees represented a wide range of museum practitioners, and researchers from multiple disciplines. To engage participants in dialogue, they were divided into small groups of research/practice teams and tasked with the challenge of designing a research scenario based on a question of interest to the group. The project input related to whole body interactions was distilled into the following research questions for future consideration:  Building a Research Agenda Related to Whole Body Interaction (WBI)  1)   What elements of WBI are key to enhancing science learning?    What body-based metaphors or bodily actions are congruent with scientific concepts, and for which key concepts is this is the case? What designs guide bodily engagement to elicit cause and effect relationships/ other foundational science concepts? In what way do WBI exhibits encourage social interaction around scientific ideas between children? Children and adults? How do parents facilitate childrenÆs movement? What adult bodily interactions best support childrenÆs participation in science exploration? What WBI activities best support peer-peer learning about science?     2)   What is the role of bodily enactment in assessing childrenÆs understanding of science concepts?  Does intentional design of bodily actions, that are congruent with the science concepts and/or exhibit key messages, enhance childrenÆs scientific explanations? Does it increase childrenÆs imagining of hypothetical scenarios? Does it increase their ability to articulate their thinking about science?   3)   What cross-cultural differences in embodied engagement emerge?  Are there differences in how various cultural and linguistic groups engage physically within country and between countries? Are there differences between the US and UK childrenÆs interactions with exhibits, such as confidence, verbal expressions, and persistence? Parental behavior? Are there differences in peer...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
