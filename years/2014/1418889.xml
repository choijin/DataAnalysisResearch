<AbstractNarration>Network science, the study of large, interconnected complex systems, has been the focus of much effort on the part of many scientists in recent years. The modeling and analysis of natural, engineered, and social networks, ranging from molecular and biological networks to the Internet, the World Wide Web, and also to online social media like Facebook and Twitter, has emerged as an important multidisciplinary field of study. Progress in this area is rapidly affecting many traditional fields of science and engineering as well as areas like public health, business, marketing, finance, and national security. The project concerns the development and analysis of computational methods for studying the structure of networks and of certain dynamical processes taking place on them. In particular, the project will develop mathematically sound approaches for maximally increasing the connectivity and robustness of networks when only a limited number of links can be added or modified. Network robustness is of paramount importance when designing infrastructure networks, since real world networks must be resilient to damage resulting from natural disasters or by man-made, malicious attacks. In addition, the project will develop efficient techniques for simulating the spread of information, viruses, rumors, etc. on networks, as well as the propagation of shocks. The techniques will be implemented on computers and tested on existing available data sets, and the software will be made available to other researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first part of the project we will design efficient algorithms for increasing network robustness and connectivity using as an objective function the total communicability of  the network, which is a scalar quantity associated with the adjacency matrix of the graph. In particular, we will investigate different criteria for the addition of links in such a way as to (approximately) maximize the increase in total communicability. Edge rewiring and deletion will also be studied. The second part of the project deals with the numerical analysis of so-called Quantum Graphs. We will study numerical methods, including finite element discretizations and fast linear algebra, for solving PDEs posed on metric graphs (1D simplicial complexes), such as the diffusion and Schroedinger equations. In particular, we will study domain decomposition and iterative substructuring methods for solving the large linear systems arising when solving elliptic and parabolic problems on graphs. Exponential integrators based on Krylov subspace methods will also be investigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project addressed several problems arising within the broad field of Network Science. This can be succinctlly described as the study of large, complex, interconnected systems. Networks are ubiquitous both in Nature and in modern society: examples include chemical, molecular, and biological networks, brain networks, road and air transportation networks, social networks including large-scale on-line social networks (like Facebook or Twitter), information networks (like the World Wide Web), financial networks, and so forth.  Two main areas of Network Science are (1) Network analysis and (2) Network design, or synthesis. The first area is especially important in that it allows scientists to identify the most important nodes (or connections) in a network,  to study how well (or how poorly) information (broadly understood) can spread from node to node  (i.e., how "well connected" a given network is), and to identify susbtructures such as communities within large networks.  The second area makes use of tools and concepts from the first area, and also from other fields like constrained optimization, in order to design networks having certain desirable properties (subject to constraints, for example on the number of edges) or to modify an exisitng one so as to enhance some of its properties, such as connectivity (this is important for instance in design networks that are robust under attacks, deliberate or otherwise, that lead to the loss of some of the existing connections).  The research carried out under this grant has led to the creation of new, powerful algorithms to determine what is the best edge modification strategy to improve the connectivity of a given network, while maintaining the network as sparse as possible (that is, the number of connections is kept suitably small).  We also developed numerical methods that can be used to study diffusion and vibration problems on graphs; these problems arise for example in the study of advanced materials like graphene.  Furthermore, we conducted a study of the person-to-person contatc network of staff and patients in the emergency room of a major urban hospital which exposed some limitations of the techniques currently used by network scientists to identify the key agents in the spreading of infectious diseases, suggesting that more work is necessary before these techniques can be used for actual predictive purposes.  More generally, the research advanced the broad field of computational/applied mathematics by bringing together disparate aspects of mathematical, combinatorial, and numerical analysis such as differential equations, graph theory, finite element  techniques, and numerical algorithms for solving large sparse matrix problems (Lanczos and conjugate gradients).  Finally, the grant allowed for the training of one brand new PhD and the partial support of another graduate student.
