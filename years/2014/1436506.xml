<AbstractNarration>This project supports a series of scientific workshops among Alaska Native, Hawai'ian Native, and Plains Indian indigenous scholars and scientists.  The goal of these workshops is to engage the participants in developing new guidelines for building collaborations between Native and non-Native researchers working with Native communities.  The research team proposes that these guidelines reflect Indigenous knowledge production, honor Indigenous innovation, and resonate Indigenous perceptions of place and as such, they will incorporate Native principles, protocols, and practices.  This approach to scientific collaboration, one that supports scientific and indigenous principles as co-producers of scientific knowledge creates a new vision for interdisciplinary research, one that includes scientific and indigenous scholarly perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As scientists increasingly engage Native communities in research as subjects, landowners, tradition bearers, participants, and/or collaborators in research there is increasing awareness among indigenous people, particularly in North America, that the scientific endeavor could benefit greatly from their knowledge and perspective.  This project is about understanding the diversity of indigenous knowledges and how indigenous people can best engage with science and scientists.  This type of multi-knowledge engagement holds the potential to expand our understanding of the world's natural and social systems.  In addition, this project engages the next generation of Alaska Native, Native Hawai'ian, and Plains Indian scholars and scientists through meaningful participation by undergraduate and graduate students and early career scientists from these groups.  By engaging students from underrepresented groups in science through this workshop series, the research team proposes to prepare the next generation of interdisciplinary scientist that can think and analyze data in a more holistic way.  They are in essence laying the groundwork for a 21st century diverse scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  It has been nearly 20 years since Linda Tuhiwai Smith wrote the seminal work, Decolonizing Methodologies, highlighting inherent colonial attitudes in Western research processes. (Smith 1999)Since then, there have been a proliferation of scholars investigatingvarious aspects of Indigenous methodologies and numerous publications and presentations on successful research collaborations between Indigenous communities and Western researchers. Academia and the Western research industryhas had ample time to make appropriate adjustments to improve research engagements with Indigenous communities. Why then do many Indigenous community members involved with research in their homelands STILL believe research is a bad thing?  This NSF fundedEaGER research project, entitled Collaboratively Harnessing Indigenous Research Principles, Protocols, and Practices (CHIRP3), has determined that these attitudes are not confined to a particular region, level of academic scholarship, or the degree to which a Tribal government has engaged with the Western research endeavor. Our team of Alaska Native, Kanaka Hawai?i, and Plains Indian scholars interviewed or conducted workshop think tanks in four regions within the contiguous US (Great Lakes, Pacific Northwest, Plains, and Southwest), three regions within the State of Alaska (Central, Southeast, and Interior), and in Hawai?i. We listened to our Indigenous community participants candidly express their frustration with research projects in their Indigenous communities. Their recommendations and novel approaches for improving research engagements in Indigenous communities challenge both Academic and Indigenous communities.  Intellectual Merit  We learned that many of our Indigenous academic scholars, from undergraduates to early career scholars, are still struggling to both fulfill the requirements for earning their Western academic credentials and find places within their Indigenous communities to be of service. We met many of them while presenting on the project as various conference venues and provided travel funds to include them in our several think tank dialogues. Those Indigenous academic scholars we spoke with need help mentoring the next generation of Native scholars, need strategies on strengthening their academic presence, and need more opportunities to serve Indigenous communities.   As a result of our close relationship with the NSF funded FIRST (Facilitating Indigenous Research, Science, and Technology) network of scholars (NSF#??), research collected during our Pacific Northwest interviews and think tank workshop inspired the theme for an upcoming NSF funded workshop, Mentoring Our Own Native Scientists (MOONS), to take place between Sept 19-22, 2018 at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas. They plan on focusing on solutions to the many challenges Native students and mentors face along the academic path toward advanced STEM degrees.  Broader Impacts  We learned that Indigenous communities respond better to research that addresses needs they identify, uses methods consistent with their Indigenous knowledge systems, and implements findings in a manner that improves their overall community well-being. This generally requires a researcher who respects their sovereignty, is knowledgeable about their historical circumstances, and is willing to socialize with them beyond academic responsibilities. A person willing to move beyond the ?logical? narrative and the distanced, non-commital, "get in &ndash; get data &ndash; get out" research design strategies instilled in Western protocols.   We learned that while there is a growing awarenessamong Indigenous communities that the scientific research industry could benefit greatly from Indigenous knowledges, values, and perspectives, there is also a growing number of Indigenous researchers and practitioners who are troubled by the increase in requests received by Indigenous knowledge holders and fear it will lead to research fatigue. The increased interest in studying the Arctic gives Alaska Native Tribes a prime opportunity to proactively promote research regulation standards that reflect their knowledge traditions which are based on millenia of direct observation. This is part of the reason many of our participants believe Indigenous leadership needs to take more prominent proactive role in research regulation and management, assert their rights as participants from sovereign nations, and/or set both the standards by which research is measured and the methods by which research is pursued.   As part of community dissemination of information, the project team made available "Proposed Guidelines for Researchers Engaging with Tribal Communities or on Tribal Lands" advocating community driven research where "meaningful involvement of the Tribe(s) to drive the work, as a true research partner throughout the whole process: research design, data collection &amp; analysis, publication &amp; dissemination, crafting policy recommendations from &amp; acting on research findings." The team prefers to consider all document shared as draft guidelines or suggested strategies. They become final when a tribal entity employs the content and uses their sovereign authority to enact it into policies that protect their lifeways and wellbeing. Such is the case with both the Kenaitze Tribe, who have reported they have already drafted their own research policy based on the proposed guidelines, as well as Sitka, who are also proactive when protecting and maintaining their intellectual property.
