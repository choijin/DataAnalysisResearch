<AbstractNarration>Animals are remarkably good at moving in complex and changing environments, far exceeding the capability of the most advanced robots. This adaptability is possible because the nervous system and the body interact with the environment as a single "neuromechanical system". In animals, this process is dominated by soft tissues such as muscles and skin but it is largely unknown how the movements of soft materials are controlled. This project will answer this question by studying how neural, mechanical and sensing mechanisms contribute to adaptable locomotion. The experiments will be carried out on caterpillars because they provide a unique opportunity to use electrophysiology (recording the electrical activity of neurons and muscles), motion capture and mechanical measurements during free behavior. In addition to addressing issues that are largely missing from our understanding of terrestrial soft animal locomotion, these studies have wide applications in robotics including the design and control of climbing machines, building assistive devices and manipulators and for controlling better prosthetics. Understanding the mechanical and sensory features that are important for caterpillar locomotion could also impact the development of pesticide-free pest-control strategies (e.g., plant surface engineering), managing sensitive ecological niches and modeling insect/host plant interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three areas of research will determine how caterpillars adjust their locomotion in different environments. The first uses motion capture to analyze the stepping patterns (gaits) on different substrates and changes in orientation. The mechanical properties of the substrate (including stiffness, density, curvature, resilience, pseudo-elasticity, friction) will be altered systematically to establish what mechanical features of the environment are essential cues for caterpillars. The second will use implanted flexible electrode arrays to monitor the activity of neurons that underlie each gait. The Environmental Skeleton hypothesis predicts that motor patterns controlling the body wall muscles will change with orientation but that motor patterns controlling grip will determine the gait. Recently developed Softworm robots (entirely soft, 3D-printed crawling robots) will be used to further examine the mechanisms of gait switching and the evolution of inching behavior. Third, to begin identifying how interactions with the environment are detected by soft animals, recordings will be made from specific groups of touch and other mechanosensing neurons in the body wall to ascertain what movements they encode and how that relates to crawling and changes in gait.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research uses the tobacco hawkmoth caterpillars (<em>Manduca sexta</em>) to address the question;&nbsp;<em>How do soft animals control their movements without joints or levers</em>? The results (-intellectual merit-, published in 13 peer-reviewed papers, 3 book chapters and presented in 32 invited talks or conference events) show that soft animals make control easier by exploiting the remarkable material properties of their bodies. This allows them to be self-adapting and robust in changing environments. <em>Manduca</em> can climb and crawl using a single strategy (the <em>environmental skeleton</em>) and even switch the grip of each abdominal leg using a single neuron (Fig. 1). They can alter their gait in response to the material properties of the substrate and sense its orientation (Fig. 2) and any micro vibrations. In addition to crawling, <em>Manduca </em>can make very fast movements (strikes) in response to noxious stimuli and this behavior is modified (sensitized) by repeated experience (Fig. 3). Strikes are mediated by sensory neurons that respond to both thermal and mechanical stimuli (Fig. 4) making <em>Manduca</em> a useful model system for studying the neural mechanisms of pain.</p> <p>These findings from <em>Manduca</em> have made a broader impact in the emerging field of soft robotics. The goal of this branch of engineering is to make machines that can move around safely and effectively in complex natural and unpredictable environments. By incorporating soft materials into robot design, it is possible to make machines with completely new capabilities. Based on research carried out for this grant, a variety of caterpillar-like robots have been built to test these novel approaches to robot control (Fig 5). Some of these machines are prototypes for cheap, robust, soft robots for search and rescue or use in environmentally sensitive tasks (Fig. 6)</p> <p>The research carried out in this project has helped to train 12 PhD students, 3 MS students, 16 undergraduates, 3 high school students and 3 postdoctoral researchers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Barry&nbsp;A&nbsp;Trimmer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1456471/1456471_10382970_1576177332467_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1456471/1456471_10382970_1576177332467_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.
