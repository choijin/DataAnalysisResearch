<AbstractNarration>Flying insects face a barrage of foreign particles such as dust and pollen, which threaten to coat the insect's eyes and antennae, thus limiting their sensing abilities. This project plans to elucidate a novel aerodynamic mechanism by which insects keep these sensory organs clean. This project will be performed in collaboration with Dr. Isao Shimoyama at the University of Tokyo. The innovative airflow measuring techniques developed by Dr. Shimoyama's lab will determine the optimal bristle array geometry for reducing airborne particle deposition. The findings could lead to bio-inspired designs for dust-controlling lenses, sensors, and solar panels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The compound eye of many species of insects is covered by an array of short bristles, or setae, evenly spaced between the eye's individual lenses. These setae are believed to resist incoming particle-laden flows to reduce deposition onto the ocular surface. Experiments will be conducted using an insect eye mimic with a micro-scale wind velocity probe to quantify the aerodynamics of various bristle array geometries and determine the most effective at minimizing airflow penetration. Preliminary experiments and numerical simulation have shown that arrayed setae can reduce airflow at the eye surface by upwards of 90 percent. While the presence of setae arrays on insect compound eyes has been known for quite some time, there hasn't been a study analyzing the effect of bristles on airborne particle deposition. The aim of this work is to identify setae as a new type of "filter," by which they guide airflows to reduce deposition into targeted areas. As a result they require little to no maintenance and are simple to install, making them ripe for applications. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Flying insects face a barrage of foreign particles such as dust and pollen, which threaten to coat the insect's eyes and antennae, thus limiting their sensing abilities.  Through this interdisciplinary collaboration, Guillermo Amador indentifies an aerodynamic mechanism by which insects keep their eyes clean.  The compound eye of many species of insects is covered by an array of short bristles evenly spaced between the eyeÆs individual lenses.  Among flying insect species, the length of their bristles is approximately equal to their spacing.  To investigate how these bristles aid in keeping clean, GA and his collaborators used insect eye mimics with micro-scale piezo-resistive cantilevers to accurately measure the airflow velocities around various bristle arrays and determine the most effective at minimizing penetration of airflow.  Using a small wind tunnel, they find that bristles create a zone of stagnant air in front of the eye, which diverts airflow and reduces the probability of accumulation of airborne particles.  The ability of bristles to divert airflow can motivate bio-inspired designs for dust-controlling lenses, sensors, and solar panels.  Intellectual Merit:  While the presence of bristle arrays on compound eyes has been known for quite some time, there hasnÆt been a study to look at how these bristles affect particle deposition and soiling.  GA hypothesizes that bristles affect incoming flows to reduce particle deposition to the eye surface.  By quantifying the reduction of airflow penetration caused by various arrays through the use of the innovative airflow measuring techniques used by Professor Isao ShimoyamaÆs lab, GA identifies the optimal bristle array for reducing particle deposition.  When the length of the bristles is equal to or greater than their spacing, they are capable of reducing airflow penetration by 30-90%, regardless of wind direction.  While the use of bristles has been studied in aquatic feeding mechanisms, chemoreception of moth antennae, and flapping flight of thrip wings, little is known whether such mechanisms assist in cleaning.  Through GAÆs findings, bristles act as a new type of "filter," by which they guide airflows to reduce deposition into targeted areas.  As a result they need no maintenance and are simple to install, making them ripe for applications.  Broader Impact:  This multi-disciplinary project represents a perfect example of bio-inspired design.  Through the use of anatomical measurements, fluid dynamics experiments and simulation, and engineering of micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS), GA develops a novel design of a "hairy" sensor capable of functioning in particle-laden environments for extended periods of time without sacrificing performance.  Such a design may increase the longevity of MEMS sensors for measuring particulate counts, micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs), and charge-coupled devices (CCDs).  A manuscript to be submitted to an interdisciplinary biology journal is currently being prepared to disseminate the work.  By using common insects, like fruit flies and honey bees, as inspiration, GA expects his work to reach wider audiences through media outlets.  The multi-disciplinary nature of the work can motivate young scientists to collaborate with colleagues outside of their field to develop innovative ideas that could only be realized through the sharing of ideas from different perspectives.
