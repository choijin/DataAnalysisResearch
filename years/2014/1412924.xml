<AbstractNarration>This research seeks to discover the factors that can predict project success and guide decisions about funding, designing, and implementing major projects intended to use information and communication technology for socio-economic development.  In the past five years, over ten billion dollars of US and international government funding have been invested in such projects, with private technology funding adding substantially to that figure.  Yet, many of these projects fail.  Existing theories emphasize the inability of technology designers in developed countries to understand the needs and context of users in developing countries.  But that approach is at best incomplete because it focuses on the technology while ignoring the link between the technology and development outcomes.  This research will go beyond a strict technology focus by exploring the interplay between technology plans and development goals. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will be organized in a series of steps employing multiple research methodologies, that logically build on each other.  Case studies of four existing information technology development projects, including interviews and extended observation, will provide a deep conceptual basis for the subsequent work.  Based on analysis of the observational and interview data, a questionnaire survey will be developed and administered to about sixty other comparable projects. Following analysis of the survey, a set of ten to twelve shorter case studies will then explore a diversity of projects and their contexts, to expand the theoretical system of analysis and identify issues that were not apparent in the first four case studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting extensive, mixed-methods base of data will allow identification of the factors that shape project success or failure, as well as building and testing of emerging hypotheses so that the research team can construct strong theory.  The resulting theory will provide the groundwork for future research, and enhance the existing scientific literature on this problem with the development scholarship and sensibility that currently is missing from it.  This effort to better understand and predict project success and failure will have the potential to reap significant benefits for the populations that these projects target, for the nations whose development is at hand, and for the entities who provide the funding and who share the aspirations of those who seek to see life improved.</AbstractNarration>

We chose Latin America because although many ICT4D projects are undertaken there, the region is underrepresented in the ICT4D literature.

Our aim was to support theory development in the relevant literatures and to develop policy and technology design insights for ICT4D.  Data Collection and Analysis  We conducted data collection in three phases:  From June to December 2015, a team of four RAs (one doctoral student and three master?s students) collected data in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay. A single RA (doctoral student) returned in summer 2016 to collect follow-up data in Argentina and Uruguay. From December 2018 to April 2019, we sent a post-doc to revisit all five countries plus three additional ones?Chile, Cuba, and Peru?to gather additional data.     In each country, we worked with a primary agency, typically non-governmental, that carried out ICT4D projects. Most of our data came from interviews that we taped, transcribed, and translated. We interviewed staff of each agency as well as the many actors with whom they interacted, including staff at schools, libraries, government agencies at local, state, and federal levels, universities, others non-governmental agencies, funding organizations, and more.

We also drew upon our review of prior academic literature in the realms of ICT4D, development, political economy, technology, education, and organization studies.  We analyzed our data in two primary ways. The first way was qualitatively, letting concepts, issues, themes, and ideas about success and failure emerge from the data rather than being taken from the academic literature. The second way that we analyzed our data was quantitatively by examining social networks to understand how information and resources flowed among actors in each country we studied. We employed an additional four doctoral students and three master?s students to help us conduct our analyses.  Outcome #1. In addition to gaining data to conduct our research, we trained and provided research experience to 12 students (6 doctoral and 6 master?s) and one post-doc researcher.  Findings  We reported our findings in the conference presentations/papers and journal papers that we published.  Outcome #2. We presented seven conference papers, published three journal papers, and supported one dissertation to date. We have two additional journal papers under review and at least one more journal paper in progress.  Outcome #3. Our work has been recognized for its quality on two occasions:  A 2020 Academy of Management conference paper (by post-doc Caroline Stratton and co-PI Diane Bailey) was nominated by the Organizational Communication and Information Systems Division for the Academy-wide Carolyn B. Dexter award for best internationally focused paper. The winner will be determined in August 2020. A conference poster presentation and extended abstract by doctoral student Caroline Stratton won honorable mention at the HCI Across Borders Symposium in 2017.   Highlights  From our many theory-building outcomes, we highlight three with respect to networks, discourse, and time.  Outcome #4. One of our earliest set of findings concerned how and why organizations form relationships in ICT4D networks. We found that non-governmental and community-based often entered into relationships with government and private sector partners to undertake their programs, even when their values about technology and development differed.
