<AbstractNarration>As new institutions are created in a global world, practices concerning inclusion by gender can continue as they have been or they can be transformed by having newly been created in a different context from instituions with established practices.  In particular, the globalization of practices concerning inclusion by gender in emergent transnational firms seem to have different outcomes than might have been expected by analyzing business practices as solely domestic.  This project will analyze practices of inclusion in a large globalizing national state, hypothesizing that global norms override dominant local practices of exclusion. Using in-depth interviews and new survey data with past and present professionals in different organizational sites, this research explores comparative frameworks to explain institutional emergence and egalitarian advantage in new professional spaces. This project is empirically significant because of the dissonance between inegalitarian norms and what may be emergent egalitarian practices.    Investigating these organizations and women who have avoided otherwise persistent gender-priming obstacles is theoretically significant because it speaks to three important conversations on organizational innovation, gender stratification and the influence of globalization in emerging markets.  The question of equity of practices in employment is important to public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New contexts such as transnational firms provide and opportunity to test neo-institutional theorizing concerning globalization, organizational emergence, and loose coupling between organizational norms and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I received the NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Award to conduct and write my doctoral dissertation titled Same Same But Different: Accidental Feminism and Unintended Parity in IndiaÆs Professional Firms. In this dissertation, I explore one set of recent changes to the structure of global gender inequality by studying the case of Indian professional women who have been at the forefront of unprecedented career success. While India as a country has been rife with less than optimal gender updates, women in a little known enclave of recently established corporate law firms seem to have leveraged a sweet spot within this grander mosaic of inequality. For women attorneys in these elite firms, gender doesnÆt relay traditional workplace disadvantages: they are promoted at the same rate as men, paid the same salaries and become partners at roughly the same rate. This is not just at odds with the broader literature on women in the workforce but also empirically peculiar for the Indian context.  To unpack the various mechanisms and structural conditions that result in this positive &ndash; but unusual - empirical context, my project employed an embedded, multi-case study drawing on fieldwork between 2011-2014 and the analysis of over 135 in-depth interviews with elite law, banking and consulting professionals in Mumbai, India.
