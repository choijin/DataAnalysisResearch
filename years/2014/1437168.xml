<AbstractNarration>Many molecules have characteristic spectral fingerprints at terahertz frequencies, which makes this frequency range unique for applications in spectroscopic sensing of chemical and biological species. However, progress in development of terahertz sensors is lacking due to the challenges associated with generation and detection of terahertz waves. Quantum-cascade lasers are the most powerful solid-state sources of terahertz radiation that have been developed in the past decade. However, they are required to be cooled much below room-temperature for operation, which makes it challenging to implement conventional optical sensing techniques with such lasers. This award will support development of a low-cost and compact terahertz sensor instrument based on arrays of chip-scale terahertz lasers for broadband spectroscopic sensing of solid or liquids. A unique "evanescent-wave" sensing scheme will allow measurement of terahertz properties of the analyte placed in ambient conditions while the laser chip is cooled inside a portable cryocooler for operation. A successful demonstration has the potential to spawn development of affordable commercial sensors at terahertz frequencies that would find applications in cell biology, process engineering, crystal engineering, pharmaceutical quality control, identification of counterfeit drugs, identification of explosives, and even drug discovery. Educational opportunities in the area of photonics and quantum-mechanics will be facilitated at various levels including that for elementary and middle-school students and engineering undergraduates. The project will also enable opportunities for interdisciplinary research across different academic departments of the university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an intracavity evanescent-wave terahertz spectroscopic sensor with integrated arrays of terahertz quantum-cascade lasers on a semiconductor chip that would interact with an analyte in either liquid or solid-phase. A key characteristic of such lasers is that the evanescent-mode of the laser cavity can extend few millimeters above the appropriately designed cavities, which could therefore interact with analyte placed in ambient conditions while it is not in contact with the cooled laser chip. The resonant frequency of the laser interrogates the complex permittivity of the analyte. The fact that electronic non-linear mixing still works at terahertz frequencies, on-chip mixing will be utilized to efficiently down-convert the sensed terahertz signal to microwave frequency region. Hence, all that is needed to record the sensed data is a hand-held microwave spectrum analyzer. The need for expensive terahertz detectors as well as a terahertz spectrometer is completely eliminated, whereas the functionality attained can be similar to or better than that from many advanced spectroscopy techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many molecules have strong and characteristic rotational and vibrational transitions at terahertz (THz) frequencies, which makes this frequency range unique for applications in spectroscopic sensing of chemical and biological species. Powerful sources of coherent THz radiation could potentially impact society through a range of applications; for example in remote detection of explosives and illegal drugs in bags and packages. However, progress in development of THz sensors is lacking due to unavailability of practical and inexpensive means to generate high-intensity THz radiation. THz semiconductor quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are chip-sized THz radiation sources that are among the most powerful and hence promising to target THz applications; however, they need to be cryogenically cooled for operation, and several challenges exist before their radiation characteristics and operational performance are at a level at which commercial instruments could be developed that use such lasers.</p> <p><br /><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong><br />Through this project, we have developed a framework in which THz QCLs could be utilized to perform spectroscopic sensing and analysis in the frequency range of ~2-4THz of a wide variety of chemical and biological analytes (in both solid and liquid forms) despite the operational challenges that are specific to this class of lasers. Through detailed calculations, we showed that a compact THz spectroscopic sensor instrument could be realized with QCLs, which will arguably be the first such low-cost THz instrument that could be made commercially once realized. The key design element of such a spectroscopic sensor instrument are arrays of "single-mode" THz lasers that radiate at a series of precisely defined THz frequencies at which the analyte needs to be probed. For each frequency, a pair of lasers need to be developed, in which both pairs can exchange the radiation within their cavities, while each of them radiate in different directions. Such an architecture would result in the possibility of remote THz optical sensing of analytes in a reflection-based geometry, and eliminates the use of additional costly components such as a THz detector or a THz spectrometer.<br />To experimentally demonstrate the proposed THz spectroscopic instrument, three components were required. The first is the ability to realize single-mode THz lasers radiating in longitudinal direction to that of the laser's cavity (or edge-emitting lasers that radiate in direction along the surface of the semiconductor chip). The second is the ability to realize single-mode THz lasers radiating in surface-normal direction to that of the laser's cavity (or normal to the surface of the semiconductor chip). And, the third is the ability to couple radiation from a pair of such lasers to achieve THz frequency mixing to down-convert the radiation to microwave regime, which could then be detected easily. Through this project, we were able to experimentally demonstrate the first two components through novel means, whereas the third component about mixing and frequency down-conversion is yet to be realized.<br />For the edge-emitting single-mode THz QCLs, we have developed a new distributed-feedback (DFB) technique for such lasers that is termed as "antenna-feedback", which allows a THz QCL laser to achieve robust single-mode operation and radiation in a narrow-beam. THz QCLs with narrowest beam output to-date were experimentally demonstrated. A US patent application was successfully filed and granted based on this newly developed DFB technique for plasmonic lasers. For surface-emitting single-mode THz QCLs, a new "hybrid-grating" technique was developed and experimentally demonstrated to realize monolithic THz QCLs with the highest optical power output and quantum-efficiencies to-date for such QCLs. It is argued that the hybrid grating scheme could potentially be utilized to increase power output for surface-emitting semiconductor lasers at any wavelength.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong><br />Over the entire length of this project, four doctoral students at Lehigh University, each of whom were partially supported through this grant, obtained advanced training in the fields of semiconductor optoelectronics, THz science and technology, and semiconductor physics.&nbsp; Three students graduated with doctoral degrees and have joined semiconductor optoelectronics industry to contribute toward photonics research and development in the country.<br />To support the broader objective of education and outreach, the program investigator (PI) taught a laboratory course to first-year undergraduate engineering students in which the broader theme of data communications using light was highlighted. The concepts of lasers versus LEDs were introduced through informal lecture sessions and laboratory workshops, and some of the more advanced challenges in the field of optical communications were addressed by means of designing simple laboratory projects over the course of the semester. The PI also participated with his graduate students in other outreach programs, such as a program for middle school girls from the neighboring schools, that aims to get girls excited about engineering. Through this program, the PI gave experimental demonstrations to middle school girls and explained about&nbsp; photonics research and career opportunities that are now available due to a rapidly developing and expanding photonics industry in the nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/16/2018<br>      Modified by: Sushil&nbsp;Kumar</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437168/1437168_10320520_1531768032399_Laser_Image--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437168/1437168_10320520_1531768032399_Laser_Image--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Terahertz semiconductor quantum cascade lasers"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437168/1437168_10320520_1531768032399_Laser_Image--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Terahertz semiconductor quantum cascade lasers"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Left: Terahertz semiconductor laser chip (center, bottom) soldered onto a copper plate.
