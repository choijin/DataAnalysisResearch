<AbstractNarration>The Pacific Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar (PNWNAS) will be held at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon on October 18, 2014. PNWNAS has been an annual event since 1987, held on a Saturday each fall in the northwestern states of USA and nearby Canadian provinces. The goal of this meeting is to bring together researchers from universities, government research labs, and industry from the Pacific Northwest region to share expertise in the field of numerical analysis and computational mathematics. This conference will enable computational scientists in the region to hear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside speakers and members of other institutions in disciplinary or interdisciplinary research areas. Meanwhile, it will also facilitate interactions that lead to employment and internship opportunities for postdocs, undergraduates, graduate students and members of underrepresented groups attending the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be about 70-80 participants for the 2014 seminar, with 8 invited speakers from industry, government, and academia. The talks will be mainly concerned with modeling large-scale complex systems, construction of accurate and efficient numerical schemes, energy sustainability, and software and hardware development, including emerging computer architectures. The last two topics are popular research fields in local government and industry. Poster sessions will be arranged for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to present their research work so as to maximize their visibility to all participants. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants from national labs and industrial partners will bring new potential internship and employment opportunities for the students and postdocs attending the meeting. The seminar will be publicized through various communication channels, including Portland State University student chapter of the Society of Women Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program to broaden participation from members of those underrepresented groups. The exposure to topics and techniques not typically available at the home universities and the opportunity for face-to-face collaboration will enhance the research programs of faculty, student, and postdoc participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seminar web site:  http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/pnwnas/</AbstractNarration>
