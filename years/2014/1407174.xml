<AbstractNarration>Geometric complexity theory is an approach to P versus NP and related problems in complexity theory using algebraic geometry and  representation theory.  A fundamental problem in representation theory, believed to be important for this approach, is the Kronecker problem, which asks for a positive combinatorial formula for decomposing the tensor product of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group into irreducibles.  The theory of quantum groups and crystal bases, which has been actively developed over the last several decades, is a powerful tool for connecting combinatorics and representation theory.  In the last decade, there have been several attempts, by Berenstein, Zwicknagl, Mulmuley, Sohoni, and others, to use this tool to study the Kronecker and related plethysm problems.  Recently, the investigator and his collaborators Mulmuley and Sohoni have obtained the beginnings of a theory of crystal bases for the Kronecker problem.  The main goal of this project is to push this approach further.  More broadly, this project aims to further explore the potentially deep connections between complexity theory and positivity in algebraic combinatorics as has been initiated by geometric complexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objects arising in algebra are typically complicated, mysterious, and have many symmetries.  Algebraic combinatorics is the study of counting and organizing such objects.  This project will explore some surprising connections between this area and complexity theory (the study of algorithms and their limitations).  The tensor decomposition problem is an important and difficult problem that shows up in many fields, including algebraic combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistics, and has applications in medicine, computer vision, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication.  Essentially, it is the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals.  This project offers potential new insights into this problem by applying powerful tools from algebraic combinatorics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Objects arising in algebra are typically complicated, mysterious, and have many symmetries.  Algebraic combinatorics is the study of counting and organizing such objects.  This project explored some surprising connections between this area and complexity theory (the study of algorithms and their limitations).   The Kronecker problem is a fundamental  problem in algebraic combinatorics which has been open since the 1930s. Meanwhile, a new approach to the famous P vs. NP conjecture in complexity theory has unearthed surprising connections to the Kronecker problem.  This has sparked a new interest in this problem in recent years, resulting in over 20 papers. The main outcomes of this project were a solution to an important special case of the Kronecker problem, which significantly extended the state-of-the-art, and the development of a new tool using noncommutative algebra to push this approach further.  A considerable effort was devoted to abstracting this tool and developing its properties in a very general setting. Particularly surprising was the extent to which this tool applies to other positivity problems (a  general class of problems which includes the Kronecker problem).  Most notably, it led to the strongest results on a positivity problem related to Macdonald polynomials, which have connections to physics, probability theory, and knot theory.   As is often the case in mathematics,the original approach (using quantum groups) to the problems studied in this project was not as fruitful as expected, but it was superseded by the approach using noncommutative algebra.  However, results towards connecting and combining these approaches were obtained, and these will likely guide future research.   The investigator mentored  two undergraduates and one graduate student on small-scale projects which fit into this research program.       Though this research is in pure mathematics, it offers potential new insights into  the tensor decomposition problem, which is essentially the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals and has applications in medicine, computer vision, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication.
