<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer, Phase I project is to help make therapy more consistent with patient preferences, beliefs, and values to maximize engagement in therapy and improve patient outcomes.  Therapy for mental health problems is highly effective, yet many patients drop out before getting the full benefit because they are not satisfied or engaged in the therapy.   Therapist Assisted Online (TAO) provides an array of tools for online psychotherapy including educational materials, homework on mobile devices, video conferencing with a therapist, and weekly monitoring of progress. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients? actions in the TAO system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time.  The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced.   This is the intelligent counseling system.  It will work very similarly to movie streaming services or online book sellers who recommend movies or books to you based on a person?s  past preferences and the preferences of thousands of other users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Access to effective mental health therapy is ubiquitious in the US.  Over 90 million people in the US live in mental health underserved areas, 55% of US counties have no psychologists, psychiatrists or licensed mental health providers.  As a result it is estimated that 60% of people with depression receive no treatment.   Tele-health could provide a viable alternative for millions of people.   TAO Connect, Inc is dedicated to reducing mental health disparities and improving access to the most effective treatment possible by developing more effective tools for online mental health care delivery.    The NSF phase I, STTR grant was used to build two initial tools toward that goal.  The University of Florida College of engineering and the department of psychology collaborated on this project.  TAO Connect, Inc. (TCI) is building an intelligent counseling system using advanced analytics and machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to individualize and customize mental health treatment in order to maximize engagement and improve treatment outcomes.     TCI has an already existing Therapist Assisted Online (TAO) treatment platform that is an integrated platform of evidence-based tools for providing online mental health treatment.  TAO is licensed to mental health providers who use the integrated system in treating their patients.  TAO tools include high production quality interactive on-line educational modules, text message reminders, daily practice logs, a weekly progress measure, and a weekly 10-15 minute videoconference with a counselor.  Patient activity in the system along with progress measure results are displayed on a therapist dashboard providing accountability for the client.     The NSF phase I grant was used to develop the first tools towards a TAO intelligent counseling system ["TAO-ICS"] that extends TCIÆs existing platform by including:  (1) treatment effectiveness feature selection and outcome prediction system, this prediction component analyzes TAOÆs collected data to identify the most important factors that contribute to the success of treatments.   The 25 factors identified as related to patient/client improvement will help us customize text messages to help increase those behaviors most associated with positive gains in treatment.   2) feedback and prediction components consisting of an intelligent feedback component that identifies positivity and negativity of user journal logs (polarity detection) and informs the user and the therapist regarding any changes over time.  The polarity tool is being integrated into the TAO treatment system as a tool patients or clients can use to help modify their thinking to be more positive.  Both tools were developed using machine learning.           Last Modified: 01/14/2016       Submitted by: Sherry Benton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
