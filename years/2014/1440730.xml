<AbstractNarration>This planning grant supports Carroll University's efforts to develop a plan to improve its campus network infrastructure aligning with the goals described in NSF's Campus Cyberinfrastructure-Infrastructure, Innovation and Engineering (CC*IIE) Program. The 12-month planning period includes the following activities: evaluate existing IT infrastructure against STEM research and education needs on campus, identify unmet needs, and define a plan to address them; develop a campus cyberinfrastructure (CI) plan aligned with Carroll's strategic planning; and study and develop a science DMZ approach to re-architecting the campus border. Planning for network improvements at Carroll is especially timely to achieve maximum leverage in enabling research and education activities across lab facilities. The work also impacts the institution's existing emphasis on undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this planning grant was to assess current and planned information technology network needs for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research and teaching laboratories at Carroll University.  The STEM faculty and information technology staff completed a comprehensive evaluation of the existing information technology network infrastructure and the current and planned STEM faculty and student research and educational needs, identifying gaps and proposing a plan to eliminate them.  The assessment will be used to plan for infrastructure upgrades to support STEM faculty and student teaching and research needs at the university.  Intellectual Merit: As a predominately undergraduate institution, Carroll University students benefit from conducting undergraduate STEM research directly with faculty, but as compared to large research institutions, the infrastructure to support STEM research is limited.  The university is making significant investments to develop the infrastructure with construction of a new 44,000 square foot wet laboratory facility, renovations to a field station structure, and plans for renovations of existing STEM teaching facilities on campus. This was an ideal time to plan for campus network infrastructure to support the growth of faculty, student and community research.  Broader Implacts: Carroll Unviersity has a significant population of first generation and low-income students and is committed to supporting their attainment of baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields.  This grant supported this effort by providing the necessary network infrastructure planning that will assist in the recruitment and persistence of students through the offering of meaningful STEM reseach opportunities.  The university also has a history of community collaborations with K-12 schools in STEM education.  This planning project also supported these initiatives and ultimately will result in attracting more students to careers in STEM.
