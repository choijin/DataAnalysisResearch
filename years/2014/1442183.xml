<AbstractNarration>Tropical forests are the largest reservoirs of biodiversity on Earth and are under great threat due to deforestation. This project addresses the critically important question of how microbial biodiversity responds to and recovers from deforestation. Microorganisms are regarded as drivers of ecosystem processes and have not been characterized as extensively as plants and animals. The US-Brazil research team will focus on the potent green house gas methane and identify the producers and consumers along gradients of land use in the Amazon rainforest. The educational efforts for this project will build relationships between K-12 students in Brazil and US for biological conservation through live video conferences for training of undergraduate students and research mentoring of graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The microbial studies have important conservation and technological implications for forest management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct and real time measurements of the methane gas in the soil-atmosphere interface will be combined with a targeted high throughput nucleic acid sequencing of microbes involved in the cycling of methane to assess their genetic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions in two different regions of the Amazon rainforest. This work will result in the most extensive survey to date of the microbial diversity of any tropical ecosystem, the most comprehensive study of microbial responses to land use change ever documented, and the development of a novel approach for the integration of microbial biodiversity, allowing for accurate prediction of the effects of deforestation on the methane cycle.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Amazon rainforest is the largest terrestrial ecosystem in the world.  It plays essential roles in global processes, including controlling global temperature, regulating the water cycle and balancing the flux of atmospheric gases.   The Amazon rainforest is undergoing increasing rates of deforestation, driven primarily by cattle pasture expansion. Forest-to-pasture conversion has been associated with changes to a number of ecosystem processes, including a substantial increase in soil methane emission to the atmosphere. Methane is one of the most important greenhouse gases globally, playing a key role in atmospheric chemistry and climate.  However it is not well understood why forest-to-pasture conversion results in increased methane release to the atmosphere.  To address this question, we assembled and trained a team of Brazilian and American scientists and students.  We measured methane flux (the flow of methane between the soil and the atmosphere), assessed local environmental conditions, and determined aspects of soil biodiversity (including species identity, gene content and phylogenetic diversity of soil microorganisms), across a gradient of land use change (old growth primary forest, cattle pasture, and secondary forest regrowth). We repeated these measurements in two contrasting regions of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest ? the relatively wet northeastern region (within the Tapajos National Forest, in the state of Para?) and the relatively dry southwestern region (at Fazenda Nova Vida, in the state of Rondonia).  We observed that primary forest soils exhibited methane uptake at modest rates while pasture soils exhibited methane emission at high but variable rates. Secondary forest soils exhibited low rates of methane uptake, suggesting that forest regrowth following pasture abandonment could reverse the methane sink-to-source trend.   While few environmental variables were significantly associated with methane flux, we identified numerous microbial community attributes in the surface soil that explained substantial variation in methane flux. Among the strongest predictors were the relative abundance and diversity of methanogens (microorganisms that produce methane); both increased in pasture relative to forests. We also identified specific microbial taxa that were associated with methane flux and which collectively explained ~50% of flux variance. These taxa included methanogens and methanotrophs (microorganisms that consume methane), as well as taxa that may indirectly influence methane flux through acetate production, iron reduction, and nitrogen transformations. Each land type had a unique subset of taxa associated with methane flux, suggesting that land use change alters methane cycling through shifts in microbial community composition.   Taken together, our results suggest that changes in methane flux from agricultural conversion are driven in large part by microbial responses to land use change in the surface soil, with both direct and indirect effects on methane cycling. This demonstrates the central role of microorganisms in mediating ecosystem responses to human-induced land-use change in the Amazon Basin.  Land use change is accelerating in the Amazon Basin, and understanding why greenhouse gas emissions increase with forest-to-pasture conversion is crucially important to inform strategies to mitigate the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion.
