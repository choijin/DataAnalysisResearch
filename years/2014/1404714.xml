<AbstractNarration>The 22nd Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) will be held at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, SC in September 2014, and the 23rd PANTS meeting will be held at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC in December 2014. The 28th Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers (SERMON) will be held in the spring of 2015. These conferences will be open and free to all participants. More details, including exact dates, a list of speakers, the location for the 28th SERMON meeting, and registration information will be decided upon soon, and all information will be posted on the conference websites as it becomes available:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each meeting will feature several invited talks, given by number theorists outside the region, ranging from prominent researchers to up-and-coming graduate students. Speakers will be chosen so as to represent a broad range of active research interests within number theory. Each meeting will also feature contributed talks given by participants from within the region. The primary goal of these meetings is to provide the number theory community in the Southeast the opportunity to hear about recent research in number theory. The meetings attract prominent number theorists outside the region, and provide regional mathematicians, particularly graduate students and junior faculty, with an opportunity to speak about their research. The meetings inspire collaboration and broaden the scope of existing research interests within the general subject of number theory. Meeting participants include mathematicians of all levels: undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and junior and senior faculty. In particular, the meeting provides a valuable opportunity to regional graduate students and to faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions, who may have few or no other opportunities for professional travel. The organizers will also continue to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and other underrepresented groups. To this end, in September 2014 PANTS will be held at a HBCU (South Carolina&lt;br/&gt;State) for the first time in the conference's history.</AbstractNarration>
