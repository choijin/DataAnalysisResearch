<AbstractNarration>Electrical conduction is an interesting phenomenon whose study has led to countless physical discoveries. At first glance, the casual flow of electrons through a conductor seems to be a simple system, but the complexities of the system quickly unravel as it is studied in more detail. Heat, impurities, crystal structure, and quantum effects are a few simple examples of complexities that are regularly considered in charge carrying conductors. One such complexity is the consideration of electron spin, analogous to magnetic polarity. Theoretically, spin-dependent currents are perfectly possible to generate and measure. However, modern electronics are not dependent on electron spin, so electrical conductivity is independent from it. Using spin-dependent currents in conductors opens up the field of spintronics and will lead to numerous applications such as spin transistors, quantum computing, and larger information storage media. In collaboration with Dr. ZhiDong Zhang at Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science in China, this study plans to significantly impact the field of spintronics by electrically generating and controlling a spin polarized current.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topological materials offer robust protection to certain material properties, making them ideal candidates for studying spin polarized currents. Topologically invariant states may induce long quantum coherence times to allow for quantum computing at high temperatures and induce dissipationless transport useful for low power devices. In that sense, this research will use bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) nanowires, a known topological material, to generate, measure, and control a topologically protected spin polarized current. The topological states that provide long quantum coherence times at room temperature are also known as surface states, as opposed to bulk states. Since nanowires have large surface to bulk ratios, they are ideal for maximizing the effect of the topologically invariant states. The generation and study of a robust spin polarized current is a necessary step towards the next age of information processing. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  Conventional electronics depend on the direction and number of electrons. In spintronics, the "spin" of the electron is consid-ered for information storage and processing. Since electron spin is a more inherent property than transverse motion, utilizing spin can lead to smaller, low-power electronics.  All electrons have spin, but inelastic scattering off atoms randomizes the direction of the spin, making the spin incoherent. In other words, the "spin coherence length" is very short. This is true for most materials.  In certain materials, called topological insulators, electrons travel along the surface differently than through the bulk. These surface states can have long spin coherence times. Spin is preserved along the surface states of a topological insulator (Image 1).  A spin current is a current where the direction of electron spin is preserved. Long spin coherence lengths are necessary for measuring spin currents, which is why topological insulators are perfect candidates for studying spin currents. Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) nanowires have topological surface states where the spin coherence length is long (Image 2)  Methods  Nanowires are a choice material, since their surface to bulk ratio is minimized. Spin currents have been measured on other materials such as thin films and 2-dimensional heterostructures, but larger spin currents can be measured when the effect of the bulk states is reduced. Ferromagnetic contacts (permalloy) inject spin-polarized electrons into the nanowire. Unlike normal metals, electrons in ferromagnetic metals are spin-polarized in a magnetic field up to 14 Tesla. This ensures that the electrons injected into the nanowire share the same spin direction (Image 3).  Nanowires are grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a silicon substrate, and contacts are made by using photolithography (image 4). Measurements are performed via lock-in techniques and take place in temperatures from 2K - 300K and magnetic fields of &plusmn; 14T.  Results  As the magnetic field is changed, the contacts become spin-polarized. Since ferromagnetic materials have hysteresis effects, measurements should depend on the ramp direction of the magnetic fields. If the coercive fields of the contacts are not equal, the polarization of the contacts can become antiparallel, giving a sharp rise in resistivity.  Most surface states are destroyed by phonon scattering at room temperature. However, behavior of Bi2Se3 nanowires does not significantly change at large temperatures (300K). Therefore, Bi2Se3 is a prime candidate for practical device applications at room temperature.  Intellectual Merit  The Intellectual Merit of this EAPSI fellowship consists of the realization of a spin polarized field effect transistor, the application of topological insulators towards practical applications, and the advancement of knowledge in many condensed matter, topological insulators, spintronics, and magnetism. Currently, a spin polarized topological current has yet to be measured, although the theoretical and experimental focus has been increasing in recent years.   Such measurement is the first step in creating practical spin transistor (spin-FET) involving quantum materials different from conventional semiconductors, which would revolutionize industry on a scale comparable to the transistor. We propose a topological insulator nanowire device that will open up a new avenue for spintronics by using topologically protected spin transport.   Mr. Goble is a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate who has a strong background in the fabrication and measurement of nanodevices, including GaAs/AlGaAs two dimensional hole systems and Bi2Te3 topological insulators. He has much experience in performing transport measurements using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS), which can measure devices in a large temperature range. Dr. Zhang and his expertise in magnetism perfectly compliment Mr. Goble's expertise; available equipment i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
