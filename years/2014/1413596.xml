<AbstractNarration>Professor Lingjun Li of the University of Wisconsin at Madison is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop multi-faceted analytical methodologies, largely based on ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and microseparation techniques for large-scale functional discovery, quantitation and structural elucidation of neuropeptides in a crustacean model system. Peptides play a key role in various physiological processes and the selected crab model is an ideal platform on which to develop novel mass spectral techniques and apply these techniques to gain biologically relevant information. The project findings are expected to expand our knowledge base in neuropeptide family organization and functional consequences of neuropeptide multiplicity in these important model organisms, with a focus on response to environmental stress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, studies are being conducted to develop multi-faceted ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and microseparation techniques for the separation and analysis of neuropeptides. The project has four separate but related specific aims: (1) to develop a multi-dimensional separation platform based on pairing capillary electrophoresis (CE) with electrospray ionization ion mobility-mass spectrometry (ESI-IM-MS), and use it for the analysis of neuropeptides; (2) to develop an ion mobility- mass spectrometry (IM-MS)-assisted isobaric tagging quantitation method and apply it to the study of peptidomic changes in response to environmental stress; (3) to develop an IM-MS-based site-specific strategy for rapid and accurate localization of D-amino acids in peptide epimers; and (4) to develop a strategy based on IM-MS and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) to study the mechanism of gas phase peptide sequence scrambling and its impact on peptide de novo sequencing and to construct a collision cross section database to facilitate endogenous neuropeptide identification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of conducting this project, a diverse group of students will be trained in advanced mass spectrometry, analytical separation methodologies and neuroscience. A partnership with the Madison Metropolitan School District program to host and mentor high school students for summer research internships will be continued and a web-based peptidome database system will be constructed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Combining Microseparations and Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry to Probe Peptidergic Signaling in Environmental Stress     Project Outcome Report  Overview: Significant changes in environmental conditions, such as hypoxia and temperature variation, pose a physiological challenge to animals. There is a great deal of interest in understanding the underlying molecular mechanism which regulates these stress-induced responses. Neuropeptides, an essential class of molecular regulators of various physiological processes, are believed to play a key role. Although considerable progress has been made towards characterizing the neuropeptidome, technical challenges have prevented its complete characterization.  The wide dynamic range, chemical complexity and posttranslational modifications of neuropeptides in the nervous system require new analytical tools to characterize and accurately quantify their dynamic changes upon environmental perturbations.  In this project supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry at NSF we developed multi-faceted analytical methodologies, largely based on ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and microseparation techniques for large-scale functional discovery, quantitation and structural elucidation of neuropeptides in a crustacean model system.    The intellectual merit of the proposed activity: Using a multifaceted approach, we have further expanded crustacean neuropeptidome, significantly expanding our knowledgebase about the neuropeptides utilized in these model organisms.  We also carried out comparative neuropeptidomic analysis to understand dynamic changes of neuropeptides involved in environmental stress, such as temperature stress, salinity stress and hypoxia stress.  In addition, we introduced the powerful IM-MS technology into the rapidly evolving field of neuropeptidomics to address several key issues that hinder neuropeptide research.

The technological advancements resulting from this proposal is applicable to large-scale analysis of biochemical and peptidergic signaling in many nervous systems, including humans.  The molecular insights gained from probing neurochemistry in response to stress could lead to a better understanding of neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms involved in adapting to environmental stress, a process that is highly conserved among all organisms to maintain their survival in the face of both externally and internally generated "stimuli".  Overall, this research helps to develop novel analytical capabilities and answer several fundamental neuroscience questions about functional consequences of neuropeptide multiplicity in response to stress.  The proposed activity transcends traditional boundaries of each individual field, and takes advantage of the power of analytical chemistry tools to advance neuroscience research and discovery.   The broader impact resulting from the proposed activity: Our research supported by the NSF grant contributed to the development and building of an integrated and improved analytical platform for neuropeptide analysis, which will have broad impact in both analytical chemistry and neuroscience research communities.  Furthermore, this highly interdisciplinary research project also provided excellent cross-disciplinary training experience for a large number of graduate and undergraduate students, including several graduate students who successfully obtained their PhD with partial support from this NSF funding and numerous undergraduate students who contributed as coauthors on peer-reviewed publications.
