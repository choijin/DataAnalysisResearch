<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to continue Carnegie Mellon University participation in the CyberCorps®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to prepare highly-qualified Cybersecurity professionals for entry into the government workforce. This project will prepare the nation?s cybersecurity workforce through advanced studies with interdisciplinary strengths in engineering, computer science, humanities, management and policy, as defined by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Workforce Framework. It will support 4 cohorts of students, each comprised of approximately seven students with a technical focus in the Master of Science in Information Security Technology and Management program and up to four students with a policy focus in the Master of Science in Information Security Policy and Management program. This program will require a course in ethics for all CyberCorps® SFS students and a project in cybersecurity, either as part of their formal curriculum or through a research assistantship. &lt;br/&gt; The NSF?s CyberCorps® SFS program funds projects that address Cybersecurity education and workforce development. The Scholarship Track provides funding to award scholarships to students in Cybersecurity. In return for their scholarships, recipients will work after graduation for a Federal, State, Local, or Tribal Government organization in a position related to Cybersecurity for a period equal to the length of the scholarship. The Capacity Track seeks innovative proposals leading to an increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce Cybersecurity professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, the U.S. federal government has hired 148 Carnegie Mellon CyberCorps® SFS graduates who have gone on to serve and protect the nation?s information infrastructure at the Department of Defense, National Security Agency, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) and many other federal organizations. Carnegie Mellon has earned three national Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) designations in the areas of Information Assurance, Research and Cyber Operations. Leading cybersecurity researchers, investigators and teaching faculty work side by side with the CyberCorps® SFS students to explore and advance critical areas such as software security, cryptography, reverse engineering, privacy, biometrics and cyber forensics.</AbstractNarration>
