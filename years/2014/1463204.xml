<AbstractNarration>Laminated metal composites are critical to reducing the weight and energy demands of transportation vehicles.  However, the manufacture of these composites is difficult, costly, and energy intensive.  To make laminated metal composites, existing methods involve applying large stresses or pressures to bond multiple metal sheets through a deformation process.  Using heat can soften the metal sheets during manufacturing, reducing the amount of required force.  A potentially cheaper, less energy intensive, and more controllable approach is to use applied electrical current instead of pure heat.  The act of driving electrical current into a metal part during deformation can localize the heat to exactly where it is needed, temporarily softening the metal during a manufacturing process.  However, how and why local current flow softens metals is not completely understood, particularly when force is simultaneously applied.  This award supports fundamental research to provide the understanding of how metals soften and bond under simultaneous electrical current and pressure. Such understanding will enable the development of manufacturing processes that produce cheaper and high quality laminated metal composites.  In turn, this will facilitate low-cost production of transportation vehicles with better fuel efficiency, including aircraft and automobiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to uncover the fundamental phenomena associated with the reduction of material flow stress under the combined electrical current and mechanical loads through the investigations at the micro- and meso- scales.  In this study, electrically-assisted static bonding of laminated metal composites will be carried out at Northwestern University.  Laminated metal composites will be fabricated under a range of pressure and continuous electrical current conditions.  These samples will then be tested for quality, in terms of bond strength, and analyzed by advanced characterization techniques.  These characterization approaches, carried out at Carnegie Mellon University, will use electron microscopy to correlate aspects of the metal microstructure to bond strength and to determine electrically-assisted deformation mechanisms.  Furthermore, experiments will be conducted inside the microscope in order to visualize the dynamics of metal deformation under in situ applied continuous electrical current and pressure.  Such experiments will provide new understanding on the effects of electrical current on microstructures, deformation behavior, and metal bonding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we studied a new manufacturing approach that combines application of electrical current when bonding two metal sheets under high-pressure rollers.  Metal normally has to be heated using an oven or furnace in order to soften the metal sheets and enhance their bond to other metal sheets when they are rolled together.  A potential cost and energy saving approach is to apply electrical current to the rollers directly, forcing the current through the metal sheets.  In this way, the metal is heated only at the exact time and location where the sheets need to be softened, which is between the rolls.  Our contribution was the use of advanced characterization methods to study the structure of the metal sheets after they have been bonded by this novel rolling approach.  We used electron microscopy to probe the metal grains and atomic structure, thereby learning how and where the metals were heated and softened.  In this manner, we discovered that most of the heating actually happened at the exact interface between the two metal surfaces.  Most of the metal sheets were not heated by the electrical current.  Instead, pre-existing scratches on either metal sheet surface create protrusions that become the preferred paths for the electrical current, similar to a tall tree or radio tower during a lightning storm.  Our analysis indicated that the heating was not uniform across the metal surfaces, but instead the heating was highly localized.  The result is significant localized heating at the metal surfaces, even sufficient to melt the near surfaces, during the roll bonding process.  Previous studies have shown that the use of electricity during roll bonding produced a stronger bond between metal surfaces.  Our microscopic analysis served to explain why.  When we analyzed the metal far away from the mating surfaces, we saw very little evidence of heating or softening of the metal.  Again, this indicates that the use of electricity to "assist" roll bonding can help to localize the desired heating to the mating surfaces instead of heating the entire metal sheet thickness.  Furture studies could investigate whether an optimize "pattern" of scratches at the surface can produce a more uniform and controlled heating of metal sheets when bonded in this manner.
