<AbstractNarration>One of the most challenging questions in active mountain building is how climate might drive tectonic processes, in the form of mass redistribution. In other words, do climate-driven changes in erosion lead to increased exposure of mountainous belts, and perhaps influence tectonic processes, like uplift and faulting, as predicted by numerical models? The study of this question, by means of observational and analytical data is challenging because most areas where active mountain building is occurring are covered by remnant glaciers and glaciated landscapes from the end of the Neogene period (23 ? 2.5 million years ago). The St. Elias mountain belt, in southeast Alaska, is a prime location to address this question due to its extensive glaciation. The recent erosional record of this active mountain range is stored in the Gulf of Alaska and was recovered during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 341. Integrated analysis of deep-sea core material obtained from drilling at the continental shelf, slope, and the deep-sea Surveyor Fan will provide means to quantify the effect of global and local climate changes on the erosional and structural evolution of a mountain range. The youthfulness of the St. Elias belt, along with high rates of tectonic and erosional processes, and its close proximity of the Gulf of Alaska provide an ideal natural setting to study climate-tectonic interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-standing debates exist in the Earth sciences on whether Neogene climate change affects rates of surface processes, such as erosion, and consequently influences tectonic processes, such as faulting, through redistribution of mass. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that an increase in glacial erosion has led to focused exhumation in the core of the St. Elias orogeny as proposed by numerical and analytical data. Two possible target regions have been suggested where a tectonic-climate feedback may have developed: in the fold-thrust belt and at the indenting Yakutat plate corner. The wealth of existing onshore geo- and thermochronological data provide a comprehensive picture of the current spatial pattern of exhumation rates, but the quantification of changes in rates and patterns through time has been challenging. The research team?s approach is to investigate the offshore sedimentary record of the St. Elias orogeny deposited in the Gulf of Alaska. This orogeny developed during a period of significant global climate change, including the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (iNHG) at the Plio-Pleistogene transition (PPT), ~2.6 Ma, and the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) from 1.2 to 0.7 Ma, but also a change of local climate resulting in alpine glaciers, perhaps as early as the Late Miocene/Pliocene (6.5 Ma). The high-resolution magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic age control from the IODP Expedition 341 cores allow close linking of changes in sedimentary lithofacies and textures, provenanace, exhumation, and sediment routing and distribution, to test the record of climate-tectonic interactions along the southern Alaska margin. The integration of Gulf of Alaska seismic reflection data with the age and provenance control from the 341 cores allow examination of sediment mass flux in the regional offshore depositional system, the Surveyor Fan, from a 3-D perspective through time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project evaluated the sediment routing in the Gulf of Alaska along the southeastern margin of Alaska.  The goal of the research was to better understand the role of glaciation and tectonics in how sediment is distributed from the glaciers in the high peaks of the St. Elias Range, transported and deposited across the marine shelf and slope of the Gulf of Alaska, and into the deep marine submarine fans of the Aleutian subduction zone. In this setting, the general proximity of the sediment source (mountains) to the sink (subduction zone) is less than 100 km, and the two endmembers are connected by onshore glaciers and offshore ice streams (i.e., glacial channels across the marine shelf).  This setting provides a unique opportunity to study sediment routing along a glaciated active convergent margin. An important fundamental question that this research tries to address is whether glacial erosion can be a prompt for tectonic uplift of a mountain belt.  An analogue would be when you partially submerge a beach ball with your hand in the ocean/lake/pool and then remove your hand (erosion) and then the ball quickly lifts higher (tectonics) out of the water.              To study these types of processes we used the drill cores from the Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 341 for the offshore component and used previous studies of the onshore tectonic uplift of the St Elias Mountains.  We collected samples from five boreholes along a NE-SW transect starting offshore of the Bering Glacier, across the marine shelf and slope, and into the deep-sea Surveyor Fan. Each borehole recovered cores from a maximum depth of 1 km, which contain sediment deposited since 10 Ma in the distal fan, since 1.2 Ma in the proximal fan, and since 0.7 Ma on the continental slope and shelf. The sediment in the cores was mainly mud and silt with small portions of fine-grained sand. The deposition ages were based on biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy determined onboard the ship during core collection. In total, 64 samples were chosen from the cores to provide stratigraphic coverage and were also selected based on their approximate sand content to increase chances of zircon and apatite yield.     Our dataset consists of ~ 650 detrital zircons selected for double dating method utilizing both detrital zircon fission track (FT) and U-Pb analysis from sand and diamict beds, as well as zircon U-Pb geochronology and apatite FT from igneous and gneissic clasts. Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology of sand records dominant peak ages of 53, 62, 70, and 98 Ma with minor populations of 117, 154, and 170 Ma. Most of these ages can be correlated to primary igneous sources exposed along the coast of southeastern Alaska. All samples analyzed share nearly identical U-Pb detrital zircon populations suggesting similar primary sediment sources.  Thermochronologic data from the same zircons have cooling ages of 80 to 35 Ma and yield similar results for continental shelf, slope, and proximal submarine fan environments, suggesting the same general source region since 1.2 Ma. Thermochronologic data from samples collected in the distal submarine fan strata, however, show extreme, rapid, and deep-seated exhumation was ongoing at ~11&ndash;8 Ma.     In summary, we were able to show that tectonic uplift of the St. Elias Mountains started before the initiation of widespread Pliocene-Pleistocene glaciation. There does not appear to be a direct connection between glaciation and the start of tectonic uplift.  Our data do show, however, that since the start of major glaciation at 1.2 Ma there was a single source of sediment that was transported rapidly across the shelf, slope and deep marine environments.  We suggest in our study that offshore sediment transport through large ice streams provided the mechanism for rapid transport of sediment from the onshore high peaks to the deep trench. If there was a tectonic response to the glaciation at 1.2 Ma, our geochronological and thermochronometric data are unable to record these recent shifts but the new data do show a record of mid-Miocene and late Miocene tectonic events recorded in offshore sediment of the Gulf of Alaska.
