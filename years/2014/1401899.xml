<AbstractNarration>Central Asia is highly dependent on glacier meltwater for its water resources. Its high mountains hold great volumes of glacial ice, with seasonal snow melt supplying up to 80% of the region's fresh water needs. However, since the 1960s, central Asia has lost over 14% of its glacier covered area and ~18% of its ice volume. Changes in glacially-fed hydrologic systems impact water availability and biodiversity in these regions. However, these observations cover only a fraction of the climate history of this region. Ice cores from glaciers in the high Himalayas preserve records of millennia of climate changes. Understanding the natural variability recorded in such records is of critical importance for interpreting the vulnerability of the region to modern and future climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will recover a surface-to-bedrock ice core from the Pamir, Tajikistan, which will be used to develop detailed records of climate changes in central Asia during the Holocene and beyond. The results will be used to reconstruct the dynamics and rates of moderate, abrupt, and threshold changes in climate in Central Asia. Specifically, the research team will generate annually-resolved, multivariate geochemical records from the ice cores (including stable isotopes, trace elements, major ions, and dust particles), recover pollen and other biological materials, and compare the results with ice core and other paleo records from the interior of Asia. Chronological control will be established with a variety of techniques (layer counting, radiocarbon, beryllium-10, lead-210, and tritium). The project involves scientific collaboratio with international research partners from Germany and Japan as well as from local government departments in Tajikistan. Graduate students from two US institutions would be involved in the international activities, which will include both field expeditions to collect the ice cores and follow up sampling and collaboration visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the Paleoclimate Program of the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, the EPSCoR program, and the Division of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Central Asia (CA) is one of the most arid regions on Earth, and is particularly sensitive to changes in seasonal moisture delivery. For the last two millennia, climate proxy records show that moisture delivery to CA has varied widely. The Pamir Mountain Range in CA is home to dozens of glaciers that serve as critical repositories for precipitation, feeding meltwater to multiple major river systems, including the Amu-Darya, the most melt water-dependent major river system on Earth. Roughly 80% of Central Asia&rsquo;s surface water is sourced from snow and ice melt in the Pamir Mountains feeding water to the ~72 million inhabitants of the region. As a contribution to the understanding of water resources and climate in Central Asia researchers involved in this project:</p> <p>(1)&nbsp; Summarized and synthesized past climate records for CA covering the last 2000 years demonstrating that there are relatively few past climate records available and that these are either short (200-400 years) or low resolution. For modern climate we find that the season during which precipitation begins and when temperatures in the glacierized highlands is cold enough for precipitation to accumulate, on glaciers and snowfields, which is normally March-April-May, is getting shorter. Small shifts in the seasonal timing or patterns of temperature and precipitation threaten this delicate balance. We document +1<sup>o</sup>C of warming in the glaciated highlands of CA over the last decade, compared to the previous 27 years of satellite data, which itself represents an already warming baseline, compared to preceding decades. Over the same period, we find a decrease in annual precipitation during the critical May cold/wet season of 2-5cm/a.
