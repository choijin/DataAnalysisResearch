<AbstractNarration>Recognizing the critical roles played by technical professionals in serving the public and addressing grand&lt;br/&gt;challenges, many formal courses and programs have been created to promote professional responsibility&lt;br/&gt;and ethical integrity among engineering graduates. Other interventions (e.g., service learning programs)&lt;br/&gt;have been developed to more broadly challenge engineering and technology students to see themselves as&lt;br/&gt;engaged citizens and community members. Yet there has been a lack of research on foundational&lt;br/&gt;understandings of social and ethical responsibility among such students, including how these&lt;br/&gt;understandings change over time and through participation in specific types of learning experiences.&lt;br/&gt;Additional empirical evidence is needed to guide ongoing efforts to cultivate enhanced social and ethical&lt;br/&gt;responsibility among future engineers, including by identifying and promoting specific interventions that&lt;br/&gt;have the biggest positive impacts on students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study responds to these gaps in the existing scholarship by asking the following research&lt;br/&gt;questions: 1) What do engineering students perceive as responsible (and irresponsible) professional&lt;br/&gt;conduct, and what do they perceive as socially just (and unjust) technical practices?, and 2) How do&lt;br/&gt;foundational measures and understandings of social and ethical responsibility change during a four-year&lt;br/&gt;engineering degree program, both in general and in relation to specific kinds of learning experiences? To&lt;br/&gt;investigate these questions, a longitudinal mixed-method study design will collect and analyze&lt;br/&gt;quantitative and qualitative data from undergraduate engineering students at four universities. To improve&lt;br/&gt;transferability of results, these schools will represent a variety of institution types. Each collaborating&lt;br/&gt;school also has large numbers of students in programs of interest, e.g., service-learning and intensified&lt;br/&gt;ethics instruction. Further, the study will give priority to investigating differences in perceptions and&lt;br/&gt;experiences among underrepresented student populations.</AbstractNarration>
