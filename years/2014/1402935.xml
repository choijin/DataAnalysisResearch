<AbstractNarration>Title:  Integrated Synthesized Optical Sources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful pursuit of this research could lead to the first widely-tunable, integrated synthesized optical sources, which would be much more stable, and have smaller size, weight and power requirements than components currently available. The combination of photonic and electronic integration will produce a chip-scale tunable sources that do not require accurate temperature control or high input power to operate. The project's GOALI partner, Freedom Photonics LLC., intends to commercialize some version of the proposed device that may impact the optical components marketplace. The new technology will be developed within the NSF-NNIN facility and the new fabrication processes will be made to students and outside users. The PIs have a strong commitment to involving high school, and undergraduate students in research activities, including summer internships, and students of under-represented groups in STEM learning programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to develop a highly-integrated widely-tunable optical frequency synthesizer (OFS) with sub-Hz-level accuracy. The integrated OFS is based on a monolithic, 4-section, widely-tunable laser offset-locked to any one of the lines of a frequency comb. By employing a combination of photonic and electronic integration, sub-Hz-level accuracy can be obtained with an integrated optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) technology. All of the photonics, except for the external reference laser, the photodiodes, and the comb generator, will be integrated on a single InP photonic IC . The tunable laser's output can be tuned across the entire comb by tuning the laser between the comb lines with the RF offset source, and alternately selecting different comb lines. With this approach sub-Hz-level relative frequency accuracy, as well as sub-kHz linewidth, should be possible. If successful, the proposed work would have a transformative impact on the design of optical systems for a series of new optical technologies.</AbstractNarration>

The synthesizer consists of three major components:  1) a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) designed as a widely-tunable coherent receiver, 2) a closely integrated electronic feedback circuit to form an optical phase-locked loop with the PIC, and 3) an optical comb source that spans the desired wide optical frequency range.  An RF synthesizer is also required to tune between the comb lines.  The basic concept is to phase lock the tunable laser in the PIC to a line of the comb source and then to offset tune it, by mixing with the RF while locked, from one comb line to the next, thus accessing all possible frequencies across the spectrum of the comb source.  The project involved critical collaborations with Freedom Photonics, LLC, for some of the PIC designs, and in the last year, OEwaves, Inc, for a high-performance optical comb source.  Figure 1 schematically illustrates the Optical Synthesizer system.  The gray rectangle represents an AlN carrier which holds the PIC and the electronics. The first version of the PIC is shown in the upper left by both a photo and a schematic.  The two optical sources are combined in the 2x2 MMI and are mixed in the two photodiodes (PDs), where a beat frequency is created.  The electronics amplify this beat frequency, further mix it with the RF, and following a loop filter, provide it to the tuning section of the laser, thus closing the feedback loop, which forces the laser to lock to the comb line plus the RF offset frequency.   The lowest schematic shows a lower-power Y-branch-laser design of the PIC provided by Freedom Photonics.    Figure 2 shows the output spectrum of the comb generator.  Although it contains some unwanted uneveness, it is useful over about a 2.88 THz optical frequency range.  The comb line spacing of 26 GHz is close enough that a reasonable RF synthesizer and RF mixing electronics can be employed in the electronics.  (Actually, one only needs to provide ~ 13 GHz of RF offset, since both plus and minus offsets are possible.)  Figure 3 shows the Optical Synthesizer output as the RF offset is adjusted from a small level  up to over 15 GHz of offset.  This demonstrates that all optical frequency outputs are possible between the comb lines.    Figure 4 gives a measurement of the linewidth of the Optical Synthesizer output.  This is accomplished by beating it against a very narrow linewidth laser and measuring the resulting difference frequency in an electrical spectrum analyser.  Because the reference laser was free running and there was also no effort to stabilize the microresonator comb generator, there was some drift over finite time intervals (like 10s of milliseconds).  Nevertheless, a very good linewidth of &lt; 4 kHz was estimated.    Figure 5 provides a photo of the unpackaged test system.  In this case probes are used for all external contacts, and the optical connections are done with lensed fiber using micrometer stages on an optical bench.  The AlN circuit board area is approximately 1 cm x 1 cm.  Figure 6 illustrates how fast the optical phase locked loop can capture a line of the comb source and lock to it.  Here the tunable laser in the PIC is 'open-loop' tuned by applying a current to one of its mirrors to shift its internal filter charateristic.  Given the probing configuration, it is estimated that this occurs in approximately 10ns.  As shown in part (d) the detected output signal on the scope is coherent for the time the current to the mirror is constant and the laser is phase locked to one comb line, but then becomes incoherent (small) when the mirror current is abruptly switched to cause the laser to tune to the vicinity of the new comb line some 5.7 nm away.  It requires nearly 200 ns for the loop to capture and lock on the new line, again providing a second coherent output.  This is very fast.  In summary, this project has been largely successful in meeting its goals. The intellectual merit has been vast.  New and novel PICs have been created, new circuit designs for phase locking have been demonstrated.  Several comb generating elements have been explored.  On a broader scale, new applications for coherent optical receivers are now being explored.  "Analog Coherent" in Data Centers is now being discussed without too much criticism.  Many sensor applications are conceivable.  Moreover, the couple of students and post doc involved have already given numerous talks on this subject, one of them invited.
