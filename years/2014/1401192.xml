<AbstractNarration>The immediate goal for the project is to develop new tools and methods to study three and four dimensional spaces.  Questions about these spaces are central to much of current research in both geometry and topology. There exist powerful tools for studying these spaces, but more is needed, especially to study four dimensional spaces where ignorance is broad and deep.  This ignorance motivates the focus here to develop new tools and sharpen the old ones keeping in mind the long term hope of understanding more about the spaces involved.  The research described in this proposal could construct bridges between the fields of topology, differential geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.  These fields are central not just to mathematics, but to theoretical physics as well.  For example, notions from these fields are used in condensed matter physics, high energy physics, string theory and theories of gravity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foreseeable future research of C. H. Taubes will focus on differential topology questions with the following three specific areas of concentration.  The first area of concentration will be directed towards understanding the behavior of sequences of solutions to certain generalizations of the equations for flat connections on 3 manifolds and for self dual connections on 4-manifolds with a goal to determine if divergent sequences doom solution counting constructions of differential topology invariants.  The second area of concentration will investigate the differential topology of certain natural generalizations to dimensions 3 and 4 of the 2-dimensional notion of a holomorphic, quadratic differential.   The third area of concentration will use the Seiberg-Witten equations to analyze the dynamics of vector fields on manifolds of dimension three and higher.  Of particular interest are conditions that guarantee the existence of closed orbits and other sorts of small dimensional invariant sets.  In all of these areas, the research will use methods from differential geometry and analysis to construct new tools for studying the differential topology of low dimensional spaces.  Specific topics and questions notwithstanding, the long term goal is to understand the structure of smooth, low dimensional manifolds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to develop mathematical tools to understand the classification and structure of smooth, 4-dimensional spaces.   (By way of an example, our universe has four dimensions, the three spatial dimensions, and time makes four.)   To this end, the principle results from this NSF grant involved the use of novel differential equations to analyze 4-dimensional spaces.   By way of background:  Solutions to two iconic differential equations, the Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten equations, have played a central role in the study of 4-dimensional spaces since the 1980's and 1990's.  Even so, the questions about these spaces that go to the very heart of the matter are still unanswered. The goal of this project was to put new differential equations into play.   One of the equations studied in this work is a generalization of the afore-mentioned Seiberg-Witten equations (which are equations from physics related to the equations that describe the interactions between electrons, their anti-particles and electro-magnetic fields).  A second equation was studied that is related to Einstein's equations which describes the force that we call gravity.   The use of generalizations of the Seiberg-Witten equations to study 4-dimensional spaces was problematic by virtue of the fact that these equations can have infinitely many solutions.  Even so, these new equations might still play a role given a sufficiently precise characterization of the behavior of any given infinite family of solutions.  This work found a characterization that involves novel objects in four dimensional geometry which are now called Z/2 harmonic spinors.  The discovery and investigation of these new objects during the course of this grant has lead to much ongoing research to determine their significance.   Meanwhile, the grant's work on the second equation (called the self-dual Weyl equation) discovered an intriguing, previously hidden role for 3-dimensional knot theory and 3-dimensional geometry in the four dimensional context.  The precise role of 3-dimensional knot theory in 4-dimensional geometry is not known at present and of tremendous topical interest.
