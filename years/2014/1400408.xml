<AbstractNarration>Vacuum processes are integral to research in nanoscience, medical device development, and advanced physics as well as advanced manufacturing of products such as hybrid cars, computers, flat screen televisions, and solar panels. In spite of vacuum technology's ubiquitous presence, the numbers of technicians needed in any given region is relatively small and the post-secondary education options for this specialized field are rare. This project will develop a cost-effective program that can provide geographically dispersed businesses and research institutions with highly-skilled technicians in this critical technology via a combination of distance education and hands-on instruction.  Normandale Community College will partner with businesses and two- and four-year institutions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New York to expand the reach of its certificate and associate degree programs in vacuum technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will 1) pilot the delivery of a distance education model that combines high-definition telepresence technology with hands-on instruction using a mobile, fully-functional vacuum trainer system; 2) validate the competencies required by industries that rely on vacuum technology and develop assessments to measure learner mastery of concepts; and 3) revise, as needed, the vacuum technology curriculum and vacuum trainer system to provide rigorous academic and hands-on learning aligned with industry needs and incorporate a modular structure to facilitate flexible options for customized training and regional customization based on dominant industry sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance knowledge of equipment maintenance technician occupations, specifically those who service vacuum systems, and their education. It fills a gap in the continuum of education and training for technicians able to support and maintain vacuum systems by providing smaller markets with access to technician education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Growing High-Tech Education: Project ReVAMP Expands Opportunities for U.S. Workers in Advanced Manufacturing     The electronic devices we use and depend on every day are fabricated with vacuum systems. Solar panels, touchscreens, LED lights &ndash; are all produced with this enabling technology. Advanced manufacturing industries, from nanotechnology and semiconductor to national defense, depend on these complex systems &ndash; and on the Vacuum Technicians who operate and maintain them.       Normandale Community College in Bloomington, Minn., is leading the effort to educate Vacuum Technicians, an overlooked workforce that has an outsize impact on vacuum-reliant industries. When a vacuum system is offline for even a day, it can cost millions of dollars in lost business. Vacuum Technicians are part of the critical response team that repairs these systems.

Project ReVAMP directly addressed this national workforce development need by combining standards-aligned courses with hands-on training and by using telepresence technology to deliver vacuum technician education nationwide.     Project ReVAMP (Revising Vacuum technology, an Advanced Manufacturing Program) was funded by the National Science Foundation (award#: DUE 1400408) from October 2014 &ndash; June 2018. Principal Investigator Delmer Smith and Co-Principal Investigator Nancy Louwagie led a team of staff, students, and contract workers at Normandale Community College, which administered the award.

To scale up, Normandale continues to establish partnerships with businesses and colleges. Teaching via telepresence ensures that more students and employees across the country have an opportunity to begin, or expand, a career that is vital to the U.S. economy.     Project ReVAMP Goals, Outcomes &amp; Impacts  Goal: Demonstrate that the telepresence classroom instructional model can be used as a venue to realize the benefits of a technical education experience, similar to face-to-face classroom settings, for learners who synchronously attend the same class at separate locations.       Goal: Develop a cost-effective program that can reach economies of scale to provide business and industry with technicians possessing essential knowledge and skills in a critical enabling technology via a telepresence classroom instructional model.     Project staff accomplished these goals by:  Updating two college-level courses: Introduction to Vacuum to Technology and Vacuum Technology and Troubleshooting Designing and installing a custom telepresence classroom with three large high definition monitors, one of which is a touch screen; three high definition cameras; high-performance microphones and speakers. Designing and building four copies each of a Rough Vacuum Equipment Trainer system and a High Vacuum Equipment Trainer system.      The number of unique student participants directly impacted by Project ReVAMP totaled 154 people.     Students and workers who enrolled at Normandale Community College completed 16 sections (11 via telepresence) of Introduction to Vacuum Technology and four sections (three via telepresence) of Vacuum Analysis and Troubleshooting.     Project ReVAMP had a local impact because it employed nine students at Normandale Community College on paid contract or as part of an Independent Study assignment.     Project ReVAMP had a national impact because courses were delivered to students and workers via telepresence, enabling real-time teaching and learning, to offsite locations in California, New York, Wisconsin, and Utah.     Project ReVAMP had an impact on the pipeline of new workers and the existing workforce of vacuum technicians in the U.S. People taking classes were two-year and four-year college students and workers who are already employed at a national laboratory and in the semi-conductor and hard-drive industries and the vacuum system design and build industry.     Project ReVAMP continues to have an impact on how vacuum science is taught by providing hands-on learning opportunities with Vacuum Equipment Trainer systems that were designed with the advice of an Industry Advisory Group and built with industry grade components.
