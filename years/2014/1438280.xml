<AbstractNarration>PI: Babbitt, Callie W.   &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1438280&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid pace of innovation in engineered nanomaterials (ENM) has led to a very large growth in new applications that take advantage of the unique properties of these materials. Fullerenes (carbonaceous ENM, e.g. 60-carbon nanospheres) are used in diverse applications, ranging from biomedical science (e.g., drug delivery), cosmetics (e.g., free radical 'scavenging'), to renewable energy systems (e.g., polymer photovoltaic cells). However, the impact of fullerenes on the natural environment is poorly understood, particularly as the fullerenes, like other ENMs, can undergo significant changes over their life cycle, changes that can affect their manner of transport and partitioning between environmental compartments. This proposal will develop a life-cycle analysis of fullerene materials by considering two diverse pathways of fullerene utilization: renewable energy (photovoltaics) and personal health (cosmetic creams).  The PI and Co-PIs will utilize an ecosystem assessment approach and use toxicity data for a life-cycle assessment that will compare the eco-toxicity impact from the totality ('embodied') of upstream production of fullerene to that of the 'direct' eco-toxicity of the materials, when they are released into the environment. A successful outcome can inform sustainable ENM process design, material handling, disposal practices, and help guide policy and decision-making.  The proposal also has a varied and strong outreach and educational plan, especially the incorporation of opportunities for underrepresented K-12 students to engage in sustainable nanotechnology research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this proposal will address key issues about life cycle impact of fullerene-based materials, which will be translatable to life cycle assessments (LCAs) for other ENMs as well. They propose to create new life cycle metrics that can account for systems-level impact of fullerenes on select ecosystem functions by combining laboratory microcosm studies of freshwater ecosystems under fullerene exposure with emerging life cycle accounting techniques for ecosystem services. This data will enable the investigators to assess the eco-toxicity impact from 'embodied' versus 'direct' eco-toxicity of the materials. The end goal of this research is to create a comprehensive life cycle assessment of fullerene ecological impact that reflects realistic variability of fullerene materials, life cycle stages, and end uses. The ability to distinguish between direct and embodied ecological eco-toxicities will enable prioritization of life-cycle stages and intervention strategies that have the highest opportunity for environmental improvement. Outcomes from this effort can inform environmentally low-impact fullerene production methods, identify risks associated with fullerene-containing products at end-of-life, enable proactive policy-making for ENMs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) enable new technologies that benefit society, including applications in medicine, water treatment, and renewable energy. However, these benefits come at a high cost if ENM production, use, and disposal are not designed, managed, and governed by policy aimed at minimizing environmental and human health risks. Environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) provides a holistic approach to quantify nanotechnology impacts, but has historically struggled to keep pace with the accelerating rate at which new ENMs are introduced to the market. Traditional metrics have also taken a limited view on ecological risk, focusing narrowly on ecotoxicity to model organisms, not on the broader ecosystem-level impacts that might occur if ENMs are released into freshwater systems. To address these challenges, this research project has created new experimental and modeling approaches that can be applied to proactively assess systems-level ecological risks and benefits for a model nanomaterial class: the spherical fullerenes (e.g., the 60-carbon 'buckyball' and other related forms).</p> <p dir="ltr">A key innovation of this project was the analysis of fullerene use and environmental impact as part of the broader landscape of nanotechnology commercialization. Research outcomes demonstrate that optimizing an entire portfolio of materials used in applications like solar energy or battery energy storage could maximize overall performance of the materials, while minimizing resource use, environmental impact, and economic trade-offs. The potential direct risks of nanomaterial release were compared to indirect environmental impacts across the nanomaterial supply chain. Research outcomes demonstrate that supply chain energy consumption may result in greater freshwater ecotoxicity than direct nanomaterial release in many realistic cases, due to the electricity-intense nature of fullerene production and the reliance on fossil fuels to provide this electricity.</p> <p dir="ltr">This systematic approach can aid decision-makers in mitigating unintended consequences from nanomaterial inputs through informed life cycle modeling. Additionally, since there are variable vulnerabilities depending on the release site, such as proximity to critical environmental areas, the location of fullerene release may actually change the magnitude of risk. Thus, an integrated spatial modeling tool was created to assess the risk of ENM exposure to lakes and rivers in New York State. Results show potential ENM exposure from production facilities that are within buffer zones of the Great Lakes watershed and vulnerable ecosystems.</p> <p dir="ltr">If, in fact, ENMs like fullerenes are released into these freshwater systems, it is essential to know how they might affect organisms or disrupt overall ecosystem health. The research project studied acute and chronic effects on model freshwater organisms and found that in realistic release concentrations, fullerenes have low probability of causing microorganism lethality due to ecotoxicity. However, when ingested, the carbon-based fullerenes caused visible darkening of the organism's exoskeleton. We showed, for the first time, that this physical change actually led to greater predation by fish who seek food sources by sight.</p> <p dir="ltr">On the other hand, fullerenes do not easily dissolve in water, and if not consumed as particles by suspension feeding organisms (e.g. Daphnia) that live in the water column, they readily sink to the sediment once they enter an ecosystem. Our results suggest that the impacts to algae and invertebrates are sublethal, but that growth and reproduction of these organisms are inhibited. &nbsp;We also showed a change in the community structure of the microbes that are responsible for decomposition and cycling of key elements such as nitrogen.  These shifts in organisms that make up the benthic community may ultimately change the ability of ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services such as nutrient removal, decomposition and sequestration of carbon.</p> <p dir="ltr">To share research and new knowledge with the broader community, the project carried out multiple integrated outreach activities. &nbsp;We created and taught nanomaterial learning modules at a local high school with 90% minority population and one of the highest poverty rates in New York (60 students). The educational modules developed were then published online and distributed to broader audiences via the National Science Teacher Association and the Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers. Through a wide array of K1-2 partnerships in the Rochester community, we worked with middle school summer camps (36 campers), &nbsp;career connections days (400 5th and 6th grade students), and RIT K12 Academy (400 5th grade students) to raise interest in STEM and sustainable nanotechnology degrees and careers. Findings were shared at community events and traditional academic venues, including international presentations and peer-reviewed journals.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438280/1438280_10314631_1540938211948_WOIS3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438280/1438280_10314631_1540938211948_WOIS3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Communicating research on sustainable nanotechnology"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438280/1438280_10314631_1540938211948_WOIS3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Communicating research on sustainable nanotechnology"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">World of Inquiry High School students presented findings from their inquiry-based exploration of nanomaterial sustainability.
