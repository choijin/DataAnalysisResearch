<AbstractNarration>This work will provide maps of nearby planetary systems in unprecedented detail using the new Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) with the Gemini Observatory. Planetary systems around other stars are associated with tenuous structures composed of dust known as debris disks, the counterpart of our solar system's asteroid and Kuiper belts. The observations will be used to test models of planet formation and evolution, and the data reduction pipeline will be made available to the astronomical community.  The PI and his team will train and mentor graduate and undergraduate students in research, and develop an exoplanetary system imaging exhibit at UCLA's Exploring Your Universe public outreach event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GPI instrument is a new coronagraphic integral field unit commissioned at the Gemini Observatory. It is capable of detecting and spectroscopically characterizing young Jovian planets reaching 10 million times fainter than their parent star at separations as close as 0.2 arcseconds.  This project scientifically exploits new, high-contrast, polarimetric images of debris disks to be obtained in the early science operations of GPI. Debris disks imaged with unprecedented contrast and inner working angles will reveal distinct signs of interaction with planets, such as eccentricity of the dust belt, surface density asymmetries, and gaps. Coupling analytical and numerical models of the dynamical evolution of dust grains with radiative transfer calculations will enable detailed scattered-light modeling of each disk with the goal of producing a physically grounded model that gives strong constraints on the mass and orbital parameters of the related planet(s). The results of this project will be used to produce independent estimates of the planet properties from those derived from the dedicated, multi-year, planet-searching campaign, and provide a unique viewpoint on the dynamical history of each system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to develop and apply techniques for the analysis of data obtained by an astronomical instrument, the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI).  In particular, one of the modes of this instrument is designed for characterizing the polarization state of light, which is a characteristic that is sensitive to when light interacts with small dust grains that are in orbit around young stars.  This dust is  a byproduct of the planet formation process, and by studying the polarization state of light, we can characterize how disks of dust around nearby young stars reflect the planet formation process.   We developed techniques and tools for extracting information on the polarization state of light, as well as tools for calibrating its strength, and tools for assessing how the measurement process altered what we see.  These tools have been incorporated into publicly available software geared toward the analysis of GPI data, and are used throughout the community of users with access to the instrument (including all US-based institutions).  Further, they have been used to study disks of dust around stars that have been detected by the ongoing Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey.   Examples of these analysis include the study of the dust around the young star HD 61005, which harbors an asymmetric disk of dust detected with GPI (attached image).  The ability for GPI to analyze polarized light allows characerization of the dust much closer to the star (located at the white cross).  Our analysis of the dust distriubtion shows that it could be shaped by an unseen planet orbiting an an angle relative to the main dust belt's orbit around the star.  Another example is the first detection of light scattered by dust around the star HD 131835 (attached image), again showing an asymmetric distribution that hints at unseen forces sculpting the disk.  As part of this project, multiple graduate and undergraduate students were trained in techniques of data acquisition and analysis, and were supported in their career development in part through conference presentations and journal article publications.
