<AbstractNarration>The objective of this SAVI is to create a "Virtual Institute" that will support the synthesis of an entire eukaryotic genome. Writing a complete eukaryotic genome remains daunting and beyond the proven DNA synthesis capabilities of any individual lab. In analogy to the Human Genome Project, these first efforts will require the coordinated activities of many individual centers. This proposal will put in place the research coordination infrastructure to enable the complete synthesis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome within 5 years at sites spanning the USA, Asia, and Europe, at institutions ranging from four-year liberal arts colleges to major research institutions, thereby capturing the imagination of undergraduate students, fellows, staff and faculty members worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this SAVI initiative are to solidify current collaborations between researchers at Johns Hopkins University, Loyola University of Maryland, and international partners in China, India and Europe. The strategic outsourcing of the synthesis of individual chromosomes guarantees that the entire yeast genome is completed within a five-year period with leveraged funds and resources from the US and international participating partners and funding agencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - The broader impacts of this SAVI project are the first-ever ability to ask and answer deep questions about fundamental properties of chromosomes, genome organization, gene content, the function of RNA splicing, the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and numerous other aspects of genomes and evolution. The "synthetic yeast" will play an important role in practical applications, ranging from a test-bed for focused biological problems to a chassis for future synthetic biology projects. Notably, yeast is the preeminent organism used for industrial fermentations, with a wide variety of practical uses, including ethanol production from agricultural products and by-products. As the only effort of its kind outside industry, this project provides a unique and very important service in keeping the knowledge in the Synthetic Biology field public through open source availability of all reagents and protocols without intellectual property restrictions. This SAVI effort is unique also in training researchers in genome-scale synthetic Biology. An innovative "Build A Genome" course was developed and implemented at Johns Hopkins University, which has since been offered at Loyola Univ. of Maryland, and two universities in China. The SAVI imitative will also offer opportunities for multi-disciplinary training of students, postdocs, and researchers, and will encourage international exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is being co-funded by NSF's Directorate for Biological Sciences, Directorate for Engineering, and Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Here we summarize major findings of our Sc2.0 project, designed to synthesize the worldÆs first designer yeast chromosomes.  SynIII -- Total synthesis of a designer eukaryotic chromosome. Rapid advances in DNA synthesis techniques have made it possible to engineer viruses, biochemical circuits/pathways and assemble bacterial genomes. In March 2014 we reported the synthesis of a functional 272,871 bp designer eukaryotic chromosome, synIII, which is based on the 316,617 bp native Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III.

Changes to synIII include TAG/TAA stop-codon replacements, deletion of subtelomeric regions, introns, tRNAs, transposons and silent mating loci as well as insertion of loxPsym sites to enable genome scrambling (Figure 1). SynIII is functional in S. cerevisiae. Scrambling of the chromosome in a heterozygous diploid revealed a large increase in "a mater" derivatives resulting from loss of the MAT&alpha; allele on synIII. The total synthesis of synIII represents the first complete design and synthesis of a eukaryotic chromosome, establishing S. cerevisiae as the basis for designer eukaryotic genome biology.   Bioethics Statement of Principles for Sc2.0. With collaborators around the world, it is important that all scientists working on the Sc2.0 project operate under a common set of principles and are cognizant of ethical and policy issues associated with synthetic biology and genome engineering. To this end, we have surveyed the current ethics and regulatory landscape of these fields and developed the Sc2.0 Statement of Ethics and Governance to which all members of the Project adhere. The statement focuses on four aspects of the Sc2.0 project: societal benefit, intellectual property, safety, and self-governance. Such project-level agreements may be valuable as a model for self-regulation in similar global, large-scale synbio projects, in order to maximize benefits and minimize potential harms.   Demonstration of SCRaMbLE. Synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP-mediated evolution, or SCRaMbLE, is the inducible evolution system built into Sc2.0 chromosomes. SCRaMbLE generates combinatorial genomic diversity through rearrangements at designed recombinase sites. We applied SCRaMbLE to yeast synthetic chromosome arm synIXR (43 recombinase sites) and synthetic region synVIL (5 recombinase sites). Deep sequencing of 64 synIXR SCRaMbLE strains revealed 156 deletions, 89 inversions, 94 duplications, and 55 additional complex rearrangements; several duplications are consistent with a double rolling circle mechanism (Shen et al., 2015). Figure 2 summarizes the structure of the starting chromosome, as well as structures of dozens of scrambled derivatives, symbolized in a "SCRaMbLEgram" in which each triangle symbolizes one of the 43 segments bounded by recombinase target sites. The diversity of structures generated can readily be seen and summarizes the remarkable capacity of S. cerevisiae to tolerate distinct chromosome structures. Importantly, each synIXR SCRaMbLE strain was structurally unique. Rearrangements occurred exclusively at loxP sites, with no significant evidence for ectopic rearrangements or mutations involving synthetic regions, the 99% non-synthetic nuclear genome, or the mitochondrial genome. Deletion frequencies identified genes required for viability or fast growth. Replacement of 3&cent; UTR by non-UTR sequence had surprisingly little effect on fitness. SCRaMbLE generates genome diversity in designated regions, reveals fitness constraints, and should scale to a fully synthetic genome.  Meetings. We have organized four scientific meetings to discuss the Synthetic Yeast Genome Project. The fifth meeting, to be held July 2016 in Edinburgh, Scotland, will focus on Sc2.0 along with the broader field of Synthetic Genomics. A fifth is planned.  First...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
