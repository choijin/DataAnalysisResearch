<AbstractNarration>A large body of research documents that long-term relationships are an important feature of firm-to-firm transactions. Survey evidence suggests that on average around 80% of firms' sales go to regular customers, and these customers are usually other firms. Nevertheless, the macroeconomic implications of long-term relationships on firms' growth and on firms' price setting are poorly understood. For example, long-term relationships with suppliers could be an important determinant of firms? performance, as well as of firms' decisions to exit and to expand. On the other hand, a firm?s desire to maintain a relationship may constrain it from changing price, thus generating or amplifying price rigidities. This might be an important driver behind the persistent effects of monetary policy shocks on GDP observed in the data. &lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research uses a new dataset, the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD) from the U.S. Census Bureau. This dataset records for every import transaction undertaken by U.S. firms the identities of the U.S. importer and of the foreign exporter, along with the values and quantities shipped. This feature of the data makes it possible to classify transactions as taking place between long-term trading partners, and to examine the implications of relationships on macro dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;The dissertation comprises of two sub-projects.&lt;br/&gt;(1) The first part of the research consists of examining the relationship dynamics in U.S. trade. The purpose of this project is to study why relationships are formed, how long they last, why they are broken up, and how they evolve over the business cycle. This research seeks to shed light on the effect supplier relationships have on the performance of U.S. importers over the business cycle and on their decisions to exit and to expand. It will also explain whether the collapse in trade during recessions is due to the destruction of relationships or due to reduced trade within ongoing relationships.  &lt;br/&gt; (2) The second part of this dissertation aims at resolving an important puzzle in monetary economics. On the one hand, VAR evidence suggests that monetary policy shocks have persistent effects on GDP. On the other hand, micro evidence indicates the average firm frequently changes price, thus in principle adjusting quickly to shocks and eliminating any real effects. Most existing research investigating this puzzle has so far ignored producer markets (transactions between firms) as a source of price rigidities.  This project examines whether firms? desire to maintain a relationship with their transaction partners is a plausible source of rigidity that can reconcile the conflicting micro and macro evidence.&lt;br/&gt;Since most firm-to-firm transactions take place in long-term relationships, it is a first-order question to understand how relationships affect aggregate outcomes. One important question is what drives the large, persistent differences across firms in performance and productivity: long-run relationships with reliable suppliers could be an important explanation. On the other hand, if producer relationships matter for aggregate price dynamics, this could have important implications for monetary policy. Understanding how producer prices are set and how they affect aggregate variables will enable central bankers to better respond to economic fluctuations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">SUMMARY</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">This project uses transaction-level import data from the U.S. Census to study how relationships between firms affect price flexibility, where a relationship is defined as a buyer-seller pair that has been engaged in trade for some time. Economists have long suspected that long-term relationships might be important for monetary policy, increasing price rigidity due to the use of fixed-price contracts. In fact, I show that prices in&nbsp;older relationships are more responsive to cost shocks than prices in new relationships. Furthermore, the share of&nbsp;older relationships in the economy increases in recessions, making prices more flexible at that time, which might reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy in downturns. My project provides a first large scale empirical analysis of how relationships between firms evolve over time and how they affect the aggregate economy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">MAIN RESULTS</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Long-term firm-to-firm relationships account for a substantial share of U.S. imports. In an average quarter, 53% of U.S. imports are transacted via importer-exporter pairs that have been together for longer than 12 months (Figure 1). Moreover, about 18% of trade is due to pairs that have been together for more than four years.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">I find that the responsiveness of prices to shocks increases with relationship age. Column (1) in Figure 2 presents the coefficients from a regression of the price change between two transactions of a given relationship trading a specific product&nbsp;on the exchange rate movement over the same time period and on relationship age. I find that in a new relationship, firms change their price by on average&nbsp;0.15% for every 1% movement in the exchange rate. For every additional month the relationship has lasted, this price response increases by 0.0015%. Thus, a four-year relationship changes price by about 0.23% for a 1% movement in the exchange rate. Columns (2) and (3) show that the finding holds for both positive and negative exchange rate shocks.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">To understand why older relationships have more flexible prices, I examine how relationships evolve over time. Figure 3 shows the value traded in each year, relative to the value traded in year one, for relationships lasting a total of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 years. The figure shows that, for example, a relationship lasting in total four years trades about 5% more in the second year than in year one.&nbsp;Relationships follow a life cycle: during the first years of the relationship, annual trade increases each year&nbsp;until a peak is reached. Trade then declines again until the relationship terminates. A similar pattern holds for the number of transactions per year and for the number of products traded per year. My findings&nbsp;are in&nbsp;line with&nbsp;survey evidence from the management literature suggesting that relationships follow a&nbsp;life cycle.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">I also study how the price level varies with relationship age. Figure 4 illustrates that the average transaction price declines with relationship age. Relationships that have conducted 41-60 transactions on average trade at a price that is 1.3% lower than the price at transaction one. Management surveys suggest that prices decline with relationship age due to productivity improvements and learning, as well as due to quantity discounts. </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Based on 16 interviews I conducted&nbsp;with international firms, I conclude that </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">relationships allow firms to share risk. I therefore develop a&nbsp;theory in which a buyer and&nbsp;a seller firm share profit risk. The firms&nbsp;stochastically accumulate relationship-specific assets, which generates the life cycle. I&nbsp;show that&nbsp;this model&nbsp;matches&nbsp;my empirical findings.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">In my framework, exchange rate fluctuations affect the seller&rsquo;s profit margin. By changing price, the seller is able to pass through some of the costs to the buyer, thus sharing profit risk. In a new relationship, risk sharing is incomplete because&nbsp;no specific assets have yet&nbsp;been accumulated and the&nbsp;firms prefer separation to helping each other. However, as the relationship develops it becomes more valuable, which incentivizes the firms to share risk more completely by increasing the responsiveness of prices to shocks. Older relationships on average have more specific assets and therefore more flexible prices.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">During the 2008/09 recession, the number of import relationships of age less than one year fell by 20%, while the number of older relationships remained relatively stable (Figure 5). Simulating&nbsp;my model&nbsp;calibrated to match&nbsp;the salient characteristics of relationships, I&nbsp;show that this increase in average relationship length raised the aggregate responsiveness of import prices to shocks by about 20%, from 0.2 to 0.24 (Figure 6). This result provides a new micro foundation for the cyclical variation in aggregate price flexibility. The findings suggest that monetary policy might become less effective in recessions due to the larger share of&nbsp;long-term relationships in the economy. Policymakers seeking to strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy in recessions should therefore attempt to combat the drop in new relationship formation at that time.&nbsp;</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/12/2016<br>      Modified by: Sebastian&nbsp;Heise</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473696136345_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473696136345_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473696136345_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Share of Import Value by Relationship Age (x-axis: Relationship Age in Months)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Heise</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Heise</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473696272764_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473696272764_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473696272764_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Responsiveness of prices to exchange rate shocks</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Heise</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Heise</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712762573_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712762573_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712762573_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Value Traded per Year by Relationship Age</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Heise</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Heise</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712816478_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712816478_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712816478_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Transaction Price by Relationship Age</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Heise</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Heise</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712883738_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712883738_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712883738_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Number of Relationships by Age over Time</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Heise</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Heise</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 5</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712958507_Figure6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712958507_Figure6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 6"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427027/1427027_10317304_1473712958507_Figure6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 6"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Simulated Response of Price to an Exchange Rate Shock in the 2008/09 Recession</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Heise</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Heise</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 6</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SUMMARY  This project uses transaction-level import data from the U.S. Census to study how relationships between firms affect price flexibility, where a relationship is defined as a buyer-seller pair that has been engaged in trade for some time. Economists have long suspected that long-term relationships might be important for monetary policy, increasing price rigidity due to the use of fixed-price contracts. In fact, I show that prices in older relationships are more responsive to cost shocks than prices in new relationships. Furthermore, the share of older relationships in the economy increases in recessions, making prices more flexible at that time, which might reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy in downturns. My project provides a first large scale empirical analysis of how relationships between firms evolve over time and how they affect the aggregate economy.     MAIN RESULTS  Long-term firm-to-firm relationships account for a substantial share of U.S. imports. In an average quarter, 53% of U.S. imports are transacted via importer-exporter pairs that have been together for longer than 12 months (Figure 1). Moreover, about 18% of trade is due to pairs that have been together for more than four years.  I find that the responsiveness of prices to shocks increases with relationship age. Column (1) in Figure 2 presents the coefficients from a regression of the price change between two transactions of a given relationship trading a specific product on the exchange rate movement over the same time period and on relationship age. I find that in a new relationship, firms change their price by on average 0.15% for every 1% movement in the exchange rate. For every additional month the relationship has lasted, this price response increases by 0.0015%. Thus, a four-year relationship changes price by about 0.23% for a 1% movement in the exchange rate. Columns (2) and (3) show that the finding holds for both positive and negative exchange rate shocks.  To understand why older relationships have more flexible prices, I examine how relationships evolve over time. Figure 3 shows the value traded in each year, relative to the value traded in year one, for relationships lasting a total of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 years. The figure shows that, for example, a relationship lasting in total four years trades about 5% more in the second year than in year one. Relationships follow a life cycle: during the first years of the relationship, annual trade increases each year until a peak is reached. Trade then declines again until the relationship terminates. A similar pattern holds for the number of transactions per year and for the number of products traded per year. My findings are in line with survey evidence from the management literature suggesting that relationships follow a life cycle.  I also study how the price level varies with relationship age. Figure 4 illustrates that the average transaction price declines with relationship age. Relationships that have conducted 41-60 transactions on average trade at a price that is 1.3% lower than the price at transaction one. Management surveys suggest that prices decline with relationship age due to productivity improvements and learning, as well as due to quantity discounts.   Based on 16 interviews I conducted with international firms, I conclude that relationships allow firms to share risk. I therefore develop a theory in which a buyer and a seller firm share profit risk. The firms stochastically accumulate relationship-specific assets, which generates the life cycle. I show that this model matches my empirical findings. In my framework, exchange rate fluctuations affect the seller?s profit margin. By changing price, the seller is able to pass through some of the costs to the buyer, thus sharing profit risk. In a new relationship, risk sharing is incomplete because no specific assets have yet been accumulated and the firms prefer separation to helping each other. However, as the relationship develops it becomes more valuable, which incentivizes the firms to share risk more completely by increasing the responsiveness of prices to shocks. Older relationships on average have more specific assets and therefore more flexible prices.  During the 2008/09 recession, the number of import relationships of age less than one year fell by 20%, while the number of older relationships remained relatively stable (Figure 5). Simulating my model calibrated to match the salient characteristics of relationships, I show that this increase in average relationship length raised the aggregate responsiveness of import prices to shocks by about 20%, from 0.2 to 0.24 (Figure 6). This result provides a new micro foundation for the cyclical variation in aggregate price flexibility. The findings suggest that monetary policy might become less effective in recessions due to the larger share of long-term relationships in the economy. Policymakers seeking to strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy in recessions should therefore attempt to combat the drop in new relationship formation at that time.
