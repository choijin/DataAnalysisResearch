<AbstractNarration>1443124&lt;br/&gt;Harmer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for US Participants at the 2014 Gordon Research Conference in Green Chemistry, July 27-August 1, to be held in Hong Kong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support the registration and/or travel for US participants to exchange new science and technology ideas at the 2014 Green Chemistry Gordon Research Conference (July 27-August 1) and the 2014 Green Chemistry Gordon Research Seminar (July 26-27) to be held in Hong Kong. These meetings will bring together an outstanding and diverse group of scientists who will present their latest research and the most important advances relevant to Industrial Green Chemistry. The students and postdocs will have the opportunity to exchange expertise/ideas among themselves across a broad range of green areas, approaches and methods. This conference addresses many issues that impact the World today from Green Energy, Bioprocessing to new types of Green polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Green Chemistry Gordon Research Conference focuses on the cutting-edge developments required to design chemical products and processes that: have a smaller environmental impact, both in their manufacture and use; are produced in an energy-efficient manner with the least possible intrinsic hazards; and have been designed for inherent safety for human health and the environment. A highly distinguished group of invited speakers will present their unpublished research on designing greener chemicals, greener processes, Green Energy, biopolymers, new organic approaches to pharmaceuticals, life cycle analysis and green chemistry education. The Green Chemistry GRC/GRS are particularly important and timely because the outputs of Green Chemistry research are now driving innovation in both academia and industry and are proving to be key measures of competitiveness in major industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Funding Report   Gordon Research Conference    Green Chemistry: Industrial Successes and Challenges  Hong Kong, July 27th &ndash; August 1st, 2014       Summary  The GRC on Green Chemistry received a grant from the NSF. It was attended by 180 scientists from all over the world. One of the most positive aspects of the conference was that it put in contact number of researchers who, despite working on similar research topics, had not found an appropriate forum for scientific exchanges. There was a unanimous decision to hold the second meeting in HK. From the initial feed-back and debriefing with GRC, the conference on Green Chemistry was well poised to be confirmed to broaden the area of this conference to Hong Kong. There were no proceedings or any printed material issued at the end of the conference and as such no details are to be published ( a rule of eth GRC). As Chair of the conference I would like to express my gratitude to NSF for their support. The support of NSF was acknowledged at the beginning of the conference and its logo is visible on the conference web site.       Objectives of the Conference The meetingÆs goal was to address the current gaps in knowledge and establish an international community of world-leading sciences that will set the agenda for confronting this group in the area of Green Chemistry. To achieve this goal, the Gordon Research Conference on Green chemistry has: &bull; Brought together renowned scientists who investigate the role Green Chemistry can play. &bull; Increased the awareness of world-leading research institutions on the impact and challenges in this field and foster new research and training programs on that topic; &bull; Attracted from all continents an audience of young researchers/trainees in the field, particularly those where these diseases are prevalent. These young trainees have presented posters and, in some cases, short talks, giving them ample time to discuss their work with the experts.   Achievements and Deliverables This conference on Green Chemistry allowed overlap of scientists worldwide in the area.  Details of all the sessions can be found on the website.  All areas of Green Chemistry were addressed.  Another important objective of the conference was to attract from all continents an audience of young researchers/trainees in the field, particularly those where issues of pollution are prevalent. We selected some of these junior scientists for short talks, thus giving them more exposure time and the possibility to discuss in great detail their work, which may trigger new collaborations and other research opportunities. At the end of the conference, participants filled a questionnaire and gave their feed-back on the overall quality of the scientific program, of the talks and of the interactions that had been promoted by the meeting. There was a very positive evaluation praising: The right size and mix of leaders in the field  Excellent choice of topics and discussions  Good opportunity for networking  Outstanding interactions across fields  Gender representation with many women scientists  Meeting concept and the choice of a topic with impact for the environment.  We are confident that this strong support shown by the community will result in the growth of Green Chemistry that will build in the future also Gordon Research Conferences in this area , specially targeted for young investigators. This will be an additional tangible outcome of the support given to this conference.       Last Modified: 08/13/2015       Submitted by: Mark A Harmer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
