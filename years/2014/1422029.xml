<AbstractNarration>Title: SHF: Small: Domain-specific Languages for Computational Thinking about Functional Geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to design, implement, and experiment with a domain-specific programming language for functional geometry with applications to describing the design of string instruments: violins, violas, and especially violoncellos.  The approach is based on the use of computational thinking for historical reconstructions of seventeenth-century geometrical and instrument construction techniques.  The intellectual merits of the proposal are the rigorous design of the domain specific language, descriptive insight and abstraction of the above techniques, an archival representation for describing basic data structures tailored to string instruments, and language constructs for generating drawings. Because instrument making, from conception to construction, is so founded on algorithmic method, computational thinking is a natural rubric for organizing design, and creating a hierarchy of  techniques that give order to the decomposition of the plane into an instrument form, and to the ancillary geometric problems that are solved with ruler-and-compass constructions. This work is integrated with building violoncellos, connecting the historical and conceptual with the practical.  The underlying domain-specific language, as an added and beneficial impact, may also be useful for teaching principles of geometry at a middle- or high-school level. The project's broader significance and importance are in providing a foundation for a descriptive tool for analyzing the evolution of instrument designs over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The domain-specific language is, at its core, a ruler-and-compass programming language for doing geometric constructions. Higher-order procedures in the language, can be used to abstract over canonical geometric constructions at the "assembly language" level of ruler-and-compass steps, providing an abstract, yet fully functional description of how these outlines were historically conceived.  These higher-order procedures may capture not only technical, but conceptual patterns of the design process.  The overall goal is to provide computational thinking in the context of a classic, specialized architectural domain, that of string instruments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We've developed a software tool for designing and studying classical stringed instruments using Renaissance methods of proportional design, known to architects and artisans of that time.  These methods were really based on straightedge and compass constructions that are the mainstay of Euclidean geometry.  We've given seminars on this project at many universities, including Brandeis (where I work), Wellesley College, UC Berkeley, U Maryland, Columbia University; violin making schools in Boston (North Bennet Street School), Milan and in Cremona (Istituto Stradivari); NSF, NEH, the Violin Society of America, and the Oberlin Violinmaking Workshop.   We also ran short courses for professional violin makers at Brandeis and in Cremona.  Publications have appeared in venues such as the ACM International Conference on Functional Programming, The Journal of the Violin Society of America, The Strad, and the Stanford Magazine.  These include both technical and popular articles with broad impact.  We've put up two websites with information on the project:  www.cs.brandeis.edu/~mairson/TDL ("Trait&eacute; de Lutherie")  www.digitalamati.org  Professional violin makers are starting to use the software tool for design.  This includes winners of major violin making competitions.  That means that the work is having a real impact and being taken seriously.  Because of this work, I got to help edit and translate the Museo del Violino publication of a book in honor of the tercentenary of the 1716 Stradivari "Messiah".  Another ancillary but related outcome is an industrial CT scan I organized of the 1700 Stradivari "Stauffer ex-Cristiani" cello at the Museo del Violino in Cremona -- the first instrument they have allowed to be scanned.  I?ve used the software to design a reduced-size version of the "Cristiani" cello that I and other violin makers around the world are now building.  I?ve used the software to draw 3D realizations of the archings of the top and the back.  The next step is to use this information to drive a computer numerically controlled (CNC) router to machine the plates directly.  This research project has been gathering momentum for several years. It should be clear from the above that it has already made a significant impression on the contemporary world of violin making.  Luthiers are using it for their design work. The software can have a lasting impact on the creativity and understanding of violin makers. It could also allow students to appreciate Euclidean geometry from a computational perspective.  The approach could make art historical research be more technical and analytical.  I've used the software to explain the evolution of the Stradivari "Forma B" violoncello from his earlier models; Kevin Kelly, a violin maker in Boston, has used it to trace design ideas from Andrea Amati to later makers such as Stradivari, Nicol&ograve; Amati (his grandson), and Giuseppe Guarneri "del Ges&ugrave;".  The contemporary technical infrastructure that supports modern violin making is right out of the seventeenth century. This project is intended to take the classical ideas of design and embody them in software. Modern luthiers buy totally into the design ideas (Renaissance-based)&mdash;they?ve mainly lackeda good, modern implementation method of them.  Violin makers will be able to change patterns and templates, and print them (on a standard printer, or 3D printer, or CNC router, or. . . ).
