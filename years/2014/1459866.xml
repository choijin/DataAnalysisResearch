<AbstractNarration>Innovation in science, technology, economics, health, and other areas of human activity fundamentally hinges on discovering and leveraging invariances - those aspects of a system that remain stable across different contexts. In this research project, the PIs will identify the invariance properties reflected in individual decision making -- invariances across individuals, across choice contexts, and across choice tasks.  Understanding of invariants of decision making behavior (and their boundaries) has broad implications in industry, national security, consumer financial decision making, health decision making and others, particularly in designing decision support systems, in understanding consumer behavior, and in enhancing citizen protection against financial and cyber-predators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three components: 1) to specify mathematically precise formulations of scientific questions about invariants of decision making, 2) to conduct laboratory studies of such invariants, 3) to develop advanced statistical and computational techniques for the analysis of the obtained data. The team will study a range of customized mathematical models that may open up new avenues to understanding invariance in decision making. Building on a long research tradition in multiple disciplines, the team will study in the laboratory how decision makers trade-off between rewards and risk, rewards and time delays, and examine the principles that guide decision making. The novelty of the research resides in its mathematical tools and in its focus on invariance: across individuals (individual differences), across choice contexts (different choice options), and across choice tasks (say, risky choice vs. inter-temporal choice). An additional novel emphasis of the project is to discover biological markers of invariants in decision making, examined with respect to MRI measures of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and brain function, and by investigating nutrient biomarkers of health and nutrition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the duration of this grant, our research team aimed to rigorously examine the concept of invariance as it relates to individual decision making.  Specifically, what aspects of decision making and choice behavior do not change across: decision environments, tasks, and populations?  The results of this project will inform the development of future decision theory. Further, our results have the potential to shape public policy and education.   Our project was roughly divided along three primary components: 1) to specify mathematically precise formulations of scientific questions about invariants of decision making, 2) to conduct laboratory studies of such invariants, 3) to develop advanced statistical and computational techniques for the analysis of the obtained data.  Our results are as follows:  1)    We successfully developed a quantitative framework for specifying and evaluating questions regarding invariance of choice behavior.  This framework leverages state-of-the-art Bayesian statistical methodology and is implemented in two open-source software packages, both freely available online.  We have developed novel theoretic models of choice that are sensitive to detecting changes in how individuals express their choices, what aspects of a choice they attend to, and the fundamental structure of their latent preferences.   2)    We carried out multiple experiments designed to evaluate decision making invariances.  To briefly highlight this empirical work, we found that older adults tend to violate a fundamental axiom of decision making, transitivity of preference, at a somewhat higher rate than younger adults.  We found that older adults were more likely to use a heuristic-based decision strategy when evaluating risky choices than younger adults. In a separate study, we found support for changes in risk preferences in older adults, specifically increases in risk seeking behavior for the older population under a particular context. In the first experiment of its kind, we found that a majority of adults satisfied the random utility hypothesis, which is a core assumption of many decision making models.  3)    We developed a series of novel statistical methodologies that are critical to evaluating the theoretic models and hypotheses that we considered.  Our team derived a new method for evaluating between-group differences in model classifications.  This new Bayesian methodology generalizes the well-known method known as Fisher?s exact test.  Our team developed novel methods of calculating multiple model comparison statistics, such as the Bayes factor, for a broad class of quantitative models.   In summary, our project was successful in developing a rigorous theoretic and methodological framework for evaluating and detecting invariances in choice behavior across a variety of contexts.  Our experimental work identified aspects of choice that change across the lifespan (and other contexts).  We have produced freely available, open-source software that can be used to test related hypotheses.          Last Modified: 08/30/2019       Submitted by: Clintin P Stober]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
