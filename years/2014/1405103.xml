<AbstractNarration>Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are a recently discovered group of transcripts that have no protein-coding capacity. Although they play diverse and important roles in the biology of complex organisms, almost nothing is known of their origin and evolution. The goal of this project is to use next generation RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) and the vast genomic resources of the fruit fly Drosophila to characterize the forces that underlie lincRNA sequence and expression evolution. Analyses of variation in pure species cannot explain how the regulation of lincRNA expression evolves, but analyses of misexpression in hybrids provides insight into how diverse evolutionary processes shape the regulatory process. Thus, the specific goal of this dissertation improvement grant is to analyze the evolution of lincRNA regulation using RNA-Seq in D. pseudoobscura/D. persimilis hybrids. Specific aims are (1) to identify the mode of inheritance of lincRNA expression, (2) identify whether lincRNA regulatory divergence occurs through cis or trans changes, and (3) identify whether lincRNAs may underlie hybrid incompatibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will be the most comprehensive analysis of lincRNA evolution to date and the first to examine lincRNA regulatory evolution in closely related species via hybrids. It will underscore the importance of an understudied class of genes that deviates from the central dogma of biology. This grant will support the training of both a doctoral student and multiple undergraduates as well as provide a summer research experience for a local high school student or teacher from the University of Maryland's Minority Student Pipeline. The knowledge gleaned from this work will be disseminated widely, both in national presentations and in print. Understanding the evolution of gene regulatory systems provides important insights into the relationship between genotype and phenotype, which ultimately underlies our understanding of disease and the improvement of agricultural crops.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an ubiquitous but poorly understood class of genes in complex organisms that have been implicated in roles in cell biology, development, and disease. Multiple studies have already shown that the primary sequence of lncRNAs tend to evolve quickly, but there are few investigations into evolution of lncRNA expression. To this end, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in two species of fruit fly with a long history of evolutionary research, Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis, and their hybrids to analyze lncRNA expression divergence and hybrid misexpression. We found that expression at lncRNA loci is more likely to be lost between closely related species (even when sequence is conserved) than expression at protein-coding loci. For all tissues surveyed (male carcass, female carcass, ovaries, testes), higher proportions of lncRNAs showed significant expression divergence between D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis than protein-coding genes. lncRNAs in the testes were more likely to show expression divergence than in the carcasses or ovaries. Surprisingly, small proportions of lncRNAs were misexpressed in F1 hybrids, often similiar to proportions observed for protein-coding genes. The highest numbers of misexpressed genes (both lncRNA and protein) were observed in testes, in both reciprocal hybrid crosses. While higher turnover of lncRNAs and increased expression divergence of lncRNAs in closely related species has been reported elsewhere, this is, to our knowledge, the first report showing that in hybrids the proportion of misexpressed lncRNAs is similar to that of protein-coding genes. This suggests that while lncRNA and protein-coding sequence may be subject to differing evolutionary pressures, lncRNA and protein-coding expression may not. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of analyses of hybrid misexpression of lncRNAs, and thus represents major progress in the field of lncRNA biology.
