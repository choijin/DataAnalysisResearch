<AbstractNarration>The project will research how student body movements support their reasoning and understanding about scientific concepts that involve hidden structures or unobservable mechanisms.  Student and scientist descriptions and explanations often involve embodied expressions, such as body movements used to represent or symbolically manipulate components of scientific systems (e.g., turning the hands to an object's rotation, tilting the upper torso to demonstrate some type of imbalance, etc.).  Exploring the embodied foundations of science reasoning is also timely because of recent advances in human-computer interfaces that allow people to interact with computers using expressive, natural movements as opposed to keystrokes and mouse-clicks. The project will initially research what types of body motion that support causal explanations for observable phenomena, which are called Embodied Explanatory Expressions (EEEs).  Building on the research, the project will then explore whether identified EEEs can be integrated into the control structures of online simulations utilizing newly available motion sensing input devices (e.g., Microsoft Kinect, Leap Motion).  The research findings will enrich our basic understanding of science learning and have practical implications in curriculum design and in the development of new learning technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will research student gestures and body motion during explanation of such scientific concepts by recording and analyzed these gestures and motion not only to identify the embodiment of such knowledge, but also to design interventions and simulations based on such motions that could facilitate learning. Using interviews, available motion sensing input devices, and other methods, the project will validate the approach, investigate how students reason using body movements, and how their expressions change with interventions.  This project will identify core EEEs for supporting scientific reasoning in three critical areas of science involving unobservable mechanisms: Molecular Interactions, Heat Transfer, and Earth Systems. The project will focus specifically on the types of embodied interactions that support students' construction of explanations, and explore whether these body movements can be integrated into the design of a new generation of online learning simulations that elevates the level of science reasoning exhibited by students who use them.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objective of this project was to investigate the relationship between middle school students' hand gestures and their ability to construct explanations of observable science phenomena such as molecular interactions and the causes of seasons. Specifically, the project team conducted several hundred interviews to examine a) the kinds of gestures that students generate naturally when giving scientific explanations for events they observe (e.g., the transfer of heat from the bowl to the handle of a metal spoon), and b) the effects of using gesture-augmented simulations on the trajectory of students' understanding and articulation of science ideas. For the second objective, the project team built several new simulations using a hand-tracking device to create a platform called GRASP (GestuRe Augmented Simulations for supporting exPlanations). The GRASP simulations allowed students to embody the causal mechanisms of a given phenomenon (e.g., the "bumping" of molecules that leads to thermal conduction or the angle at which light hits the surface of the Earth leading to different temperatures at different times of the year). Students were guided to use GRASP simulations to enact their ideas with their hands, and to connect these physical representations with verbal explanations.</p> <p>The GRASP project's early findings were demonstrations that explicitly requesting students to make gestures and having them reflect on those gestures often led to improvements in understanding and productive discourse about their ideas. Some of our papers describe how simply asking students to ?show me? when trying to express their ideas led to gesturing that in turn led to more sophisticated explanations. Results also showed that after gesturing students explanations tended to shift away from basic descriptions of the phenomena to explanations with more causal elements. Perhaps most valuable in these early studies were ideas for how to represent science phenomena with one's hands that were extracted directly from student interviews. For example, one student represented changes in pressure of gas molecules by varying the frequency with which she tapped the fingers of one hand on the palm of her other hand; this became the basis of the control mechanisms implemented for the GRASP gas laws simulation.</p> <p>The first iterations of the gesture-augmented simulations were built by Year 2 of the project, at which point we began conducting interviews with students in which they first tried to give an explanation independently (e.g., "Why is it warmer in the summers and colder in the winters?") before interacting with the simulation for approximately 15-20 minutes followed by a second attempt at giving an explanation. These studies showed both a general effect of using the simulations that benefitted subsequent explanations as well as highlighting the specific features of the simulations that scaffolded the students' understanding. For example, with the causes of seasons topic, many students started off knowing that the tilt of the Earth played a role, but were frequently unable to connect the tilt with the density of light rays that hit the ground in a specific location on Earth. The seasons simulation facilitated this connection by showing the change in the Earth's position relative to the Sun as students altered their angle at which light rays were hitting the ground as represented with their hands. Studies with the GRASP simulations produced additional insights about the progression of students' attention and understanding while using dynamic visualizations and the effects of simulation-prompted gestures on future explanations and gesturing. In later years of the project we conducted studies where the GRASP simulation was used by pairs of students as well as in authentic classroom contexts. Results showed that students were generally successful using these simulations collaboratively, and reflecting on the gestures of others as successfully as their own.</p> <p>The intellectual merit of the GRASP project is an extended and applied understanding of how gestures instigate productive scientific reasoning. The findings build on other recent work on embodied cognition and embodied learning to suggest that successful learning interventions can leverage simple, and sometimes instinctual, body movements. As described in a 2019 paper published by the GRASP team in <em>Science Education</em>, gesture can serve as an "epistemic tool" to aid scientific reasoning, and it is argued that more attention should be given to gesture and other kinds of physical movement when designing STEM education interventions. The broader impacts of the project include a set of design principles for creating gesture-augmented simulations and implementing those simulations in authentic learning contexts. The GRASP simulations only covered three specific STEM topics, but using gesture to bridge gaps in understanding and promote effective explanations could be achieved in many more content areas. This project also demonstrated the potential for integrating gesture-based learning activities into existing curriculum and formal educational environments. The GRASP simulations and associated resources are all freely available via the Concord Consortium's web repository.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/26/2019<br>      Modified by: Robb&nbsp;W&nbsp;Lindgren</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391205440_GRASPFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391205440_GRASPFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GRASP Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391205440_GRASPFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GRASP Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The GRASP gas pressure simulation</div> <div class="imageCredit">The GRASP Project</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robb&nbsp;W&nbsp;Lindgren</div> <div class="imageTitle">GRASP Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391254426_GRASPFigure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391254426_GRASPFigure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GRASP Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391254426_GRASPFigure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GRASP Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The GRASP seasons simulation</div> <div class="imageCredit">The GRASP Project</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robb&nbsp;W&nbsp;Lindgren</div> <div class="imageTitle">GRASP Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391318690_GRASPFigure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391318690_GRASPFigure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GRASP Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391318690_GRASPFigure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GRASP Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Two students working with a researcher to use the GRASP gas pressure simulation</div> <div class="imageCredit">The GRASP Project</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robb&nbsp;W&nbsp;Lindgren</div> <div class="imageTitle">GRASP Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391388105_GRASPFigure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391388105_GRASPFigure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GRASP Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391388105_GRASPFigure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GRASP Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Two students using the GRASP heat transfer simulation</div> <div class="imageCredit">The GRASP Project</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robb&nbsp;W&nbsp;Lindgren</div> <div class="imageTitle">GRASP Figure 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391464773_GRASPFigure5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391464773_GRASPFigure5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GRASP Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432424/1432424_10325219_1577391464773_GRASPFigure5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GRASP Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Split screen of a GRASP interview showing student gesturing and the simulation screen</div> <div class="imageCredit">The GRASP Project</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robb&nbsp;W&nbsp;Lindgren</div> <div class="imageTitle">GRASP Figure 5</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
