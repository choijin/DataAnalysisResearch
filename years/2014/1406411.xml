<AbstractNarration>This research is in the area of Probability and Statistical Physics. Statistical physicists and probabilists often try to understand the macroscopic behavior of systems consisting of many microscopic random inputs, which can give rise to interfaces between two phases at a critical temperature, such as water and ice at zero degree Celsius. This can be modeled via the scaling limit behavior (macroscopic behavior) of discrete lattice models (microscopic inputs) in critical cases. Oded Schramm's SLE (Stochastic Loewner Evolution) processes have led mathematicians and physicists to a clean and novel understanding of the scaling limits of the interfaces in discrete models in two dimensions. And CLE (Conformal Loop Ensemble) is the generalization of SLE which is predicted to be the scaling limit of the collection of all interfaces in discrete models. This research focuses on CLE and its relation between Gaussian Free Field, Liouville Quantum Gravity, and Random Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precisely, the research considers the following two problems.&lt;br/&gt;(1) The conformally invariant metric on CLE. Since the introduction of SLE and CLE, CLE(4) has been proved to be the scaling limit of the collection of level lines of discrete Gaussian Free Field. In the previous work of the principal investigator, a time parameter is constructed for CLE(4) loop configurations, and a coupling between Gaussian Free Field and CLE(4) with time parameter is given. The research aims to show that the time parameter defined on CLE(4) is in fact a deterministic function of the loop configuration. This result would deepen understanding of the relation between Gaussian Free Field and CLE.&lt;br/&gt;(2) CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity. Liouville Quantum Gravity is conjectured to be the scaling limit of random maps. The research project first aims to understand CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity and then to explore the relation between CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity and loop-decorated random maps.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PI's Hao Wu (originally) and Scott Sheffield (subsequently) studied several aspects of a "random generalized function" called the Gaussian free field and random collections of loops called "conformal loop ensembles."  These are random fractals that have deep relationships to many areas of physics and mathematics.  The work by Wu includes several research articles in this area, including:    [1] Conformal restriction and Brownian motion (available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1898)  This is a survey article covering a fractal symmetry called "conformal restriction" and fine properties of Brownian motion (the so called Brownian intersection exponents).  It also includes original results by Wu on radial conformal restriction.  [2] Simple CLE in doubly connected domains (with Sheffield and Watson, available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6132)  This article studies CLE in the annulus, in the punctured disc and in the punctured plane. This is closely related to the study of level lines of the GFF in annulus.  [3] Level lines of GFF I: zero-boundary GFF (with Menglu Wang, available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3839)  This article explains the behavior and properties of boundary emanating level lines of the GFF and also gives the relation between the zero-boundary GFF and CLE4.   [4] Level lines of GFF II: whole-plane GFF (with Menglu Wang, available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04606)  This article explains the behavior and properties of interior emanating level lines GFF and also studies the continuum exploration process of whole-plane GFF.    Sheffield, who was one of the collaborators with Wu, took over as PI part way through the project. The grant helped to support advancing graduate students, including Menglu Wang and Samuel Watson (the collaborators listed above), as well as Ewain Gwynne and Joshua Pfeffer, and a further research program by the second PI and co-authors in this area.
