<AbstractNarration>A scientist from the University of Washington will participate in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic Ocean cruise and measure the vertical distribution of the stable isotopes of carbon found in dissolved inorganic carbon (del13C), a tracer of biogeochemical cycling.  In addition, he will determine the spatial variation in the ratio of oxygen gas to argon gas (O2/Ar) in surface water samples because this ratio can be used as a proxy for organic matter export.  In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. Results from this study will further our understanding of the processes that control observed trace elements, nutrients, and the stable carbon isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon in the present day ocean and use this information to gain information on past changes in ocean circulation on carbon cycling.  This project will also provide training opportunities for undergraduate students, and results will be integrated into public outreach activities and material for class lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of the impact of physical and biological processes on the distribution of nutrient and trace elements in the modern ocean is critical to our interpretation of future changes in their distributions in the Arctic and their utility as proxies of circulation and biological pump conditions in the historic ocean. One key parameter needed to understand these processes is del13C of dissolved inorganic carbon, for which little to no data currently exists in the Arctic Ocean. This study will aim to measure the depth distribution of the del13C of dissolved inorganic carbon and the dissolved O2/Ar ratio in the surface layer of the ocean. These measurements will help to quantify the contributions of chemical processes and the biological pump on the spatial distribution of nutrients, trace elements, and del13C, as well as estimate organic matter export rates from the surface ocean.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this research project was the measure the isotopic composition of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Arctic Ocean. The isotopic composition refers to the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 (i.e. 13C/12C). The importance of the 13C/12C is two-fold. First, the 13C/12C composition of CO2 in the ocean changes as the ocean adsorbs CO2 emitted from a specific source, in this case, the burning of fossil fuels. Second, by measuring the 13C/12C of carbonate shells originally produced by phytoplankton in the surface ocean and currently buried in sediments, one can attempt to reconstruct the concentrations of CO2 in the ocean back through time.</p> <p>We collected ~500 samples of seawater from the Arctic Ocean during an oceanographic research cruise during fall of 2015 (Figure 1).

This means that the levels of CO2 in the Arctic Ocean have increased significantly during the last ~150 years (i.e., the industrial era). This is an important observation because it verifies earlier claims that the Arctic Ocean is becoming more acidic, which is referred to as Ocean Acidification, as a result of accumulation of CO2 produced by fossil fuel burning.</p> <p>We made another important observation about the change in the 13C/12C of CO2 in the seawater of the Arctic Ocean. We determined that the change was the result primarily of CO2 that was carried into the Arctic Ocean by ocean currents entering from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This is important because it means that the acidification of the Arctic Ocean is driven mainly by ocean circulation rather than by the uptake of CO2 within the Arctic Ocean basin itself. Furthermore, we determined that chemical compounds necessary for photosynthesis by phytoplankton, like nitrate and phosphate, were added primarily by ocean currents just like for CO2. This is important because it means that the rate of photosynthesis in the Arctic Ocean is, in part, tied to the supply of nutrients from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This observation also suggests that changes in photosynthesis rates in the Arctic Ocean during the past, as recorded by the 13C/12C of carbonate shells in ocean sediments, are partially the results of changes in the supply of nutrients via ocean currents.</p> <p>From a broader impact perspective, the 13C/12C measurements on CO2 that we made during the 2015 cruise provide an important benchmark for future cruises.

By comparing the 13C/12C of CO2 measured on future cruises to the Arctic Ocean to the measurements we made in 2015 we will be able to calculate the rate at which CO2 produced by fossil fuel burning has been accumulating in the seawater and, as a result, the increase rate in ocean acidification. Determining the rate of ocean acidification in the Arctic Ocean will be an important factor impacting the future populations of many shellfish (specifically crabs and clams) which are important commercial fisheries in this region.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/03/2019<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;D&nbsp;Quay</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433349/1433349_10321768_1546556613010_CruiseTrack--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433349/1433349_10321768_1546556613010_CruiseTrack--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cruise Track"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433349/1433349_10321768_1546556613010_CruiseTrack--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cruise Track"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
