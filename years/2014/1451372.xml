<AbstractNarration>Organic molecules dissolved in aquatic ecosystems represent the largest pool of organic matter transported through river networks and one of the most complex mixtures on Earth. The processing of these organic molecules by microorganisms resulting in their conversion to CO2 contributes to the large exchange of CO2 between the aquatic environment and the atmosphere with implications for global climate change. Despite the importance of this phenomenon, as much as 80% of the organic carbon susceptible to microbial metabolism remains unidentified.  The goals of this study are to use recent advances in low through-put, ultra-high resolution analytical organic chemistry to identify and characterize the pool of biologically reactive molecules and to extend the ability of commonly used high through-put, low-resolution optical techniques to provide information about the temporal dynamics of these molecules in river networks. The outcomes of this research could advance the understanding of the link between the composition of organic molecules in a river network and the evasion of CO2 to the atmosphere, answering the question of what makes an organic molecule biodegradable.  The researchers will work with educators who teach K-12 students in making processes that are invisible to the naked eye accessible and compelling as the educators develop curricula that depict the influence of molecular geochemistry and microbial geobiology to life on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers hypothesize that: (1) biologically reactive but molecularly uncharacterized humic molecules account for the majority of dissolved organic matter that bacteria respire to CO2; (2) the constituents of colored or fluorescent dissolved organic matter can be associated with groups of individual molecular formulas through the use of advanced statistical analyses, including Spearman Rank and 2-D correlation analyses; and (3) dissolved organic matter molecules that are ubiquitous across distant watersheds span the biological reactivity spectrum, while molecules unique to a watershed are predominantly reactive and readily converted to CO2. The research will be performed in streams within 2 well characterized river basins, one in the temperate forests of Pennsylvania and one in the tropical evergreen forests of Costa Rica.  Water samples will be collected under baseflow and storm flow conditions, across stream orders and seasons, and separated into biological reactivity classes using stream water-fed plug flow bioreactors. The samples will be molecularly characterized using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry as well as UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence spectra with excitation emission matrices. The successful completion of the research should advance the ability to use optical sensors to understand carbon flow through river networks and advance the understanding of the molecular nature of the dissolved organic matter that fuels the evasion of CO2 from streams and rivers to the atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific Merit.  This project produced information on how the element carbon (C) changes from organic to inorganic form as it moves from land through surface waters (lakes and streams) to the atmosphere.  Through the process of respiration, organic carbon flushed from soils to surface waters is converted to carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas emitted to the atmosphere where it warms our planet. Knowing the controls on respiration of organic carbon in surface waters allows us to predict how greenhouse gas emissions from inland waters may shift in response to climate or land-use change.   We discovered and characterized key interactions between sunlight and aquatic microorganisms that can control respiration of organic carbon to carbon dioxide in surface waters.  We showed that the sun needs to shine on stream water for as little as 30 minutes to substantially impact how microbes respire the organic carbon to carbon dioxide.  Although we have known that sunlight changes how microbes respire organic carbon in unshaded streams and rivers of the tundra, it was thought that forested streams in temperate regions receive too little sunlight for it to impact respiration.  Our results demonstrate that as organic carbon flows downstream to wider and less shaded stream channels, sunlight will increasingly control how it is respired to carbon dioxide by microbes.  Discovery of how little sunlight is needed to influence respiration of organic carbon suggests that any change in the concentration of light-absorbing organic carbon or in the amount of sunlight reaching surface waters will alter greenhouse gas emissions.  Broader impacts.  This project produced two scientific publications, and helped train a young scientist working on a PhD Dissertation and who is continuing to study how surface waters contribute to the global carbon cycle.  Curricula for undergraduate environmental science courses were developed and taught using data and new knowledge from this project.
