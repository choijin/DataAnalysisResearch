<AbstractNarration>This research concerns improved methods for the modeling of material systems.  Many materials modeling problems rely heavily on quantum mechanical models. However, for quantum mechanics to be really useful, one has to couple it with either continuum models or molecular mechanics models. The success of such an approach has been well documented in chemistry applications.  This project explores approaches based on quantum mechanics (density functional theory) coupled with molecular mechanics or continuum mechanics in modeling materials.  Although the coupled quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approach has enjoyed a considerable amount of success, winning the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry, its application to general material systems, particularly metallic systems, has been at issue for a long time. The problem comes from the non-local effect of the errors made at the interface between the molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics regions. This problem is particularly severe for metallic systems. This project tackles these important challenges in the modeling of material systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many technical hurdles that one needs to overcome. First of all, one needs to improve the efficiency of density functional theory (DFT) algorithms to be able to handle inhomogeneous systems, such as systems with point defects or a small portion of extended defects. The next hurdle is to derive classical models, based on either molecular mechanics or continuum theory, that are consistent with DFT. This means that the DFT models reduce to classical models in some limit. A third problem is to design coupling schemes that move smoothly from DFT to classical models. The current project will focus on the second and third problems, beginning with one-dimensional model problems. The investigation's starting point is the Fermi operator formulation of DFT. By making successive approximations on the Fermi operator formalism, the PI aim to arrive at a consistent DFT/molecular mechanics or DFT/continuum model coupling scheme.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is only the first stage of the long term  project for developing  coupled continuum-quantum mechanics models.  So far, we used the fast DFT (density functional theory) algorithms to create a massive amout of data from quantum mechanics models and use this data to create a much more accurate classical inter-atomic potential using the methods of machine learning.   Previous models used in molecuar dynamics have all been developed using rather crude ad hoc models with rather few parameters.  Their accuracy is quite insufficient, particularly for dynamical properties. The new models developed using our strategy will not only be more accurate, they are also needed  when we develop coupled continuum and density functional theory models.   Currently we have collected the data using DFT.  But we are still struggling to develop the inter-atomic potential using machine learning.  The difficulty lies in the strong nonlinearity and the induced complexity in the model. We have experimented various different methods.  We have had some very encouraging successes but we are not yet ready to write a paper. Of particular interest is a new kind of deep learning models that are particularly suited for this task.     Upon finishing this part of the project, we will be in a position to develop the coupled method.  The inter-atomic potential will be used in the intermediate regime between the continuum models and the DFT models.
