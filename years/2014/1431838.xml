<AbstractNarration>Recent weather extremes, e.g., Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, have shown the consequences of the combination of a deteriorating infrastructure and a citizenry that is unprepared to deal with natural disasters of this scale. Undergraduate students in geotechnical engineering need realistic experience that enables them to understand and process the risks inherent in flood-protection design. Because games enable people to experience the unfamiliar in a virtual world and to experiment and fail in multiple ways without the consequences that occur in the real world, they are an excellent vehicle for learning about design in a high-risk environment. The research team will develop and implement a transferable and scalable Mixed Reality and Mobile (MR&amp;M) Educational Game, "Geo Explorer," that can be integrated with traditional geotechnical engineering education. It will be tested and implemented in existing geotechnical engineering courses at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Southern Methodist University, Manhattan College and California State University, Fullerton. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will 1) develop a new MR&amp;M game focused on flood-protection design and field testing that includes real-time game-embedded tools to monitor student progress toward learning geotechnical engineering subjects; 2) develop and implement a course module, which integrates the MR&amp;M gaming environment into geotechnical course curricula and will include actual lab testing, virtual field testing, theoretical system design and virtual practical experience; 3) develop and implement a hybrid (face-to-face and online) dissemination model for expanding the use of the gaming environment to geotechnical engineering educators; and 4) evaluate the project effectiveness at accomplishing the first three goals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Educators are tasked with preparing undergraduate students to become professionals who are knowledgeable in dealing with the challenges of today?s society, such as infrastructure resilience and sustainability. To educate a professional workforce who is properly trained in STEM, able to identify warning signs of system failures, and capable of making the right decisions, undergraduate engineering education must be transformed to include practical experience. Educational games have this transformative potential, while also utilizing a technology that is familiar to today?s students. Games enable people to experience the unfamiliar in a virtual world and have the power to engage its users. In our work, we investigated the transformative potential of gaming in <em>undergraduate geotechnical engineering education</em>, which lacks opportunities for students to experience field work and testing.</p> <p>We developed a mixed reality game called ?GeoExplorer?, which integrates traditional engineering education with game-based learning. In this game, students join the geotechnical engineering company Terra Inc. for an internship through a fictional website, conduct several field tests in a 3D virtual environment to retrieve data, analyze this data using standard engineering software, and then submit their findings to their manager. Over a period of four years, we gradually implemented the three different versions of GeoExplorer at four different universities (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Southern Methodist University, Manhattan College, and California State University Fullerton), reaching a total of approximately 500 students. Our results show that students were satisfied with the experience, valued the practical experience (?the game shows what happens in real life?), and found it effective in teaching the content. It also helped to increase the relevance of geotechnical engineering and an interest in pursuing a career in civil engineering. Furthermore, we found that students significantly improved in their engineering knowledge and gained confidence in conducting fieldwork. Some called the experience ?perfect just the way it is? and others wanted more of it: ?Make there be more issues, more things we would experience on the field.? While our work demonstrates the potential of games, we concur with the latter group of students that more can be done, and our research team aims to continue to investigate the use of gaming in engineering education.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/20/2019<br>      Modified by: Casper&nbsp;Harteveld</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431838/1431838_10332988_1574273098849_MainMenu--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431838/1431838_10332988_1574273098849_MainMenu--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Main Menu GeoExplorer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431838/1431838_10332988_1574273098849_MainMenu--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Main Menu GeoExplorer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is the main menu of GeoExplorer.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Northeastern University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Casper&nbsp;Harteveld</div> <div class="imageTitle">Main Menu GeoExplorer</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431838/1431838_10332988_1574271741506_Website--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431838/1431838_10332988_1574271741506_Website--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Terra Inc.
