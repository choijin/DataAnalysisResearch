<AbstractNarration>Belowground nitrogen (N2)-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) are of high ecological and economic importance, yet their role in aboveground food webs is virtually unexplored. To functionally disentangle the complex ecological effects of rhizobia, this project will use multiple rhizobial strains in combination with different host plants, wild lima bean (Fabaceae: Phaseolus lunatus) and wild pea (Fabaceae: Leptospron adenanthum). In the laboratory, these plant-rhizobia systems will be experimentally exposed to varying CO2 and nitrogen availabilities. Both plant species show fundamentally different chemical defenses against herbivores. While P. lunatus has an efficient nitrogen-based defense (via cyanogenesis), L. adenanthum invests in carbon-based defense (via phenolics). In addition to these direct defenses, both plants show an array of indirect defenses (extrafloral nectar and herbivore-induced volatiles) which act through the attraction of carnivorous arthropods. The project will provide an integrated picture of the effects of rhizobia on plant traits, plant-associated organisms of different trophic levels and the impact of variable abiotic conditions on these associations. As plant-microbe-arthropod interactions are relevant for multiple disciplines including chemical ecology, evolutionary biology, global change biology, conservation biology, agriculture and soil sciences, this research will have broad impact. In particular, in times of rapidly changing environments, the value in better understanding the mechanisms controlling natural and agricultural ecosystems cannot be overestimated. As part of this project, one graduate student and several undergraduates will be trained and opportunities for school teachers and K-12 students to participate in the research will be provided in weekly lessons and a three-week summer field course.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will assess bottom-up effects of rhizobia on generalist and specialist insect herbivores of different feeding guilds, as well as on parasitoid and predatory arthropods. Furthermore, different levels of rhizobial N2-fixation will be considered as rhizobia differ in quality as plant mutualists. While mutualistic rhizobia strains reciprocate, cheating rhizobia reside in root nodules and function as carbon sinks, but provide no nitrogen, and thus reduce the net fitness benefit for the pant host. Beyond lab studies, costs and benefits of the rhizobial symbiosis will be explored in a natural habitat of both plant species (Costa Rica). Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: 1. What are the independent and interacting effects of rhizobial strain, soil nitrogen and ambient carbon dioxide (CO2) on plant traits? 2. How do rhizobia-mediated plant traits affect insect herbivores and carnivores? 3. What are the ecological benefits and defense-associated costs of the rhizobial symbiosis in a mutualist-cheater continuum in nature? Spectrophotometric assays, GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry), will be used to analyze plant defensive and nutritive compounds. Plant resource allocation to rhizobia and effects of different nitrogen fixation rates will be quantified using isotope labeling techniques (15N) and N2 depletion studies with Argon chambers (setups in which atmospheric N2 is replaced with Argon). Effects of rhizobia-mediated plant traits on insect herbivores and carnivores will be studied with feeding and olfactometer choice trials. Accompanying field studies will serve to evaluate the effects of rhizobial strain and N2-fixation rate on multiple plant defense traits in nature and to test for the predicted bottom-up effects of rhizobia on arthropod herbivores and carnivores in the natural ecosystem.</AbstractNarration>

While the effects of microbial nitrogen-fixation on agricultural productivity?as well as on the diversity of natural ecosystems?have been studied in great detail, little is known about the effects of rhizobia on plant chemistry, their ecological costs, and their role in multitrophic networks (i.e. communities of organisms using different food sources).</p> <p>This project provided new findings on the effects of rhizobia on plant consumers, predators, and parasitoids in nature, but also on the susceptibility of the plant-microbe symbiosis to abiotic stress factors. Specifically, we showed that extensive rhizobia colonization of wild lima bean plants in Costa Rica enhanced the chemical defense (cyanogenesis ? the release of toxic hydrogen cyanide) of their host plants when under attack by plant-eating beetles. At the same time, however, rhizobia colonization resulted in reduced numbers of predatory ants patrolling the plant surface and parasitoid wasps attracted to the plants. Ants are attracted to the plant through the secretion of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">e</span>xtra<span style="text-decoration: underline;">f</span>loral <span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>ectar (EFN; nectar not associated with pollination and typically secreted from plant parts other than flowers) and function as an indirect defense by killing or chasing off plant-eating insects. Parasitoid wasps use VOC (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">v</span>olatile <span style="text-decoration: underline;">o</span>rganic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">c</span>ompound) cues emitted by injured plants to locate plant-eating insects that they use as a food source for their larvae. Both EFN and VOCs are produced at lower quantities when the host plants show a strong presence of the rhizobial nodules on their roots. Thus, rhizobia have variable effects on host defenses with different consequences for plant-associated insects.</p> <p>Furthermore, new functional interactions between the host plant chemical phenotype and rhizobial colonization were discovered, and we identified costs associated to the maintenance of the rhizobial partner under resource-limited conditions. The provision of microbially-fixed nitrogen can benefit the expression of defenses like cyanogenesis, but the carbon costs of rhizobia may decrease the plants? ability to invest into carbon-based defenses such as EFN or VOCs?these bacteria consume up to 30% of carbon acquired through photosynthesis. In combined field and laboratory experiments, we discovered that different genotypes of lima bean utilize different investment strategies with high cyanogenic genotypes heavily investing in rhizobial partners, whereas lower cyanogenic genotypes?which are mostly defended through EFN and VOCs?invest little in microbial symbionts to keep carbon costs low. A further outcome of this project was the finding of reduced performance of rhizobia-colonized plants under light-limited conditions, underscoring the costs of rhizobia in an ecological context. Under light limitation, vegetative and reproductive traits were inhibited in rhizobia-inoculated lima bean plants relative to controls (uncolonized plants). Under these conditions rhizobia were turning into ?parasites? exploiting limited plant resources.</p> <p>Our results show that rhizobia are strong and widely underestimated moderators of complex plant traits with cascading effects on other organisms of different trophic levels. At the same time, this symbiosis is sensitive and prone to effects resulting from global climate change and local anthropogenic activities such as increasing soil salinization. Salt stress is known to negatively affect plant performance; however, its effects on the association with key microbial plant symbionts, such as nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, are less understood. Our field studies with wild lima bean suggest that the plant-microbe symbiosis is more salt-sensitive than the plant host itself and will break down even in low to moderately saline soils. Given the newly discovered complex role of rhizobia in ecological interactions, we expect far-reaching negative effects of symbiosis breakdown in agricultural and natural ecosystems. These findings suggests that the salt tolerance of such interactions is an important factor which needs to be considered for the development of sustainable agriculture approaches.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/25/2019<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ballhorn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1457369/1457369_10350690_1561439749791_Crematogasterant--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1457369/1457369_10350690_1561439749791_Crematogasterant--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Crematogaster ant"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1457369/1457369_10350690_1561439749791_Crematogasterant--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Crematogaster ant"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In Costa Rica lima bean plants attract a range of different ant species by secreting sweet extrafloral nectar.
