<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating thermal computational modeling of industrial scale process systems to commercial application in order to enable a predictive understanding of thin film properties and processes used in thin film and photovoltaic (PV) industries. This computational simulation approach is important because thin film deposition is the backbone for many industries including thin film PV, semiconductor, flat panel display, LED laser manufacturing and others. The project will result in a proof of concept of computational modeling to advance thin film manufacturing. These computational simulation methods will include thermal aspects as well as generation, transport and deposition of vapor species. This will bring accurate computational simulation engineering to the thin film industry and lead to significant economic benefits. By including thermal, vapor and film growth into one model, this approach is a significant advancement over the less sophisticated approaches currently in use.&lt;br/&gt;  The project engages the members of Colorado State University's Industry / University Corporative Research Center (I/UCRC) Next Generation Photovoltaics Center (NGPV). This is an NSF supported industry driven consortium. In addition, Direct Solar (DOE-STTR Grantee) will aid in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.&lt;br/&gt;  This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application; these include developing methods for the prediction of the film thickness, film uniformity and microstructure. These will then be verified experimentally. The deposition of thin film CdTe photovoltaics (PV) and other films will be studied. The physics of thin film formation of these materials will be understood. The foundation of this research is the thermal modeling of many industrial scale systems that have been completed by our group. The exact geometries of the industrial hardware are modeled and the resultant temperature distribution predicted by the computations is within +/- 2% of the experimental measurements.  The potential economic impact is expected to be in a $750 million market in the next 2-5 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the critical simulation, thin film and PV industries.</AbstractNarration>
