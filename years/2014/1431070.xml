<AbstractNarration>The conference "Geometry of Groups and Spaces" is a satellite conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians which will be held in Daejeon, Republic of Korea, from August 7-12, 2014. The conference aims to combine and develop ideas from algebra, geometry, and topology in new and interesting ways, and to search for new applications of these ideas. The connections between geometry and algebra through the study of symmetry groups of spaces are deep and venerable, going back to the seminal work of Felix Klein and Henri Poincare in the nineteenth century. The field remains active and relevant today, with dramatic advances, new techniques and broad connections to many fields of mathematics.  This conference will bring together mathematicians in all career stages, with a primary goal of enabling young mathematicians to interact and collaborate with, and to learn from, senior researchers. Notes and recordings of lectures delivered will be made publicly available whenever possible.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is concerned with recent developments in the eponymous fields, especially within hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifold topology and geometry, Teichmueller and moduli space theory, and geometric group theory. All of these fields are intimately connected with each other and have experienced dramatic advances in recent years. Specific highlights to be discussed will include the geometry of symmetric spaces, the virtual Haken conjecture, projective structures, mapping class groups and automorphism groups of free groups, Artin groups, and hyperbolic groups. The website for the conference can be found at http://icm.cayley.kr.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In August of 2014, the International Mathematical Union held the International Congress of Mathematicians, the largest regularly occurring international gathering of mathematicians. Many exceptional mathematicians from all over the world gathered in Seoul, Korea, for this event.   In order to take advantage of the energetic atmosphere created by the Congress, we organized a more specialized satellite conference in nearby Daejeon, Korea. The focus of this conference, and the title of this grant, was "Geometry on Groups and Spaces". Recent major research programs concerning geometry of groups and spaces have included two satellite programs of the 2010  International Congress of Mathematicians (one in Singapore and one in Goa, India), two  Park City (Utah) Mathematics Institute programs (moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces in 2011, and geometric group theory in 2012), and there are others. Such successful programs bring together experts with various areas of specialization together for somewhere between one and several weeks, and allow researchers with complementary knowledge to collaborate in a nurturing environment and to competently tackle the problems at hand. The great advantage of a meeting in a particular geographic location is that the greatest impediment to communication of the world experts, i.e. distance, is removed. We brought together many of the world's experts on Teichmuller theory, geometric group theory, outer space theory, hyperbolic geometry, and character varieties. We also brought together younger mathematicians, both graduate students and young researchers, so that they could interact with each other and with senior researchers, thus broadening their knowledge and building working relationships.       All the specialized areas mentioned above are active fields of research.  Many groundbreaking results in these areas have been announced recently, which has resulted in a flurry of interest in new questions and problems related to these results, and our conference provided a venue for exploring these questions and problems. The 22 plenary talks and 38 additional talks spanned the gamut of the subject and were well and enthusiastically attended.   We were able to bring together a diverse group of attendees from various backgrounds, including many young female and minority mathematicians from American universities. By bringing together senior and junior mathematicians, we helped to foster long-lasting and productive working relationships, as well as helped to facilitate effective knowledge and skill transfer. When possible, we recorded the lectures and posted them online, thus helping to develop a communal repository of knowledge, in addition to informing mathematicians who are unable to come to Korea of the goings-on at the conference.
