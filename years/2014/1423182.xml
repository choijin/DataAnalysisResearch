<AbstractNarration>The design and analysis of network algorithmics, namely, techniques and principles behind the software and hardware systems running on high-speed Internet routers, has become a rich area of research. In general, network operators would like routers to deliver robust performance under a wide variety of, often unforeseen, operating conditions.  To address this need, this project takes a first look into network algorithmics solutions that can guarantee a certain level of performance, not only under typical or average parameter settings as in prior studies, but also under all admissible parameter settings. Toward this goal, PIs propose to develop a novel mathematical approach, called worst-case large deviation theory that is needed to prove such universal lower bounds on performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of three closely connected research threads.   First, the principal investigators (PIs) will develop solutions for distributed data streaming problems that can guarantee a certain level of performance, under all possible ways a given data set is partitioned into distributed subsets.  Second, they will develop a rich family of load-balanced switching solutions that can guarantee high throughput and reasonably low delay under all admissible traffic workloads.  Third, they will build mathematical connections between worst-case large deviation techniques they developed in the past several years for deriving such universal performance bounds in prior network algorithmics solutions, which they expect will shed light on the new mathematical problems they will encounter in the first two research threads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage both graduate and undergraduate students through integrated classroom curriculum and research training that span multiple disciplines, from fundamental mathematics, algorithm design, to hardware implementation.  The results will be broadly disseminated through publications, invited talks, tutorials, and open-sourcing of software developed for this project in accordance with the policies of each institution.  The PIs will work closely with leading networking and systems solution providers to facilitate technology transfers.  Further, both PIs are committed to outreach efforts at their corresponding campuses to broaden the participation of under-represented groups in research and higher education.</AbstractNarration>

In all three schemes, new mathematical discoveries have been made in proving such guarantees.  In the first LBS scheme, called Sprinklers, the team have invented a new and powerful WCLD proof technique that combines standard large-deviation with negative associations among random variables in a very subtle way.

To this end, the team have designed a simple yet powerful randomized algorithm that can provably maintain such a near-perfect load-balance over time, and to prove this guarantee, formulated and proved a new WCLD theorem.  Research along this task has also led to several works by the team on data centers concerning their switching operations, troubleshooting, and storage systems. Related to the second task of WCLD in DDSP, the team have studied the important and challenging problem of how to measure a certain type of data inconsistency, known as functional dependence violation, in a distributed database in a communication-efficient manner.

This exploration has been a great success since the team have indeed discovered a deep connection among the times-2 bound, Schur concavity, negative associations, and convex orderings, as suspected in the proposal.   Broader Impact:  On the practical side, the project has resulted in much better LBS, data center switching, and DDSP techniques.  On the theoretical side, it has resulted in several major mathematical discoveries that have significantly advanced the mathematical theories of WCLD and queueing systems.  These discoveries are so general that they are expected to soon find new applications in queueing, networking, and systems.   This project has also generated considerable educational and broader impact.   A female undergraduate student majoring in mathematics at Georgia Tech, worked on this project under PI Xu's close supervision for about a year (AY 2015), resulting in a top conference paper.  PI Xu and co-PI Lin together served as General co-Chairs of ACM SIGMETRICS 2015 (a part of ACM FCRC 2015).  The conference brought together a large group of experts from both academia and industry in systems and networking performance evaluation, as well as a large number of graduate students.  PI Xu teaches a graduate course on network algorithmics every year since 2006 using the legendary namesake textbook.  Upon the invitation of the author of the textbook, PI Xu is currently co-authoring with him its second edition.       Last Modified: 11/24/2018       Submitted by: Jun Xu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
