<AbstractNarration>Involving more students from urban and rural areas in STEM fields and careers has been at the forefront of national STEM education reform efforts for decades. Research shows that engaging these students in STEM activities relevant to their everyday lives is critical to increasing their motivation, interest, learning, and participation in STEM. This project will address this need through engineering and computer science activities aimed at helping 400 middle and high school students grasp the intricacies of scientific principles and technology design. The goal is to inspire and prepare a greater number of students from the targeted population to understand how these principles and design strategies contribute to a stronger educational and technological society. To do this, the project will use a teaching and learning model that will integrate human-centered robotics and telepresence theme-based activities in a problem-based learning and systems thinking environment. In this project, human-centered robotics will involve the development of robotics technologies and applications for everyday use while telepresence robots will enable better communication, operation, and exploration across enormous distances. This dual strategy makes the proposed technological approach highly relevant to the daily needs of students in Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of students and faculty mentors from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Departments at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and from the School of Informatics and Computing and the Center for Research on Learning and Technology at Indiana University at Bloomington. Through this partner-effort, the research team will develop a curriculum that addresses the technical and societal aspects of the human-centered robotics and telepresence that underlie the engineering and computer science concepts students will learn about. Each year, students will actively engage in a 9-month problem-based learning strategy using two basic open-architecture platforms based on the Arduino microcontroller. Students will be able to customize these platforms through design variations and with the addition of new sensors, actuators, program parts, and other technology-related functions. User-friendly software will help teachers and mentors assist students with their designs and redesigns. Through this approach, students will gain STEM knowledge and skills that will be useful to their own individual lives and for sharing with other students, who might be chronically ill, reside in remote places, live in the lower 48 states, or even internationally via ties established through prior NSF-supported efforts. Hence, this project will help student develop technology-based products adaptable to peoples' daily environments, needs, and practices in some meaningful way, which in turn, could increase student's motivation and interest in STEM and STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

Our problem-based curriculum and robotics toolkit were based on the concept of &ldquo;Human-Centered Robotics&rdquo; (HCR), which combines the development of technical skills with an understanding of the relationship between technology, nature, and society. We expected this merging of the social and the technical to increase engagement in STEM among all students, and especially among non-dominant populations (e.g. females, and ethnic and racial minorities), who have been found to begin to lose interest in STEM during middle school.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The project was a collaboration between Indiana University Bloomington (IUB) and the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). The IUB team focused on the development and evaluation of curricular materials, including the design of problem-based HCR lesson plans, robotics kits, and online instructions and tutorials for implementing the HCR curriculum. UAF developed software infrastructure to support the curriculum. UAF and IUB researchers worked together to imeplement the curriculum in middle and high-schools in Alaska and Indiana. Over 200 middle- and high-school students and 7 teachers participated in the project.

As students worked together to build a telepresence robot, they negotiated how to organize the problem-solving process using team-based collaboration and engineering design practices. The unit addressed the Next Generation Science Standards, which asks students to grapple with how a whole system is more than just the sum of its parts.

In the final iteration of the curriculum, students worked with &ldquo;clients&rdquo; from the community to help them achieve their goals.

Early pre- and post-test evaluations included questions about authentic HCR scenarios, engineering design, systems thinking, electrical circuits, and basic robotic parts, and showed that all students made knowledge gains about these topics. Females often started out with a more social understanding of robots, and developed more knowledge on the social applications of HCR than males. Males initially tended to focus on the technical composition of robots, and showed more understanding of technology afterwards. We iterated on pre- and post-test measures during the project to better capture students&rsquo; engagement with the physical, technical, and social aspects of robotics. Our final pre- and post-tests suggest students considered more aspects of HCR design overall after going through our curriculum, particularly paying attention to the technical aspects and applications of HCR, with no differences by gender.
