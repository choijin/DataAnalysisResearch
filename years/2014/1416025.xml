<AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of a superior infrastructure material with wide-reaching applications.  Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) rebar materials offer significant performance advantages as compared to uncoated steel rebar.  These advantages include a sevenfold weight reduction, the elimination of corrosion, a 30% reduction in concrete usage (which translates to a 15 billion ton reduction in CO2 emissions), and equivalent tensile strength at smaller diameters versus traditional steel rebar.  FRP rebar is being produced in small quantities, but has limited market acceptance due to its high cost.  The material and process to be developed will allow price parity and enable dramatic improvements in production speeds as compared to the current FRP state-of-the-art.  When combined, these improvements will open the FRP market of $1.8 billion and create opportunities in the broader $60 billion global market for rebar.  Additionally, global basalt mine waste dumps will be explored and, if possible, utilized as a raw material for fiber production.  If successful, this would eliminate a significant waste stream and lead to better environmental stewardship. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will focus on developing the process required to produce this new rebar.  A thermoset resin and basalt fiber will be used as the primary reinforcements within this composite.  Over the past 20 years, FRP rebar has been developed into a viable product, representing $1.2 billion in cumulative revenue.  However, no FRP rebar product is currently offered at price parity with uncoated steel rebar.  In order to reach price parity, this effort will focus on development of a novel high-speed manufacturing process for this material.  Basalt fiber is an emerging material that has potential to replace carbon fiber in a variety of applications.  Additionally, thermoset resins not commonly used in pultrusion can offer improved performance characteristics that cannot be achieved with typical FRP rebar resins.  Completion of this project will create further understanding of material interactions in this system, which will create the potential for additional composite technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neuvokas completed a Phase I and Phase IB study for the National Science Foundation titled "Development of High Speed Process Technology for the Manufacturing of Cost Effective Polymer Rebar".    This project funded critical elements in the research and development of the process and moved the company closer to a commercialized product.  Neuvokas rebar (Tradename: Gatorbar&trade;) is a basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) composite produced with a unique high speed manufacturing process.  The SBIR Phase I study resulted in a rebar pilot production process fully 3x faster than current state-of-the-art processes and the technology will be utilized to achieves speeds as high as 100x faster.  While a consortium of pultruders has collectively organized the Fiber Reinforced Polymer Rebar Manufacturers Council and they have developed FRP rebar into a viable market over the past 20 years, none of these manufacturers has offered their product at price parity with steel.    This project resulted in job creation and environmental improvements.  With full implementation of this High Speed Process up to 35 manufacturing jobs will be created in the immediate future.  When considering FRP rebar significant performance advantages are offered when compared to steel rebar.  These advantages include no corrosion, a 7x weight reduction, enabling a 30% reduction in concrete usage (allowing 15 billion ton reduction in C02 emissions), equivalent tensile strength at smaller diameters when compared to steel rebar products, an extended (2x) structure life with zero increase in associated construction costs.  To-date FRP rebar has been produced but has had limited market acceptance due to high cost.  Gatorbar&trade;, a superior product at price parity with steel will open the entire $12.8 billion US market and $143 billion Global market for steel rebar.
