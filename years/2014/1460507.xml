<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Colorado State University, located in Fort Collins, CO, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015- 2017. Students will participate in a program that exposes them to a broad range of research areas and approaches that constitute the modern discipline of biochemistry and molecular biology. Students will be involved in their own research project where they learn how to formulate and test hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze results, and use state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation. Students receive a stipend, free housing in a university residence hall or apartment building, a meal allowance, and an allowance to defray travel to/from the site. At the end of the program, students will present their research results orally and through a poster, and produce a final report in manuscript form. In addition to research, students will engage in activities that will enhance their knowledge of the environment such as an educational hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park. Field trips to nearby government labs and biotech companies as well as workshops on GRE preparation, ethical conduct of research and scientific careers are also planned. The program will use the BIO REU Sites common assessment tool to obtain feedback and assessment data for improving our REU program and all REU programs. Students with limited opportunities for research and those from groups under-represented in science are especially encouraged to apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

Shing Ho at Shing.Ho@colostate.edu), or Stasi Brazil-Engleman at 970-491-5602 or reubiochem@colostate.edu.</AbstractNarration>

The students got to know each other and participants in other summer programs through experiential challenges (team building activities), white water rafting and hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park. They also took a field trip to nearby biotech company as well as participated in an ethics workshop and panel discussion on scientific careers with CSU URM graduate students and REU alumni. We provided for travel and lodging costs for four alumni to return for a reunion during the last week of the summer session. This reunion allowed alumni to meet alumni from other years and to interact with current participants and discuss with them how the REU experience impacted their career choices. The alumni participated in a panel discussion and attended the poster session and graduation banquet of the summer program.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/09/2019<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Laybourn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460507/1460507_10353207_1557444355770_IMG_0160--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460507/1460507_10353207_1557444355770_IMG_0160--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CSU MBS REU Participants 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460507/1460507_10353207_1557444355770_IMG_0160--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CSU MBS REU Participants 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">CSU Molecular Biosciences REU participants and Horsetooth Reservoir.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Paul Laybourn</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Laybourn</div> <div class="imageTitle">CSU MBS REU Participants 2017</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>

The targeted student participants are from institutions with high concentrations of underrepresented minorities and where opportunities for research are limited. All the participants in our summer program were students recruited from off-campus. Ninety percent of the 2018 participants were from underrepresented groups. Although, due to our organizational structure, students were involved in separate research projects, the common theme was that the projects are exciting, interesting, meaningful, and tailored to the relatively short time period of the student participants' tenure.
