<AbstractNarration>This project explores a new direction to analyze human gait. The project obtains high accurate gait data, movement and high resolution ground reaction forces on different terrains, which has not been possible to measure and acquire previously.   The project enables to produce the first ever detailed and multimodal gait database that can be used for research and education.  It can assist computer scientists and biomedical researchers in addressing complex questions such as understanding, analyzing and simulating the kinematics and dynamics of walking in natural settings. The resulting research and datasets can be incorporated in the curriculum of many fields such as computer science, biomedical engineering and medicine and will result in significantly better educated future researchers, professors, and employees in gait analytics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focus on collecting novel, accurate, multi-modal gait data on unconstrained terrains and developing a novel approach to analyze the gait data. The research team develops predictive models to create realistic simulations of human gait, which is important for many industries such as healthcare, sports, footwear, and entertainment.  This requires accurate human movement data and ground reaction forces on different terrains.  Currently the most common method to collect the gait data is to put surface markers on human subjects. Due to the skin movement, surface marker data collected by this method contain a significant error.  Gait kinematics estimated from the surface markers are not accurate and may be quite off from the real human movement.  Moreover, the most common methods to collect the ground reaction forces use a simple force plate.  However, a simple force plate can only measure the ground reaction forces on one simple type of terrain and cannot measure the ground force close to real daily life.  The ground reaction forces on the terrains similar to real life are unknown.  This exploration project enables many new studies and applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Modeling and animating human movement efficiently and accurately are basic and challenging tasks for many applications, from ergonomics, biomechanics, rehabilitation, and physical therapy, to virtual reality and entertainment.  These tasks are complex since a large number of degrees of freedom have to be managed simultaneously.  To date, however, no efficient, accurate, general-purpose models for gait motions on unconstrained terrains exist, despite decades of computer graphics, animation, robotics, and biomechanical research.       The goal of this project is to use an advanced multi-modal motion capture system to collect novel high accurate human movement kinematics to fulfill the research gap mentioned above.        We have developed a novel camera based approach for quick tracking of human movement.   We have been developing the methods for predicting the gait posture and understanding the critical joint behaviors as well as postures for other activities. We have also developed the methods for fine movement modeling including automatic segmentation, registration, and geometry modeling.  We have proposed a hybrid multi-organ segmentation approach and segmented joint bones including knee and shoulder, spine, and hand.  We have developed novel deep-learning based methods for identifying the bony landmarks and applied for knee bones. We have developed methods for assessing bone morphology for shoulder and quantifying the joint angle changes induced by injuries at hand.  We have also developed methods for assessing shoulder joint morphology and joint kinematics examination for group truth estimation. We have also made significant progress on 2D/3D registration.  We have developed a feature-based and deformable model based registration method for kinematic analysis of joint bones. We have significantly improved the registration accuracy.  Our work has been published at ISBI, MICCAI, SPIE, Neurocomputing, CVIU, JOR, applied ergo, etc.  Papers have been published as cover stories and some have been invited for oral presentations.  The work will, we hope, make a contribution toward facilitating human movement analysis.  A wide variety of applications, with the potential to improve the lives of the people with musculoskeletal disorders , could also benefit from the advances made through this project.  Through this project, many undergraduate and graduate students have had the opportunity to participate in human movement analysis, product design, and medical image analysis research.  This results in a unique generation of under-graduate and graduate researchers with a comprehensive knowledge of computational sciences, medical science, and product design.
