<AbstractNarration>This CNIC project will allow the PI, Douglas McCauley of the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) to develop a research area that is new to him via a collaborative research effort with researchers at Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) in Morogoro, Tanzania and a complementary research team in a different department at UCSB. The goal of the project is to evaluate and adapt new, very high-resolution satellite data and computational analysis tools to directly study self-organization of large vertebrates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key intellectual merit of this project is to perform proof-of-concept demonstrating that high-resolution satellite data can be used to understand the scale, scope and parameters of self-organization geometries in large vertebrates.  This effort could have a transformative impact on the scale and scope at which self-organization in vertebrates can be evaluated. Self-organization geometries in animals, that is the collective behaviors that shape the geometry of animal aggregations, have thus far focused primarily on small vertebrates (e.g. minnows) and satellite data has not been utilized as a data source. By exploring a new and significantly different set of animals this project may significantly contribute to the understanding of group behavior and pattern formation in nature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this CNIC proposal is to identify the necessary sub-meter panchromatic and multispectral satellite data for a small pilot study in the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem, ground truth the satellite data and validate the computer-assisted analysis tools that will be applied, in this pilot effort, to evaluating self-organization geometries of migrating wildebeest herds. These techniques may allow study of how group architecture and migratory behaviors have been altered by environmental change. More significantly, by comparing conclusions drawn from the study of self-organization in large groups of large vertebrates to those generated in groups of smallbodied aggregating organisms, it will be possible to better understand the general principles that control animate self-organization. The research is also likely to result in tools and information that can assist the management of large vertebrates in ecosystems around the world that are undergoing significant change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to identify behavioral mechanisms that control collective movements in large vertebrates by fostering new research collaborations between early career scientists in the United States, Tanzania, and the United Kingdom.  To achieve this goal, we collaboratively developed new analytical techniques for processing high resolution, remotely sensed images of migratory wildebeest herds in Serengeti National Park. Outputs from this effort are now being used to:  (a) Identify mechanisms that control self-organization in large vertebrates at multiple spatial scales.  (b) Determine whether these same mechanisms explain patterns of self-organization in smaller bodied organisms.  (c) Evaluate the role that environmental change plays in regulating these mechanisms.  Working with our international collaborators, we have compiled a large database of remotely sensed, high resolution images of wildebeest herds responding to threat in situ and developed techniques for automated extraction and analysis of data from these sources.  Results from this work will advance fundamental science by improving our understanding of the dynamics of collective behavior at novel spatial scales.  The technical products we have generated will be broadly useful to research communities endeavoring to study animal behavior across large spatial scales and in remote landscapes. Outputs will also contribute biological insights that have broad application from the management and conservation of large, mobile species to the development of multi-agent robotic systems.  In addition to these outputs, the project created meaningful new pathways for collaboration between scientists in the US, Tanzania, and the UK. It also provided training in the implementation of scientific protocols and the use of new remote sensing technologies for 30 undergraduate students at UC Santa Barbara, including the opportunity for a subset of these students to join in collaborative field research in Tanzania. Numerous students that participated in the lab and field research were from backgrounds presently underrepresented in the sciences.  Preliminary outputs from this research were presented at international research conferences, became the subject on new grant proposals, and are planned for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
