<AbstractNarration>Oxidative stress results from the imbalance between free radical production and cellular detoxification and repair. At large interdisciplinary conferences, presentations addressing oxidative stress tend to be scattered throughout the program, often at concurrent sessions. Those conferences that focus on oxidative stress do so almost exclusively within the contexts of medicine or toxicology. Following a successful First International Conference on Oxidative Stress in Aquatic Habitats in 2012; this award will support portions of the Second International Conference on Oxidative Stress in Aquatic Habitats.  Funds will support symposium speakers who integrate the 'omics' into their research programs and will support the conference attendance of U.S. students, postdoctoral associates, and early career scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference structure will include three types of working group sessions that will create synergy across disciplines and nationalities and enhance the development of collaborations.  The conference design creates a unique opportunity to contribute to the interdisciplinary and global workforce needed for the Genomes - Phenomes Grand Challenge.  Summative assessments will provide valuable information about what components of the conference design were most effective at facilitating collaborations and bridging disciplines and nationalities. Support from this award will enable participation by students, postdoctoral associates and early career scientists who self-identify into one or more category of underrepresented status. This will help increase the diversity of the STEM workforce that participates in international collaborations and that is engaged in studying the genome - phenome continuum.</AbstractNarration>

At the 2015 conference there were 14 participants from the U.S. (21% of the conference attendees). The three-day conference was attended by 67 participants, representing 14 countries.  The objectives of this project were to:  Increase the participation of scientists from U.S. institutions at the Second International Conference on Oxidative Stress in Aquatic Ecosystems.  Increase the conference attendance of U.S. students, postdoctoral associates and young investigators who are from traditionally underrepresented groups in the STEM disciplines.  Catalyze the addition of the æomicsÆ into the conference with the goal of facilitating integration of the æomicsÆ into the research programs of conference attendees.  Facilitate the creation of new collaborations, particularly those that involve grant-sponsored participants, that are international and/or that are interdisciplinary and address multiple points along the genome &ndash; phenome continuum.  Of the 14 attendees who were from U.S. institutions, eleven received complete financial support. Of these, four are faculty members, three are postdoctoral associates, two are Ph.D. students and two are M.S. students. Demographic information was collected from the seven students/postdoctoral associates: four are women, two identify as first-generation college students, and three identify as belonging to an ethnic minority group.  The three participants who received partial support are faculty members. All 14 U.S. participants gave either oral or poster presentations.  There were two components of the intellectual merit of this project.

The graduate students and postdoctoral associates received formal and informal mentoring about conference attendance and best practices for searching for postdoctoral/faculty positions. The students and postdoctoral associates received extensive feedback on their research programs. The overall conference design, and the first working group session in particular, facilitated networking opportunities. Finally, this project provided young scientists from U.S. the opportunity to interact with researchers from other countries. In a post-confer...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
