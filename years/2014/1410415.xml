<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research to University of California Irvine is for developing a scientific understanding of how nature produces transparent, durable biomaterials, as exemplified by the proteins making up the eye lens. Although the molecular details of these proteins vary among different organisms, they are functionally similar in their high stability and resistance to temperature extremes and UV-light damage. Understanding the structural factors diverse lens proteins have in common will help guide the design of future temperature and UV-resistant biomimetic materials. The educational plan includes training of students at the Ph.D. and undergraduate levels. These students will be trained not only in the specific skills needed to complete the research, but also in thinking and problem-solving across disciplinary boundaries. Another important component is outreach to middle school and high school students. The goal of the outreach program is to increase interest in science as a career among middle school students and includes a variety of activities and visits to the PI's labs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand the molecular basis of protein stability, in particular resistance to extreme temperatures and UV light exposure. Studies of extremely stable structural proteins that are not homologous but play the same functional role will provide insight into sequence determinants of stability without interference from effects that are conserved due to enzymatic activity in thermostable enzymes. The particular proteins chosen for this effort are eye lens crystallins from three organisms adapted to extreme environments.  The box jellyfish (Tripedalia cystophora) J2-crystallin has a high thermal stability, while the gamma-S1- and gamma-S2-crystallins from the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) help confer unusual cold tolerance on the eye lens of this organism.  The iota-crystallin of the diurnal gecko Lygodactylus picturatus, has an unusual UV protection mechanism involving binding of a retinol derivative. NMR and optical spectroscopic studies coupled with molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations will elucidate the important structural factors and intermolecular interactions that confer high stability on these proteins, guiding the future design of biomimetic materials. The educational plan includes training of students at the Ph.D. and undergraduate levels, who will be exposed to a broad range of experimental and computational techniques, as well as the continuation of a successful outreach program aimed at middle school students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this project is to understand how heat- and cold-tolerant eye lens proteins maintain their stability, transparency, and high refractivity in extreme environments. The&nbsp;<strong>intellectual merit</strong>&nbsp;of this project derives from the advances in simulation methodology for studying proteins in the crowded milieu of the eye lens and novel experimental studies of the lens proteins of organisms adapted to extreme environments. Highlights include a new molecular modeling framework for simulating proteins in very concentrated conditions, an improved understanding of how the lenses of Antarctic fish resist cold cataract, a characterization of how metal binding impacts the stability of a heat-resistant lens protein, as well as new information about how protein structure affects the refractivity of lens proteins.</p> <p>Our multi-conformation Monte Carlo method enables the explicit modeling of crowded protein solutions at atomic resolution. In the eye lens, proteins are packed tightly together: in fish lenses, the protein density can be greater than 70%, compared to about 50% for an average protein crystal. Traditional modeling approaches often focus on small numbers of biological macromolecules in a dilute solution, which is useful for comparing to many experiments carried out in a laboratory, but omits details that are relevant to how the proteins work in the real system. The key novel aspect of our approach is the incorporation of macromolecular flexibility in the model. Each protein can adopt multiple conformations as well as simply moving around relative to its neighbors, resulting in better agreement with experimental data than previous many-protein simulation methodologies. &nbsp;On the level of individual molecules, we have modeled lens proteins from the Antarctic toothfish and compared them to their human counterpart. Despite high structural similarity, each protein is equivalently flexible at its native temperature (37 C for the human, -2 C for the Antarctic fish). This result adds to our understanding of how cold-tolerant proteins remain functional at low temperature, a phenomenon that is relatively under-studied compared to thermophilic proteins.</p> <p>We also investigated reversible liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of eye lens proteins from the cold-tolerant Antarctic toothfish (<em>Dissostichus mawsoni</em>. Under normal circumstances the highly concentrated lens proteins are maintained in a homogeneous, transparent solution. Cooling of the eye lens causes the proteins to coalesce into a separate liquid phase. The intact eye lens of the Antarctic toothfish is completely resistant to LLPS, however some of the individual proteins are not. The other biological roles of LLPS vary from membrane-less organelles that carry out reactions that are isolated from the cellular contents to molecular condensations that can sequester or release molecules in response to stimuli. These liquid droplets have also been implicated in the early stages of protein aggregation. We identified sequence determinants that can be used to control the onset temperature of LLPS in these crystallins. It is possible to dramatically shift the onset temperature of LLPS in either direction with a small number of mutations. These results not only give insight into how the Antarctic toothfish eye lens proteins are adapted to a cold environment, but also hint at general principles for controlling LLPS.</p> <p>The refractivity of eye lens proteins is critical to their function, but has not been previously investigated in detail for highly refractive proteins from aquatic organisms. We experimentally measured the refractive index increment of several crystallins. The values for crystallins from aquatic organisms are of particular interest, because the lenses of these animals do not benefit from an air/water interface at the cornea; therefore all refractive power must be provided by the lens itself. Fish have several adaptations for underwater vision, including spherical lenses, very high protein concentration, and enhanced refractivity of the crystallins. Our results show a new dimension to the latter property, as the amino acid composition does not fully account for crystallin refractivity as was previously believed. Instead, both surface hydration and proximity of highly polarizable residues play an important role. Using our experimental results, we have developed a correction term to the standard model of protein refractivity that improves agreement with experimental data.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<strong>broader impacts</strong>&nbsp;include the development of new simulation methodology, which can be applied in other fields, enhanced understanding of transparency and refractivity, which can be used to help develop better artificial lenses, and better ability to control the formation of liquid droplets in protein mixtures. The latter structures can be used as mini-reactors to sequester solution components and control the timing of chemical reactions. The project has also provided training opportunities for students from the Ph.D level to middle school. Four students supported by this grant earned their Ph.D.s, two more advanced to candidacy, and three undergraduate students were trained as part of this project. Our outreach efforts included hosting middle school students at least once per year for campus tours and hands-on activities led by the PIs as well as graduate and undergraduate students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Rachel&nbsp;Martin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1410415/1410415_10321151_1538269988227_crowd--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1410415/1410415_10321151_1538269988227_crowd--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Simulation of proteins in crowded solution"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1410415/1410415_10321151_1538269988227_crowd--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Simulation of proteins in crowded solution"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We developed a novel simulation methodology that enables the explicit modeling of crowded protein solutions at atomic resolution, shown here for the proteins making up the human eye lens.
