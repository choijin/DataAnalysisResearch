<AbstractNarration>Many Americans proclaim a preference for renewable energy over traditional fuel sources, yet actual renewable-energy projects frequently draw opposition from communities in which they may be sited.  Complaints of environmental damage and aesthetic blight are common responses to any unwanted development project, pitting the clean energy against the preservation of land and landscape, memory, and identity. This raises important questions for policymakers, scientists, and communities concerned with sustainable development: What does it mean to be in the public interest?  Who has authority to define that interest?  And through what means might such definitions emerge or be imposed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Irvine, doctoral student, Alyse Bertenthal, under the supervision of Dr. Mona Lynch, will address these questions through a case study of a recent proposal to develop a million-panel solar farm that has generated significant controversy in a region that has long struggled over the allocation and management of its soil, minerals, and water. The researcher will use a mixed methods approach, including interviews, participant observation, GIS/GPS mapping, and the historical analysis of court documents to shed light on how laws, society, and the environment have interacted over time. Examining these disputes both ethnographically and historically allows the researcher to elucidate how individuals and groups construct themselves as "the public" as they negotiate legal claims to land and resources.  By untangling constructions and contestations of public identity through resource management, this project will contribute to efforts to understand the discourses, logic, and practices through which people define themselves; how they situate their pasts and futures in particular places; and how law mediates these processes.  Findings from this research will provide insight into the challenges confronted by policymakers legislating a more sustainable America and by the people who must sustain such policies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided support for a doctoral student to complete ethnographic and archival research in the Owens Valley, California. The Owens Valley holds a special place in the environmental imaginary, an outsized story of resource grabs and water wars whose notoriety and longevity has been promoted by film and novels. Today, the Owens Valley has become a site for experimental forms of environmental governance, and other rural areas have begun to mimic its efforts as part of an emergent circuit of knowledge and practice to foster environmental renewal.  At a time when the very concept of environmentalism has become contested, analysis of the historical and contemporary conflicts in the Owens Valley can deepen our understanding of how the environment is being (re)conceptualized and how borders between people and places&mdash;and the rights and responsibilities that arise in the intersections between them&mdash;are being reformed materially and socially through specific governance strategies and practices.  In doing so, this project also provides a picture of the cultural foundations of environmental governance, and ties the law and its implementation to vital ideas about the world and the human place in it.   The findings of this project impact understanding of the linkages between human activity, social organization, natural systems, and human and environmental health.  The project's interdisciplinary research design promotes a wider array of possibilities for achieving a deeper understanding of a place and its relationships to other places, and offers a divserse set of strategies for recognizing broad patterns of conceptualization, practice, and behavior that might otherwise be missed. Findings from this project offer insight into emergent models of environmental management and a means of assessing how these respond to urban and rural political, economic, and cultural concerns.
