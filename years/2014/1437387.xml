<AbstractNarration>Staples&lt;br/&gt;1437387&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to investigate microfluidic flow of gases inspired by the manner in which insects manage to pump gas through their microscopic breathing air ducts. The project aims to develop a combination of theoretical and computational tools to explore novel microfluidic methods for gas transport. In particular, the PI will capitalize on her group's ongoing research that studies 3D gas transport in arthropods. The research objectives include theoretical methods to obtain reduced order models for flow in inelastic tubes, and computational methods to develop meshfree simulations of the process. Using this simulation approach, one of the objectives of the proposed research is to assess the validity of using an inelastic tube with local contractions in a practical microfluidic-system for gas transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current gas microfluidic devices are mostly 2D geometries and are indistinguishable from liquid microfluidic devices. They generally consist of smooth, straight channels with uniform cross sections, and are in general ineffective. However, this project is focused on exploring exactly this recently discovered paradigm inspired from nature:  gas transport in insect respiratory systems relies on inelastic but locally collapsible tracheal tubes, which differs from macroscopic transport or liquid flow across small spaces. This research program can lead to designing novel microfluidic strategies and devices. Poor gas flow distribution capacities severely limit many microfluidics applications important to public health and industry. In addition to the cooling of handheld electronics devices, many artificial tissue growth and medical lab-on-a-chip technologies are currently limited because of ineffective 3D gas distribution at the microscale. The proposed work could potentially have a profound impact in these fields.</AbstractNarration>

These devices have several important applications, including point-of-care medical diagnostic devices emerging as a promising tool for improving global health.

We also derived associated theoretical models for the flow rate in these devices and carried out computations to predict the flow in the devices.  To begin, we hypothesized that the two unique features of insect respiratory flows that lead to its extraordinary effectiveness are its automaticity and instrinsicality. The automaticity in the system resides in that the respiratory air flow moves in a network of tubes that automatically collapse when the insect contracts its abdomen/makes ordinary motions, and these collapses help drive the tidal respiratory flow in conjunction with an automatic pressure gradient that occurs from oxygen being consumed at the tissues. The intrinsicality of the system resides in its intrinsic geometric features: that the network tubes reach such small diameters near the tissue that the air begins to "slip" against the walls of the tubes as the average distance air molecules travel during random motions becomes comparable to the tube diameters, leading to a reduction in the friction forces that have to be overcome with work.  Using this hypothesis, we derived minimal theoretical models of the insect respiratory actuation mechanism that reproduced the automatic and instrinsic features and predicted the air flow rate as a function of tube wall contraction rate, the contraction amplitude, and the tube geometry. We added slip effects to the model for the smaller respiratory tubes to determine the reduction in friction forces. We performed a series of computations based on the reduced-order model.
