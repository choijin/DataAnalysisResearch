<AbstractNarration>In this International Collaboration in Chemistry project supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Mirkin and his research team at the City University of New York, Queens College is collaborating with Prof. Christian Amatore and his group at the Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, on molecular mechanistic studies of the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).  The ORR process is central to many technological systems (e.g., fuel cells, lithium and sodium batteries, catalysis) as well as biological processes, including oxidation of food and drug molecules in liver, ageing, and numerous diseases.  Despite extensive research on the ORR during several decades, basic questions about its molecular mechanism remain open.  Professor Mirkin is developing new experimental and computational methods to study the ORR with the aim of advancing our understanding of these fundamentally interesting and practically important electrocatalytic reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoelectrochemical techniques, including scanning electrochemical microscopy and voltammetry at the nanopipette-supported interface between two immiscible liquids are used for the mechanistic analysis of the ORR.  Very fast mass-transfer, high sensitivity and selectivity of these techniques enable the detection and quantification of short-lived ionic species produced in the course of the ORR, such as superoxide.  The kinetics of the intermediate formation and consumption are analyzed with the help of the recently developed KISSA-2D simulation package.  The anticipated results have significant implications for fuel cells, other alternative energy systems, and sensors.  The proposed activities enhance the infrastructure for research and education at the City University of New York, Queens College by stimulating the development of new instrumentation.  The established international collaboration provides additional training opportunities for students in both research groups and exposes them to a wide range of experimental and computational approaches.  The proposed activities provide research opportunities to high school students and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most important outcome of this project is the development of a new approach to the detection and quantitation of short-lived ionic intermediates of heterogeneous processes based on the electron transfer/ion transfer mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and the application of this technique to the investigation of the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).  Direct evidence of superoxide formation at the bare polycrystalline Pt surface during the ORR in neutral aqueous solution and its desorption has been obtained by using the SECM equipped with a nanopipette tip. The diffusion flux of superoxide was measured at the electrode surface and the amount of produced superoxide as a fraction of reduced oxygen was evaluated.  The developed technique should be applicable to a broad range of electrocatalytic processes involving charged reactive intermediates. With the attainable distance of the closest approach between the nanopipette tip and substrate surface of a few nanometers, one can detect ionic intermediates with the lifetime on the nanosecond scale.  In collaboration with the Amatore group (&Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure, Paris), we performed finite-element simulations of the electron transfer/ion transfer mode of SECM, including the surface generated ionic species either chemically stable or participating in the first or second order homogeneous reaction, and the electroactive species simultaneously present inside the nanopipette and in the external liquid phase.  These simulations expanded the concept of using the nanopipette supported liquid-liquid nanointerface as a probe in the electron transfer/ion transfer mode of SECM for measuring the kinetics of homogeneous reactions whose rate constants cover the whole range of experimental interest, i.e. from a few nanoseconds up to a second, under steady-state conditions.  The SECM was employed to measure electrochemical kinetics at nanoporous Au electrodes.  A new experimental/computational methodology was developed to evaluate the true surface area involved in the interfacial electron transfer in the nanopore.  The rates measured at the nanoporous Au were 3 &ndash; 5 times higher than those obtained at a flat gold electrodes, pointing to a significant effect of nanoconfinement.  Substrate generation/tip collection SECM experiments enabled the identification of hydrogen peroxide and showed that the nanoporous Au is significantly more active towards the four-electron ORR than the flat gold.  In collaboration with Christian Amatore, we used platinized carbon nanoelectrodes to penetrate living cells and independently measure local fluxes of four reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, nitrogen monoxide and nitrite ion).  Our experiments with normal breast cells and metastatic cancer cells showed strong correlation between intracellular production of the reactive species and metastatic activity.  We also used the SECM to measure for the first time the individual production rates of four reactive oxygen and nitrogen species inside single phagolysosomes of living macrophages.  This work can open new avenues for studying enzymatic redox catalysis in biological systems on the subcellular level.  Several methodologies for electrochemical collision experiments were developed to probe different processes related to electrocatalysis.  By localizing one iridium oxide nanoparticle inside a conductive nanocavity, we were able to observe the time evolution of the transient shape in a sequence of collisions and probe the dynamics of deactivation of the nanoparticle.  The results suggest that the loss of catalytic activity of the nanoparticle for the H2O2 oxidation in a series of short collisions may be less significant than in the long-time electrolysis.  In another series of experiments, collision measurements were coupled with the SECM to reveal that the cathodic dissolution of Pt during ORR produces Pt nanoparticles.  An important result of this study is the first in situ detection of a few locally generated catalytic nanoparticles.  Electrochemical collision experiments were also used for detection of and discrimination between different microbial cells based on their charge and redox activity.  The microbial redox activity is essentially reproducible and can be used as a unique signature for identification of specific bacteria.  The analysis of charge-transfer processes occurring during the collision events may also be useful for development and optimization of microbial fuel cells.  This project provided opportunities for multidisciplinary research to four graduate students, one undergraduate student, and three postdoctoral fellows.  They were trained in electrocatalysis, scanning probe microscopies, and nanoscience.  These students gave oral and poster presentations at national and international meetings and participated in preparation of research papers and reports.  They also performed joint research with our collaborators at &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure (France), NREL and Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Two students obtained their PhDs degrees.  Two postdoctoral fellows obtained academic positions, and one &ndash; an industrial position in China.   A visiting scientist from Brazil and a visiting student from China  have been doing research in the PI's laboratory closely related to this  project.  A high school student spent one summer and a fall semester doing research in the PI's laboratory.       Last Modified: 02/11/2019       Submitted by: Michael Mirkin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
