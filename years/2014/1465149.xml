<AbstractNarration>T. Daniel Crawford of Virginia Tech University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory; Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to develop theoretical and computational methods for the accurate prediction of the optical properties of chiral molecules in solution remains a challenging task for computational chemistry.  A chiral molecule is one in which there are two different versions that are identical in composition but which cannot be superimposed, much like human hands.   The "left-handed" and "right-handed" molecules are mirror images of one another.  Such molecules are optically active, they can rotate plane-polarized light either clockwise or counter-clockwise.  Chiral molecules play an important role in many branches of chemistry, including the chemistry that governs the functioning of living beings.   Crawford and his research group focus on the development of robust and efficient methods for computing the special "chiroptical" properties of these molecules, with the overarching goal of providing practical and reliable tools for assigning absolute stereochemical configurations of chiral compounds.   These studies are invaluable in the elucidating  the intimate relationship between molecular structure and chiroptical response and thus may provide the chemical community with a deeper understanding of the nature of optical activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best approach for modeling the intimidating complexity of solvent effects on molecular properties remains elusive, especially for chiroptical properties such as optical rotation (OR), circular dichroism (CD), vibrational Raman optical activity (ROA), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), which exhibit an exquisite sensitivity to environmental effects.  This project focuses on the development of robust and efficient tools for the high accuracy modeling of chiroptical properties in the liquid phase, including implicit, explicit, and hybrid approaches.  Implicit models will be developed to approximate the bulk solute-solvent interaction using both shape- and density- based cavities coupled with potentials derived self-consistently.  Explicit solvation effects will be accounted for using a new hybrid QM/MM scheme, including a novel wave-function-embedded periodic approach.  Efficient implementation of these models will rely heavily on emerging reduced-scaling methods, particularly within the coupled cluster linear-response approach for non-resonant optical activity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        Chirality is an inherent three-dimensional "handedness," a property found in all sugars, proteins, and enzymes, as well as most modern drugs. The two hands of a chiral compound can exhibit dramatically differing chemical behavior when reacting in a chiral environment, such as the human metabolism.   These molecular pairs also exhibit distinct responses to left- and right-circularly polarized light in absorption, emissions, refraction, and scattering.  Furthermore, these responses can vary substantially between gas and liquid phases.  Examples include the strong solvent dependence of the specific rotation of propylene oxide, to the dramatic differences between vapor- and solution-&shy;phase chiroptical properties of compounds such as norbornenone and dimethylallene, all of which demonstrate that the chemistry community's understanding of chirality and optical activity remains astonishingly limited. Indeed, no theoretical model can yet predict such properties with the level of robustness and accuracy that is required for the assignment of absolute stereochemical configurations of chiral isolates.  The focus of this NSF-supported project was to expand our understanding of the behavior of chiral compounds within polarized fields such that we can determine the necessary parameters of a correct theoretical model for simulating this behavior.   In order to understand better the impact of solvation, we explored implicit solvent models, including frozen-density embedding and continuum-based models, and we found that such approaches cannot provide physically realistic descriptions of chiroptical phenomena because of the lack of explicit coupling between the solvent potential and the external electromagnetic field.  However, we find that methods that incorporate explicit solvent effects can provide correct physical simulations, with the proviso that such simulations are considerably more expensive that implicit approaches.
