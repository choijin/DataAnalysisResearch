<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Elizabeth Jarvo of the University of California, Irvine is developing earth abundant nickel catalysts for stereoselective synthesis.  The broader impacts of this research include development of readily available catalysts from earth abundant elements, reducing the US dependence on precious metal catalysts, and increasing sustainability.  Graduate students are trained in organic and organometallic laboratory techniques and in mechanistic investigation.  Mentoring and career-development workshops that target women and minority graduate students and faculty are integrated into the program. Outreach efforts engage underrepresented groups and develop skills sets for retention across a wide range of ages, from middle school students to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty.  Through partnering with local schools, underserved middle school students participate in STEM research environment and opportunities at UC Irvine.  The LEAPS outreach program co-founded by Professor Jarvo provides underserved and underrepresented middle school students with a day at college experience, including hands on experiments that connect their classwork with cutting-edge research in chemistry and physics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on refining the mechanistic understanding of two-electron reactions of organonickel complexes, a critical step forward in the development of nickel catalysts for a range of transformations.  In addition to providing a more sustainable alternative for precious palladium catalysts, nickel catalysts provide unique reactivity patterns and advantages, particularly in reactions of typically sluggish substrates  and for the synthesis of new tertiary stereogenic centers. The identities of active catalysts are being defined using kinetic and structural analysis, including NMR and EPR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.  New reactivity manifolds, including reductive ring-contractions of halotetrahydrofurans, are being developed to challenge the mechanistic hypotheses and provide practical syntheses of substituted cyclopropanes, pharmacophores in medicinal chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: We discovered and developed a new series of chemical reactions for fine chemical synthesis, stereospecific intramolecular cross-electrophile coupling (XEC) reactions.  These reactions establish a new reactivity manifold for XEC reactions that proceeds through polar, two-electron processes, thus contributing to fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of organonickel reactions.  We have developed this reaction through synthesis of cyclopropanes, indanes, and tetralins, key cyclic scaffolds found in medicinal agents.   As part of these efforts, we have discovered the first XEC reaction of an alkyl fluoride, highlighting the advantages of a base metal nickel catalyst in XEC reactions.     Broader impacts.  This award has supported our outreach programs that bring underserved middle school students to our laboratory for hands-on experiments, with the long-term goal of increasing participation and awareness of chemical research by underrepresented middle school students.  We have co-sponsored a day-long undergraduate research symposium, held each summer.  Undergraduate researchers from across southern California attend to present their research in a poster session.  In 2018, 146 undergraduates from 24 institutions participated.  The long-term goal of this annual symposium is to increase engagement and mentoring opportunities for underrepresented students.  We have partnered to provide career-development workshops for graduate students and faculty.   Graduate and undergraduate, and high-school students have been trained in mechanistic analysis, reaction development, and organometallic chemistry.  Graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows are being trained and mentored in many career development skills, including describing their research to a lay audience. A graduate student has completed training opportunities in Chemical Hygiene, his intended career path.  A faculty member at a PIU institution, Professor Nancy Williams, has been on sabbatical in my laboratories, providing research and networking opportunities for her as well and training and mentoring for UCI students.
