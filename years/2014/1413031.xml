<AbstractNarration>Solar neutrino research has already discovered massive neutrinos and flavor mixing, and is moving into an era where precision measurements can tell us about the inner workings of the Sun. The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle is one of the fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, releasing electron-neutrinos. Should this next period allow the Borexino detector to measure the CNO neutrino flux sufficiently well to infer the metallicity (the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium) of the sun's interior, it could test the fundamental assumption of homogeneity in the sun and provide crucial information regarding opacities in the solar interior that are important for helioseismology. Such studies could thus have a great impact on our understanding of the sun, stellar astrophysics, the link between planetary and stellar formation, as well as basic neutrino physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for the continuing role of Virginia Tech in the Borexino experiment, the world's purest large-volume liquid scintillator detector located at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, designed to measure the principle components of the neutrino spectrum coming from the Sun as it converts hydrogen into helium through fusion. They have measured the 7-Be, 8-B, and pep neutrino fluxes from the Sun, and set a limit on the CNO neutrino flux. The next three-year period with ultra-low background requires re-calibration to verify these results, and to prepare the collaboration to move into a new 'CNO focused' phase. The principle physics goals are 1) measurement of the CNO neutrino flux, 2) more precise results for the 7-Be and pep neutrino flux, and 3) a better result for the pp neutrino flux. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact on science, technology and outreach that is expected from the program includes: the training of graduate and undergraduate students in current topical physics research; experience with deployment and utilization of ultra-clean calibration techniques; presentations of this research program to undergraduates, through research projects, student presentations, lectures, and problems - exposing the next generation of scientists from multiple fields to the excitement of astroparticle physics; and a broad engagement of the neutrino community through their Center for Neutrino Physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Borexino Collaboration (this grant is part of that) report a spectral measurement of neutrinos from the sun, directly revealing for the first time operation of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) fusion-cycle which is expected to be the dominant energy source powering stars heavier than the Sun. (CNO neutrino flux: 7.0+3.0-2.0 x 108 cm&minus;2 s&minus;1; 5&sigma; observation) For much of their life, stars get energy by fusing hydrogen into helium.  In stars like our sun or lighter, this predominantly happens through the 'proton-proton' chains. However, many stars are heavier and hotter than our sun, and include elements heavier than helium in their composition (whose total amount is called the star's 'metallicity') including carbon and nitrogen which can catalyze hydrogen burning.  The prediction since the 1930's is that the CNO-cycle will be dominant in heavy stars.  The neutrinos emitted as part of these processes provide a spectral signature allowing separation of 'proton-proton chain' or 'CNO-cycle' contributions.  Confirmation of CNO burning in our sun, where it operates at only a 1% level, reinforces our confidence that we understand how stars work. Beyond this, CNO neutrinos can help resolve an important open question in stellar physics: how the sun's central 'metallicity,' as can only be determined by the CNO neutrino rate from the core, is related to metallicity elsewhere in a star.  The traditional models have run into a difficulty: the surface metallicity measured spectroscopy do not agree with the sub-surface metallicity measurements inferred from helioseismology observations.  Neutrinos are the only direct probe we have of the core of stars (including our sun) but are exceedingly difficult to measure.  The Borexino detector lies under the Apennine Mountains in central Italy at the INFN's LNGS, where it detects neutrinos as flashes of light produced when neutrinos collide with electrons in 300-tons of ultra-pure organic scintillator. The great depth, size and purity (equivalent under a milligram of dust in 300 tons) makes Borexino a truly unique detector, alone in terms of achieved low-background.  The Borexino collaboration had already successfully measured components of the 'proton-proton' solar neutrino fluxes, helped refine neutrino flavor-oscillation parameters, and most impressively even measured the first step in the cycle: the very low-energy 'pp' neutrinos (Nature articles in 2014 and 2018).  While the collaboration dreamed of expanding the science scope to also look for the CNO neutrinos in a narrow spectral region with particularly low background that prize seemed out of reach.  But the US groups at Princeton, Virginia Tech and UMass Amherst, led by Calaprice, believed CNO neutrinos might yet be revealed using the additional purification steps they had developed and methods they had investigated to realize the exquisite detector stability that would be required. The challenge was intriguing to unravel.  The containment vessel apparently has a trace amount of residual 210Pb (a radon daughter) on its surface due to an initial purified water fill which, frustratingly, still had a few radon daughters which plated out onto the vessel.  The decay of this 210Pb leads to 210Bi, whose beta-decay spectrum to 210Po overlaps the CNO spectrum of interest -  thus becoming a background problem.  Fortunately, one can tag the subsequent 210Po alpha decay and thus statistically remove the 210Bi background events.  However, the 138-day 210Po half-life confounds this tagging if very slow convection currents, over the course of many months, have moved the 210Po from near the vessel walls and into the fiducial counting region.   If this motion could be reduced enough, and the intrinsic local 210Bi background was low enough, one could then observe the expected five-or-so low-energy recoils per day in 100 tons due to CNO neutrinos. To convince the collaboration it might be possible, in 2014 the US groups (with major roll for this NSF award) launched a comprehensive thermal mapping of the internal detector accomplished by re-tasking existing calibration ports, which demonstrated the potential to sufficiently model and understand fluid mixing.  Encouraged by these results, thermal insulation of the 18m diameter detector was then completed in late 2015, which included an active temperature stabilization system.  The background-tag 210Po began to steadily decrease in regions of the fiducial volume, and new simulation and analysis tools were developed to best utilize these regions, and excitement and confidence of CNO discovery within the collaboration began to grow.  Ultimately the entire hall where the detector is located was temperature controlled. The effort paid off.  Beyond revealing the CNO neutrinos which is the subject of a November 2020 Nature article (and cover image), there is now even a potential to help resolve the 'metallicity' problem as well. - Nature commentary ? https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01908-2 - Cern Courier ? https://cerncourier.com/a/neutrino-2020-zooms-into-virtual-reality/ - Nature article ? https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2934-0          Last Modified: 08/03/2021       Submitted by: Robert B Vogelaar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
