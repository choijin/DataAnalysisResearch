<AbstractNarration>The chemical composition of galaxies - the relative amounts each galaxy has of hydrogen, helium, oxgen, nitrogen, iron, etc. - provides important clues to how those galaxies have evolved.  However, the known drivers of galaxy evolution - acquiring gas that can form stars, the types of stars that form and where they form in the galaxy, and dynamical processes, such as the reistribution of gas within and outside galaxies through supernova explosions, etc. - are difficult to separate when the sample of galaxies is small, and all the galaxies in the sample are very similar.  This proposal plans to develop the computer codes needed look at a sample of several thousand galaxies with very different properties in in order to provide insight into how their chemical compositions are related to the drivers of galaxy evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explaining how astronomers are able to gather and use information about stars and gas by looking at the different wavelengths of light (their electromagnetic spectrum) is challenging.  Yet these spectra lie at the root of most of our measurements of the masses, motions, temperatures, and compositions of stars, planets, nebulae, galaxies, and large scale structure in the Universe.  Many difficult concepts, such as the phases of the moon, can be effectively taught with the aid of demonstrations.  The PI will work with an undergraduate student to design and build a portable spectrograph - a portable version of an instrument that astronomers use to study the different wavelengths of light - to be used in classrooms and for public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will develop and publish a sophisticated code to measure nebular abundance gradients in MaNGA.  This will enable the study of nebular abundance gradients in disk galaxies, which offer a uniquely powerful probe of the processes that drive galaxy evolution: gas accretion, star formation, and gas outflows.  The complex interplay of these processes is challenging to disentangle even in our own Milky Way. However, insights into these processes can be gained by examining galaxies in a wide variety of evolutionary states.  The development of this code is a key step in being able to analyze the information from the MaNGA dataset.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The gas in nearby disk galaxies is continually chemically enriched by generations of stars. Abundances of common elements like oxygen are typically the highest in galaxy centers and decline with radius. The study of radial abundance gradients offers a powerful probe of the processes that shape galaxy evolution: the accretion of pristine gas, star formation, and the outflow of enriched gas in galactic winds. Many modern galaxy simulations incorporate these processes and produce realistic abundance gradients. However, to test these models, data spanning a broad dynamic range in galaxy physical properties is required.   We have undertaken one of the most comprehensive studies to date of nebular oxygen abundance gradients using two dimensional spectroscopy of several hundred galaxies from the MaNGA survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV.  Intellectual Merit:  We found that galaxy abundance gradients do not have a universal slope as previously claimed.  Rather they depend upon galaxy stellar mass. In low mass galaxies, gradients are flat (there is no change in the O/H ratio with radius.)  Gradients become steeper on average with increasing stellar mass.  However, a closer look at individual galaxies more massive than the Milky Way reveals a variety of gradients, ranging from flat to steep.  We aim to explore the root causes of gradient variations at fixed stellar mass as the MaNGA sample increases in size over the next few years.  This empirical study provides an important new benchmark for the next generation of galaxy evolution models.     Broader Impacts:  A key challenge in broadly disseminating the results of this research is explaining how MaNGA obtains spectra and how spectra are used to learn about galaxies.  We have begun designing a outreach exhibit to elucidate these concepts. The exhibit is highly interactive and makes use of real MaNGA hardware and data.
