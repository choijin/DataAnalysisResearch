<AbstractNarration>Non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas are a new and fascinating type of a plasma that has tremendous potential in medicine and nanotechnology. Our understanding of the atmospheric microplasmas and the nature of the plasma interaction with biological matter is very limited. In this project, we will, in particular, advance the knowledge of atmospheric microplasmas relevant for medical applications. This research program will serve as a vehicle for undergraduate and graduate education in the field of plasma science.  The PIs will make a concerted effort to involve women and under-represented minority students in this project by working closely with the relevant student organizations at George Washington University. To recruit women, the Society of Women Engineers will be contacted and informed of the project activities. In addition, undergraduate students will be engaged in the research through the Work Study program or a Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement. The experience will impart them with the knowledge and the skills to excel in independent academic or industry careers they pursue after completing their education. The educational plan for this project also aims to generate interest in science and technology in the area of plasma science and bioengineering and to reach out to K-12 teachers, school children and their parents. In particular, we plan to interact with local schools in the Metropolitan DC area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central objective of this project is to understand the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas with a view towards biological applications. To this end we will develop and implement a wide range of new diagnostic methodologies and tools applicable for atmospheric microplasmas. The overall project will address the ionization mechanism, energy balance and conditions for streamer propagation as well as effects related to overvoltage. This project has both fundamental and technological significance. The fundamental significance of this project is in understanding the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas. To this end a wide spectrum of diagnostic instrumentation for atmospheric pressure microplasmas will be developed. Availability of this instrumentation has critical importance for the future progress of the field of atmospheric microplasmas. Enabled by these advances, the technological significance lies in exploring the wide range of applications of atmospheric microplasmas, such as plasma medicine and nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
