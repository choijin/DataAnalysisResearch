<AbstractNarration>Dr. Melodie French has been granted an NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at the University of Maryland, College Park. She will use experimental methods to characterize the effects of pore fluid pressure on slip processes in subduction zone rocks. Geophysical observations indicate that high fluid pressures occur in regions of subduction zones characterized by slow slip, which is behavior intermediate between standard seismicity and steady creep. Despite the fact that slow slip likely increases shear stress on the seismogenic plate boundary and may contribute to the nucleation of destructive earthquakes, little is known about the effects of very high fluid pressure on slip processes at the relevant pressure and temperature conditions. The results of this research program will constrain the processes that cause slow slip in subduction zones. Undergraduate students will be included in the execution of the research as part of their senior thesis requirements. In addition to working with students on the technical aspects of the research, Dr. French will mentor students in fulfilling requirements that develop their scientific communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismic hazards associated with slow slip include (1) triggered seismicity along the updip seismogenic portion of subduction zones and (2) downdip and landward propagation of a seismic slip event. The focus of this work is to determine the micro-mechanisms of slow slip, and to provide constitutive relations that can be used to model seismic hazards associated with slow slip events. To accomplish these goals, Dr. French will conduct a set of experimental studies to document faulting and slip under the temperature and stress conditions that slow slip occurs. The effects of both high and increasing pore fluid pressure on failure rates, stress drops, and strength will be determined in antigorite-rich serpentinite. A set of novel experimental stress paths will be employed to test published and new hypotheses on the stabilizing effects of pore fluid. In addition to the experimental work, detailed microstructural analyses will characterize and quantify the deformation mechanisms that cause slow slip behavior.</AbstractNarration>
