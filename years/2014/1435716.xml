<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Delaware State University seeks to enhance the undergraduate chemistry program in by infusing sustainable chemistry concepts in courses and laboratories, with the goal to  increase recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of chemistry majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the project are to: 1) develop a course and laboratory in sustainable chemistry; 2) infuse sustainability and green chemistry concepts in the existing chemistry undergraduate curriculum; 3) integrate learning with hands-on sustainable chemistry research experiences; 4) promote sustainable chemistry awareness at the university; and 5) widely disseminate the results of the project. The project is projected to impact all undergraduate chemistry majors at Delaware State University. The project will create knowledge related to how undergraduate students learn chemistry when the subject is taught in the context of green chemistry, environmental stewardship, climate change, food security and other aspects of sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through a combined effect of media, family and school education, today?s college students are aware of sustainability as a global value. With growing public concern over water, food, and energy security, complemented by the need for waste management, students are motivated to learn how human actions related to chemical processes affect the health of our planet. From a concept perspective, sustainable chemistry entails the design of new chemical processes and/or re-design old chemical processes toward eliminating non-toxic/non-hazardous materials and products, reducing waste, and conserve energy. Through this project, students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) had the opportunity to learn and apply sustainable chemistry concepts. The project had established five main goals that have been accomplished through the various project?s activities. The project goals span from classroom interactions to laboratory modules, internship opportunities and campus and community outreach, as follows.  1. Enhance chemistry department offering through a sustainable chemistry course/laboratory.  2. Infuse sustainability and green chemistry concepts in the existing chemistry undergraduate curriculum.  3. Integrate learning with hands-on sustainable chemistry research experiences.  4. Promote sustainable chemistry awareness at DSU.  5. Widely disseminate items 1-4 so that others can easily follow our example. Five groups of project activities (PAs) have been developed and implemented toward reaching these goals and have seamlessly integrated sustainability infusion with students? recruitment, retention and job placement. The first group of activities (PA1) focused on development and implementation of a new chemistry course, Sustainable Chemistry, which covers a large area of experiments with emphasis on chemical practice of sustainable chemistry concepts. The course was structured in six units, comprising biomass/biofuels, solar energy, nanomaterials fabrication, biopolymers and global impact of safe water and clean soil, followed by students? presentation of a course paper. Students have selected and presented on a large variety of topics, including: Biofuels, Polymers from Renewable Resources, Green Solvents, Chemicals from Biomass, CO2 Sequestration, Green Catalysts Development, Hydrogen Production, Recycling Paper, Recycling Bio-Plastics, and Efficient Water Purification. Course evaluation along with class discussions have highlighted the ability of students to formulate solutions for global problems, develop their critical thinking, and apply a holistic approach to problem solving. The second group of activities targeted curricular enhancements and comprised interventions aimed to transform the existing departmental curriculum by infusing chemistry concepts into existing course/laboratory components.  The third and the fourth group of activities involved short-term projects in the context of internships, capstone projects and undergraduate research. Fifteen students have been directly involved in these experiential learning interventions and the outcomes reflected the success of this approach, resulting in three peer-reviewed journal articles, two conference presentation and awards to both students and project team.  The last group of activities aimed to increase sustainability awareness in campus and multiple events have highlighted participation of our students at DSU events (including Research Day, Assessment Summit, Earth Day, Honors Day, Undergraduate Research Symposium).  In regard to intellectual merit, the project developed a new set of educational interventions along with developing innovative synthetic methodologies that lead to novel materials and processes such as a new method to synthesize a solar material and the fabrication of a novel enzymatic catalyst.   In regard to broader impacts, resonant with the national need to broaden the diversity of the STEM workforce, one of the missions of DSU, an HBCU, is the training of groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, women, and students with low socio-economic backgrounds. A large majority of our STEM students are from underrepresented groups&ndash;67% African-American and 5% Hispanic. Out of total enrolled STEM students, 62% are women.

The project results have been widely disseminated through presentations at national conferences and through peer-reviewed journal articles.
