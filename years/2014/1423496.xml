<AbstractNarration>Effective communication of science to the public by scientists is a desired and sought after attribute. This project which is working with graduate and undergraduate students in Physics will determine what interventions are best in assessing communication and attitudinal capacities in this cadre. Further, the project will determine what strategies are best at remediation. Finally, the successes will be generalized with regard to interventions and remediation to other Physics programs across the country and perhaps to other disciplines in the STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a variety of factors that contribute to effective communications with public audiences. Some of those factors include audience characteristics and teacher/mentor capabilities. This project will ascertain the issues in the latter teacher/mentor capacities. They will assess the mentor's baseline skills regarding communication, teaching and emergent attitudes. These are considered separately as each contributes uniquely to the effectiveness of communication. In the communications skills section, the objective will be to determine initially if the mentors are using any one of the following models: deficit, meaning the mentor is the expert and the participants are not informed; dialogue, where there is more back and forth between mentor and participant; and finally participatory interactions, where there is full integration of participant and mentor ideas. Once the baseline is established, the investigators will introduce mechanisms for remedial intervention with the student mentors to determine if and what types of changes can be made to improve communication directed toward public understanding of STEM concepts and ideas. Finally, the researchers will seek to determine if these interventions have affects beyond the immediate challenges such as career discussions, participation in classes and/or written products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we have characterized the impacts of participation in informal physics programs on university students? professional development. This work specifically focused on one approach to informal education where undergraduate and graduate physics students regularly partner with K-8 children by collaboratively conducting hands-on physics experiments in a weekly afterschool program.   This effort has focused on a case study of the Partnerships for Informal Science Education in the Community (PISEC) program run jointly by the University of Colorado and the JILA Physics Frontier Center.   The outcomes of this project have focused on the development and study of a model that broadens what it means to be a physics educator, what it means to study physics, and what role informal physics programs can have in the development of physicists.  Prior to this project there was little structure to consider how participating in informal physics environments impacted university members.  The model developed over the course of this project demonstrates that teaching, communication, and identity are crucial components of the growth of university physics students through their experiences as educators in informal environments.  These studies have resulted in two concrete frameworks - one for teaching physics in an afterschool environment and one for understanding physics identity through racial identity.  Looking at the theme of teaching, we found that physics students make different instructional moves that frame the afterschool environment as either more teacher- or more student- centered, which in turn affects how youth perceive scientific authority. We characterized how certain pedagogical strategies can either help guide students towards the activity or further distance them from engaging in the activity. Looking at the theme of identity, we operationalized a physics and racial identity framework from interviews with physics students about their informal and formal physics experiences.  From this analysis, we find patterns in the data that show connections between specific identity constructs and connections to informal learning experiences both as a participant and as an educator.
