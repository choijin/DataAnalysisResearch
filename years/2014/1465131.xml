<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Thomas Lectka of Johns Hopkins University is developing new chemical methods focused on site-selective fluorination to produce chemically interesting products not easily accessible by other means.  At Johns Hopkins, Professor Lectka, supervises a research group that contains predominately undergraduates.  In addition, graduate students are participants in the K-12 educational outreach program and also the Chemistry Olympiad; in a separate program offered by Hopkins called LEAD, two grad students spend time mentoring inner-city Baltimore middle school students twice a week in science and math.  In summary, the P.I. plans to continue a track record of educating underrepresented minority groups (especially African-American and Hispanic undergraduates) for the foreseeable future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operational simplicity, low catalyst loadings (where applicable), mutual compatibility, mild conditions, and broad scope are the fundamental goals.  The recent, widespread interest in fluorine chemistry stems primarily from the utility of fluorinated compounds as pharmaceuticals.  Nearly one quarter of the top pharmaceuticals on the market contain fluorine, placing synthetic fluorination methods, particularly those amenable to late-stage functionalization, among the most valuable warheads in the arsenal of the medicinal chemist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most important project outcomes of this award involved new ways to attach fluorine to complex organic molecules.  Fluorine is a special element; it is the most electronegative atom (that is it craves negatively charged electrons) and when attached to an organic molecule (that is one containing a carbon skeleton) it changes the molecule's properties in interesting and useful ways.  Our studies concentrated on developing new ways to convert certain hydrocarbon (C-H bonds) into C-F bonds.  Many types of C-H bonds exist, within different chemical environments in organic molecules, so we strove to transform only one of them selectively.  We insisted that these new methods be safe and easy to use, in contrast to the use of fluorine gas itself, which is difficult to handle and highly toxic.  We also expended much effort into understanding how the reactions occur (their mechanisms).  This understanding led to several new publications concerning improvements in fluorination methods.  In total, well over a dozen publications resulted from the funding of this grant, all in prestigious chemistry journals.   In tandem, we also investigated the special properties of fluorine when contained within highly unusual organic structures.  Namely, how would these strange new environments affect fluorine's properties?  The answers to these questions have allowed us to understand fluorine's remarkable properties more thoroughly.  Finally, this award has permitted the training of several graduate students and over a dozen undergraduates, many of whom have chosen to proceed with a career in science.  The techniques that they learned while working on this project should form an excellent basis for their newfound advanced scientific inquiries in industry, graduate school, and medical school.  In associated outreach programs, the P.I. and his students also introduced the wonders of organic chemistry to local high schoolers and new undergraduates.
