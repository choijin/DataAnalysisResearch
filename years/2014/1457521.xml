<AbstractNarration>Considerable uncertainty exists about the effects of changing climates on the distributions of plants and animals. Most studies of recent climate change on species' geographic ranges are based on projections from computer models rather than measured responses from field studies. This research takes a very different and multi-tiered approach by using historical records and specimens with the necessary precision, geographic and temporal scale, and magnitude of observed climate change to produce important insights into the direct and indirect effects of climatic and nonclimatic factors on changes in species' geographic distributions. This research will resurvey field sites in the southwest United States last surveyed more than 70 years ago, which will not only advance our understanding of environmental changes but will establish a new benchmark for comparison of future changes. Federal land-management agencies will benefit from greater knowledge of the status of sensitive species and wildlife responses to climate change. Specimens and audio recordings collected will be available for ancillary studies. Results will be extended broadly to the public through talks, popular press and media, and museum displays, including new exhibits of the San Diego Natural History Museum and the Oakland Museum of California. The National Park Service Science and Education Office will distribute results widely through videos and podcasts to train their interpreters on the biological effects of environmental change and to provide interpretive materials for their visitor centers. Undergraduates, graduate student and postdoctoral researchers will participate in this study, learning field and lab techniques, natural history, physiological methods and modeling. Results and data will be shared with scientists and the general public through websites and online databases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will resurvey sites that were sampled from 1908-1945 to examine the impact of 20th century climate change on small mammal and bird communities in Sonoran, Mojave, and Great Basin deserts. These areas have warmed greatly over the last 50 years, with the average annual temperatures increasing up to 2Â°C. The research will advance understanding of animal responses to climate change by: developing new models that mechanistically project species' ranges by linking climate through important physiological thresholds of temperature and water stress; developing novel tests to examine whether climate change results in species shifting their geographic ranges individually or whether whole communities of species shift similarly; and testing if body sizes and diets of species have responded to climate change. Birds and mammals will be resurveyed at 105 sites. Both audio and physical voucher specimens will be collected and made available for future reanalysis. Standard morphological data will be collected for birds and mammal skulls. Ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes will be measured from tissues. Multispecies occupancy models will account for detectability in historical and current surveys to develop unbiased estimators of local colonization and extinction of species and changes in community composition in response to site-level characteristics. Measures of thermal and hydric stress at and above the upper limit of the thermal neutral zone will be made for 12 species of mammals to develop models of heat stress that can be validated.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project advanced theory and understanding of responses of birds and mammals to recent climate change in the Mojave Desert, by resurveying sites with a historic baseline and quantifying faunal changes over the past century. Ecophysiology modeling found the rodent community relatively stable but the bird community collapsing over the last century of climate change in the Mojave Desert. Differences in exposure are due primarily to birds' higher cooling costs and differences in microhabitats.</p> <p>As part of this collaboration between scientists at UC Berkeley, the San Diego Natural History Museum (SDNHM), University of New Mexico, and UC Santa Cruz, from 2015 to 2019 the SDNHM resurveyed birds and mammals at 14 sites in Joshua Tree National Park (JOTR), 14 in Mojave National Preserve (MOJA), and 4 on land under the jurisdiction of the BLM. The resulting 5,943 records of birds represent 186 species, the 5,868 of mammals 59 species. Integrating results from 20 sites previously resurveyed in the San Jacinto Mountains, SDNHM is providing interpretation of faunal changes within a natural history context through detailed species accounts drawing heavily from historic field notes.</p> <p>Our SDNHM resurveys revealed notable range expansions and/or increases in MOJA of the Zone-tailed Hawk (<em>Buteo albonotatus</em>), Gilded Flicker (<em>Colaptes chrysoides</em>), Black-tailed Gnatcatcher (<em>Polioptila melanura</em>), Crissal Thrasher (<em>Toxostoma crissale</em>), Rufous-crowned Sparrow (<em>Aimophila ruficeps</em>), and western harvest mouse (<em>Reithrodontomys megalotis</em>). However, in JOTR, declines were more frequent, primarily in shrub and woodland species, including 9 of birds plus the chipmunk <em>Tamias obscurus</em>. These changes appear correlated with increased cover of grass, shrubs, cacti, and Joshua trees in MOJA, and with a decrease in pinyon-juniper woodland in JOTR.&nbsp;A spread of the California Towhee east into JOTR represents the single counterexample in that area.</p> <p>Although many species showed northward or upslope range shifts as expected from climate warming, partly on the basis of these resurveys and taking a broader view of range shifts, we identified 52 nesting bird species whose southern California ranges have expanded southward or downslope over the past century (<a href="https://westernfieldornithologists.org/docs/2020/Avifaunal_Change/Unitt-Hargrove/Unitt-Hargrove-Avifaunal_Change.pdf">https://westernfieldornithologists.org/docs/2020/Avifaunal_Change/Unitt-Hargrove/Unitt-Hargrove-Avifaunal_Change.pdf</a>). Aquatic species, montane species, and urban adapters account for most of these range shifts in opposition to the force of climate change, facilitated by the importation and management of water, urbanization, and possibly the increasing density of montane forests-- factors more directly related to human modification of the environment than to climate change.</p> <p>Analysis of 77 mammal species based on our resurveys of the San Jacinto Mountains and Mojave Desert, together with other published data, has revealed that, of 7 species reaching southern range limits in our study areas, 3 have undergone major northward retractions.

Although these range shifts are consistent with expectations from a warming climate, unknown other factors likely contributed. Two other chipmunks have declined steeply, not only <em>Tamias obscurus</em> in JOTR but also <em>Tamias panamintinus </em>in MOJA.
