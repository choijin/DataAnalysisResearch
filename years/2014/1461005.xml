<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Baker University, Baldwin City, KS, in collaboration with the California Academy of Science, San Francisco, CA, will support the training of eight students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2017. The program offers students with and without ambulatory disability (on crutches or in wheelchairs) the opportunity to conduct original research into the world of water bears (phylum Tardigrada) and the ecological mysteries of the high frontier of the forest canopy. Students will be trained to climb ropes and sample treetop habitats to discover new distributions, ecologies, and species. They will use advanced microscopes (PC, DIC, AF, SEM) to amass the data and images necessary for analysis, presentation, and publication. Student researchers will travel to alternative forest types at LTER sites in Florida, Massachusetts, or Oregon to collect comparative data. Students will complete the research process with a poster presentation at the California Academy of Science, where they will also engage in public outreach by teaching climbing techniques used to sample the tree canopy. The three-dimensional, comparative ecological studies of tardigrades living in forest canopies will shed light on both the distribution of these organisms and the complexity of underexplored temperate forests.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities and who may have ambulatory disabilities will be trained in the program. Students will be immersed in research design, planning, conduct, analysis and reporting. All will present their work as posters and talks at scientific meetings, and many will write manuscripts for peer reviewed journals. Our results-orientated REU experience will motivate students, with or without a disability, to pursue graduate degrees and will enhance their careers as they become educators, scientists, and leaders of thought. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The common web-based assessment tool for REU programs (funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure) will be used to measure the effectiveness of the training program. Students must agree to be tracked after the program by the NSF automated email reporting system.  Information is available at www.bakeru.edu/canopy, or by contacting William Miller (William.Miller@BakerU.edu) or Meg Lowman (mlowman@calacademy.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In 2011, W.R.Miller, M.D.Lowman and E.McCord developed a successful pilot REU program (#115650) to explore the canopy of Kansas for tardigrades with opportunity for students with ambulatory disability. The current program is based on the discovery of great numbers of tardigrades in the canopy of deciduous forests. Our REU site program (#141005) was titled "3D Herbivory and Biodiversity of Tardigrades in North American Forest Canopies: Inspiring Students with Physical Disabilities to Pursue Field Biology". It was a collaborative project between Baker University and the California Academy of Sciences with a core objective of teaching the process of research to undergraduates. We offered a physically challenging and rigorous research experience in field ecology and discovery in the high frontier of the canopy. We knew from personal experience that, given equal opportunity, students with ambulatory disabilities can collect and process samples as well as any student. We further partnered the mobility-limited students with ambulatory students to insure real-world cohorts and maximize inclusivity in our student teams. We expanded the original pilot discovery of canopy tardigrades into the unexplored canopy of different forest types across the continent. We chose locations at Long Term Environmental Research (LTER) and NEON (National Environmental Observation Network) sites based on ecoregion, forest type and facilities. We selected the nearby University of Kansas Field Station (NEON site) and the Baker Wetlands as training sites and traveled in 2015 to Ordway-Swisher Biological Station and LTER/NEON site in Florida, in 2016 to the Harvard Research Forest and LTER/NEON site in Massachusetts, and in 2017 to the H.J.Andrews Experimental Forest and LTER in Oregon. The project combined our collective PI experience in canopy exploration, tardigrades and two years of REU management (pilot). Students tested hypotheses about the taxonomy, diversity, density, distribution, and complexity of tardigrade ecology in the unexplored temperate forest canopy. Each year, our students were professionally trained in tree climbing, tardigrade research, and research ethics at Baker University. Each student developed a research project within the core project as we explored the oak-hickory forest of eastern Kansas. Then the team took a field trip to one of the other forest types to collect habitat samples, but returned to Baker to process the samples, identify the specimens, and analyze the data. The students expanded their cohort experience with a trip to California to visit a coastal Douglas fir-Redwood forest and then conduct an outreach component at the California Academy of Sciences. There they presented seminars about their research and at led "Water Bear Hunts" for more than 2,000 museum visitors each year. Students used the summers experience to subsequently develop posters and talks for regional and national meetings. Our students developed a three-dimensional experimental design based on vertical transects into multiple species of trees in under explored forest types to ascertain unknown ecological relationships and discover new species. Students learned the complete research process from asking questions which do not yet have answers, through field collection, data generation, analysis, and report writing. Many students are or will soon be published in peer reviewed journals. We collected in five states at 58 sites and up to 1,500 meters elevation. We climber 492 trees of 29 species, collected 3,575 habitat samples of moss and lichens of 34 species, up to 30 meters into the canopy. We extracted 28,384 tardigrades of 37 different species, discovered at least eight new species to science and recorded 26 species new to their state. A tardigrade display was installed at the Baker Wetlands Discovery Center to document new species. Students have produced and presented posters and talks for three regional meetings, two national conferences and an international symposium. They have published 13 records and&nbsp; produced five peer reviewed publications during this project. Research Gate, the research tracking site, reports that our papers have been read and requested hundreds of time by students and researchers around the world. Our students and PIs continue to develop papers describing new species, recording new canopy ecology and defining new distributional records which will be published in the coming years. Our project supported NSF initiatives to motivate students, with or without disability, to pursue graduate degrees. of our 22 students, half are in graduate school, two in medical school, one was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and two are doing tardigrade masters. The grant, research and publications have enhanced the careers of the PIs and demonstrated that designed original research can be achieved at small undergraduate institutions. Our students take their research experiences into their future lives as graduate students, educators, scientists and eventually leaders of thought. Finally, the results of our three-dimensional ecological studies have shed light into the complexity of the under-explored canopy of our temperate forests and spurred insights into their critical role as the land-air interfaced of our changing planet.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/26/2018<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;R&nbsp;Miller</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
