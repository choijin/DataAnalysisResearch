<AbstractNarration>The Rochester Institute of Technology will implement a small focused research project that is designed to provide a better understanding of how academic content and communication skills transfer into the entry-level workforce. It is adapting foundational research on learning in an academic setting to the workplace and provides multiple perspectives of the "skills gap" between higher education and the workplace.  Specifically, the researchers propose to examine the use of mathematics, optics, and physics content knowledge and communication skills within the Rochester-region optics, photonics, and imaging community.  They will conduct two interrelated studies. The first study will produce evidence about the skills required to obtain, keep, and succeed at a job in optics with immediate relevance to local colleges and universities focused on optics education. The second study will expand on the first by examining the employee perspective in more detail. The PIs will use data-based deduction research to integrate the two studies within a higher education framework. The project will reveal differences in skill sets between academia and industry and provide evidence regarding whether or not a common curricula can serve each path.  Rochester is an ideal location for the study. Xerox, Kodak, and Bausch and Lomb made Rochester the optics and imaging hub in the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project conducted research at the intersection of classroom instruction, discipline-based education research on STEM learning, and preparing the STEM workforce. Although many researchers are studying learning in STEM, very few are directly connecting their research to STEM workplaces and careers. This project collected over 50 interviews with companies (including management and entry-level employees) as well as PhD researchers and their faculty advisors. By examining mathematics, problem-solving and communication within these professional settings in industry and academia, we can guide a backward design process that will help departments in physics and related fields better prepare students for career success. Throughout this project we have observed the significant influence of the workplace context on problem-solving and communication. Context includes the goals of a team or company, the community of people and how they work together, and the tools they use.</p> <p>Although students in math and physics courses frequently get practice with relatively short "back of the chapter" problems, our research identified a surprisingly diverse range of problem-types in professional settings. These included conceptual model-building, computational model-building, design modeling, root-cause analysis (troubleshooting), data analysis problems, and fabrication and testing. These problems utilized a diverse range of representations (e.g., symbolic mathematics, computer code, formulas within a spreadsheet, data tables and graphs) in a diverse range of contexts (e.g., experimenting, designing, using software, and manufacturing). Our findings highlight the need to emphasize diverse problem-types within physics and mathematics instruction. In addition to being more reflective of professional work, teaching diverse problem types has been associated with developing a more flexible expertise. The problems identified in industry and research were always linked to some a clear goal (e.g., build an experiment to make a measurement, design a product), whereas undergraduate problem-solving is often abstract and disconnected from a real-world context. Our research suggests educators should create more realistic contexts for instruction as a means to diversify problem-types and the representations and tools needed to solve them.</p> <p>We also applied our data to K-12 instruction by looking for authentic examples of science and engineering practices within optics and photonics workplaces. By identifying and contextualizing these practices we can see how they integrate together and can form the basis for lessons that teach students how to do science in addition to teaching the concepts of science.</p> <p>Our research on communication utilized an approach known as Communication in the Disciplines, which seeks to develop communication training that is authentic and integrated within a particular discipline (e.g., physics). Currently, many undergraduate science programs emphasize communication training that is between students and faculty or between students in the same field. Sometimes programs also emphasize communication with the general public. However, the most ubiquitous communication situations in industry were between people with varied areas of expertise. These situations arose on interdisciplinary teams, cross-functional teams, or instances when engineers interacted with customers, managers, or the fabricators responsible for building their designs. We referred to these situations as "cross-occupational communication," and we note that there are very few opportunities in most undergraduate science programs to gain experience with cross-occupational communication.</p> <p>During this project the research team developed expertise in studying workforce development for advanced STEM fields. The team applied their methods toward two other emerging technologies: integrated photonics (micro-scale circuits for light) and quantum information science and technology. The systematic approach of starting with employer interviews, characterizing the diverse skills sets, and understanding what training should happen in college versus on-the-job has proven useful for guiding education efforts in these other fields.</p> <p>This project has also galvanized a regional community of optics educators, which includes high school teachers, career and technical educators, and faculty at community colleges, primarily undergraduate institutions, and research universities. The community formed through this project is dedicated to increasing participation in optics courses and degree programs and supporting local industry through educating students about career opportunities in optics.</p> <p>A good STEM education is often promoted as a means for prosperity for individuals, communities, and our nation. This research has contributed to our understanding of how higher education transfers into a workplace context, and also how companies often play an essential role in the training of new employees. Our research points away from a "skills gap" narrative and points toward constructive ways in which higher education and companies both can play an essential role in developing the STEM workforce. By uncovering the factors that lead to workplace success and providing practical implications for teaching, we are helping to create more transparent pathways into STEM careers for all students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/20/2019<br>      Modified by: Benjamin&nbsp;Zwickl</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432578/1432578_10318307_1576874755835_Intersection--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432578/1432578_10318307_1576874755835_Intersection--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Intersection of DBER, Instruction, and Workforce Development"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432578/1432578_10318307_1576874755835_Intersection--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Intersection of DBER, Instruction, and Workforce Development"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This project sought to directly link discipline-based education research and classroom instruction with workforce development for STEM fields, particularly optics and photonics.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kelly Martin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Benjamin&nbsp;Zwickl</div> <div class="imageTitle">Intersection of DBER, Instruction, and Workforce Development</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432578/1432578_10318307_1576874893740_NGSSPracticesVectorGraphic_5.svg--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432578/1432578_10318307_1576874893740_NGSSPracticesVectorGraphic_5.svg--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Science and Engineering Practices in Workplace Contexts"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1432578/1432578_10318307_1576874893740_NGSSPracticesVectorGraphic_5.svg--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Science and Engineering Practices in Workplace Contexts"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A network map showing how the eight science and engineering practices from the Next Generation Science Standards were found in various workplace contexts.
