<AbstractNarration>Dating brittle fault slip is a research frontier essential for characterizing numerous upper crustal processes. Direct, robust, and efficiently obtained timing constraints are necessary to reconstruct structural-tectonic histories, mountain building processes, and landscape evolution, as well as to document ancient seismicity histories to assess modern seismic hazards, earthquake forecasting, and fault mechanics. However, direct dating of fault activity in the upper crust is challenging due to limited applicable radioisotopic techniques, and few robust geologic indicators of past seismic slip exist in the rock record. This project tests a new potentially transformative method to directly date fault slip by using the (U-Th)/He on iron oxide coatings on fault surfaces collected from active and ancient faults as well as explores the chemistry and physics underpinning the method. The project advances desired societal outcomes through: (1) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology through contributions to traveling displays for K-12 students, development and presentation of elementary school educational modules, participation in university outreach activities, and development of projects and lessons for northern Utah home-schooled students; (2) development of a globally competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate and undergraduate students; (3) increased partnerships with other academic institutions and the U.S. Geological Survey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal research objective of this project is to develop hematite (U-Th)/He geochronology as a method to directly date fault slip. (U-Th)/He dates from hematite-coated fault surfaces record brittle deformation events by constraining the timing of either synkinematic hematite formation or the rapid cooling from frictional heating during faulting. In some cases, these dates may track regional cooling, yielding a new tool to quantify tectonic exhumation or erosion linked to broader fault zone evolution. This method is tested on three active or ancient fault systems in the North American Cordillera: the northern Wasatch fault zone in Utah; faults in the central Colorado Front Range; and the eastern Denali fault zone in the Yukon. The project involves: (1) macroscopic characterization and structural analysis of hematite-coated faults and microscopic determination of hematite occurrence, texture, and grain size; (2) characterization of He diffusivity from 4He/3He diffusion experiments; (3) targeted (U-Th)/He dating of hematite-coated faults at each locale including multiple samples from the same fault surface; (4) development of independent constraints on fault surface thermal histories using transition metal paleothermometry from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 4He/3He thermochronometry; and (5) establishment of independent constraints on fault activity timing using U-Pb dating and existing 40Ar/39Ar illite age data of related synkinematic calcite and clay-rich fault gouge, respectively, and regional cooling patterns from host-rock apatite (U-Th)/He and fission track data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Iron oxide minerals like hematite (Fe2O3) and goethite (FeO(OH)) are commonly found in faults and fractures in Earth?s shallow crust, where they are formed by reactions between percolating fluids and surrounding rocks. The ages, compositions, textures, and other characteristics of these minerals have the potential to provide information on the history of faulting, groundwater flow, and other geologic phenomena. Our project developed 1) methods for dating these minerals using the (U-Th)/He system, 2) methods for determining the temperatures, pressures, and compositions of the fluids from which they precipitated, and 3) interpretations of geologic histories based on results of applying these methods.  One of our findings from this study is the first direct dating of clastic sandstone dikes that were injected into ancient crystalline basement. By using a novel technique of dating hematite crystals of different sizes we were able to determine both the crystallization/formation age of these rocks as about 700 million years old (during the worldwide "snowball Earth" Sturtian glaciation), as well as the subsequent thermal history of these rocks through multiple mountain-building and burial events. In addition, our infrared fluid-inclusion examination and experiments determined that these units formed in from saline fluids that were about 200-225 degrees Celsius.  Another one of our findings from this study is the determination that hematite crystals in deep (1-2 km) bedrock fractures in Sweden that are associated with enormous sulfur isotope fractionation indicating ancient microbial communities crystallized about 400 million years ago.  Other findings from our project included 1) dating hematite precipitated along major faults that allow geologists to better interpret the rock record of past earthquakes, 2) using hematite dating to understand ancient hydrothermal fluid flow events that have altered and reset magnetic and isotopic signatures in sedimentary rocks, and 3) using iron oxide dating to date the timing of oxidation and recrystallization of pyrite in rocks.  Our results will be used in future studies to provide more geochronologic and thermochronologic dating of secondary oxide minerals in faults and fractures in Earth?s shallow crust. Combining these dates with isotopic, chemical, and textural characteristics of these minerals will provide constraints on a variety of geologic phenomena including ancient seismicity and paleohydrology.
