<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical and computational research and education directed towards a transformative acceleration of progress in our understanding of complex materials, which show prominent competitions of quantum mechanical effects such as strong electron interaction, magnetism and superconductivity.  For simpler materials for which the physical properties can be accurately represented in terms of a system of independent particles in the presence of an average potential, methods based on Density Functional Theory have enabled large-scale simulations of realistic systems with high accuracy. For materials in which electrons interact strongly and the "independent-particle" picture is not as reliable, the so-called Dynamical Mean Field Theory method has enabled practical and accurate calculations of their basic properties.  This project is aimed at developing a number of new theoretical tools, which can be used in combination with electronic structure tools based on Dynamical Mean Field Theory to enable theoretical prediction of material properties without using empirical parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enable the construction of a predictive framework for describing the physical properties of materials in which electron-electron interactions play a very important role. The tools and codes developed in this project will allow one to theoretically characterize complex materials, which will lead to improved scientific understanding of quantum many-body effects, and will provide a basis for harnessing such effects to develop functional materials such as strong magnets and novel superconductors. The educational component of this project involves the training of the next generation of scientists in an interdisciplinary environment at the intersection of theoretical physics, computational physics, and materials science. The PI will also be involved in public outreach activities by mentoring and providing summer research experiences for high school students through the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To search for new materials with enhanced physical properties it is crucial to develop capabilities for computational characterization of a material. This award supports theoretical and computational research and education directed toward developing a number of theoretical spectroscopic tools, which can be used in combination with electronic structure tools based on Dynamical Mean Field Theory to enable theoretical prediction of material properties using first principles methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectroscopic tools to be developed will be used for (i) computing dynamical structure factors measured in neutron spectroscopy experiments, (ii) predicting the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in unconventional superconductors, (iii) Auger spectroscopy, which can be used to measure the strength of correlations and to theoretically estimate the strength of the Coulomb interaction, (iv) Raman spectroscopy which can identify the low frequency excitations of the solid, and (v) computing the free energy of a solid for studying phase transitions at finite temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enable the construction of a predictive framework for describing the physical properties of correlated materials.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The work carried out in this project contributed substantially to the development of the advanced abinitio electronic structure method, which implements the combination of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). We have provided the community with the practical and efficient implementation of this electronic structure method (see http://hauleweb.rutgers.edu/tutorials/index.html) as well as developed several fundamental building blocks of the algorithm.<br />For example, we developed the exact double-counting between the DMFT and DFT methods[1], which was a &nbsp;fundamental problem in the algorithm, and was often cited as the most crucial problem in the field. We have shown in Ref.1 that the double-counting can be derived exactly from a solution of the uniform electron gas problem, in which electrons interact with the DMFT screened interaction. The implementation of this formula allowed us to improve significantly the precision of the algorithm, as the double-counting determines the valence of the correlated ion, and we showed that in several systems, only this new formula can predict from ab-initio the experimentally realized valence, for example, Ni-d<sup>8</sup> in rare earth nickelates[2] (see Fig.1).&nbsp;<br />We have recently derived and implemented analytic formulas for forces that act on all atoms in the unit cell in a given crystal structure[3], which allows one to describe the feedback effect of strong correlations on structural properties of solids. This opened an entirely new direction in the field, as now one can optimize the structure within DMFT, and predict very precise positions of atoms in many correlated materials, for example across the Mott transition in the rare earth nickelates[2], reproduced in Fig.1.<br />Moreover, we showed in Ref.4 that the phonon spectra of correlated solids can now be predicted, and one can address for example the fundamental problem of phonon dynamics in the presence of local moments versus ordered magnetic moments. Namely, within the standard electronic structure methods, one can only describe magnetic moments in the long-range ordered state, which is fundamentally different from the high-temperature fluctuating moment state, such as realized in elemental iron at high temperature[4].<br />We also developed modules to compute various spectroscopic quantities, for example, the magnetic excitation spectra as measured by neutron scattering[5]. The theoretical calculation was carried out for a large class of iron superconductors[5], and it was shown that the predicted magnetic response is in good agreement with experiment (see Fig.2). &nbsp;This method also allowed us to predict a candidate superconducting order parameter in iron superconductors, and in some of the most studied representatives like LiFeAs, a novel orbital-antiphase state was most stable, which was missed by both the weak and the strong coupling theories.[5]<br />&nbsp;Elemental Pu, and in particular its delta-phase, has a unique position in the periodic table because it is located exactly at the boundary between the itinerant and localized behavior. Back in 2007 we argued on the basis of DFT+DMFT, that this uniqueness of Pu is due to its valence fluctuations. &nbsp;In 2015, the group in Los Alamos used neutron spectroscopy to measure the spin excitations in plutonium[6] up to the predicted valence fluctuating scale, and we showed that the moment shows up above this scale. The DFT+DMFT simulations of neutron structure factor were shown to be in excellent agreement with experiment[6] (see Fig.3).<br /><br />In the past, we predicted that the order parameter of the hidden-order state in URu2Si2 is a very high order multipole, namely hexadecapole, which is staggered in real space with the wave vector (0,0,1) (see Fig.4). &nbsp;With Girsh Blumberg and his student Sean Kung we recently showed, analyzing Raman scattering, that the hexadecapole order parameter is indeed present below 17.5K in this material[7], thus confirming our previous prediction. &nbsp;We also showed that the antiferromagnetic and hexadecapole order parameter are intimately related through a common complex order parameter[7], as predicted by DFT+DMFT theory.</p> <p>[1] &nbsp;Exact double-counting in combining the Dynamical Mean Field Theory and the Density Func- tional Theory, Kristjan Haule, Phys.
