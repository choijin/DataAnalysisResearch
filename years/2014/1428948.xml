<AbstractNarration>The aquisition of a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope will greatly enhance the life sciences at Smith College, the nation's largest liberal arts college for women. This microscope will inspire a new generation of scientists through its ability to observe individual molecules in real time, thereby providing an opportunity to go from textbook descriptions of molecules to actually witnessing their behavior and showing how molecular activity leads to the behavior of whole cells. Interdisciplinary research in Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Neuroscience and Physics will include: cellular organization and cargo transport by the molecular motors that allow for cell movement; interactions of molecular motors and their tracks at different stages in muscle and nerve development; time-dependent function of single molecule catalysts; characterization of designed proteins that may inhibit cancer progression; and time-dependent responses of novel polymers designed to react to specific environmental conditions. Finally, the TIRF microscope will facilitate the creation and validation of a low-cost teaching TIRF microscope designed for pedagogical applications and laboratory class exercises. Design plans and materials for this teaching system will be disseminated to colleges and universities throughout the United States as part of Smith College?s substantial community outreach programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently great progress has been made in understanding the biophysics and mechanochemistry of proteins and small molecules. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy is an essential tool enabling this revolution as it enables sub-diffraction-limited single molecule localizations to a precision of ~1 nm. A TIRF microscope at Smith College will enable single molecule research in eight laboratories representing six departments and programs. Research is focused in three areas: 1) mechanochemistry, genetics, and biophysics of the cytoskeleton, 2) single molecule mechanisms of chemical polymerization and catalysis, and 3) engineered proteins and their interactions within cells. Several cytoskeleton projects will delve into understanding the motor proteins dynein, kinesin, and myosin and how they interact with one another and their microtubule and microfilament tracks. Investigations of how anesthetics catalyze cytoskeletal rearrangement in neurons and how kinesin inhibitors alter radial glial cells in development will also be conducted. The molecular level dynamics of peptide interactions and how these interactions affect the macroscopic mechanical attributes of polymers of these peptides will be studied.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With our proposal ?MRI: Acquisition of a TIRF microscope? we set out to add the capability of observing single molecules in real time to the instrumentation available in the Center for Microscopy and Imaging at Smith College.  Specifically, we sought to enhance our curriculum and research, as well as create more pedagogical opportunities in the realm of interdisciplinary single molecule science both at Smith and beyond.  The acquisition of this instrument has indeed achieved these goals, with some specific highlights enumerated below.  These goals were achieved by first integrating the newly acquired TIRF microscope into the Smith College Center for Microscopy and Imaging.  Beyond a general core facility, this Center?s main objective is to provide sophisticated research instrumentation for independent use by undergraduates, working on both their own research and the research of their faculty mentors.        Curricular outcomes:  The TIRF microscope is used directly by undergraduates in courses related to cell biology, biochemistry and microscopy.  It is also used to demonstrate principles of these fields and the techniques of single molecule science to visitors to the Center.  In one notable example, students from the course BCH 353 (Biochemical Dynamics Laboratory) purify cytoskeletal motors and characterize their motility on the TIRF system.  In the fall of 2018 we introduced a new Topics in Microscopy course (BIO 314) focused directly on TIRF microscopy and the use of the instrument in student research projects.  This course is now offered every semester.  The instrument is also heavily used by students conducting Special Studies and Honors Thesis research.        Research Outcomes:  The TIRF microscope has been used by undergraduates and faculty to produce data presented at multiple meetings and conferences.  For example, in 2016, three students presented posters and two students gave ?lightning talks? at a Biophysical Society Thematic Meeting on Engineering Molecular Motors.  One faculty member also delivered a submitted research talk at this conference. Overall, data acquired with the TIRF has been presented by faculty in at least 7 poster presentations at major international conferences.  More recent results have also been presented at invited seminars at 3 Universities and Colleges.  One paper has been published, a manuscript is in preparation, and 9 new projects are underway.     Students regularly use the TIRF microscope for research through the academic year and during Smith?s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program.  In the summer of 2018, the TIRF was used an average of 26 hours per week for the 10 week duration of the program.  Currently, 9 research projects are making active use of the system, representing single molecule projects in biophysics, biochemistry, cell biology, super resolution microscopy, biologically inspired nanotechnology and molecular computing.        Pedagogical Outcomes:  As part of our acquisition of this instrument, we also sought to design, build and characterize a low cost (i.e.: less than $20,000) TIRF ?tool kit? system suitable for undergraduate research courses.  We envisioned this system to be constructible by undergraduates during their course and subsequently employed to make single molecule observations with a goal of connecting the microscope technology to its enabling observations of single molecules. This past year, we finalized the design, calibration and characterization of this system. We are currently writing a descriptive and pedagogically themed manuscript for submission in 2019.        In summary, the acquisition of a TIRF microscope has added new capabilities to the resources available at Smith College and nearby institutions (Amherst, Hampshire and Mt Holyoke colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst).  Undergraduate students make active use of this instrument for numerous independent projects in support of collaborative research with faculty mentors and it has enabled new curricular opportunities in a variety of courses.
