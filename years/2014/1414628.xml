<AbstractNarration>Moore's "law", describing the fantastic increase in performance of transistors, the fundamental building block of computers, is approaching fundamental quantum limits of scalability and performance. These hard limits of smallest size and fastest speed coincide with the explosion of demand for electronics, from phones to the data centers underpinning the internet, and the environmental consequences of generating the electricity to power this infrastructure. One possible solution is to develop an alternative transistor based on a completely different physics: manipulation of the spin state of an electron in place of conventional voltage modulation. Over the past decade, an exciting new field of condensed matter physics, topological insulators, has theoretically postulated and experimentally realized a class of materials possessing a non-trivial relationship between electron spin and momentum. This crucial coupling between the two properties could be the link between the existing paradigm of electronics and future realizations of faster, vastly more energy efficient devices. However the current materials in which these properties are realized remain far from robust in the environmental conditions required to be more than a scientific curiosity.  To better understand these existing materials limitations, this project takes advantage of an experimental technique available at Professor Yukio Hasegawa's laboratory at the Institute of Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, called spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), capable of measuring the spin states of electrons with atomic scale spatial resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SP-STM is a particularly well-suited experimental technique within this context; being surface sensitive and atomically resolved allows for the direct observation of how the theoretically predicted topological protection manifests itself in scattering at defect sites.  Bismuth selenide, the most promising topological insulator to date, has a crystal structure and mechanical properties making surface preparation of samples for STM relatively facile.  Measuring the out of plane spin polarization of electrons at scattering sites will clarify the existing theoretical framework used to understand topological insulators, and inform how to utilize the surface states in spin electronic heterostructures.  This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The measurement and manipulation of electron spin states has immediate technological application as well as relevance to a handful of farther reaching questions in the field of physics.  However identifying a prominent peak is not the same as finding a successful route to its summit.    A new class of materials called topological insulators have properties that could provide avenues for advancing these goals.  We sought to study the prototypical topological insulator bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) using a technique called spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) available at Professor Yukio HasegawaÃ†s laboratory at the Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo.    Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) uses quantum effects at the apex of an atomically sharp tip to measure energy characteristics that can be localized to single atom spatial resolution.  The way this is accomplished is necessarily a surface based phenomena, requiring an extraordinarily clean sample in an ultra high vacuum environment.  The non-trivial conduction state of interest in bismuth selenide resides at the surface of the material making STM a particularly powerful technique to study said state.    The three month experimental window provided by this program was an excellent opportunity to do some of the preliminary work required in advance of achieving SP-STM on Bi2Se3, as well as concretely establish some of the technical problems that will need to be overcome for ultimate success.  The preliminary STM data acquired in the meantime is interesting enough in its own right and is still being analyzed.  Beyond the scientific merits, as an introduction to the people, infrastructure, and culture of cutting edge research in Japan this experience was unparalleled.
