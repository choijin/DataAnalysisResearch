<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description:&lt;br/&gt;Traditional chemical synthesis methods resemble cooking in the sense that the ingredients, mixing methods, temperature, and pressure all may be varied to produce a desired result.  Despite control over all of these macroscopic variables there are some chemical processes that remain elusive.  Since the invention of the laser in the 1960s, the field of coherent control has sought to use the laser to manipulate chemical dynamics by applying energy of suitable color and duration directly to individual molecules.  In this sense, the laser can be thought of as a new type of reagent that drives a chemical reaction.  While easily stated, this task has proved challenging.  Molecules are complicated and dynamic, making it difficult to determine the correct laser characteristics to drive a particular process.  A proven method for approaching this problem is to use experimental feedback to guide an adaptive search of the possible laser pulses.  In a physics version of natural selection, laser pulses that provide a better outcome are given an increased chance to survive and have their characteristics contribute to the tailored pulse that ultimately produces the desired outcome.  Such a method, however, is only as good as the feedback that drives it.  The goal of these studies is to develop enhanced image-based feedback techniques that enable this adaptive approach to coherent control of chemical dynamics.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;The PI has recently developed the ability to use three-dimensional momentum imaging of the laser-molecule reaction products to define the control objective described in the non-technical description above.  Using three-dimensional imaging to target a specific final state has led to better understanding of the mechanisms that undergird the laser-based control, especially in situations in which obtaining precise optical spectroscopic feedback is impractical.  Increased mechanistic understanding can subsequently lead to better search parameterization, enhancing the adaptive control process. Current efforts are focused on applying image-based adaptive control to study and influence photoisomerization processes in small molecules such as ethylene. By studying photoionization, it is possible to probe how electronic excitation is rapidly converted to nuclear motion, an essential step in many ultrafast chemical processes.  Ethylene is particularly interesting as a benchmark molecule for examining the role of conical intersections in these electronic to nuclear energy conversions.  These studies will be advanced by using two-pulse experiments, which allow the separation of the ionization step from the subsequent evolution of the molecular ion, which the group hopes to control.  Strong-field tunneling ionization of polyatomic molecules often involves multiple molecular orbitals, and studies of these relationships help link the image-based feedback to more specific target states, again with the objective of refining adaptive control methods.   A goal of this project will be extending this work to explore the control of laser driven electron rescattering via feedback derived from angle resolved photoelectron distributions.  Electron rescattering is an essential part of many ultrasfast laser-based processes, such as high-harmonic generation and the production of attosecond pulses, and therefore control of this sort has a number of potential applications.  Finally, as an undergraduate institution, this project helps identify and develop talented students by immersing them in forefront research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Controlling molecules using lasers is an idea that originated not long after the invention of the laser.  The idea is tantalizing because it offers the possibility of a new method for chemical synthesis.  Unlike changing the composition of the ingredients, changing the temperature or altering the pressure of the synthesis, a laser can conceivably control chemistry at the microscopic level, like a light-based catalyst.   It?s turned out to be a harder problem than first thought.  For example, applying a laser pulse of the correct color and duration to a molecule could, in principle, inject just the right amount of energy to modify a specific chemical bond and change the molecule into a more desirable configuration. In practice, however, the energy quickly spreads from that location to other parts of the molecule.   As laser technology has become more sophisticated, studies of these molecule-laser interactions has progressed in parallel.  The work supported by this grant award has focused on the process, known as strong-field ionization, by which an intense laser pulse removes electrons from molecules.  The ability to understand and control strong-field ionization is important not only for prospects of laser-based chemistry, but also for creating ever-shorter laser pulses, probing how atoms move inside a molecule, and even imaging the electronic structure of molecules.   We studied the small hydrocarbon molecules acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), and ethane (C2H6) and found that when the laser pulse was strong enough, the electron distribution in the target molecules was affected in a specific way.  The result would be the creation of a field-dressed (meaning it was created while the laser was present) state with Rydberg character.  Rydberg states are usually quite diffuse and centered on the molecule as a whole rather than an individual atom.  We found that these states would form at specific locations around the molecule (see the associated figure 1).  Electrons from these locations would ionize very easily, affecting the overall angular distribution of electrons and ions that result from this strong field ionization process.   More technically, Ionization from these field-dressed orbitals with Rydberg character creates holes in the electronic wavefunction that strongly influence the direction of the hydrogen elimination from the molecular cation. Understanding the link between the electronic properties of the ionization process and the photofragment angular distributions that result from molecular dissociation is an essential component of designing adaptive control schemes that use photofragment imaging as a feedback source.  We continue to use this photofragment imaging feedback technique to develop laser pulse shapes that cause a specific process to occur in a molecule.   A primary broader impact of our work is the development of highly trained undergraduate students that often continue on in STEM fields.  In this award period, five undergraduate students were supported.  One has continued on to a Ph.D. program in chemistry, one is now doing graduate study in computer science, and one is attending medical school.  The other two students are still at Augustana University.   Our work is done in collaboration with Kansas State University?s J.R. Macdonald Laboratory, where the experiments are done with Itzik Ben-Itzhak?s group.  Theoretical support for our work is provided by Regina de Vivie-Riedle?s group in Munich.
