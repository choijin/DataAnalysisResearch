<AbstractNarration>Experimental historian of science, Professor Pamela Smith will lead a team of international interdisciplinary experts and students in the reenactment of experiments that were conducted during the scientific revolution. In 2014-15, the focus will be metalworking and portrait medal casting; in 2015-16, on pigment making and painting; and in 2016-17, on varnish making. These laboratory seminars lay out a new model for collaboration between the humanities and sciences, demonstrating the reciprocal effects of bringing historical research to bear on laboratory activities and vice versa. It will have significant impact on students of chemistry, engineering, and history because the learning experiences are designed to illuminate the relationship between making and knowing. The historic laboratory manual from which these historical experimental reenactments will be drawn will be published in an open-access format open to the public and the results of the research will be made available in a multi-media interactive online environment. This resource will be invaluable to scholars and to science educators and students interested in STEM.  The involvement of curators, conservation scientists, and educators will ensure that museums and other public institutions will be able to use the research generated by the project to develop public programming and installations that emphasize the common history of art, technology, and science and the value of history of science and hands-on learning in both historical and scientific training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will illuminate the role of technical manuals in fostering the creative process and technical ability, qualities that are instrumental to industrial innovation.  The focus will be the physicality of investigating nature, particularly the tactile relationship to materials that produced unprecedented accuracy and innovation in experimentation and on the role of tacit knowledge in methodological experimentation.  A better understanding of the embodied techniques used in scientific experimentation may illuminate current concerns with experimental replication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Making and Knowing Project (www.makingandknowing.org), a research initiative of the Center for Science and Society at Columbia University, is creating an open access digital critical edition and English translation of a unique anonymous sixteenth-century French artisanal and technical manuscript, BnF Ms. Fr. 640. This edition contains an extensive research apparatus and set of resources, and will ultimately also include a freely available, adaptable template for other scholars, instructors, and students to apply the Project?s collaborative, pedagogy-driven research methodology in creating their own collaborative research projects.   The first stage of accomplishing this goal is the transcription, normalized French transcription, and English translation of Ms. Fr. 640?s recipes and entries. Each of these texts is encoded with a customized markup schema to prepare it for digital publication and transform the manuscript?s content into a rich, searchable, and analyzable dataset. The transcribed and translated versions of the manuscript form the basis for laboratory seminars in which students carry out original text- and object-based research and hands-on laboratory reconstructions of the processes described in the manuscript. Their essays, which will be part of the digital edition, form the research apparatus and output of the project, and are overseen by a large network of scholars who gather together with the students in an annual meeting. All phases of this research have been supported by the NSF Award #1430843.   Intellectual Merit: Never before published or extensively studied, Ms. Fr. 640 contains a huge variety of recipes and instructions in areas as varied as medicine, metalworking, surveying, ballistics, pigment and varnish making, cannon casting, and detailed observations of animal behavior. It offers unrivaled first-hand testimony of the craft workshop, and provides a glimpse into the earliest phases of the Scientific Revolution, when nature was investigated primarily by skilled artisans by means of continuous and methodical experimentation in the making of objects - the time when "making" was "knowing." Ms. Fr. 640 thus forms a crucial missing link in the origins of modern science and represents a pivotal historical moment in the growth of a new mode of gaining empirically-based knowledge which we now call "the scientific method." The Making and Knowing Project is researching the manuscript?s assemblage of written and practiced activity by employing interdisciplinary methodologies, including hands-on reconstructions of the recipes (using historically relevant materials, tools, and processes) and new data visualization and analysis from the digital humanities. The resulting open-access critical edition will not only make this manuscript accessible to diverse audiences but allow them to experience the processual knowledge of historical techniques through texts, images, and videos. The research is carried out through a process partially adapted from current scientific research methods and brings together students, practitioners, scholars of the humanities and social sciences, natural scientists, museum professionals, and specialists from computer science and the digital humanities in formal university courses and a series of "expert crowdsourcing" workshops and working groups.

The Template will be freely available as a part of the critical edition and the Project?s website.   Broader Impacts: The critical edition will add a rare and important text to an extremely limited corpus of technical treatises and will make the manuscript accessible to diverse audiences. It will contribute to the careful deciphering of materials and techniques done by museum curators and conservators; it provides rich evidence for new scholarship in STS, and in the histories of art and of science; and its original interpretative apparatus of textual, historical, and technical annotations will open fertile avenues of research on technical "recipe books" to literary scholars and historians. At the same time, the Project?s innovative methods can (and have already begun to) be applied to other large-scale collaborative research projects. By involving participants of varied experience, such as postdoctoral scholars and graduate students, and including pedagogical activities at every stage, the researchers gain skills and professional development while they help in realizing the research objectives of the Project. The close connection of research production and pedagogy increases the impact of all components of the Project.   Ultimately, the Project seeks to demonstrate that hand and mind are not in fact separate components of human cognition and action, despite the current lack of conceptual categories and scholarly terminologies to express their unity. Thus, the Project?s most expansive impact is in its construction of new historical narratives, new methods and modes of analysis, and new pedagogical practices that contribute to a richer and more unified understanding of human cognition and action.
