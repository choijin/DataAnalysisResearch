<AbstractNarration>The numerical  simulation, using advanced computational platforms, of both high and low-speed flows of gases where the distance that molecules travel between molecular collisions is comparable with a body dimension   remains a challenging discipline in both aerodynamics and gas-fluid mechanics in general. Important practical examples are the motion of low-earth orbit satellites, space-vehicle re-entry into both earth and extra-terrestrial atmospheres, gas-flows that occur in inertial-confinement fusion and the fluid-dynamical behavior of nano-devices, particularly where either or both molecule-surface interactions and fluid/gas mixing are active.  The present project develops a novel methodology for the computational simulation of gas-dynamic flows of engineering interest.  This is based on consideration of generalized, aggregated gas properties known as moments, combined with ideas from the theory of probability and statistics. It is expected that this research will provide a new and viable approach to the numerical simulation of real-gas flows with improved predictive power over presently available methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposes a methodology for the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation describing the kinetic theory of gases at the mean-free path level. This is based on a new approach to the moment-closure problem, cast in terms of the Grad 13+9N-moment expansion of the Boltzmann equation, where N is an arbitrary integer. For any specific N =1,2.., a set of time-space, differential-integral equations for moments can be formulated.  These are not closed because each equation contains both moments that lie outside the set of retained time derivatives, and also collision-integral terms contain the distribution function itself. The new approach is to close the system at each time step by constructing an analytic form of the local distribution function that maximizes a standard measure of the single-particle entropy, while satisfying the known moments as a given set of constraints.  This can be done numerically as a constrained optimization problem.  The result is a local analytic form for the local  distribution function that satisfies positivity, and which then allows numerical evaluation of unclosed moments and collision terms, implementation of boundary conditions followed by an update of the retained moment equations in time.  The proposed method has been tested by comparison with a known exact solution of the relaxation in time of a given initial distribution function towards an equilibrium state.  It is proposed to apply the method to a sequence of  flows with increasing space dimensionality, including rarefied and transition Couette flow, the internal structure of shock waves and free-molecule to continuum transition flows about bodies in two and three space dimensions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Probability concepts are often utilized in analysing  engineering or physical systems. The need for a probabilistic description usually arises when some essential information about the physics or chemistry is either completely unknown or only partially known.  One then needs a method of assigning probabilities  or likelihoods to certain events or outcomes or even inputs in a way that makes practical calculations of complex,  but only partially known systems, possible.  One way is simply to toss coins, so to speak, which is equivalent to stating that we make a completely uninformed or random guess.  But there are other approaches.  One is the so-called principle of maximum entropy where entropy is a measure of the quality of disorder or uncertainty attached to each event itself.  In quantitative terms for information, entropy density is the mathematical logarithm of the probability density (which is unknown) of the occurrence of the event, and the total entropy is the sum of all such individual entropies over all possible unknown events. So the entropy can interpreted as a quantitative measure of the overall uncertainty.  The concept was first used in the kinetic theory of gases by L. Boltzmann, then generalized to statistical mechanics by J. Willard Gibbs, and then later again to  information theory by Claude Shannon in 1948.  One very useful feature of the information-theoretic concept of entropy is that it that its for allows for known but limited information to be included into determining likelihoods/probabilities. This leads to the principle of maximum entropy, namely that the best estimate of likelihood can be obtained  by choosing the probability set that has maximum entropy measure (or uncertainty) subject to some known but limited information.  This is referred to as the maximum entropy reconstruction (MER) problem.  The thrust of the supported research was twofold: first to analyse the MER in the context of the problem of moments, and second to apply this methodology to physical gas-dynamic flows.  A moment of the probability measure is its weight or contribution towards some aggregated sum.  This sum usually has some specific physical interpretation. For example the contribution of a gas molecule moving with some given speed  to the average velocity of all molecules is the product of the probability that the molecule is moving with that speed and the speed itself (moment arm). This would then be the molecular-velocity moment. One can also calculate other moments concerned with mass or energy or the rate at which these quantities cross some given line or plane in a gas.  In mathematical terms the problem of moments is called the Hamburger moment problem after the German mathematician Hans Ludwig Hamburger.  So the MER in the problem of moments is to construct (calculate) the probability measure of events, constrained by  certain known  moments of those events, that, of all possible probabilities, has maximum entropy measure. Another way of  saying this is to construct the most random or uncertain set of probabilities for the unknown information subject to some known but limited information.  This MER would seem to be benign but was known to be plagued by the unexpected appearance of infinite and physically meaningless outcomes in some circumstances. In mathematical parlance, this is referred to as showing a ``singular structure''.  This was puzzling and but not understood.  In the first part of this research, the mathematical structure of the MER  solution to the Hamburger moment problem was analysed in detail. This analysis exposed the underlying character of singular solutions in quantitative terms and showed their detailed structure.  Using this analysis, it was then possible to construct robust numerical methods to calculate solutions for almost all possible cases. The exceptions are the actual singular cases, where no solutions exist.  The methodology is called the hybrid maximum-entropy reconstruction (HMER).  This provides a workable solution to  a previously unsolved, and difficult problem.  It is expected that this  will impact all disciplines that utilize or wish to utilize an MER approach for probability estimation.  The second part of this research makes explicit use of the HMER in the research field of  the motion of gases at the level of the collisional mean-free path of molecules.  The mean-free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other molecules. The mathematical description of mean-free path effects is given by a well-known equation called the Boltzmann equation and an approximation called the BGK equation.  Applications include the interior structure of shock waves and earth-satellite aerodynamics. When these equations are expressed in terms of moments as discussed above, it turns out that there are not sufficient equations to describe all the moments needed.  So here the HMER is used to estimate these additional and unknown moments given information about the known moments. The applications explored were the relaxation of a gas to thermal equilibrium and the internal structure of  a shock wave.
