<AbstractNarration>The National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Testing and Assessment is conducting this study to determine the best available methods to assess student skills in teamwork, communication, self-regulation of behavior, academic tenacity, and grit.  These skills, also known as interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies, have begun to gain recognition as important to student success in college generally and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) specifically. Indeed such factors may be as important to college success as traditional thinking and reasoning skills, which already have a deep research base to guide instruction and assessment of student performance in STEM. The report resulting from the study will be able to provide guidance to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To conduct the study, the NRC is convening a committee of experts to identify and analyze the current state of knowledge of this field. This work builds on other NRC reports, such as Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century (NRC, 2012), which identified three broad domains of competence: cognitive (e.g., thinking, reasoning), interpersonal (e.g., communication skills), and intrapersonal (e.g., self-regulation). The committee's report will establish principles and priorities for the development and use of assessments related to the range of interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Educational attainment &ndash; the number of years a person spends in school &ndash; strongly predicts adult earnings, as well as health and civic engagement, but U.S. college completion rates are lagging relative to those in other developed nations.  As part of a broader national college completion agenda aimed at increasing college graduation rates, higher education researchers and policy makers are exploring the role of intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies in supporting student success. These sets of competencies represent two of three domains of competence outlined in a previous National Research Council study:     Intrapersonal competencies involve self-management and the ability to regulate one?s behavior and emotion to reach goals. Interpersonal competencies involve expressing information to others as well as interpreting others? messages and responding appropriately. Cognitive competencies involve thinking, reasoning, and related skills.   To address the national imperative to increase college completion, the National Science Foundation (NSF) commissioned the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) to convene an ad hoc committee to conduct a study of the assessment of intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies in higher education.  The Academies report, Supporting Students? College Success: The Role of Assessment of Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Competencies focuses on competencies (also known as 21st century skills) that may boost college attainment.     Based on a thorough review of the research, the study committee identified eight intrapersonal competencies showing evidence of supporting students? college persistence and success, as measured by grades, retention, and graduation.  Three have the most promising evidence:   A sense of belonging: a student?s sense that he or she belongs      at a college, fits in well, and is socially integrated.   A growth mindset: a student?s belief that his or her own      intelligence is not a fixed entity, but a malleable quality that can grow      and improve. Utility goals and values: personal goals and values that a      student perceives to be directly linked to the achievement of a future,      desired end.    Brief, low-cost interventions that helped students develop these competencies sometimes generated the largest benefits for student groups at risk for academic failure.  The committee recommends that funders support further research, in partnership with higher education institutions, to build on and extend these promising findings.   College and university stakeholders, such as faculty, administrators, and guidance staff, could use assessments of the eight identified competencies in a variety of ways, such as to measure whether interventions are working and identify students who would benefit from particular support services.  The committee concluded that stakeholders are more likely to embrace assessments and use the resulting data to support students when the assessments are initiated for improvement purposes rather than when they are used to hold students or programs accountable.  The committee found that assessments of intra- and interpersonal competencies should meet the same high standards as those of cognitive competencies.  These include reliability, validity, and fairness.  However, many current assessments of the eight identified competencies fall short in showing evidence related to these three standards and predominantly use self-report survey.  Such surveys have well-known limitations, such as being subject to social desirability bias (answering in ways that show oneself in the best light), and to other forms of response bias (for example, differences in how individuals interpret the meaning of rating scales).   Given these limitations, the committee recommends that institutions not make high-stakes decisions carrying serious consequences for individuals (e.g., admissions decisions) based solely on current assessments of the eight identified competencies.  It also recommends that funders support research on innovative assessment approaches that can mitigate the limitations of existing measures.

Many of the faculty, administrators, and higher education researchers attending these sessions were already engaged in efforts to assess and develop intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies, and expressed appreciation for the guidance provided by the report.
