<AbstractNarration>This award is for the Partnership for Research &amp; Education in Materials (PREM) between the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) (Humacao, Cayey, Bayamon, and Rio Piedras campuses) and the University of Pennsylvania (PENN) Materials Research Science &amp; Engineering Center. Current research topics that will continue during the extension period include nano-electronics devices, simulations of electrodes and ion movement in supercapacitors, and development of electrochemical biosensors. In addition, education and outreach activities conducted with PENN will continue. The PENN-UPRH PREM has been very successful in recruiting minority students for careers in materials science. A total of 14 new PhDs have graduated from PREM students and 23 are currently in graduate programs in the USA and Puerto Rico.</AbstractNarration>
