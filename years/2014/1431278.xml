<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI will use the case of  field studies of  Karst environments to explore international scientific collaborations and network building.  The study will highlight the importance of the specific historical, social, and spatial dynamics of different scientific disciplines in order to increase the likelihood of success of future scientific collaborations. The working hypothesis is that the frequency of attempted and realized collaborations will vary depending on 1) political events in the participating countries and 2) personal networks established during international conferences. Data will be coded to assess how participants of attempted and realized collaborations defined exploration and research objectives. These results will be tested for correlations with another scale that gauges the degree of failure or success of expeditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. One potential outcome is the establishment of a Karst studies program at West Virginia University. A bi-lingual website is planned for dissemination of results.</AbstractNarration>

This is one of the challenges that cave explorers and scientists, or speleologists, from this research project's case study have and continue to face.
