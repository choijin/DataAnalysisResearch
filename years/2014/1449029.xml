<AbstractNarration>The AI and Robotics research communities have benefitted from collaborations over the past several decades.  However, the recent acceleration in the development of new algorithmic techniques in both fields and new hardware in robotics provide many opportunities for high-impact collaborations.  The PIs are requesting funds to take advantage of this opportunity by holding the first of what is expected to be a series of meetings to encourage collaboration between these two communities.  The first meeting will be held at the most important AI conference, AAAI-2015, in Austin TX.  There will be events that bring some of the most accomplished researchers from Robotics to AAAI and also events that will be exciting school children and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided funds aimed at highlighting and promoting the application of AI techniques in robotics, and establishing and consolidating links between the AI and robotics community. These events occurred at AAAI-2015 in Austin, Texas, from January 25th to 30th, 2015. The activities were overseen by AAAI Robotics Co-Chairs Professor George Konidaris and Dr. Brad Knox.  The specific activities and goals for the robotics activities at AAAI included:  Incorporating the former robotics track into the main AAAI program. Creating a new "integrated systems" special track. An AI Robotics fellowship program for graduate students from robotics labs who are interested in AI research. Inviting talks from selected papers from a peer conference in robotics (Robotics: Science and Systems). An AI Robotics Early Career Spotlight. A celebration of Shakey. A Robotics Exhibition, one night of which was open to public, including a RoboCup Exhibition Match. A program where talented local high school students are brought to AAAI to see AI and robotics research in action.   Each of these activities was successfully executed as detailed in the report below, except for the high school student program, which was folded into the general AAAI Open House.  The major findings of this project were:  1)      There is substantial community interest in, and support of, bringing robotics researchers to AI venues (as indicated by the high number of applications to the AI Robotics Fellowships).  2)      There is substantial interest in bringing AI research into robotics venues (as indicated by the reciprocal events hosted by ICRA and RSS).  A major focus of the AAAI robotics-related events were the Robotics Fellowships, which brought 10 robotics PhD students to AAAI, providing them with some mentoring, and the opportunity the present their work to the community.  The primary outreach activity at AAAI was the AAAI Open House, which included a substantial robotics component. In particular, the Robotics Exhibition and RoboCup Exhibition Match attracted a great deal of public attention including ~200 visitors, and were featured on local media.
