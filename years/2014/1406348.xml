<AbstractNarration>High energy physicists believe that the Yang-Mills Equations model the behavior of quarks. The Yang-Mills Equations turn out to have a remarkably rich mathematical structure. These equations enable the study of models of space-time inaccessible by other means and in addition give tools for the study of the topological structure of DNA. The PI will continue his research on the Yang-Mills equations and their connections to many different parts of mathematics, the study of nonlinear partial differential equations, low dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory and graph theory.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI with study Floer homology invariants for three manifolds and knotted graphs in them. In particular with Peter Kronheimer, the PI is studying a  family of  Floer homology theories built from connections with a prescribed singularity along knotted graphs in three manifolds.  Certain versions of these theories appear to be related to Khovanov-Rozansky SL(N)-homology for foams and the relations will be explored and elucidated. Other versions point to theories more general than Khovanov-Rozansky homology.  Yet another rather delicate version appears to have bearing on questions of tri-colorability of spacial graphs, and  in particular appears likely to provide novel insight to the question of tri-colorability of planar graphs.</AbstractNarration>
