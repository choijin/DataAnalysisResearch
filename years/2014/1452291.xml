<AbstractNarration>The goal of this study is to advance our understanding of the coupling and causal links between high-latitude forcing of the thermosphere and mid-latitude plasma density structuring during both quiet and storm times. The study will also characterize the relative importance of spatial/temporal variation at the high-latitude boundary between the magnetosphere and ionosphere in generating observed variability in the mid-latitudes. The knowledge gained will impact the development of future models by identifying any missing physics in the models as well as the spatial/temporal resolutions required to capture relevant processes. Improving modeling is critical to enabling space weather forecasting capabilities, and will enhance the infrastructure for research and education. &lt;br/&gt; This project will address two fundamental questions: 1) What is the cause/effect relationship between high-latitude forcing on the neutral winds and the response of electron densities at mid-latitudes, especially during geomagnetic storm conditions? 2) What is the relationship between spatial/temporal variability within the high-latitude drivers and the variability observed within the mid-latitude neutral winds and ionospheric structure? Observations of mid-latitude thermospheric winds and temperatures made by the North American Thermosphere-Ionosphere Observation Network (NATION) of Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI) will be coupled with time-dependent 3D electron density estimates from the Ionospheric Data Assimilation Four Dimensional (IDA4D) assimilative model. The source of the dynamics observed in the thermospheric neutral winds and electron density will be investigated through exercising an inversion algorithm (Estimating Model Parameters from Ionospheric Reverse Engineering; EMPIRE) developed to estimate the ionospheric drivers from three-dimensional, time-evolving distributions of ionospheric electron densities. The first-principles Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) will also be used to elucidate the underlying physics responsible for the coupling. This study will contribute to the education and training of graduate students at the University of Illinois and the University of Michigan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Thermospheric neutral winds play an important role in the large-scale distribution of plasma in the earth's ionosphere because they carry momentum, energy, and composition from high-latitudes to mid- and low-latitudes. The goal of this project was to improve understanding of the coupling and causal links between high-latitude forcing of the thermosphere and mid-latitude plasma density structuring during both quiet and storm times. This was accomplished through the use of a comprehensive database of thermospheric neutral wind measurements as well as results from two state-of-the-art models of the earth's upper atmopshere.   For the first time, neutral winds were assimilated into a modeling framework (IDA4D/EMPIRE). We also investigated the effects of atmospheric scattering on the reliability and robustness of thermospheric parameters estimated from ground-based Fabry-Perot interferometers, which will have an impact on future data collection and parameter retrieval techniques.   We performed a comprehensive year-long comparison between model and measured winds and temperatures which helped improve the models' representation of themospheric dynamics. These results will also inform new observing strategies for measuring the spatial variability of thermospheric netural winds.          The results about correlation lengths, especially, are important for determining optimal deployments of future networks. Our results indicate that much of the climate and weather in the thermosphere can be observed with a less-dense network of instruments than we had originally anticipated. Deployments of furutre networks of instruments should be distributed at proper distances to capture the appropriate scale sizes to better understand the thermospheric weather.
