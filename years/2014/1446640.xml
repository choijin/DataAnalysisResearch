<AbstractNarration>Traditionally, the design of urban transit services has been based on limited sampling data collected through surveys and censuses, which are often dated and incomplete. Lacking massive online feeds from multiple transit modes makes it hard to achieve real-time equilibrium in demand and supply relationship through cyber-control, which eventually manifests into multiple urban transportation issues: (i) lengthy last-mile transit due to non-supply, (ii) prolonged waiting due to undersupply, and (iii) excessive idle mileage due to oversupply. This project addresses these issues by focusing on two types of transportation systems in metropolitan areas: (i) public bike rental sharing systems and (ii) fleet-oriented ride sharing systems. The public bike rental sharing systems are used to allow commuters to rent bikes near public transit stations for the last mile of their trips. The fleet-oriented ride sharing systems schedule a fleet of participating vehicles for ride sharing among passengers in which shared ridership reduces individual fare paid by passengers, increases the profit of taxi drivers, and can improve the availability of service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory and practice of transportation sharing systems have typically focused on isolated individual transportation modes. The project will collect massive multi-modal online feeds from metropolitan information infrastructure to model dynamic behaviors of transportation systems, and then utilize massive micro-level trip information to apply fine-grained real-time control to handle rapid changes in dynamic metropolitan environments. General principles and design methodologies will be designed to build multi-modal, integrated urban transportation systems. These research discoveries will be applied toward commercial applications. Long-term deployment problem of bike stations will be addressed, especially in the low-income districts, to provide suggestions on the station deployment and assessment for specific deployment plans. The project also solves the short-term bike maintenance issue to balance the usage of shared bikes to prevent quick deterioration of rental bikes, and improve availability of bike rental services in real time. This project will also study fleet-oriented ride sharing systems that decide fares based on real-time supply/demand ratio to handle dynamic metropolitan scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support two Ph.D. students who will receive innovation and technology translation training through close interactions with municipal governments and small-business companies. Such partnerships expedite the adoption of cutting-edge technology, evaluate research solutions in operational environments, and obtain user feedback to trigger further innovations. The project will improve the efficiency of existing transportation systems under sharing economy and ultimately the work would noticeably improve the quality of every-day life in metropolitan areas across the United States.</AbstractNarration>
