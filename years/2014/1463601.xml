<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a three-day meeting on mathematical and philosophical logic at the University of California, Los Angeles, from January 30 to February 1, 2015. This is the eighteenth in a series of biennial logic meetings at UCLA which, starting in the mid 1970s, has been one of the most important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast. The 2015 meeting honors Donald A. Martin, a key figure in both philosophical and mathematical logic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific projects. Conference topics center on mathematical logic, including set theory, model theory, and recursion theory, and philosophical logic. About half the grant funds are dedicated to travel awards for graduate students and early career researchers, to allow them to participate in the meeting. The conference provides an opportunity for junior researchers to learn about recent progress in the area and to initiate collaborative research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meeting web site: www.logic.ucla.edu/vig2015/index.html</AbstractNarration>
