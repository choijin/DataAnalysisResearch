<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is a research and development effort to create a platform technology for wearable sleep monitoring devices. Currently, there is no miniaturized, user-friendly skin-worn sleep monitor that combines measurements of the key biomedical parameters necessary for identifying causes of sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is of epidemic proportions and has several main causes. Sleep apnea stands out as the most common and often undetected cause.  Millions of Americans are sleep deprived and at risk of sleep apnea with most of them remaining unaware of their condition and suffering the health, productivity and quality of life consequences.  A successful completion of this project will aim to help to provide diagnoses for this group, allowing them to seek treatment.  The introduction of this new device will also broaden the utility of clinical sleep monitors.  The low projected cost of this sleep monitor will drive down up-front costs, while the wider use of sleep monitors will reduce the healthcare expenditure associated with the treatment of disorders stemming from sleep deprivation and sleep apnea.  The commercial potential for this platform technology is significant with the total potential market estimated at several billion dollars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feasibility of the proposed diagnostic method for sleep monitoring has been recently proven, and this project aims to implement this method for a platform technology which can be used for a range of miniature skin-worn sleep monitoring products both for consumers and healthcare professionals. The sleep monitoring technology developed during this project will be a combination of the company's achievements in the area of sleep diagnostics and the best technologies and materials available for wearable devices.  The proposed device includes new and powerful types of sensors which are not found in competing devices, and which promise improved performance.  The specific objectives of this project are to integrate the latest electronic components and the most advanced materials with our proprietary method and to achieve a robust and reliable design. This project will explore the use of the latest battery technologies, advanced miniature flexible circuit board manufacturing processes and the latest plastic materials to create a design that expands the application of wearable devices and sleep monitors. A successful completion will lead to the development of a cutting-edge sleep monitoring technology that will serve as a tool for assessing cause of sleep deprivation in general and sleep apnea, in particular.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This main outcome of this project was the development of a manufacturable, robust prototype of a wearable sleep monitor designed for human factors. This project  demonstrated that even sophisticated medical devices providing the data  of clinical quality can be miniaturized and made into consumer products  which have the potential to broaden the access of the public to vital  health data.     The wearable sleep monitor developed during this project has the  potential to be widely used by the consumers and result in greater  awareness of the public of the importance of sleep quality and alert the  users about their sleep disorders.   This project also resulted in transfering the technology initially developed for healthcare  professionals into a prototype consumer product. Consequently, the public  use of this technology has a potential to increase significantly and  lead to improved access of the public to the tools and techniques  previously available only in the healthcare setting.   Additionally, the product prototype developed during this project has the potential to change the behavior of consumers who  would be able to obtain sleep data of clinical quality outside of the  healthcare setting, minimize the costs of sleep monitoring  Our hope is that the ultimate outcome of this project will have an  impact on the public health and reduction of morbidity and mortality as  well as reduction in the healthcare costs associated with sleep  disordered breathing.
