<AbstractNarration>Remarkably, it was not until 2008 that Bacteria and Archaea (prokaryotes) were shown to possess adaptive immune systems that protect them against prokaryotic viruses.  This system, called CRISPR/Cas, uses protein and RNA based recognition to identify and destroy an invading virus. However, we still lack important details on how this is accomplished.  The project will utilize biochemical methods to further our understanding of the CRISPR/Cas system and the detailed biochemical steps it takes to recognize and destroy the invading viral DNA. It will also investigate the ways in which the activity of this immune system is controlled. Although the goal is a basic biological understanding of the biology and chemistry of CRISPR/Cas, the ability this system to recognize, repair, alter, or destroy a specific DNA sequence in a living cell has a host of potentially powerful applications in biotechnology. Finally, there is a strong integration of the project with the educational goals of Montana State University and the National Science Foundation. Students (and teachers) at the high school, undergraduate and doctoral levels will receive significant training in biochemistry, structural biology and thermal biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will utilize a number of biophysical and biochemical methods, including X-ray crystallography, single particle cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance to accomplish the specific goals of this project.  These methods will first be used to understand how the CRISPR/Cas recognizes and templates CRISPR RNA for the recognition and destruction of invading viral DNA.  These same methods will be used to investigate how the activity of Cascade is regulated. Combined, these studies will elucidate the structure of the 400 kDa Cascade complex at the atomic level, identify post-translational modifications that control its activity and identify molecules thought to regulate the expression of the CRISPR/Cas system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes and Findings:   While there is extreme interest and broad understanding of potential uses of CRISPR-Cas as a gene editing technology, Nature did not invent CRISPR-Cas for this purpose.  Rather, CRISPR-Cas naturally serves as an adaptive immune system in single celled prokaryotic organisms, where it is found in more than 40% of Bacteria and nearly all Archaea.  These systems are incredibly diverse, and have been divided into 2 major classes.  The well known CRISPR-Cas9 system belongs to Class 2.  However, it represents less than 10% of identified CRISPR-Cas systems.  Much more common are the Class 1 systems, which are further subdivided into types (I, III, IV) and subtypes (IA-IF, IIIA-III-D, IVA-IV?).  CRISPR-Cas systems work to protect these single cell prokaryotes from invading virues using a 3-stage system.  In stage 1, a small piece of the DNA from the invading virus is cut out by the Cas system and inserted into the host cells DNA.  These snippets of foreign DNA, known as spacers, are archived in the host CRISPR-loci.  In the second stage, the CRISPR loci are transcribed into pre-CRISPR RNA, and then cut at regular intervals to produce CRISPR RNAs (crRNA).  In the third stage, the crRNA is assembled into large Cas protein complexes that patrol the cell looking for DNA and/or RNA that cam hybridize to the crRNA.  Since the crRNA is derived from viral DNA, if the crRNA does hybridize to DNA or RNA, it must be from a virus.  So, when it finds these viral DNAs or RNAs, it destroys them using Cas protein nuclease activity.  We study the regulation of Class 1 systems in a model Archaeon (S. solfataricus) that utilizes both Type IA and Type IIIB Class 1 systems.   We asked how does this organism coordinate the activities of these two different CRISPR-Systems.  We have found that a CRISPR associated protein known as Csa3 works as a transcription factor, and is itself controlled by a 4-base cyclic RNA signal known as cyclic-tetradenylate or cA4.  This regulatory signal is produced by Cas10 when cells are having difficulty clearing a viral infection.  Cas 10 is part of the type IIIB system, whereas Csa3 is part of the Type IA system.  We have shown that when cA4 is recognized by Csa3, it turns on expression of Cas genes involved in stage 1 which cause the cell to acquire new, more effective crRNAs.  In addition, it also turns on expression of crRNAs, so that the newly acquired spacers are transcribed into crRNA and incorporated into new, more effective surveillance complexes.  Thus, when the cell is struggling to clear a viral infection, proteins in the type IA and type IIIB systems work together to feedback activate new spacer acquisition, and to incorporate these new crRNAs into both type I and type III surveillance complexes to finally clear the infection.  Thus, type I and type III systems are not completely independent.  Instead, we now recognize they are two complementary arms of a coordinated anti-viral response.  These findings have significant implications for the control of CRISPR-Cas in prokaryotes, including pathogenic bacteria.  In addition to these activities, we have also continued to investigate the viruses that infect S. solfataricus, as the interplay between virus and host has been key to discovering many of the important details of CRISPR-Cas.  For example, we know that membrane perturbation by viruses activates CRISPR-Cas, but we do not yet know how. Towards this goal, however, we are studying viral genome delivery into the S. solfataricus cell, and now have atomic models for initial attachment of the archaeal virus STIV to the host cell, and also understand how the unique architecture of the lemon- or spindle-shaped viruses that are so common in the archaea provide the driving force for genome delivery as they transition to hollow, cylindrical tubes.   Broader Impacts: The project has facilitated training and professional development for 15 students involved in undergraduate research, 3 students who completed research for their Masters degrees, 3 students completing Ph.D. degrees, and for 2 students during initial stages in their Ph.D. studies. In addition, it also provided significant training in cryo-EM for the PI, allowing him to add cryo-EM as an additional experimental technique to address the laboratories long-standing structural interests, and catalyzing subsequent grants to bring a state of the art cryogenic transmission electron microscope to Montana State University for use by the molecular life sciences community across the Northern Rocky Mountains and Northwestern Plains regions.
