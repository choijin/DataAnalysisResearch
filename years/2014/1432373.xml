<AbstractNarration>Many students who intend to major in computer engineering do not persist through the introductory sequence of digital logic courses that are part of every accredited computer engineering program in the U.S. These students often lack the necessary prerequisite knowledge due to their varied backgrounds and incoming preparedness levels. This problem is compounded by the large class sizes of introductory college courses, which make it difficult to accommodate the background knowledge and the skills of individual students. Additionally, an e-learning environment has the potential to reach a broad audience through remote delivery, thus further increasing the impact of this approach. This enables community colleges and 4-year universities to move toward a true two-plus-two transfer program by allowing students to complete lower-level computer engineering courses remotely before transferring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adaptive learning materials in this project will be developed for use in an introductory digital circuits course and a logic design course. Both of these courses contain laboratory components that will also be addressed by this work. The materials will be developed as self-contained learning modules that can be used at different colleges with varying schedules (e.g., semester vs. quarter). The materials will consist of a unified, adaptive learning environment that can be implemented using any course management system (e.g., Moodle, Desire2Learn, Blackboard) to eliminate the need for proprietary software. An accompanying lab kit will facilitate hands-on learning in a low-cost, portable form factor to facilitate remote delivery and eliminate the financial barrier of offering a meaningful laboratory experience.  The materials will be tested at a diverse set of institutions: Montana State University, a Ph.D. granting, research active university, MSU-Billings, a 4-year non-research university, Flathead Valley Community Colleges, the largest 2-year community college in Montana, and Salish Kootenai College, a Tribal College proving both 2-year and 4-year degrees for Native Americans. This broad range of participants will allow the team to assess the effectiveness of the adaptive learning materials while simultaneously considering the relationship between student background and the student learning experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both quantitative and qualitative measures will be used to assess the adaptive learning modules. Direct measures will be collected on student performance, including the number of ungraded quiz attempts within an adaptive module, end of module exam scores, time required to complete a module, and time spent at each level of difficulty within a module. Surveys will be used to collect student satisfaction with the adaptive learning environment that will include feedback on their impression of content difficulty, workload compared to other courses of the same credit load, and their sense of how well the material was personalized to their needs. Student demographic information will be collected including gender, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic background, ACT scores and college credits obtained. This information will be used to understand how different groups use and benefit from the course materials. Focus groups will also be conducted with student participants at Michigan State University in order to collect qualitative data on student learning and attitudes toward the e-learning system. Phone interviews will be conducted with students from the other participating institutions. The interim findings from this assessment will be used as feedback to enhance the adaptive learning system in order to accommodate a broader range of participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the feasibility of using a fully online learning environment for teaching digital logic circuits.  Allowing engineering courses to be taught online provides two advantages.  The first is access to higher education.  In many situations, especially in large geographic states like Montana, the physical distance to a university can present a financial barrier to attending college.  Offering lower-level engineering courses fully online can allow students to gain credits that will count toward a 4-year degree prior to transferring to a main college campus for the completion of their degree.  This cuts down on the time-to-graduation post-transfer, and ultimately to lowering the financial barrier to education.  The second reason for online delivery of engineering courses is providing an asynchronous option for working individuals.  Having to be in a classroom at a prescribed time with deadlines tied to traditional class meeting times makes taking classes nearly impossible for adults with full time employment.  However, if the same course can be taken off-campus and allows the student to work on it on their own schedule, then it becomes more feasible for working adults to earn engineering degrees.  There are two primary barriers to offering engineering courses online.  The first is how to provide a meaningful laboratory experience.  The laboratory portion of engineering courses provides students the deepest levels of learning and is the key to providing a ?hands-on? experience with real hardware.  Simultaneously, it is difficult to implement online.  This is typically due to the large and expensive equipment that is needed to conduct the laboratory assignments.  Since this equipment resides on-campus in a traditional laboratory setting, the design of the course must be structured to accommodate this physical and time-sharing constraints.  The second barrier to online engineering courses is providing assistance to students that have background deficiencies related to the content.  These students typically require a significant amount of instructor time to bring up to the proficient level that the majority of other students in the class are at.  In an online environment, the 1-on-1 instructor time becomes difficult to provide, especially when the course is offered with asynchronous timing.   In this project we developed a comprehensive set of online course materials for teaching digital logic circuits and logic design.  These materials included a set of learning outcomes, new textbooks, lecture videos, assessment exercises, and lab exercises based on a portable lab kit.  The materials were tested across a broad range of institution types including a 4-year research university, a 4-year teaching university, a 2-year community college, and a 2-year tribal college.  The mode of delivery was also varied to test whether the materials would work in both a live and online environment.  Our data show that there was no significant difference in student performance across the institution type or delivery mode.  This verified that for a digital logic course using our materials, the same level of learning can be achieved across many delivery types, including the laboratory component of the course.   The second part of our project looked at how effective an adaptive learning system was at helping struggling students progress through the material when they didn?t have access to an instructor.  The adaptive learning modules consisted of presenting the material with an increasing level of complexity.  The students were continually assessed using automatically graded quiz questions that dictated the difficulty of the content the student was presented.  Our data analysis revealed that students with GPAs between 2.5-2.9 on a 4-point scale showed a significant improvement in their performance on the targeted learning outcomes due to the adaptive learning intervention.  This verified that the adaptive learning modules helped the typical student that normally requires increased instructor time in a live setting.   The intellectual merit of this research was in the creation of a comprehensive set of course materials for teaching digital logic that was tested across institution type and delivery mode.  This provides the community a tool for improving access to higher education by allowing students to earn college credits without needing to be physically on-campus.  The broader impact of this project is a model for developing online course material and an e-learning environment that can help students with background deficiencies.  This model has the potential to be expanded to other engineering disciplines and could increase the size and vitality of the engineering workforce.
