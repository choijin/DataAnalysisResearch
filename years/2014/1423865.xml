<AbstractNarration>The world's languages have traditionally been divided into one of three categories (stress-accent, pitch-accent, or tone) based on how pitch is utilized to distinguish words from one another. However, this division of languages is based largely on the impressionistic judgments rather than on detailed quantitative measurements of linguistic properties. Recent work has demonstrated that this typology is deeply inadequate for characterizing both the precise role(s) of pitch in language, and the relevant sources of diversity among languages. For example, although a language may utilize pitch as the primary acoustic cue to differentiate between words, it may also use stress, suggesting that these two phenomena are not mutually exclusive. The prevailing typology, though arguably flawed, has formed the basis for many important claims about the nature of language and linguistic complexity, which in turn have shaped how linguistic pedagogies are developed for use in foreign language teaching, and the way that prosodic systems are modeled for developing tools such as speech recognition software. Given the importance of such resources in today's global society, it is important for linguists to form a clear picture of the ways in which the acoustic properties of speech are used by speakers both in production and in perception. The current project aims to take a closer look at pitch, accent and prosodic structure in an effort to better understand how these structural elements interact, with the end goal of developing a more accurate linguistic typology, and a more adequate set of tools for language teaching and natural language processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research for this project will take place in Southwestern Cameroon, focusing on the Bamileke languages, a subgroup of the Mbam-Nkam branch of the Benue-Congo group (Niger-Congo family). These languages have some of the most complex tone systems in the world, and much remains to be understood about their structure. Recent work suggests that word- and phrase-level accentual properties reminiscent of those found in prototypical stress languages are responsible for previously unexplained tonal phenomena in these languages, and that accent may play a much more important role in the organization of sounds than was formerly thought. This research will endeavor to explore in detail the way that acoustic measures such as pitch, vowel quality, amplitude, syllable and vowel duration interact in language production, and the way that these cues are weighted by listeners when perceiving speech. Data will be collected in the form of controlled production and perception experiments, as well as in the form of natural conversation between native speakers of the language. Research findings will contribute to our understanding of the ways in which pitch can be used alongside other acoustic cues at different levels of grammatical structure in a language with lexically-based tonal contrasts. Since many of the languages deemed 'critical' for learning by the US government also fit this description (Mandarin Chinese, Punjabi, Hausa, etc.), this work will have important implications for a wide variety of national language training initiatives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  The goal of this project was to investigate the sound system of the Medumba language, a Grassfields Bantu language spoken in southwestern Cameroon.  Specifically, the project aimed to investigate the phonetic properties of tones in the language, and the interaction between tone and syllable prominence.  In carrying out the project, the Co-PI completed two two-month field trips to Cameroon to run a series of experiments on speech production and perception, and also collected various kinds of naturalistic conversation data.    Broader Impacts  As planned, the Co-PI hosted two Cameroonian linguistics students during the fieldwork, one each trip, and served as a mentor to the students by teaching them the basics of experimental design and data collection.  Students were able to both observe and participate in the data collection procedures, helping with stimulus creation, and with elicitations from native speakers.  The Co-PI is in the process of analyzing data from an experiment which involved these researchers and which she intends to co-present with the students once the project is ready.  In addition, the Co-PI conducted trainings in the use of ELAN and PRAAT software, both free types of software for phonetic data annotation.  Two Cameroonian researchers participated in the trainings and also helped the Co-PI to transcribe some of the Medumba conversation data in the native orthography of the language.  One of the researchers went on to use her transcription skills with ELAN in her own Master's Degree work in translation.  She is now studying in the United States and plans to apply for doctoral programs in Francophone literature.  Deliverables  The Co-PI has created a number of data sets which will be made public, including a corpus of spoken Medumba conversation data (in the process of being annotated), and various types of tone production data.  Researchers will be able to access this data online and use it for their own work, if desired.  Stimuli from the perception experiments conducted by the Co-PI are also already available on her website.  The co-PI is also working to annotate video of native Medumba speakers in the process of making shea butter, a popoular natural skin care product.  The process of making the butter highights several local agricultural and cooking customs, all narrated by the speakers themsevles.  This video will be made available to the participants in the video, as well as to local language preservation organizations.  The Co-PI has presented her work at several major conferences in the field of linguistics both in the US and abroad, including the International Symposium on Tonal Aspects of Language, the Annual Conference on African Linguistics, and Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing.  The work has appeared in proceedings volumes from these conferences as well as in a journal article in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America Express Letters.  The Co-PI continues to analyze data from the project and plans to complete her dissertation in the spring of 2017.     Intellectual Merit  The project is one of the first of its kind to do in-depth experimental work in phonetics on an African language.  The co-PI not only made several important discoveries about the nature of tone and prominence in Medumba, but also developed and adapted experimental methods appropriate for a fieldwork context.  She has written about and shared these methods with a number of colleagues in an attempt to empower linguists to use such methods even when an ideal laboratory setting is not available.
