<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Northeastern University, located in Boston, MA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2017. The REU program is open to all undergraduate students who are citizens, nationals, or permanent residents of the United States. Students from underrepresented groups, from schools with limited opportunities for research, and with military backgrounds including cadets, reservists, and returning veterans, are encouraged to apply. The focus of the REU site is interdisciplinary research across biological levels. Pairs of participating students will work in interdisciplinary research teams and explore related research questions from different perspectives. Example projects include extracellular matrix-guided differentiation of adult stem cells, microbial biofilm assembly and DNA damage response, behavioral and molecular aspects of social immunity, organismal survival under extreme conditions, links between circadian rhythms and regeneration, and mitochondrial DNA inheritance in developing oocytes. Students will participate in joint workshops on ethics and responsible conduct of research, proposal writing, presentation of talks and posters, applying to graduate school, and career opportunities in science. At the end of the program, students will present their research in a summer research symposium. Students will be housed in new dorms on campus in the heart of Boston. The effectiveness of the training program will be assessed with a common web-based tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Students will use techniques at the cutting edge of biological research to answer new questions, and will enhance their abilities to lead and perform in research teams.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/biology/undergraduate/reu-site/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Wendy Smith at w.smith@neu.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Rebeca Rosengaus at r.rosengaus@neu.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Students participated in a 10-week intensive research program as teams examining related biological questions from different perspectives. Our program hosted 9-12 students each year, with a total of 33 students during the award period. The primary goal of our REU program was to increase the numbers of students with interest and potential to pursue research careers, particularly students from underrepresented groups.&nbsp;Through&nbsp;in-depth inquiry and associated professional development, we aimed to promote a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life and life sciences and prepare students for advancement in research. Research teams consisted of 2-3 each of REU students, faculty advisors, and graduate students or postdocs. We prioritized admitting students from institutions that lacked doctoral research programs, students from minorities underrepresented in science, and first-generation college students. We also prioritized students&nbsp;with military experience, both as a way to enhance representation of this deserving community in STEM doctoral programs, and due to their fit with our programmatic emphasis on teamwork and leadership in science. Topics examined by the teams included the molecular and organismal effects of parental bacterial infection on their immunity; novel approaches to discovering microbial chemical defenses; exploration of relationships between mitochondria and stem cell function; contrasts between healing of&nbsp;skin cells of animals that regenerate well vs. those that regenerate poorly; and genetic pathways responsible for the regulation of motility and aging. Research models included bacteria, moths, worms, and salamanders. Students developed hypotheses and outlined formal research strategies articulated in short peer-reviewed proposals and, at the end of the program, presented their work in a poster session for all interested campus members. Enrichment sessions were provided weekly, including sessions on teamwork and leadership (with an expert from our Engineering Leadership Institute), scientific writing, poster and oral presentation, and responsible conduct of research. Enrichment sessions also included panels on applying to graduate school (led by current doctoral students) and on careers in biology (led by local professionals ranging from biotech to MD-PhD to science-television-program production). Each week a seminar was presented by a Northeastern researcher that included open questions which ranged from science to work-life-balance. Optional weekend activities included trips to nearby museums, picnicking and kayaking.</p> <p>Our participants came entirely from outside of Northeastern University, from locations as distant as Guam, Puerto Rico, and California, and as close as local community colleges.&nbsp;Over 60% were female, and 67% from groups underrepresented in science. Given the teamwork and leadership emphasis of the program, we included 10-25% of students with military backgrounds in each cohort, including 3 veterans. Students were housed in new dorms on campus, and to the extent possible we made sure their rooms were clustered to enhance interactions not just between research teams but the group as a whole. About 40% of our alumni are either still in undergraduate programs or just graduated this spring (2019). Most indicate plans to apply to (or have already been admitted to) PhD or MD/PhD programs. Other alumni have, in large part, remained in science-related programs or employment with 15% enrolled in PHD or MS programs, 6% in MD programs, and 24% employed in science. Of the latter, many expressed an interest in ultimately continuing their graduate education either in PhD or MD/PhD programs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of the program, each of our REU teams had students attend local or national meetings to present their work (13 such presentations in all) including 3 teams to the national REU conference, and 2 to national CUR meetings. Three students have been co-authors on publications, a remarkable accomplishment for 10-week time frames in which the research is conducted. The Common Assessment tool consistently revealed gains in abilities to work in lab independently.&nbsp;All of the alumni who responded to our detailed survey indicated that their Northeastern REU experience enhanced their interest in and/or preparation for in research. Students commented specifically on the freedom provided to plan and execute experiments, to tackle complex programs, and gain numerous skills that helped their future research efforts, employment, and graduate programs.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/23/2019<br>      Modified by: Wendy&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460628/1460628_10355390_1563748305688_ForProjectOutcome_StudentsatTeamworkActivity--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460628/1460628_10355390_1563748305688_ForProjectOutcome_StudentsatTeamworkActivity--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Teamwork and Leadership Training"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460628/1460628_10355390_1563748305688_ForProjectOutcome_StudentsatTeamworkActivity--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Teamwork and Leadership Training"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students working on a teamwork exercise on the Northeastern University campus</div> <div class="imageCredit">Photos taken by REU PI's</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wendy&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smith</div> <div class="imageTitle">Teamwork and Leadership Training</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460628/1460628_10355390_1563748627802_ForProjectOutcome_Students_at_Microscopes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460628/1460628_10355390_1563748627802_ForProjectOutcome_Students_at_Microscopes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Research in progress"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460628/1460628_10355390_1563748627802_ForProjectOutcome_Students_at_Microscopes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Research in progress"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students studying the genetic basis of cellular movement</div> <div class="imageCredit">Photos taken by REU PI's</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wendy&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smith</div> <div class="imageTitle">Research in progress</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460628/1460628_10355390_1563748787343_ForProjectOutcome_REU_Nahant_cropped--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460628/1460628_10355390_1563748787343_ForProjectOutcome_REU_Nahant_cropped--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field trip to Northeastern Univ.
