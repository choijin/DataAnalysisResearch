<AbstractNarration>DePaul University will explore how to engage underrepresented youth in computational thinking activities both in and out of school. The project staff will explore how youth from different backgrounds engage in a citywide initiative called Chicago City of Learning (CCoL). CCoL provides STEM learning experiences both online and face-to-face with over 130 organizations. This  project seeks to understand what types of factors are most likely to engage youth in  computer science online learning opportunities. The project staff hope to discern how to string together computer science learning opportunities that lead to all youth developing  the interest, knowledge and skills to take computer science courses in high school and pursue careers in college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DePaul University will implement a design-based research agenda to design, implement and study the CCoL initiative. CCoL is designed to make visible to students and parents a network of organization-led and self-paced learning opportunities for youth. Students who participate in CCoL earn digital badges that visually represent their learning, achievement, and skill development from both face-to-face and self-paced learning opportunities. This project will develop 1) a set of self-paced, online learning activities that can then be shared and iterated upon by the larger community, 2) design principles around how to issue digital badges to support community engagement for underrepresented youth, 3) an anonymized dataset of the learning journeys of Chicago's youths through a shared set of computation face-to-face learning activities that can be analyze for patterns across gender, race, age, and geographic location and learning outcomes (e.g. specific badges earned), and 4) the scaling of the City of Learning initiative to other cities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Digital Youth Network?s (DYN?s)  Broaden Participation and Education in Computing (BPEC) Program was developed to create partnerships among youth-serving organizations to create inviting computing communities that are visible to underrepresented youth.  As DYN?s 13 years of work in underrepresented communities has shown, these youth are often unaware of how to access learning opportunities connected to their interests in STEM. Our efforts focus on understanding and increasing the participation of underrepresented youth (girls and students of color) in computing- focused activities. We use the Chicago City of Learning (CCOL) initiative as our context of design and research. CCOL is an initiative that focuses on engaging Chicago youth in informal STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) opportunities over the course of a year, with an emphasis on school breaks.  Our research approach is a design-based research agenda.  While the major goals of  our BPEC Project were as follows:   Map the landscape of Chicago?s computing opportunities to understand the multiple entry points and pathways into computing, particularly for underrepresented youth.  Create strategies for increasing visibility and engagement in computing opportunities (both online and in-person) in Chicago. Uncover important factors to consider when designing citywide structured pathways and entry points into computing.  Explore ways of to create effective, efficient, and engaging approaches to supporting the use of Minecraft in settings where one cannot expect all youth to have their own Minecraft account or teachers to have the prior experiences and knowledge to onboard and support youth exploration and discovery in Minecraft.    Through the support provided through this grant we were able to make considerable progress in each area and to extend the provided resources into additional research and programmatic efforts supported by National Science Foundation, Best Buy Foundation,  Comcast, and the MacArthur Foundation.  The analysis of the current state of computational making learning opportunities in Chicago and the barriers to participation led to a multitude of design-based research interventions focused on increasing both opportunities and students participation in available programs. Specifically, we implemented the following strategies for increasing visibility and engagement in computational making acitivities:  Extending      the resources from NSF in partnership with Best Buy and Comcast to launch      a data-driven mobile van initiative that provides coding and making camps      in communities that through the analysis of the Chicago City of Learning      initiative have the fewest community-based opportunities.   Code 60:  Hour of Code      volunteers consisted of college students, software professionals, and      DePaul faculty.  All volunteers for the Hour of Code event attended      a two-hour training.  Training consisted of an overview of      the day?s agenda, a walkthrough of the CCOL website, expert-led      discussions on how to mentor youth, and related resources.       Additionally, mentors were provided with a packet of resources to      prepare them for their volunteer shifts. Through additional funding from the MacArthur      Foundation we were able to implement in partnership with 4 community      afterschool program providers  a new      model for a community-based STEM afterschool network by working with 5      local schools to register and transport middle school age students to STEM      learning opportunities within the community.  This approach allowed us to pool learning      opportunities across schools thereby allowing students to engage in STEM      programming with community peers from different schools with shared      interests. This approach also decreased equipment and resource costs as we      able to offer larger full workshops at locations staffed to support      specific programming. Using the data we have documented over the years that      shows where coding and making opportunities are the fewest, we have for      the second year in a row, partner with the Chicago Housing Authority to create 12 hour coding and making camps to introduce youth to hands on STEM activities.  Hosted a checkout system for Minecraft      accounts that allows teachers to lease classroom sets of accounts that can      be used in and out of school thereby allowing students without personal      accounts to continue learning beyond the school day. Developed the ability to create achievements      in Minecraft and to  badge students      earning of Minecraft achievements Worked with school partners (e.g. CPS)       to understand how to represent Minecraft outcomes in ways that are      meaningful to teachers, schools, and administrators.
