<AbstractNarration>The Cooperative Election Study is a data infrastructure project involving the collaboration of research teams from over 70 different academic institutions.  Collectively, these research teams have fielded national surveys of 35,000 adults in 2006, 37,000 in 2008, and, with partial funding from NSF, 54,000 in 2010 and 55,000 in 2012.  Each research team that wishes to be involved in the project purchases a 1,000 person sample survey from the same firm.  Each individual team determines half of the questions on its survey.  The other half of the content, Common Content, is created by a design committee, drawn from the participating teams.  Common Content consists of questions that every team would like to measure or questions that are of broad interest and require a very large sample.  The project, thus, fields as many as the there are teams and also produces a single large sample survey that consists of the Common Content.  With 35 teams in 2006, there were 35 individual team surveys each with a sample of 1,000 and a single common survey of 35,000 cases.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survey, through the use of modules, encompasses a vast range of research topics that individual teams seek to answer.  Researchers have used their team modules to conduct standard survey research on particular themes and questions for which appropriate public use data are not available.  Others have used their modules to conduct experiments with political advertisements, pictures of candidates, information about the economy, and other treatments.  Since its inception, the survey has produced studies that have appeared in over 100 journal articles and dozens of books.  These include over a dozen articles that appeared in the top journals in the discipline as well as articles in law, sociology, statistics, and economics.  Studies utilizing this data have focused on a wide variety of topics including elections, voting behavior, public opinion, political parties and polarization, the opinion on wars and other military interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survey has helped to create and sustain a network of researchers interested in state and national elections, survey design, and public opinion.  Participants have included graduate students and undergraduates who not normally have access to surveys of this size.  These participants develop research skills especially in the area of questionnaire design, and generate further research ideas that can be pursued through this or other vehicles.  Additionally, the scholars involved in this project will continue to use the data to develop educational material relating to the survey that can be adopted widely as part of Political Science undergraduate and graduate curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study conducted a survey of 54,000 adults in the United States to understand better the attitudes and opinions of the American public and voting behavior in the 2014 elections. Participants in the survey were recruited to provide a nationally  representative sample, and they were interviewed two times, in October,  before the eleciton, and in November, after the election. This survey is the largest publicly available academic survey about public opinion and elections conducted in the United States.   Research teams from 48 different universities, involving hundreds of faculty and students across the United States, helped design the survey.   Each research team purchased a module (a 1,000 to 2,000 person sample) and each module consisted of questions asked every module and questions unique to that team's survey.   The questions common to each survey were combined into a single survey dataset, called the Common Content survey.   That Common Content dataset consists of 54,000 responses to the questions asked on every survey.   In addition, each team received a survey dataset consisting of 1,000 to 2,000 responses to the questions unique to that Team's survey.  In this way, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study coordinates many different research team's projects to create a very large sample survey of the entire United States.   The main products from this study are the datasets and surveys produced through the collaboration.  The 2014 CCES grant produced 49 distinct surveys, the Common Content Survey and 48 Team Surveys.  The Common Content and Team data are provided to the public for free through the Harvard University IQSS Dataverse.  http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cces/publications?page=1  To date there have already been 4,600 downloads of the Common Content database, and that is in addition to the distribution of the databases directly to the teams. To date there have been 35,000 downloads of CCES Common Content databases.  Further, researchers use the data developed using the CCES platform to write research articles and books about public opinion, voting behavior, and representation in the United States.  These data are also widely used in undergraduate and graduate student research projects and theses, as well as for instructional examples for data analysis and survey research design.
