<AbstractNarration>This project, developing an underwater network instrument, enables studying and collecting data from oceanic life and environment. The project builds this novel underwater network using current commercial products and develops new components that do not exist today. The instrument is built in a modular fashion so that improved hardware and software can constantly be developed and integrated. In addition, the team develops a modular protocol stack that addresses the constraints that exist with acoustic wireless networks. This project addresses the data exchange from the underwater sensors, robotics, and real-time video that requires fundamentally different modes of networking protocols and behaviors. Integration of computational capabilities to commercial communication units (Teledyne Benthos acoustic modems) will be developed to grant flexible and modular protocol stack implementation, with capabilities of network reconfiguration and instrument programming from remote locations. The instrument will be integrated with the Marine Science Center that will provide maintenance and management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance will be felt in a broad area of marine sciences where the instrument will provide the option to consistently collect and observe data in a large body of water. Many other science disciplines will be able to take advantage of the type of data exchange with this instrument, including environmental sciences dealing with natural and human caused catastrophes. Important discoveries can be expected in the area of innovative communications networks able to operate under the challenging conditions of underwater communications. Some of the output could be proposed as standards as a much desired network standard does not exist today.</AbstractNarration>
