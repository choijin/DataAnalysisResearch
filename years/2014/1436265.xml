<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Albany State University will implement a project entitled: Course-embedded Model Utilizing Nanoscience and Nanotechnology to Integrate Research based Projects into the Science Curriculum. The project will transform the undergraduate science curriculum at the institution by infusing nanotechnology based research in the laboratory.  Project objectives include the infusion of research experiences in chemistry, biology and physics courses; enhancement of students' content knowledge of the field of nanoscience and technology; and, enhancement of students' research and critical thinking skills. The broader impacts of the project are in the training of undergraduate students for interdisciplinary research, as well as outreach programs to K-12 students and professional development workshops for high school teachers to develop or adapt activities in nanotechnology for implementation into the K-12 curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integratation of research into the curriculum is accomplished by concentrating on three tracks of research in nanotechnology. The tracks are: the biomedical application of carbon nanomaterials, where synthesis, functionalization, characterization, wave-nanoparticle interactions and delivery applications of graphene and ferrite nanoparticles are investigated; the study of nanoparticles on living organisms where the focus is on the effect of nanoparticles on human cells, plants, and microorganisms and biological macromolecules; and an introduction of nanotechnology where students prepare gold nanoparticles under varying conditions and characterize and study their catalytic properties. This project connects the disciplines of chemistry, biology and physics using nanotechnology as the central theme for the integration of the research into the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the project is to transform the undergraduate science curriculum at the institution by infusing nanotechnology based research and inquiry based activities in the laboratory courses.  Specific objectives for the project are  1)      Implementation of inquiry based activities and research in majors' chemistry, biology and physics courses.  2)      Increase students' content knowledge of the field of nanoscience and technology.  3)      Improve students' research and critical thinking skills.  Research and Inquiry based activities were implemented into the STEM curriculum (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) using three broad themes centered around nanotechnology. These themes included 1) Chemistry at the nano-scale: An introduction to nanotechnology, 2) Biomedical application of carbon nanomaterials and 3) The effect of nanoparticles on living organisms.  Activities were implemented in over 50% of the STEM laboratory courses taken by both biology and chemistry majors.  These included five chemistry courses (general chemistry, organic chemistry, quantitative analysis, biochemistry and physical chemistry), one introductory physics course and two biology courses (principles of biology and microbiology and applications).  All biology, and chemistry majors at the institution take these courses. In addition, forensic science majors take all of the targeted chemistry courses. As a result the project impacted over 400 students per year during the project period.  Students learning gains and perceptions were assessed using 1) pre and post content tests and 2) pre and post surveys.  Pre and post content tests measured learning gains in two areas, knowledge and analytical thinking. Pre and post surveys assessed students' perceptions about the impact of the activities on their learning.  In all course implementations students showed increase in knowledge when comparing pre and post test results.  In order to determine if this could be attributed to implementation activities, where possible the data was compared with control groups that did not implement. The results were mixed depending on the course. Chemistry and physics courses comparison analysis with control groups showed that the increase in knowledge was higher for the implementation groups.  For biology implementation results showed the opposite; the learning gains were greater for the control group.  The size of the control group was much smaller than the implementation group and the pretest scores of the control group were also lower than the implementation group, which may have some bearings on the results. While students did do better on knowledge and comprehension questions regarding nanoscience and technology concepts, for questions that required higher ordered thinking (e.g. analysis and evaluation) students did not show any significant improvement on post-tests.  The results suggest that our model which involved at most four lab sessions for the project implementation in each class may not be enough time and exposure to the activities to effect significant leaning gains in critical and analytical thinking. Student assessments were administered right before after implementation and suggests that more prolonged engagement in these types of activities, where students are provided more time for immersion and exploration, is needed to promote learning at levels beyond the knowledge and comprehension stage.  While specific learning gains were mixed, the results of pre and post student surveys indicate that students perceived that the activities did positively impact their learning. Pre and post survey analysis of chemistry courses for example showed significant increase in the number of students that were satisfied or very satisfied (9 -16% increase) with their ability to carry out the following:  Develop their own scientific questions Select appropriate equipment to carry out a study Develop own experimental protocol Identify and control experimental parameters Present lab results to members Write an accurate full length lab report Work as an undergraduate research lab assistant in a      chemistry, biology or physics lab Safely conduct experiments   When asked to compare their experiences carrying out the research and inquiry based lab modules on nanotechnology with traditional (cook-book) labs that they had taken, at least 60% of students agreed or strongly agreed to the following:  The lab was more like a real-life situation allowed more in-depth analysis so the results were more      meaningful allowed me to be more involved in the experiments* help me to make connections among different concepts      and see the big picture helped me to learn the material* helped me to improve my oral and written communication      skills gave me more time to complete the tasks with less      pressure enabled me to work more independently   * Over 80% of students in chemistry courses  Over 400 students, primarily African American, benefited over the project period. The results were disseminated to a broad audience through twelve presentations at regional and national conferences. In addition training sessions were provided to area high school teachers and demonstrations and hand-on engagement activities to high school students during career day visits as well as during campus visitations.
