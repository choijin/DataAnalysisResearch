<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the STEM instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students.  Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.  The Pre-Engineering Education Collaboratives (PEEC) strand of TCUP is designed to increase the number of American Indians in engineering by helping tribal colleges establish two-year pre-engineering courses and degrees that seamlessly articulate to four-year engineering programs, and to provide research and service learning projects that are regionally and culturally relevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sisseton Wahpeton College, a tribal college located in South Dakota, will convene a workshop for the sixteen partner institutions that are involved in the four PEEC projects. The workshop will provide a forum for PEEC administrators, faculty, and researchers to share and learn new strategies for pre-engineering study geared toward American Indian tribal college students. New models for effective engineering degree tracks, appropriate curricula, methods of instructional delivery, along with the necessary support mechanisms will be discussed helping to assure tribal college students successfully earn engineering degrees.  At the workshop, projects will present what qualitative and quantitative outcomes have been achieved and what could have been done differently. Projects will be asked to identify issues they encountered that hindered the PEEC process along with any implemented or planned solutions. Identifying strategies for continued funding will be a critical workshop outcome.  A formal report will be written that captures the workshop findings and recommendations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funded in 2010, the Pre-Engineering Education Collaboratives (PEEC) represents a unique partnership between more than a dozen Native-serving colleges and several public universities with strong engineering degree programs.  The workshop provided a forum for PEEC administrators, faculty, and researchers to share and learn new strategies for pre-engineering study geared toward American Indian tribal college students.  New models for effective engineering degree tracks, appropriate curriculum, methods of instructional delivery, along with the necessary support mechanisms were shared as best practices to ensure that tribal college students successfully earn engineering degrees.   As the PEEC program was completing their first years of development, workshop participants were able to draw upon their five-years of experience to identify the more successful outreach and educational strategies.  These included:  Community involvement built stronger and more relevant programs, which contributed to student persistence. Student cohorts are difficult to maintain, especially when a large percentage of students are non-traditional.  Part-time students and varying levels of college preparedness advocate towards the development of other methods of social and academic engagement. Student recruitment required far greater resources and time than originally anticipated, and that more outreach to the K-12 level would be very beneficial. Developing engineering collaboratives that will effectively create pathways for a significant number of Native American/Native Hawaiian students to become engineers is an incremental process.  The partnerships developed and the graduates of this PEEC initiative serve as important role models, however the challenges faced by these communities require a commitment greater than five years to overcome.
