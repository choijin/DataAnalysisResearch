<AbstractNarration>This proposal concerns the relation between two different areas of algebra: group theory, the abstract study of symmetry, and algebraic number theory, the study of algebraic numbers, like the square root of 2 (as opposed to transcendental numbers, like pi).  The main link between these two fields is provided by algebraic geometry, the geometry of systems of polynomial equations in several variables.  A key theme in the proposed work is monodromy, which encapsulates the symmetries revealed by a parametrized system as the parameter follows a closed loop.   Monodromy problems arise in many settings, in both pure and applied mathematics.  For instance some of the techniques under study in this proposal have been used by the proposer and others to determine which kinds of computations can be carried out by different kinds of quantum computer.  Algebraic number theory has found important practical applications, especially in the development of modern cryptosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this proposal is group theory in relation to algebraic number theory.  The main goal is to use group theory as a tool, for instance in analyzing images of l-adic Galois representations, or Mordell-Weil groups of abelian varieties over Galois extensions of the rationals.  The secondary goal is to study groups, especially linear groups, using methods from number theory and algebraic geometry, including the circle method, etale cohomology, and deformation theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to better understand the interplay of ideas between two different areas of algebra: group theory (which is the abstract study of symmetry) and algebraic number theory (which is the study of systems of numbers satisfying polynomial equations with rational coefficients).  The main link between these two fields is provided by algebraic geometry (the geometry of systems of polynomial equations in several variables).  A key theme in the proposed work is monodromy, which encapsulates the symmetries revealed by a parametrized family of geometric objects as the  parameter follows a closed loop.  Progress on this project required effectively applying ideas from group theory to algebraic geometry and number theory or the other way around.     Intellectual Merit     Results of the first kind are exemplified by the proposer's recently accepted paper with Chun Yin Hui titled ``Maximality of Galois actions for abelian and hyperkahler varieties''.  This gives a new strategy for proving that certain symmetry groups appearing in algebraic geometry are ``as large as possible''.  Results of this kind have a long history, in some sense beginning with Gauss' famous 1796 compass-and-straightedge construction of the 17-gon.   Results of the second kind are exemplified by proposer's recent solution of the ``probabilistic Waring problem for finite simple groups''  in a series of three papers with Robert Guralnick, Aner Shalev, Pham Tiep.  The classical Waring problem, solved by Hilbert in 1909, says that every whole number can be written as a bounded sum of nth powers for each n, for instance every whole number is the sum of four perfect squares.  The analogous problem in finite group theory was solved by the proposer, Shalev, and Tiep; the new work can be thought of as roughly analogous to the improvement on Hilbert's result by Hardy and Littlewood, who succeeded in estimating the number of such representations.     Broader Impacts     During the time of grant support, three students completed their Ph.D.s under the supervision of the proposer, and three more began their thesis work.  The thesis problems of four of these six students are within the scope of the proposal.          Last Modified: 11/03/2019       Submitted by: Michael J Larsen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
