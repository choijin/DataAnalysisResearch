<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-B (CSDM-B) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Pengfei Wang of the University of Alabama at Birmingham is studying new photochemical reactions to develop photoremovable protecting groups (PPGs) for potential applications in chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, medicine, and materials science.   PPGs are indispensable tools that are used in a broad range of basic and applied research areas, especially when removal of protecting groups under neutral and reagent-free conditions with precise spatial and temporal control is desired. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of new PPGs as well as the development of a training ground for students (including students from underrepresented groups) in an academic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The photochemical release of an amino group is of great importance in many research areas. However, direct release of an amino group by photochemically breaking the C-N bond in a fast, primary photochemical process is rare.  This project focuses on the development of new photochemical reactions and their applications in the development of structurally simple and mechanistically novel photolabile protecting groups for nitrogen (amines), sulfur (thiols) and other atoms. New PPGs with different chemical/photochemical properties, largely based upon photosolvolysis of trityl derivatives, are being examined and optimized.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Clean, fast, and mild photochemical cleavage of covalent bonds is important to many research areas, especially when reactions taking place under mild and reagent-free conditions with precise spatial and temporal control are desired.

PPGs are protecting groups to be removed with light, and they are indispensable tools in a broad range of basic and applied research areas. The goal of this project is to enrich the current PPG arsenal with structurally simple and practical PPGs that have different chemical/photochemical properties to complement the existing PPGs and meet the increasing demands from various research areas. With the support of NSF, we have developed a series of robust new PPGs for protection of carbonyl, hydroxyl (including diol), carboxyl, and amino groups. Others and we have also explored applications of these new PPGs in organic synthesis, photoactivated prodrugs, photorelease of perfumes in solid phase, photocleavage of block copolymers, light-controlled hydrogel formation, and surface patterning. We also envision that our new discoveries such as the C-N bond formation photochemistry will find a broad spectrum of applications, especially in biomedical/tissue engineering. This project has contributed a great deal to the human resource development. Two postdoctoral associates, 2 graduate students, 11 undergraduate students (and 9 of them from underrepresented groups) and one high school student have participated in the research since 2014.
