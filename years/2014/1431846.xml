<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of how high school physics can have a maximum positive impact on students' self-perceptions, thus noticeably impacting their outcomes in this subject matter. Its focus is on the development of a positive physics identity (students' perceptions of themselves in relation to this field in terms of competence, performance, persistence, interest, and recognition by others) among high school students, particularly females, as a means to increase their academic performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary data analysis from an ongoing NSF-funded project (GSE/RES 0624444) suggests a strong correlation between the physics identity construct (e.g., Do you see yourself as a physics person?) and the study's proposed physics identity measures (i.e., performance, competence, recognition, and interest). Although most students, especially females, conveyed depressed attitudes toward themselves as physics learners, as well as toward the discipline, those who expressed favorable perceptions toward physics learning identified a set of activities that appear to affect the development of a positive physics identity: (a) focus on conceptual understanding, (b) frequency of laboratory activities that address their beliefs, (c) frequency of opportunities to share and interact, (d) teacher encouragement, and (e) holding discussions on current relevant science topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI hypothesizes that students in general, and females in particular, develop depressed attitudes toward physics, and negative perceptions of themselves as physics learners due to the lack of personally meaningful learning experiences. Thus, she submits the following research questions: (1) What high school physics teaching practices predict physics identity development?; (2) How do these strategies influence physics identity development, especially mediated by perceptions of their performance, competence, recognition, and interest?; (3) What is the long-term impact of these experiences on physics identity as students traverse their undergraduate careers?; and (4) What is the most appropriate pedagogical plan for high school physics teachers to ensure adequate development of positive physics identity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study's proposed methods consist of case studies, a longitudinal study, development of a pedagogical plan, and the implementation of this plan. Classroom case studies of successful teachers draw on the previously referred survey of which 348 (90 females) finished high school physics with a self-rating as a physics person (5 on a 0-5 scale), including positive perceptions of instructional and leaning experiences. The longitudinal study aims at understanding the long-term impact of specific pedagogical practices on students' physics identity,including 15 students (8 females) who will be tracked over 3 to 4 years through surveys and interviews at the end of each academic year. Development of the pedagogical plan will include 15 sample lesson plans with detailed activities that connect physics content to real-world contexts, counter stereotypes about physics, analysis of underrepresentation in physics, and physics identity formative assessments. The plan will be tested through a quasi-experimental study with four teachers using the same physics course with at least two groups. Each teacher will implement the plan in one of the groups; the other group will be used as control. Of the 180 physics classes, approximately 15 (one every two weeks) will use the education plan. A physics identity scale will be administered at the beginning and end of each course. Classroom observations will be conducted while the plan is implemented.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has shed light on the importance of high school physics teachers and their practices for attracting more women to physics.  Indeed, high school may be the last time point where a large number of women can be engaged to learn and persist in physics with the help of a supportive high school teacher (Figure 1, representation of women in physics at various educational levels).  In terms of intellectual merit, the project deepened our understanding of how and why particular physics teacher practices facilitate students? physics identity development.  In other words, how teachers can help more students feel capable, interested, and recognized in physics, particularly women who suffer the greatest attitudinal setbacks in physics.  The project resulted in several publications in leading journals which:  (i) Described and tested a theory for measuring physics identity (Figure 2, physics identity framework);  (ii) Explored how physics identity differs by gender and race/ethnicity (Figure 3, gender differences in physics identity across select race/ethnicity groups);  (iii) Identified teachers? practices related to physics identity development, particularly for women (Figure 4, testing strategies for women);  (iv) Investigated why these practices may be impactful (Figure 5, connecting teacher practices to students? physics identities);  (v) Examined the longitudinal influence of teachers? practices and tested the effect of a workshop that exposed teachers to practices that facilitate students? physics identity development.   Given these intellectual contributions, the project has significantly advanced work on disciplinary identity in physics in both theoretical and practical ways.  The practical strategies involve engaging students in learning physics in ways that allow them to feel capable even when challenged, capture their interests, and recognize their abilities in multiple ways.  The broader impact of the project included communicating the results of this research to science education researchers, teacher educators, and physics teachers to promote change in practice.  These results include the empirically-tested framework for physics identity development and, importantly, a set of practical pedagogical strategies for high school physics teachers to use in their classrooms.  The results of this work directly reached the teachers participating in the study and the hundreds of students they teach each year.  In addition, strategies that specifically help women develop physics identities were not only disseminated but also used by participating teachers.   This is important since women represent only a fifth of physics undergraduates even though they make up roughly half the overall population.  Furthermore, gender differences in physics identity are consistent across different race/ethnicity groups.  Given that attracting more women to physics is one of the most pressing concerns for broadening participation in physics, this project has led to subsequent grant proposals focused on national initiatives to recruit more women to physics which are in collaboration with the American Association of Physics Teachers and the American Physical Society.
