<AbstractNarration>In principle, quantum computers can use the physics of atoms and molecules to perform calculations ranging from code-breaking to simulation of materials algorithmically faster than any conventional supercomputer.  The main challenge for building a quantum computer is that quantum components are prone to error. Error correction can be used to overcome this challenge but it places stringent requirements on future quantum computer hardware. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path for bridging the gap between current physical hardware and large-scale quantum algorithms. Specifically how a state-of-the-art quantum error correction scheme, the surface code, behaves when mapped to realistic physical architectures will be examined.  If successful, this research will help experimentalists build the first universal scalable quantum computer. The research will train graduate students and undergraduate students in the growing field of quantum information science and provide them with an opportunity to work with industrial collaborators at IBM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal expands the frontiers of physics by exploring quantum computation at the intersection of experimental devices, computer architecture, and quantum information theory. Surface codes with a computational error threshold of 1% are a promising solution to the problem of decoherence and imperfections in quantum systems. Computation is performed by the creation, annihilation, and braiding of topological defects.  Examining this process from the perspective of algorithms and architectures will help reveal common structures and provide a precise method for implementation of these ideas on real physical systems. Surface code implementations that account for realistic noise models and system-level constraints will be examined.  This will leverage previous work in experimental device data, quantum circuit synthesis tools, computer architecture, and quantum programming languages and compilers.  Additionally, there will be close collaboration with Sergey Bravyi at IBM (including summer internships at IBM for students) on the theoretical foundations of this work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum computers promise an advantage over conventional computers for a number of important problems ranging from decoding secret messages to understanding chemical processes. We cannot yet achieve this promise because current quantum computers are of limited size and are sensitive to noise. There is a growing academic, industrial and government effort to build large, robust quantum computers.  Quantum error correction is a method to build sturdy quantum computers by making logical quantum bits (qubits) from error-prone physical qubits. It comes at a cost of both increasing the amount of physical qubits needed to build the quantum computer and increasing the complexity of performing algorithms.  Even with this extra cost, quantum computers are expected to retain an exponential advantage over conventional computers.  The intellectual merit of this project is to examine the actual additional cost of quantum error correction for a realistic description of the physical qubits and a variety of quantum error correction codes.  The work has focused on two physical qubit platforms, trapped atomic ions and superconductor qubits, which are currently at the forefront of quantum information experiments.  The lessons learned about mapping algorithms to physical systems are expected to apply to other physical platforms. The project was a collaborative proposal between Georgia Tech, Chicago, and IBM (unfunded).  The project had two significant scientific outcomes.  First, we performed a detailed architectural study of two distinct implementations of the surface code, currently the quantum error correction code with the best overall performance, using superconducting qubits. The result showed that the standard method of implementing the surface code based on double-defect qubits is often less efficient than using patches of planar qubits.  In both cases, communication by quantum teleportation is necessary to avoid algorithmic bottlenecks. Second, we explored how the underlying noise source affects the performance of quantum error correction codes. We found that physically motivated errors can lead to either increase or reduce the cost of error correction relative to the simple standard noise model. The increase was expected, but the reduction points towards the value of developing quantum error correction codes that match the inherent noise of the quantum computer.  The broader impacts of the project were primarily the training of students in this interdisciplinary field. This project has supported two graduate students and an undergraduate student.  The three students came from three different disciplines: Chemistry, Computational Science and Engineering, and Physics.  One graduate student had the opportunity to intern at IBM and experience the similarities and differences between academic and industrial research.
