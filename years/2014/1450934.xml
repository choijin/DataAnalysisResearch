<AbstractNarration>The International Research Network Connections Network Operations Center (IRNC NOC) serves as a cooperative point of contact and communications for IRNC network management, providing consolidated network monitoring, reporting, and operational visibility for the IRNC program.  The IRNC NOC facilitates a single set of operational expectations for all IRNC funded infrastructure programs; this enables greater availability of IRNC infrastructure and improves results in troubleshooting multi-domain network issues.  A central data repository created by the IRNC NOC provides critical operational information; monitoring data and performance metrics in support of NSF funded science and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IRNC NOC end-to-end Performance Engagement Team (E2E PET) provides centrally guided and well-coordinated end-to-end performance incident management. The E2E PET coordinates activities with the IRNC Exchange Point and Backbone programs as well as international partners, enabling efficient and timely troubleshooting of end to end performance issues spanning the continents.  The IRNC NOC works together with these programs to create a common framework for handling end-to-end performance problems.  An IRNC NOC Advisory Council with representation from each of the awarded backbone, exchange point, and measurement projects guides interaction to ensure consistent operational practices across the IRNC programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IRNC: Network Operations Center (NOC) provided 24x7x365 operational service to the IRNC-funded network infrastructure projects.  These networks support the high-performance connectivity required by the international research and education communities for data intensive science.  The IRNC: NOC?s operational support helped ensure that the networks were operational and performant by minimizing network performance issues.  In doing so, the IRNC: NOC helped facilitate scientific research and collaboration to the South Pacific, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas (Latin, South, and North).     In addition, the IRNC: NOC Performance Engagement Team (PET) provided support to the IRNC community by helping debug and optimize data transfers across wide-area networks.  In conjunction with host network engineers, the PET was able to address some of the challenges that disrupt end-to-end network performance.  In the latter days of the project, the PET collaborated with the new IRNC Engagement and Performance Center (EPOC) on similar issues.  This synergistic interaction provided additional benefit to users worldwide.  The IRNC: NOC software and systems team developed a Global Research Map which provided a live, visual status of the IRNC network infrastructure. It was later expanded to include other global and U.S. domestic research and education networks outside of the IRNC program.  This provided valuable utility to both end users and network support staff in their efforts to debug problems and research network traffic flows.  The Global Research Map will continue to remain available to network communities at the end of this project.      While the impact of the project was quite broad, it was also localized by providing valuable experience and training to the IRNC: NOC staff, including several graduate assistants who assisted with the project.  The efforts of the IRNC: NOC also helped improve operational best practices, standards and provide exposure to other IRNC projects which support researchers and the broader research &amp; education network community.  These merits will continue to prove beneficial in the future.       Last Modified: 04/20/2021       Submitted by: David E Jent]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
