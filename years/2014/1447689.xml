<AbstractNarration>Standards for data exchange are critical to the development of any field.  They enable researchers and practitioners to exchange information reliably, apply a variety of tools to their problems, and reproduce scientific results.  The COmputational MOdeling in Biology NEtwork (COMBINE) was created in 2010 to organize standardization efforts for systems biology.  This effort includes, among others, the systems biology markup language (SBML) for mathematical modeling; the biological pathways exchange language (BioPAX) for describing pathways; and the systems biology graphical notation (SBGN) for visual representations.  In a separate effort, the synthetic biology community is developing the synthetic biology open language (SBOL).  While synthetic biology has many unique requirements, there are also a lot of overlapping features such as the need to construct mathematical models, describe pathways, and provide visual representations.  It is important to join these efforts, such that, the synthetic biology community can leverage existing standards enabling the sharing of tools and other infrastructure.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help enable these two communities to meet together at COMBINE's HARMONY 2015 meeting to be held in Wittenberg, Germany on April 20th to 24th (http://co.mbine.org/events/HARMONY_2015).   Workshops like this one are instrumental in making progress in the development of these standards.    Currently, most standardization efforts are either unfunded or only have very limited support.  Indeed, the success of these standards has been due to the donation of time from many individuals to participate in discussions, write specifications, serve as standard editors, and attend workshops.  Many of these individuals working on the development of SBOL are students based in the US who would otherwise find it difficult to find the funds to attend this meeting.   Therefore, this project would help support travel expenses for these US-based students working on the SBOL standard to travel to Germany for HARMONY 2015.  Not only would this be a valuable experience for these students, but it would also greatly enhance our goal of bringing together researchers in synthetic biology with those working in systems biology leading to integrated standards and shared software and infrastructure.  The goals of this workshop will be to (1) develop synergistic relationships between systems and synthetic biology researchers; (2) provide a tighter integration of standard development for systems and synthetic biology; (3) perform outreach to modelers and experimentalists; and (4) discuss a coordinated effort to advocate the use of standards in publications and archival databases to enhance reproducibility of scientific results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported travel expenses for three graduate students and two postdoctoral fellows to attend HARMONY 2015 in Wittenberg, Germany.  This event is organized annually by the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE).  The goal of this event is to promote the development of the standards and supporting infrastructure for systems and synthetic biology, as well as, interoperability between these standards.  The primary COMBINE standards are the systems biology markup language (SBML), systems biology graphical notation (SBGN), simulation experiment description markup language (SED-ML), the biological pathway (BioPAX) description language, the cell markup language (CellML), and the synthetic biology open language (SBOL).  This was the first HARMONY in which SBOL participated, which marked the expansion of the COMBINE community into synthetic biology.    At HARMONY, there are not many oral presentations; instead, the majority of the time is devoted to community discussions and software development.  A major focus of this meeting was promoting interactions between synthetic biology standards and systems biology standards.  For example, there were several discussions related to visualization of synthetic biology designs using a combination of symbols from SBOL Visual and SBGN.  Another major outcome of this meeting was the development of the specification document for SBOL Version 2.0.  SBOL Version 2.0 extends SBOL beyond modeling designs composed of DNA to those including more general components such as RNAs, proteins, etc.  It also adds some qualitative modeling aspects, including a means to connect SBOL to the systems biology modeling standards of SBML and CellML.  The specification document that was written largely during this meeting was recently published in the Journal of Integrative Biology.  Another major outcome of this meeting was a beta version of libSBOLj 2.0, a java library supporting SBOL.  This library enables software developers to add support to their tools for SBOL 2.0.  A paper describing this library is under review for the IEEE Life Sciences Letters journal.  This grant was instrumental in these outcomes.  A large segment of the synthetic biology community working on SBOL is in the United States, and the five students who participated with help from this grant work in this area.  Two of the students are editors of the SBOL standard, and they have been instrumental in the development of SBOL Version 2.0.  Another student has been a primary devleoper of libSBOLj.  All five students are developers of software that use SBOL.  Without this grant, it would have been prohibitively expensive for them to attend.
