<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  Organic photovoltaic devices (OPV) provide opportunities for a low cost solar energy technology, but improved materials are critical to commercial viability.  Undergraduate participants in the Rochester Institute of Technology REU Site will (i) conduct research to develop materials while (ii) learning the theory of OPV operation and (iii) engineering new device architectures.  Thus, the project will provide a blueprint for substantiating the expansion from laboratory prototypes to mass-produced units and will help build an educated and experienced workforce to tackle ongoing issues in energy and sustainability.  Broader impacts of the program will also be achieved through dissemination of findings on (i) engaging deaf students in undergraduate research,  (ii) outreach, recruitment, and retention of "2+2" or "2+3" students who choose a community college or small 4-year institution to complete general education requirements and then transfer into a strong science, technology or engineering program to complete a bachelor's degree.  These students often enter a research-focused university underprepared for the rigor of science and engineering and lagging in technology exposure.  Success associated with the broad theme of organic photovoltaics may enable affordable, sustainable OPV energy systems that contribute to US energy independence and a low-cost, portable technology vital for energy in developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This project is centered on the development of improved materials targeted for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, which will contribute to a broad portfolio of solar energy technologies.  Within the scope of the proposal, the undergraduates will participate in (i) experimental validation of simple theoretical components that will lead to well-directed and implementable synthesis strategies and (ii) manufacture and testing of prototype photovoltaic devices.  The project will build upon RIT's functional printing strengths to bring OPV technology closer to commercial manufacture through ink development and substrate modification.  Participating students will develop a fundamental understanding of how their chosen field of science contributes to the interdisciplinary nature of OPV materials research.  The students will participate in extramurally funded research projects and as co-authors of resulting peer-reviewed publications and/or national conference presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  Over the lifetime of the award, the subject of Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) has been the unifying glue that became a natural focus for our assembled faculty team of chemists, physicists, computational theorists and engineers.  REU participants chemically synthesized new materials, which were then characterized using techniques such as X-ray diffraction and surface microscopy. The materials were then tested in OPV devices with device efficiency being correlated to those characterized materials properties. Theoretical work also led to an understanding of how structural properties would lead to better control of excited state populations, which are so important for device efficiency. When theory was validated with successful simulation this would also lead to improved rational design of valuable future molecules.  Multi-functional printing of perovskite devices was also investigated and compared with more typical spin-coated prototypes in collaborative work between research groups. In addition, other printing projects based initially on OPV device application subsequently led to successful research offshoots. Projects that began with microemulsions and functional materials to make inks for OPV evolved into 3D bioprinting. Similarly, beyond using production scale printing processes for OPV, functional nanomaterial metal oxide compositions were deposited, designed to produce a wide variety of sensors and actuators for aerospace and medical applications. Nanostructured materials were also developed to make inorganic photovoltaics, complementing research directly associated with OPV.  Projects to develop redox flow batteries involving nanostructured graphene allowed a connection between the generation of energy from sunlight and the ability to store that energy. Furthermore the thread of nanostructured carbon was carried from these redox flow batteries into the separation and purification of carbon nanotubes for use as dopants into OPV devices.  Critically, all the projects linked to organic photovoltaics, which allowed the students to feel connected to the long term need for sustainable renewable energy. However there were so many creative possibilities for research to blossom beyond of the scope of the project outlines that were initially developed.     Broader Impact  One targeted broader impact for this program was to provide opportunities for freshmen and sophomores at smaller colleges and community colleges with little to no opportunities to do undergraduate research to work in a graduate level research environment. In STEM research, there is a divide between such schools and nationally ranked research based institutions. The student who enrolls in a research institution is immediately exposed to a culture of scholarship with faculty for whom the expectation is to create opportunities for undergraduate experiences in the laboratory, but students enrolled in early STEM courses at community colleges or smaller schools may remain in an educational environment with little to no research exposure.  In this program we heavily marketed to students from smaller/community colleges and provided the additional summer research opportunities that allowed them to springboard forward, while not interfering with their dedication to academic year courses and study. We provided a framework that delivered purposeful exposure to structured research activities in a dynamic environment. All of our students thrived and for the most part have gone on to engage in post-graduate scientific research.    The program engaged students in collaborative research allowing each to begin the process of building skills to support their academics, self-efficacy, and understanding of the culture of research. When the student worked directly with a team including a faculty member, graduate students and RIT undergraduates, they built their own capacity to function in an advanced technological environment. Students participated in weekly journal club, team research meetings, research facility tours, and events to hone scientific writing skills and scientific ethics. Throughout the program, students developed resiliency, personal leadership, use of academic supports and financial literacy.  Of note, three students worked through critical thinking and literature review  projects in the summer of 2020 as the program was brought to these  participants through intense remote interactions while the university  was closed because of COVID19 restrictions. Students benefited by  building self-motivation and self-reliance, both critically valuable as  they face new challenges when universities rely so heavily on remote  learning in the midst of the pandemic.  Besides the impact directly aligned with student success, the work completed has helped to enable affordable, sustainable OPV energy systems, as part of a portfolio leading to energy independence in the USA and a low-cost, portable technology vital for energy in developing countries. Through the interdisciplinary collaboration, the program formally promoted discussion on the deployment of advanced materials for emerging applications for future research projects.  As a result of the team’s efforts to address more significant inclusive excellence for under-represented minorities and community college students, the PI for this proposal has played a significant role as a research mentor in RIT’s ongoing Inclusive Excellence initiative, now funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI).
