<AbstractNarration>Information Centric Networks (ICNs) promise to fundamentally change the way we think of communication, moving from location-specific interactions to name-based communication. Names identify anything from users and devices, to content and even virtual entities.  ICN has been recognized as a key direction to architect the Future Internet, as evidenced by the efforts currently supported by the NSF's Future Internet Architecture (FIA) projects, especially Named Data Networking (NDN) and MobilityFirst. The two approaches have fundamental differences in naming (hierarchical human and machine readable names for NDN versus flat identifiers for MobilityFirst and in name resolution ('in-band' versus 'out-of-band'). Developing a way to interoperate between these different network architectures will therefore be an important area on which to focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will broadly address the interoperability of network architectures that use differing approaches for naming and name resolution.  This is a fundamental and evolving issue that is likely to be of increasing and significant concern as networks evolve to become more information centric. While the NDN and MobilityFirst FIA projects are two specific approaches for information centric networking, they are symptomatic of the fundamental ways in which networks may evolve in supporting name resolution (which is needed not just for information centric environments, but also for seamless mobility, which MobilityFirst seeks to also achieve) and structuring names. Examining interoperation of architectures of different types of naming and name resolution will be of value in the long term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the primary reasons for this effort is that approaches to reason about interoperability of name-based network architectures are at an early stage.  This project uses a somewhat new approach to reasoning about interoperability by developing both abstractions related to specific issues in network architectures and also looking at specific examples of the two still evolving FIA architectures. The outcome of this exploratory effort will be specific abstractions that can then be used as a design pattern for interoperability between architectures. Over the last two years, the principal investigator (PI) has worked with both NDN and MobilityFirst, and is in a unique position to undertake this effort.  The PI expects to find novel ways of integrating simulation and testbed experiments to evaluate scalability and performance of the interoperability architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort will have a beneficial impact on the entire NSF FIA program as a result of the in-depth understanding of the tradeoffs being made in the different FIA Architectures. It is expected that the architectural contribution from this project will be the development of mechanisms and protocols for inter-working between the NDN and MobilityFirst architectures. This will yield long-term benefits for the evolution of the Internet to a future information-oriented architecture, as intended by the FIA program. The project will also directly support two graduate students at UC Riverside, one of America's most diverse research-intensive universities and one of only a handful of accredited research-intensive Hispanic Serving Institutions. The principal investigator will offer a new graduate level course on FIA, and disseminate his educational materials as well as his research results.</AbstractNarration>
