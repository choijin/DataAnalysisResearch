<AbstractNarration>Biofouling is a significant problem which occurs when a biosensor is exposed to a complex medium (i.e. blood, plasma, or urine) that contains moieties other than the analyte of interest. Effects of biofouling can include false positives and decreased limits of detection. This project focuses on the continued development of an inexpensive, portable, and easy to use biosensor. The sensor is customizable and enables sensing of a variety of antigens in a physician's office, at a patient's bedside, or in a patient's home. The current design includes a single surface acoustic wave (SAW chip) that simultaneously senses an antigen and removes biofouling for the detection of cancer markers. Through this project, the team will optimize the sensor design, develop a commercially feasible product, identify a customer base, and validate business hypotheses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this technology is its ability to impact the health of large populations of people who do not have access to quality screening/tests for various life-threatening diseases. This is more evident in developing countries, where a need for tests and test devices for infectious diseases is vital. The market for biosensors is growing because of the push to move diagnostic testing out of large clinical laboratories into decentralized settings such as physicians' offices and walk-in clinics. Implementation of effective point-of-care (POC) tests will not only impact the lives of individuals, but can reduce time in and costs to hospitals, which will result in a more efficient healthcare system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This ICorps project resulted in several advances to the surface acoustic wave biosensor platform under development, and trained two graduate students, the PI and an industrial mentor in the customer discovery process.  Specifically, removal of nonspecific binding of proteins on sensor surfaces was shown to be removal by Rayleigh acoustic waves generated in a SAW device fabricated in ST-quartz.  This results is of use in developing biosensors for use in directly quantifying disease biomarkers in bodily fluids such as blood and urine.  The same acoustic wave were shown to improve incubation times by causing micro-mixing in the sensing medium, leading to faster responses.  Several details related to develepment of a prototype were addressed as well.  Silver nanocubes dispersed on the sensor surface were shown to enhance fluorescence signals via the metal-enhance-fluorescence phenomena, allowing for detection limits to be lowered by a factor of 1000.  This immunosensing modality can be integrated into the SAW NSB-removal and mixing platform, to develop an immunofluoresensor platform.      The customer discovery process followed by the team allowed for a sharp perspective on what direction this prototype development could take.  This project resulted in the team continuing on that customer discovery and commercialization path.  The team has incorporated a company since this project started, and has started developing commercial collaborations and funding sources.  The two graduate students obtained their Ph.D. and M.S. degrees, respectively.  Two new patents on this technology were filed, and IP licensing negotiations were started.  Three journal articles were published, and several conference presentations were made, with 4 resulting in conference proceedings.
