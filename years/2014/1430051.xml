<AbstractNarration>Large volcanic eruptions produce stratospheric sulfate aerosols that can persist for one to two years following the eruption. In addition to a reduction in global-mean temperature over this time period, the aerosols can produce regional climatic responses including reductions in tropical monsoon rainfall, winter warming over the Northern Hemisphere continents, and possibly an increase in the likelihood of El Nino events. While these effects may only last for one or two years, the impact on subsurface ocean temperatures can last longer, up to several decades for water masses below the thermocline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to determine the extent to which the above climatic consequences are predictable. While the eruptions themselves are not predictable, the amount of sulfate injected into the stratosphere can be determined within days of an eruption, and this information may suffice to determine the volcanic influence over the years to decades following an eruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large part of the research effort is devoted to identifying the volcanic signal in climate simulations from multi-model ensembles including the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project versions 3 and 5 (CMIP3, CMIP5), the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project versions 2 and 3 (PMIP2, PMIP3), and the NCAR Large Ensemble (LE) and Past Millenium (PM) simulations. Several aspects of the simulations will be evaluated as part of this effort, including the nature of the volcanic forcing used, the state of the atmosphere and ocean (in terms of climatic fluctuations associated with El Nino and other climate modes) at the time of the eruption, and the effect of the eruption on stratospheric ozone.  Following this analysis the Principal Investigator and his team will conduct a suite of climate simulations with the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1).  A number of simulations will be performed including simulations of past volcanic eruptions and simulations of eruptions starting at specific climate states (e.g. the warm and cold phases of El Nino).  Simulations will also consider the predictability of climatic effects as a function of the size, location (particularly high latitude versus low latitude), and time of year of the eruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has societal broader impacts due to the substantial human impacts that eruption-induced climate fluctuations can have.  Work performed under this award could contribute to the development of a forecasting system for the long-term climatic disruptions following volcanic eruptions, which would enable adaptation efforts for communities likely to be adversely affected.  In addition, the project supports a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             This grant supported research on the impacts of volcanic eruptions on climate.  The main results were:  - Volcanic eruptions caused the Little Ice Age.  - Volcanic eruptions cause El Ni&ntilde;os.  - The 1783 Laki volcanic eruption did not cause the unusual summer warming in Europe that year.  - Climate models can still not reliably simulate the conversion of volcanic sulfur dioxide injections into the stratosphere to sulfuric acid droplets and the subsequent distribution of the resulting cloud around the world.  - The red and yellow sky in the famous Edward Munch paintings of "The Scream" may have been the sunset from the 1883 Krakatau eruption or may have been noctilucent clouds.              I worked to help organize the Model Intercomparison Project on the climatic response to Volcanic forcing (VolMIP).  In this project, many different climate models are doing the same simulation to evaluate how well they can reproduce what actually happened.  We started with the largest eruption of the past 500 years, the 1815 Tambora eruption, which produced the 1816 "Year Without a Summer."  In preliminary calculations, we discovered that models produce different results in terms of where the volcanic cloud goes, which points to the need for more analysis.              In separate work we reinforced previous findings that a series of large volcanic eruptions at the end of the 13th Century cooled the Arctic so much that it initiated the Little Ice Age, which did not end until human greenhouse gases emissions became the dominant cause of climate change a century ago.  The volcanic cooling changed ocean currents so that they were blocked from warming the Arctic during that period.              We also showed that large tropical volcanic eruptions increase the chances that there will be an El Ni&ntilde;o in the next year, warming the tropical Pacific Ocean, with global impacts.  We showed that cooling of tropical Africa was the mechanism in our model that triggered El Ni&ntilde;os.              In the summer of 1783 it was unusually warm in Western Europe, but the following winter was very cold.  The Laki volcano began an 8-month eruption in June 1783, and it had previously been suggested that the particles it emitted, both into the lower and upper atmosphere, may have been responsible.  With a set of 80 climate model simulations, we showed that the summer warming was just by chance, and it would have been warmer still without the eruption, but that the winter cooling was probably a result of the eruption.              I also helped write review papers on the 1815 Tambora eruption, volcanic sunsets, large very explosive eruptions, and the research into volcanic eruptions of the last 100 years.
