<AbstractNarration>This program will combine observations of neutral hydrogen with existing Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging and spectroscopy, plus satellite imaging, to study certain types of galaxies in regions largely devoid of galaxies.  The main purpose is to address critical questions about galaxy formation and cosmology. Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students. An astronomy outreach program for elementary school students will be run by Dr. Vogeley and his group at a school in a minority, economically-challenged neighborhood, with talks, interactive activities, and visits to the Joseph Lynch Observatory at Drexel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current best cosmological model (lambda cold dark matter) severely over-predicts the abundance of void dwarfs unless star formation is strongly suppressed in low-mass dark matter halos, or the spectrum of halo masses is modified. The void environment, in which gas-stripping galaxy interactions are extremely rare, is therefore a crucial test of our understanding of the processes affecting galaxy formation. The exact degree of mismatch between predicted halos and observed galaxies will be quantified, the detailed star formation and gas properties of void dwarfs will be measured, and comparison will be made to high-resolution cosmological simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work provides new insights into how galaxies form and evolve in the large cosmic voids that fill more than 60 percent of the universe. We constructed the first statistically-significant sample of dwarf galaxies in voids with matched optical (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), radio (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey), and UV (GALEX) observations, which allows us to probe the impact of voids on the luminosity function, HI mass function, and star formation history of galaxies. We measured the effects of environment on two fundamental tests of galaxy formation: the galaxy luminosity function (LF) and the HI mass function (HIMF). In both cases, we find a significant shift towards lower-mass, fainter galaxies in voids. The shift of galaxy luminosity is larger than the shift in HI mass, which suggests that void galaxies have relatively more cool gas in their outskirts. HI-selected galaxy samples have a relatively larger number of faint galaxies (steeper LF), which helps reconcile the observed galaxy abundance with cold dark matter structure formation. Utilizing optical, Hi and UV observations of nearby galaxies, we determine that specific star formation rates of dwarf galaxies are higher in voids than in walls.  This higher star formation rate may reflect the relative availability of cool gas in voids. Our results suggest that void environments, on average, provide a nurturing environment for dwarf galaxy evolution allowing for higher specific star formation rates while forming stars with similar efficiencies to those in walls. We compared the metallicities (oxygen abundances) of dwarf galaxies in voids with dwarf galaxies in more dense regions.  We also measure the ratio of Nitrogen to Oxygen abundance, which varies between void and wall regions.  The variation we find in abundance ratios as a function of environment supports a picture in which void galaxies are retarded in their star formation and indicates that "cosmic downsizing" might depend on the large-scale environment, as active star formation moves to lower galaxy density at later epochs.
