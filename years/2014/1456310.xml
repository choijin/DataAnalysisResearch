<AbstractNarration>The Ucí-Cansahcab Regional Integration Project explores the ways in which the integration of several ancient settlements in the Northern Maya lowlands (what is now the state of Yucatan, Mexico) transformed political, economic, social, and ritual life. Integration took place at the beginning of the Classic period (250-550 AD) when the ancient Maya built a stone causeway that linked the city of Ucí with the town of Cansahcab, located 18km to the east. The causeway also connected two other towns and a handful of hamlets in between Ucí and Cansahcab. The rise of Izamal, the regional capital, also played a role in this integration. In particular, a style of architecture using massive stones originated at Izamal and spreads to all of the sites along the causeway. This project seeks to gauge both the impact of regional integration on the people living near the causeway as well as the ways in which these people actively shaped the outcome of this integration. National Science Foundation Funding will be used to excavate eight ruins of various size to detect changes that occurred after the integration and to determine whether these changes affected all sites in the vicinity of Ucí or only those sites linked to the causeways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An appreciation of the dynamics of power has prompted archaeologists to recognize that people do not merely react to policies emanating from central authorities. The dynamic histories and strategic maneuverings of local communities help shape those policies and the terms of integration. A fundamental area of archaeological inquiry has been to study the impact of regional integration on local communities. This approach, sometimes referred to as "bottom up", has been fruitful at multiple levels of political complexity and the current research will add to this domain. However, following the notion that all members of society, regardless of their position in the field of power relations, play active rolls in the production of history, one must also recognize that "impact" goes both ways. In other words, a "bottom-up" approach to historical transformations must attend not only to how hinterland communities were impacted by centralized authorities, but 1) how the strategies of non-elites condition and circumscribe the exercise of centralized power; and, 2) how the extensive social diversity of actors grouped together in the unwieldy category of "non-elite" results in divisions and movements that are themselves a source of transformation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has multiple broader impacts. These impacts collaboration with descendant communities and training workers and archaeologists at various skill levels. Collaboration involves working with residents of Ucí and other villages as well as migrant communities in order to promote preservation of cultural heritage. As for training, students at the University of Kentucky as well as the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatan will gain opportunities to complete Masters theses, doctoral dissertations and licentiatura theses with the mentoring of the PI and Mexican collaborators.</AbstractNarration>

These are both more reachable than groundwater in regions further away in Campeche, where in 2015 we measured depths to water of 30m near the ancient Maya site of Pich in a separate project.   Paleoecology and soils research of this project included six full soil profiles in archaeological contexts in 2011 that included 36 soil analyses of chemical and physical variation, including major cations, texture, phosphorous, nitrogen, CEC, and carbon isotopic ratios (see the NSF report by Dr. Richard Terry).  The 2014 season focused on finding a paleoecological research core site.  After searching for coring locations, we narrowed sites down to the nearest possible coring sites to our study areas.  We attempted five cores with a Livingston Corer with limited success, but we obtained one long core that turned out be 255 cm long from the Santa Rosa Aguada north of Buczotz, Yucatan, Mexico, UTM: 16Q E. 0318907, N. 2353410 at 9 masl in 60 cm of water. (see Attachment A)  We obtained three cores that totaled 255 cm in depth of mostly peat sediments.  We sampled at 2 cm intervals and split the core into multiple sub samples for pollen, AMS dating, texture, and geochemical analysis by magnetic susceptibility, XRF, and XRD.  We obtained an AMS date from near the bottom of the core at 250 cm that produced a 2 SIGMA CALIBRATION Date of Cal BC 340 to 325 (Cal BP 2290 to 2275) and Cal BC 205 to 50 (Cal BP 2155 to 2000), which dates to the Maya Late Preclassic Period.  Another AMS date from 152 cm in depth produced a 2 SIGMA CALIBRATION Date of Cal AD 775 to 970 (Cal BP 1175 to 980), which is in the Maya Late to Terminal Classic.  We measured magnetic susceptibility through the core, finding higher measurements between the c. 2000 and the c. 1000 BP dates and lower measurements above the Late/ Terminal Classic date. Other chemical and physical analyses are in progress. We can report that Dr. Steve Bozarth was not able to isolate pollen from thes...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
