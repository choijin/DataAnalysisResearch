<AbstractNarration>This project continues the principal investigator's study of interactions between differential geometry and nonlinear partial differential equations.  In particular, it will investigate regularity for certain classes of Hessian equations, including fourth-order elliptic equations, and also volume-minimizing Lagrangian submanifolds of Euclidean space, Calabi-Yau manifolds, and certain pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Many questions on second-order special Lagrangian equations, including existence and regularity, have witnessed great progress over the last five years.  In this project, the principal investigator intends to study the fourth-order generalization of this equation, which may be even more relevant to physics.  Nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equations represent a young and exciting field, and any progress may be adaptable to other equations and even other physical sciences. Recent and ongoing developments in the theory of optimal transportation show that the structure of the optimal transportation map is related to the geometry of certain maximal calibrated submanifolds of a pseudo-Riemannian space. A goal of the project is to apply the machinery of calibrated manifolds (such as special Lagrangian) to obtain novel results in optimal transport, thereby developing a nice geometric picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves research into two exciting areas of mathematics, which appear to be linked together under the surface. The optimal transport problem asks the question of how to transport materials most cost efficiently between two locations. The answers are directly applicable in many areas of science, including economics, medical imaging, fluid mechanics, and meteorology. Development of a strong mathematical theory that emphasizes the crucial elements allows those in industry to implement solutions based on the theory. For example, someone working in logistics may want to know the cheapest way to ship certain goods. Solving the problem by brute force may not be computationally possible, but if a good mathematical theory is available, the solution can be computed efficiently.  Another proposed use of optimal transportation is to create software that assists surgeons in real time.  In order for this to happen, a solid theory is necessary. String theory is an exciting developing branch of physics, which many hope will lead to an understanding of the fundamental interactions of the universe. In the late 1990s, leading mathematical physicists asserted that in order to get a better understanding of string theory, we should try to understand objects called Lagrangian submanifolds. These objects are like minimal surfaces that have special properties and are governed by nonlinear equations. This project attempts to answer questions such as when these surfaces are smooth, when they are flat, and when they are discontinuous. The answers to these questions will impact the study of physics going forward.  Recently, the principal investigator and his collaborators have related the problem of finding the optimal transportation map to the problem of describing a certain type of Lagrangian minimal surface. The smoothness of minimal surfaces has been intensely studied by mathematicians for decades. This project would now like to apply some of the ideas from geometry to the theory of optimal transport.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  In this project, we investigate two types of problems: 1) Regularity theory for second and fourth order elliptic equations, and 2) notions of Ricci curvature that can be applied to spaces without a manifold structure, in particular metric measure spaces arising in the study of large data.    On the first type of project, we produced several outcomes.  Most notable, in a recent work with Jingyi Chen, we are able to show that continuously differentiable Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian submanifolds are analytic.  This is a satisfying regularity result echoing previous landmark results in minimal surface theory.  The Hamiltonian stationary equation governs submanifolds that minimize area among a class of submanifolds.  This variational equation can be expressed as a fourth order nonlinear equation of a single variable, or, a nonlinear system of second order equations.  Thus our work adds to the understanding of both fourth order elliptic theory and second order systems of variational type.  With a graduate student Arunima Bhattacharya, we generalized some of the results and methods (in particular, the Schauder theory) to a larger class of fourth order equations.    We are also able to produce by example a nontrivial entire solution to symmetric polynomial of Hessian equations in a variety of dimensions and degrees.  These are novel, and the question of existence was open for some time.   Knowing that such solutions exists is helpful to future study of these equations: Often times when studying regularity of an equation near a point, methods will require "zooming in" on the solution near the point, and in the limit producing a solution on the whole space. If the possible solutions on the whole space are known, one may be able to infer local properties of the solution.   In another direction, in work with Antonio Ache, we describe a method for a discrete Ricci curvature on metric measure spaces, which does not rely on a length structure.  This was developed with the following three factors in mind:  First, metric measure spaces seem to be a natural framework for big data: Data happens not only in space, which can be measured by geometry (distances), but data also occurs with probability - so we should also see a measure somewhere in any spaces we are studying. Second, Ricci curvature is the natural curvature object to put on metric measure spaces: This perspective has emerged over the last 15 years following the groundbreaking work of Perelman.   Finally, most attempts to quantify Ricci curvature on non-smooth spaces require a length structure.   We are able to define Ricci curvature in a way that agrees with Riemannian notions in the limit.  As an aside, we note that an out-of-the-box discrete Ricci flow based on our method appears to cluster some data sets reasonably well.
