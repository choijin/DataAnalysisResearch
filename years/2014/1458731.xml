<AbstractNarration>The University of North Georgia (UNG), through the project entitled "Strengthening Pathways to the Baccalaureate for STEM Scholars from a Predominantly 2-Year Campus" will strive to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce by recruiting, mentoring, and supporting academically talented but financially needy students through degree completion and partnering with employers to facilitate placement in the STEM workforce. The project will focus on students who enroll at UNG's Gainesville Campus, which has a mission of that of a traditional 2-year institution, and who transfer to baccalaureate STEM programs at UNG's Dahlonega Campus, and also seek to improve student retention and graduation rates on both campuses.  The project will support full time students in programs leading to associate or baccalaureate degrees in biological sciences (except medicine or other clinical fields), physical sciences (including physics, chemistry and materials science), mathematical sciences, and technology areas associated with the aforementioned disciplines.  Among the intended broader impacts are providing students with skills to improve academic and workforce competitiveness, increasing faculty involvement in mentoring students, fostering permanent changes in organizational practices to provide an environment that encourages and supports diversity, and increasing the economic diversity of the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will achieve four key objectives: (1) improve educational opportunities for financially needy students by awarding 24 competitive scholarships annually, (2) increase retention of students to degree achievement by creating supportive environments through enhancements in organizational culture and practices; (3) improve student support programs by providing faculty mentoring, peer mentoring, academic workshops, tutoring, an early alert system, counseling, disciplinary activities, undergraduate research experiences, and participation in professional meetings; and (4) increase the number of well-educated, skilled employees in the STEM workforce by implementing the project with industry partners, who will provide guest lecturers, site visits, special activities and internship and placement opportunities in STEM occupations.  The initiative will advance knowledge of effective practices that prepare students to pursue STEM careers from traditional 2-year institutions, the nation's fastest growing educational level, by innovatively integrating student support and placement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2015, the University of North Georgia (UNG) was awarded a National Science Foundation Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (NSF S-STEM) grant (award number 1458731; $614,935; Natalie Hyslop, PI; John Holliday, co-PI; Mike Bodri, co-PI).

We accomplished these goals by using the NSF S-STEM grant funds to create a scholarship program on the Gainesville and Dahlonega campuses of UNG which awarded annual scholarships of $4,362 per student to 60 eligible students whose time with the program ranged from 1 to 4 years.  Over 90% of the scholars reported that receiving the funds from the S-STEM program allowed them to ?devote more time to school and their studies than they would have had otherwise?, which was an important goal of the program to assist with graduation and degree completion rates in the STEM fields.     When our program ended in August of 2020, 88% of the S-STEM program scholars had either graduated with a STEM degree or were still enrolled in a STEM program. Of the students that graduated on the Gainesville campus, nine were accepted directly into a STEM Ph.D. program, and all students who graduated with an A.S. degree continued to a STEM B.S. degree.  Of the scholars who graduated from the Dahlonega campus, two were accepted directly into a STEM Ph.D. program, two were accepted into a STEM Master?s program, and six went directly into the STEM workforce.

We also provided workshops and seminars over a broad range of topics which focused on academic and professional development.  These events, 90 total, were planned with direct input from the scholarship students and included topics such as: study skills, professionalism and communication, exploring STEM careers with topic experts, getting involved in undergraduate research, resume creation, internships, interview skills, reading and writing scientific literature, how to attend scientific conferences, abstract and presentation writing, scientific writing, scientific data analysis, and graduate school application and expectations.  Several of these workshops were open to all students at the university and we had strong turnout from students not directly involved in the scholarship program.  More than 90% of the scholars who responded to an end-of-scholarship survey noted how important the seminars and workshops were to their academic career and overall success.     In addition, the program provided financial support for student travel so they could present their undergraduate research at various professional conferences across the United States; an important experience for all STEM students that can sometimes be prohibitively expensive, especially to lower-income students. The program also provided additional presentation experience through an S-STEM conference we held for the scholars where they presented their research in a lower-stress conference setting.     Overall, this program provided students with the financial support and skills to improve academic competitiveness, encourage the continued pursuit of STEM careers, increase the retention of students in STEM fields, increase faculty involvement in mentoring students, nurture permanent changes in organizational practices, and increase the economic diversity of the STEM workforce.
