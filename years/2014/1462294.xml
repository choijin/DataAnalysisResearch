<AbstractNarration>1462294 - Linne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biennial Laser Diagnostics in Combustion Gordon Research Conference (GRC) has served since 1981 as the off-the-record, rigorously academic forum for students and scientists from around the world interested in using lasers to understand combustion problems. This year in coordination with the GRC, the second Laser Diagnostics in Combustion Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) is organized, which is a forum for graduate students and post-docs to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas immediately preceding the GRC. The GRC itself brings together approximately 170 scientists for a week of intense interaction and scientific discussion. This is not a conference for reviewing previous research, but rather to concentrate on novel and often controversial advances for the near- and longer-terms.</AbstractNarration>
