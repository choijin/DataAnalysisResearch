<AbstractNarration>This RII award to Montana EPSCoR will build a coordinated research program linking microbiology, ecology, and climatology to understand the dynamics of the processes that govern how an ecosystem responds to climate change. Through this interdisciplinary and ecosystem-centric approach, the program will provide an innovative model that is both regionally relevant and nationally significant, while capitalizing on the unique resources and scientific strengths in Montana. The funded participants include Montana University System (MUS), University of Montana (UM), and seven tribal colleges: Blackfeet Community College, Fort Peck Community College, Little Big Horn College, Stone Child College, Fort Belknap College, Fort Peck Community College, and Salish Koontenai College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will form a single statewide umbrella institute, the Montana University System Consortium for Ecosystem Research and Education (MtCERE), which will build on past EPSCoR investments to acquire new talent in targeted scientific areas, establish shared research facilities, and develop an integrated education, diversity, and outreach program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed MT EPSCoR research program aims to link microbial ecology, systems ecology, and climatology to investigate the multi-scale processes that govern ecosystem responses to climate change. In particular, researchers will examine how physical and biotic processes, operating at multiple scales, interact to govern ecosystem structure and function and the influence of climate change on these systems. The project has identified three focal areas to study: 1) feedback between microbial dynamics and ecosystem processes; 2) linkages among landscape patterns and ecosystem processes; and 3) impacts of multi-scale interactions and specific vulnerabilities of species and ecosystems to climate change.  The project will involve interdisciplinary experimentation, observation, modeling, and iterative data-model comparisons in four benchmark Montana ecosystems, including the Crown of the Continent, High Plains, Upper Missouri, and Greater Yellowstone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The research outcomes will have strong relevance to a broad set of research fields, both within Montana and nationally. The project has an extensive diversity plan to enhance math and science success for Native American undergraduate students and other underrepresented groups, improve core environmental sciences education at Tribal Colleges, support accelerated math preparation for Tribal College students, and increase the number of Native American Ph.D. students in environmental sciences. Workforce development efforts include research partnerships, teaching-the-teacher programs, pre-college student opportunities, team-centered research internships and mentoring, and new approaches for science communication to promote Montana?s connection to science and provide the state?s rural and underrepresented populations. In addition, the project plans to take advantage of Montana?s unique natural areas, including Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, to have extensive external engagement with the general public.</AbstractNarration>

The mission of the project was to advance Montana's research and engineering capacity, focusing on 1) understanding ecosystem dynamics in the context of regional climate change; 2) assessing the consequences of ecosystem change on the environment, communities, and economic vitality in Montana; and, 3) providing knowledge and tools to educate and engage the people of Montana to adapt to these changes.&nbsp;</p> <p>INSTEP III built interdisciplinary research capacity in the state of Montana, and in doing so integrated across the disciplines of microbial ecology, systems ecology, earth sciences, climatology, and social sciences. Research results expanded knowledge on Montana's ecosystem dynamics and linkages in response to climate, including understanding human components. A diverse portfolio of over 300 peer reviewed disciplinary and interdisciplinary publications documented project discoveries and outcomes.</p> <p>A sustained outcome of the INSTEP III project is the creation of the multi-institutional Montana Institute on Ecosystems (IoE), that spans the Montana University System. The IoE has become the central organizing hub and sustainability mechanism for INSTEP III research and education, working with academic institutions across the state of Montana: Montana State University, University of Montana,&nbsp;Montana State University Billings, Montana State University Northern, Montana Technological University, Carroll College, Little Big Horn College, Blackfeet Community College, Salish Kootenai College, Stone Child College, Chief Dull Knife College, and Fort Peck Community College. The IoE has proven to be a successful model for promoting collaboration across institutions in Montana, facilitating an&nbsp;integrated exploration of fundamental issues in ecosystem science, creating new learning experiences to inspire and educate, and developing partnerships around relevant science topics to address the needs of Montana, the region, and the nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>The project capstone, the Montana Climate Assessment (MCA), is a stakeholder-driven assessment of climate in Montana and the state's first such project. The MCA assesses potential impacts of climate change on the citizens of Montana, encompassing historical variability, current trends, and projections of future impacts as they relate to topics of economic concern. The collaborative project was implemented by researchers from two Montana University System institutions, one state agency, and one non-profit organization. The MCA summarizes scientific data and findings to inform relevant decision-making and adaptation planning for a changing Montana. The assessment has been distributed electronically and through outreach events across the state, reaching citizens, farmers, ranchers, foresters, and other water-users in rural communities. The MCA is sustained as a living project within the IoE and will continue to inform Montana's governing bodies and citizens over time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through the RII Track-1 project, Montana NSF EPSCoR made substantial investments in the scientific workforce and citizens of the state of Montana. The project contributed to 28 new faculty hires at UM, MSU, and MTech, and supported over 300 annual research experiences for graduate students and over 200 summer research experiences for undergraduate students. NSF EPSCoR RII Track-1 funding leveraged $38 million in new awards across the Montana University System.</p> <p>INSTEP III developed an expansive outreach and inclusion network for advancing K-12 STEM education and public science outreach, reaching over 15,000 people with broader engagement programs. These included exhibits at spectrUM Discovery Area, science road shows, a unique Rough Cut Science speaker series, distinguished visiting scholars, and education and outreach partnerships such as the Montana Girls STEM Collaborative, the Science Action Club, and Girls STEAM Ahead.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/11/2019<br>      Modified by: Ragan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Callaway</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1443108/1443108_10137657_1559922107842_DianaSix--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1443108/1443108_10137657_1559922107842_DianaSix--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tree Core Sampling"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1443108/1443108_10137657_1559922107842_DianaSix--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tree Core Sampling"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Diana Six, University of Montana W.A.
