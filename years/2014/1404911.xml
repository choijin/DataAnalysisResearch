<AbstractNarration>Containers are ubiquitous in everyday life with uses including the preservation of foods and beverages and to protect products against damage.  Molecules need containers for the same reasons.  For example, molecular containers are currently used in everyday life to formulate insoluble drugs.  The research group of Professor Lyle Isaacs at the University of Maryland, College Park studies the preparation and application of a new advanced class of molecular containers called cucurbiturils.  The work has the potential to impact both academic and industrial science by providing a series of container compounds bearing reactive functional groups that allow their incorporation into advanced functional systems for real world applications.  Additional broader impacts of the research include education and training of undergraduate and graduate students as interdisciplinary scientists, which is accomplished in part through international collaborations and by the development of a series of videos to attract students to molecular container chemistry via a flipped classroom approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Chemistry Division supports the work of Professor Isaacs, which focuses on the development of the synthetic and supramolecular chemistry of the cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) family of molecular container compounds.  The work aims to understand the anomalously tight binding CB[7]-diamantane(NMe3)2 complex via the synthesis and Ka determination of structural analogues.  These tight binding CB[n]-guest pairs can be used in concert with monofunctionalized CB[n] derivatives prepared by the the Isaacs group to enable new application areas including those that currently benefit from biotin-avidin technology like bioassays.  Finally, the work addresses the scope and nature of selective interactions between acyclic CB[n] containers and peptides and proteins.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant award funded our work on the synthesis and application of Cucurbit[n]uril-type (CB[n]) receptors.  Cucurbiturils are shaped like a barrel and function as containers for other molecules in water.  When target molecules become bound inside a molecular container it is often observed that their physical and chemical properties are altered (e.g. color, odor, solubility, reactivity).  Under this grant we have worked toward three goals: 1) to understand the factors that result in the unusually tight binding of CB[n]-tight receptors, 2) synthesize and use mono-functionalized versions of macrocyclic CB[n] as components of more complex functional systems, and 3) synthesize and study the molecular recognition behavior of new acyclic CB[n] type receptors.  Under the first goal, we have studied the binding of a large series of cationic guests (e.g. adamantanes, diamantanes, napthalenes, bipiperidines) toward CB[7] and CB[8].  Several key factors that influence the strength of binding (Ka) were found, namely the hydrophobicity of the skeleton of the guest, the overall guest charge, the N-to-N distance in the diammonium ions, and secondary electrostatic interactions between host and guest.  The work deepens our understanding of molecular recognition in water and suggests broadly applicable strategies to the molecular recognition community.  Under the second goal, we have synthesized monofunctionalized CB[7] bearing clickable azide functional group and we have also prepared more soluble tetramethyl CB[8].  We have used this monofunctionalized CB[7] to: 1) create CB[6]-CB[7] heterodimers and hydrophobic CB[7] which stimuli responsive supramolar networks and vesicles,  2) augment gels with CB[7] groups that allows for protein separations based on primary sequence, 3) non-covalently pegylating proteins to enhance their pharmacological properties, 4) functionalize DNA strands with CB[7] to create chimeras that respond to ATP and release protein inhibitors.  In the past several years numerous groups have begun using monofunctionalized CBs to create complex systems and our work provided key guidance for the work of others.  Under the third goal, we have synthesized new varieties of acyclic CB[n] compounds as a means to introduce new capability.  For example, in one study we created enantiomerically pure acyclic CB and measured their chiral recognition capability whereas in another we introduced mono- and difunctionalization as a means to endow the system with allosteric control over binding.  Alkylene capped versions of acyclic CBs were created to try to augment the cavity volume.  Finally, a triptycene walled CB was shown to wrap / snake itself around even very large macrocyclic guests.  Overall, the work impacts the field by providing methods to make new hosts of general utility and also teaches the field the impact of structural modification on host-guest binding affinity.  FInally, as part of our broader impacts work we have participated in the SAMPL challenges by providing blinded datasets of CB[n]-guest binding constants.  In the SAMPL challenge, computational chemistry compute the binding free energies of host-guest complexes as a means to test and improve their computational methods.  The ability to compute binding free energies in water is important across a wide swath of chemistry and biochemistry, so this work has a broader impact on the field and promotes synergies between the supramolecular and computational chemistry communities.
