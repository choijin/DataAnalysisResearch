<AbstractNarration>The proposed approach to be explored through this I/UCRC Fundamental Research Program project utilizes interfacial polymerization (IP) to create a barrier layer on pre-patterned ultrafiltration (UF) membrane supports to create functional patterned thin film composite (TFC) membranes. The specific objectives are (1) generation of new knowledge regarding (i) the IP process dynamics on patterned UF membranes, (ii) the structure of the resulting barrier layer, and (iii) their dependence on major processing parameters; and (2) examination of the influence of specific surface pattern characteristics on salt deposition (fouling) during desalination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will enable a non-chemical approach to the fabrication of TFC membranes with reduced fouling and improved energy efficiency; the study will also advance current knowledge as to how surface topography affects membrane fouling during active filtration, which in turn will guide the design of optimized surface patterns for specific separation applications.  The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio while potentially attracting new members. The proposed work will leverage the exceptional infrastructure for innovation in education and outreach at CU-Boulder to provide new and inspirational educational experiences, with a focus on membrane technology, for students at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thin film composite (TFC) membranes are widely used in separation processes such as reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) for desalination application.  The biggest challenge for desalination of salty water, like all other liquid separation processes, is the fouling control.  With the increase of pure water permeation, dissolved salts, together with other solutes, will deposit onto the surface of the membranes. Membrane scaling increases the resistance to water permeation and the frequency of cleaning, both of which increases the energy cost for water production and reduces the membrane lifetime.  Current commercial TFC membranes consist of an ultrathin polyamide layer atop a porous support.  The polyamide barrier layer is the key element that reject the passage of ions but allow permeation of water.  The barrier layer is typically rough and the morphology is referred to as "ridge-and-valley" structure, which results from the membrane manufacturing process.  Recent research has demonstrated that imparting periodic surface patterns atop ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF) membranes can increase the membranes? antifouling performances.  This pattern-induced antifouling effect is attributed to the fact that surface pattern will enhance the shear force at the feed/membrane interface, which will lead to faster back-diffusion of the foulants.  However, creating periodic surface patterns on TFC membranes is challenging.  Prior to this project, no successful surface patterning of TFC membrane has ever been achieved.   The goal of this project was to develop a new processing method that can reliably fabricate TFC membranes with well-controlled surface patterns.  The process we invented through this project is comprised of two steps: (1) patterning porous UF membrane support using nanoimprint lithography (NIL) process, and (2) forming the polyamide barrier layer atop the surface-patterned UF membranes using conventional interfacial polymerization (IP) process.  During the project, we carried out extensive experimental studies to understand the relationships between processing parameters used in both steps, the surface patterns achieved on the TFC membranes, and performance of the patterned TFC membranes.  Upon completion of the project, we gained the knowledge on the processing-structure-property relationships for the proposed method.  The major findings include:  UF membranes with controlled surface pattern can be reliably created with the NIL process, and the pattern features can be tuned by the NIL parameters including temperature, pressure, and NIL duration.  Using IP process, as in fabricating commercial TFC membranes, the polyamide layer can be successfully deposited atop the patterned UF membranes, producing the patterned TFC membranes.  The method can be applied to all common IP formulations used to manufacture industrial membranes.   The detailed morphology of the barrier layer can be tuned by the IP process parameters including the monomer concentrations, reaction time, pretreatment and post-treatment steps.  With increase of monomer concentrations and reaction times, the polyamide layer thickness increases, which can lead to the masking of the periodic structure of the UF supports.  With optimized monomer concentration and short reaction time (less than 2 min), TFC membranes with well-defined surface pattern can be obtained.  The growth of the polyamide layer on the patterned UF membranes is non-conformal, meaning that the barrier layer thickness within the trenches is larger than that on the ridges.  This growth mechanism is different from that on flat membranes, and leads to reduction in pattern height of the TFC membranes compared with the patterned UF membrane supports.  The degree of non-conformal growth decreases with the decrease of IP kinetics, and varies with the monomer types used.   The patterned TFC membranes displayed comparable permselective performance (water flux, salt rejection) with commercial NF and RO membranes with similar chemistry.  The surface patterns helped reduce the concentration polarization and scaling during lab-scale testing.
