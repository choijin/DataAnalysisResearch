<AbstractNarration>CBET- 1446444&lt;br/&gt;American Institute of Chemical Engineers&lt;br/&gt;PI: Darlene Schuster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a 1.5-day symposium during the upcoming 248th American Chemical Society (ACS) National Meeting (August 10-14) in San Francisco. The symposium will provide a discussion forum for Separation Science and Technology (SST). This symposium is a follow-up to an NSF co-funded symposium held at the 2012 Fall ACS Meeting entitled ?Ensuring the Sustainability of Critical Materials and Alternatives?.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objectives of the currently proposed symposium are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Bring into focus crosscutting research and education needs in SST associated with the sustainable recovery and recycling of critical materials and (e.g. metals) and resources (e.g. phosphorous) from liquid and solid wastes including impaired water (e.g. seawater, brackish water, brines and domestic/industrial wastewater), mine tailings and electronic wastes.&lt;br/&gt;2. Communicate these research and education needs to the broader SST community of scientists, engineers, policy makers, business leaders and entrepreneurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will contribute to the advancement of separation science and engineering (SSE) and its application to the sustainable supply of the critical materials and resources to build the sustainable products, processes, technologies, farms and industries of the future by inspiring a new generation of scientists, engineers and students to enter this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIChE will develop and maintain a website that will be neutrally branded and dedicated to the subject of critical materials. It will serve as a repository for relevant materials from this symposium and potential future symposia. The website can link to other sites with pertinent information. The AIChE will permanently have the workshop materials maintained for dissemination. This website will not only make materials available to the research community but also serve to inspire and engage the next generation scientists, engineers and policymakers.</AbstractNarration>

This is the second in a targeted series of critical materials workshops sponsored by National Science Foundation, Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (NSF CBET).  Grant 1446444 ("Separation Science and Technology as a Platform for SusChEM: Recovery of Critical Materials and Resources from Solutions and Wastes") supported the registration and/or travel expenses of some of participants.  The grant also covered registration and travel expenses as well as wages for those who organized and provided on-site support for the workshop.     The first workshop, "Ensuring the Sustainability of Critical Materials and Alternatives" was held on August 21, 2012 at the ACS national meeting in Philadelphia and brought together engineers, material scientists and chemists from academia and industry to identify areas where more research is needed.     The current (second) workshop, SST for SusChEM, brought together 47 attendees from academia, industry, government/national laboratories and professional organizations (AIChE and ACS), 22 of which were speakers, to build on the findings of the first workshop by identifying education gaps as well as remaining research gaps.  The workshop organizing committee included:     Gretchen Baier, Dow Chemical Mamdou Diallo, KAIST/Caltech Catherine "Katie" Hunt, Dow Chemical (Retired) Bruce Moyer, ORNL Seyi Odueyungbo, Chevron Eric Peterson, INL Darlene Schuster, AIChE      The SST for SusChEM workshop served to discuss the research and education needs for advancing the role of separation science and technology (SST) in the sustainable energy, water and materials nexus.

SST for SusChEM included a total of five topic sessions, each included speaker presentations followed by a panel discussion.  The topics were:     Recognizing Criticality and a Call for Action:  Waste as Untapped Source of Valuable Materials Re-engineering Mining and Extractive Metallurgy:  Green Mining Purifying Impaired Water:  Resource Recovery and Water Reclamation Reclaiming Precious and Rare Earth Metals:  From Urban Mining to Recycling Converging Separation Science and Technologies for Materials Sustainability:  Research and Education Needs      Speakers included:     David T.
