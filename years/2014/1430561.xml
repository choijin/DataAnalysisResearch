<AbstractNarration>The International Union of Radio Science (URSI) General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (GASS) is held every three years.   In 2011 the 30th URSI General Assembly was held in Istanbul, Turkey, with over 1,200 attendants.  The next URSI-GASS will be held in Beijing, China on August 14-23, 2014. The National Academy of Sciences provides travel fellowships for young scientists to attend the URSI-GASS and travel support for senior scientists to represent the United States at the URSI Council meetings.  Ultimately this ensures that we are maintaining U.S. pre-eminence in the field of radio science, strengthening the current and future health of U.S. scientific research and promoting scientific advances in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is conducted by the U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Radio Science (USNC-URSI) which operates under the Board on International Scientific Organizations in the Policy and Global Affairs Division.  The support for senior scientists to represent the United States at the URSI Council meetings allows them to participate in union discussions on scientific, programmatic, financial, and organizational topics; work with colleagues from other countries on resolutions and other union matters; and work with the U.S. early career travel awardees to ensure they are fully included and involved in the Scientific Symposium. The travel fellowships encourage students at U.S. universities to participate in the Scientific Symposium and in the 2014 URSI General Assembly and allow younger researchers to participate in scientific meetings in their field and to present their research to colleagues in an international setting.  This exposes them to new scientific developments from both leading U.S. and international institutions, and contributed to their education and their professional development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Union for Radio Science (URSI) is one of the international scientific unions related to the International Council for Science (ICSU).  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the member organization for the United States, and carries out its membership responsibilities in URSI through the U.S. National Committee for URSI (USNC-URSI).   URSI is responsible for stimulating and coordinating, on an international basis, studies, research, applications, scientific exchange, and communication in the fields of radio science.   The purpose of this grant was to provide partial travel support to U.S. radio scientists attending the URSIÆs General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (GASS), held August 16-23, 2014 in Beijing, China, and the North American Radio Science Meeting (NARS), held July 19-24, 2015 in Vancouver, Canada.  The URSI GASS serves as URSIÆs major international meeting, while NARS, organized jointly by the U.S. and Canadian National Committees for URSI, is held every 5-7 years.  The purpose of both of these meetings is to allow radio scientists to share their research with international colleagues and to learn about recent advances in the field.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT  Travel awards were made to 30 U.S. scientists attending the URSI GASS, and to 40 young U.S. scientists attending NARS.   The scientists and engineers selected for $1,000 travel awards to the URSI GASS were presenting papers during scientific sessions or were chairs or vice chairs in URSIÆs scientific commissions.   These commissions include:  Commission A - Electromagnetic Metrology  Commission B &ndash; Fields and Waves  Commission C &ndash; Radio Communication Systems and Signal Processing  Commission D &ndash; Electronics and Photonics  Commission E &ndash; Electromagnetic Environment and Interference  Commission F &ndash; Wave Propagation and Remote Sensing  Commission G &ndash; Ionospheric Radio and Propagation  Commission H &ndash; Waves in Plasma  Commission J &ndash; Radio Astronomy  Commission K &ndash; Electromagnetics in Biology and Medicine  Some of the travel awardees also helped to organize and run the URSI Student Paper Competition. The U.S. National Committee for URSI (USNC-URSI) launched an annual Student Paper Competition at its annual meeting several years ago, and now helps organize it on an international level at the URSI GASS.  The USNC-URSI strongly encourages the involvement of early career radio scientists in URSI-related domestic and international meetings.  The $800 travel grants to early career radio scientists attending the NARS meeting were to provide an opportunity for the young scientists to present their research in an international setting, learn about new areas of radio science research, gain familiarity with the URSI commission structure, and build a network of international contacts.   Interactions with colleagues from both the U.S. and other countries will help foster new collaborations and the development of new networks, ultimately resulting in new scientific research that advances the field.  Travel awardees were asked to complete a questionnaire after the meeting.  BROADER IMPACT  Research in radio science benefits society as a whole.   Electromagnetic interference is important for the performance of radio, TV, and navigation instruments.  Forest fires, crop yields, and soil moisture can be monitored by satellite instruments.  Space weather influences the ionosphere which, in turn, affects communication equipment and navigation.   Finally, electromagnetic fields and biological systems can interact in both harmful and beneficial ways.  Radio science is studying these causes and effects. As advances are made, applications ripple down to society as a whole.  Including early career scientists in international meetings helps build the future workforce.  Through their participation in the meetings, young scientists are exposed to leaders in radio science, have opportunities to present and discuss their wor...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
