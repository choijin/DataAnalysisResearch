<AbstractNarration>Extreme events, such as heat waves, cold spells, extreme precipitation, and severe storms, play a significant role in the loss of lives and damage to ecosystems and infrastructure, presenting fundamental challenges to sustainability. Under anticipated trends in planet-scale environmental trends, there is considerable uncertainty in the projected changes in the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme events. Reducing these uncertainties is a grand challenge that will require substantial advances in both the environmental and data sciences. The proposed research seeks to advance both the environmental science that underpins predictions of extreme events, and the data science required to identify relations between variables in massive data sets. The results of this research will provide a basis for improving predictions of extreme events for use in sustainability planning. This project will educate and cross-train graduate students in both disciplines, allowing them to contribute to this new emerging field.  The proposed research will also inform course development, and will be disseminated through tutorials, conferences, and seminars. The team's involvement with workshops, the GW Sustainability Institute, and GW Planet Forward will help to broaden the impact through public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance machine learning and statistical modeling of large-scale and regional events by: (1) using new tools in sparse regression in high dimensions, (2) identifying nonlinear relations in data, and (3) learning relations in spatiotemporal data that are non-stationary over space and time. The results of this research will advance understanding of extreme weather events and their relation to planet-wide environmental trends. Such relations will be learned by applying new statistical algorithms to analyze extensive climate model simulations which generate very large data sets. The findings will be validated against observations, and the learned relations will be compared between different models to assess consistency and robustness, and to validate models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Extreme events, such as heat waves, cold spells, extreme precipitation, and severe storms, play a significant role in the loss of lives and damage to ecosystems and infrastructure, presenting fundamental challenges to sustainability. In this project, we investigated advances in machine learning and statistical modeling of regional and large-scale events, with emphasis on modeling dependencies and characterizing extreme weather events.  Extreme events often are associated with large-scale atmospheric circulation changes induced by persistent sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies.  Prior work on modeling such relations ran into two key issues: strong spatial correlation in the field of covariates (e.g., SSTs) and limited predictive skill due to small training samples.  To overcome these issues, we adapted standard regularization methods like LASSO and ridge to impose a smoothness constraint through a novel use of Laplacian eigenvectors, and instead of using observations, trained the empirical model using climate model output, which is an order of magnitude larger than observational data.  The resulting empirical models gave skillful predictions of observational data for reasonable choices of regularization parameter.  This result is notable because no observational data was used directly for training.  The fact that robust predictive relations could be identified in dynamical models, and verified in observations, increases our confidence that SSTs and land temperature are indeed predictively related in nature and that this relation is capture by dynamical models. We also showed that combining global-scale changes in both temperature and precipitation provided much more accurate estimates of human-caused climate changes than using temperature, precipitation, or sea level pressure individually, and that models without interactive ocean circulations could predict certain temperature patterns skillfully on multi-year time scales.  The latter finding has important implications for understanding the role of ocean dynamics in decadal predictability.  We also made technical advances on finite sample modeling of tails of response variables based on a large number of potential covariates, and illustrated that such modeling can indeed be done even when the number of training samples is far smaller than the number of covariates.  Addressing the lack of data-driven definitions of multivariate extreme events, of the type described at the outset, we extended an unsupervised "topic modeling" method from the field of text mining, to learn (from climatological data, as opposed to text), multivariate spatiotemporal climate phenomena including heat waves and extreme low-pressure wet events. Our historical validations demonstrated that our approach discovers extreme events such as historical draughts. We also applied unsupervised learning techniques for feature extraction to the (time-lagged) historical ocean temperature field, followed by sparse regression, for seasonal prediction.  We also provided an algorithm based on a hidden Markov random field (MRF), whose structure is a geospatial lattice over the globe, to improve climate model ensemble predictions by sequentially incorporating climate observation data with climate model simulation output,  while simultaneously learning the level of both temporal and spatial non-stationarity.
