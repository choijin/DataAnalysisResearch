<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to simplifying the display backplane manufacturing process and thereby deliver cost savings to a display industry annually losing billions of dollars.  The technology being developed as part of this Phase II project has the potential to outperform current thin film transistor (TFT) backplane technologies in key Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) performance areas such as power consumption, image brightness and quality, and color richness.  The vision of this project is to redefine the cost, manufacturability and performance of displays through the use of advanced materials and novel electronics. Beyond dramatic economic implications for the LCD industry, the amorphous metal and metal oxide-based technologies developed through this project will enable a technically and economically viable path to roll-to-roll production of flexible glass displays.  Enabling a roll-to-roll "flex" factory could reintroduce display manufacturing to the United States.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project challenges conventional display industry practice by eliminating semiconductor content and relying on quantum tunneling conduction enabled by innovative materials to control the LCD backplane.  The relatively simple tunneling devices developed as part of this project contrast with the industry's focus on increasingly complex semiconductors and manufacturing processes to meet the performance demands of UHD TV while reducing cost.  The use of these structurally less complex tunneling devices in the LCD backplane has been enabled through the use of amorphous metal thin-films.  The objective of this Phase II project is to develop a prototype display incorporating amorphous metal thin-film based tunneling devices and to evaluate its performance in terms of gray-scale control, power consumption, and maximum refresh rate.  It is anticipated that amorphous metal tunneling devices can outperform current TFT technologies in these three areas by enabling 12-bit gray-scale accuracy, increasing the sub-pixel aperture ratio, and eliminating the need for semiconductor materials.  The results from this prototype will confirm the technology's core value proposition, amorphous metal thin-film devices improve UHD performance while reducing manufacturing cost and increasing factory capacity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award enabled Amorphyx to produce the world's first liquid crystal display with pixels controlled by an amorphous metal non-linear resistor (AMNR) backplane.      Amorphyx employs roughly fifteen people in Corvallis, OR and creates intellectual property related to amorphous metal thin-film electronics for flat panel display as well as non-display applications.     Amorphous metals are extremely smooth which enables them to benefit quantum tunneling based diodes and non-linear resistors, as well as more traditional thin-film transistor electronics.  They are also very strong and flexible, which can enhance the performance of these electronic devices for foldable and roll-able applications.  Amorphyx believes the quantum tunneling based amorphous metal non-linear (AMNR) devices and liquid crystal display (LCD) backplanes developed as part of this project can fundamentally redefine the cost of display manufacturing.  This is possible because AMNR-LCD has been shown to potentially reduce capital equipment costs and improve product yield.      The culmination of this project are the AMNR-LCD prototypes produced and tested by Amorphyx.  These prototypes had a pixel size and density equivalent to a 50 inch Ultra High Definition televisions, since that is the general market that Amorphyx believes AMNR technology can best address.  The full color AMNR-LCD prototypes were developed with a major LCD manufacturer, who provided the liquid crystal technology and jointly evaluated display performance.        Additional outcomes of the research and development undertaken to build AMNR-LCD prototypes include the creation of detailed electronic and optical simulation models.  The prototype experimental results and these models have enabled Amorphyx to establish a much better roadmap for taking AMNR technology to market.      In fact, after objective analysis of the project results, both technical and commercial, Amorphyx believes the LCD product may not be the first AMNR or amorphous metal thin-film electronics product to market.  Nevertheless, Amorphyx considers the project a success because, 1) all tasks were completed and 2) the general learnings from the AMNR-LCD R&amp;D can be translated to a host of other flat panel display applications such as AMNR-OLED, EPD, mLED, and &mu;LED.
