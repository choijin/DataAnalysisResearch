<AbstractNarration>This funding is for the conference "Curves and Automorphic Forms" to be held at Arizona State University from March 10th to 14th, 2014.  There will be approximately 10 speakers and an anticipated 75 participants.  The theme will be extensions of the modularity theorem for elliptic curves over the rationals.  Talks will describe work on computations of elliptic curves over number fields and of hyperelliptic curves over the rationals, on the conjecturally corresponding modular forms (e.g., Hilbert, Siegel, Bianchi), and on associated L-functions.  The format will be a hybrid of a traditional conference and a workshop with lectures in the morning and afternoons devoted to collaborative work.  We hope that bringing together experts on these various objects will encourage collaborations in new directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By its very nature, the conference seeks to connect different areas of mathematical research, and thus should be useful in exposing researchers of all levels to ideas which have increasing importance. The grant includes funding for graduate students, postdocs, young researchers, and mathematicians from underrepresented groups. We hope that the conference will draw not only mathematicians who work directly in these areas, but also others from neighboring areas of mathematics.  Part of the workshop activities will be to incorporate results from computations into the L-function and Modular Form Database, http://www.LMFDB.org, which provides data and information on mathematical objects for both researchers and a general mathematical audience.  The conference website can be found at http://hobbes.la.asu.edu/lmfdb-14.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We sponsored the conference "Curves and Automorphic Forms" on March 10-14, 2014, at Arizona State University.  The theme of the conference was extensions of the modularity theorem for elliptic curves over the rationals.  This is an area where the Langland's program suggests intriguing connections.  In some cases, precise conjectures at present do not exist making computations of explicit examples all the more important.  The conference focused on computations of these mathematical objects, and the dissemination of these results through the web, specifically, through the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (http://www.lmfdb.org).  The conference brought together an international array of researchers.  There were lectures in the mornings (by John Cremona, John Voight, Dan Yasaki, Samir Siksek, Alyson Deines, Kiran Kedlaya, Stefan Lemurell, Cris Poor, David Yuen, Sally Koutsoliotas).  In the afternoons, participants were brought together to work on computations, related mathematical problems, and on aforementioned website.  Details of the "paramodular conjecture" were nailed down during this time, and progress was made in sharing data on elliptic curves over number fields.  Roughly 50 people attended the conference, 37 of which were partially supported by this grant.  Supported participants included 10 women, and more than half of those supported were graduate students or post-docs.
