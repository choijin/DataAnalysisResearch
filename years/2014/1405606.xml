<AbstractNarration>The search for exoplanets, or planets orbiting stars other than our sun, is moving forward at a rapid pace.  Progress in this field is largely driven by our technological ability to build instruments that can measure tiny radial velocity changes of a star's light as its planet or planets tug it towards us or away from us, creating a tiny "Doppler" shift in the stellar spectrum revealing orbiting companions.  This technology in turn is largely limited by our ability to calibrate our planet-hunting instruments.  Calibration identifies spurious errors that would otherwise mimic radial motion in a stationary star.  The proposal in this case aims to build an easy-to-operate calibration system that will generate a comb of light with peak outputs spaced in wavelength, with fine enough comb scale to significantly advance the current state of the art in planet hunting instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The calibrator being built will be automated, and is intended for use on the HARPS-N spectrograph located at the TNG telescope in the Canary Islands.  It will be a "turn-key", easy-to-operate astro-comb, producing outputs in the middle of the visible spectrum (~500-620 nm), and will enable precision radial velocity measurements with sensitivity &lt; 10 cm/s over arbitrarily long periods of time.  The calibrator will be usable by telescope operators and observers without the need for laser scientists to be on site.  The science thus enabled includes determination of the mass of Earth-like exoplanets, direct measurements of the acceleration of the young universe, and investigation of the constancy of fundamental constants over cosmological time scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train students and postdoctoral researchers in scientific practices at the interface of ultrafast optical physics and astronomical instrument building and observation.  The techniques to be developed will contribute to a wide array of interdisciplinary and commercial applications in fields such as few-cycle optical pulses, molecular spectroscopy, and bioimaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Astrophysical spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the properties of stars and other astrophysical objects.  Even the presence of planets orbiting distant stars can be inferred from spectroscopic information as a planet's gravitational tug on its host star imprints a Doppler shift on the star's spectrum.  Detecting these stellar "wobbles" (known as radial velocity or RV changes) is possible using modern high-resolution spectrographs.  However, the detection of the very small Doppler shifts induced by small, rocky planets, like Earth and Venus (RV change &lt;10 cm/s) requires wavelength calibration precision and stability beyond conventional wavelength standards such as ThAr lamps.  In previous work, we developed a laser-based technology optimized for wavelength calibration, known as an "astro-comb," which produces an array of spectral peaks that can be referenced to atomic clocks.  Our previous astro-comb could not be kept operating continuously without human tending, limiting the usefulness of the device.  In the present program, we developed a more robust astro-comb employing a "turn-key" laser system and a special kind of optical fiber known as a "tapered photonic crystal".  We also expanded the wavelength coverage of the astro-comb to more of the visible spectrum (centered around the middle or green part of the spectrum), which will allow more sensitive RV measurements and hence better searches for Earth-like exoplanets.  We are in the process of installing this "turn-key green astro-comb" as an improved wavelength calibrator for the HARPS-N spectrograph, which is located at the TNG telescope in the Canary Islands.   As a broader impact of our project, the combination of a turn-key laser system and a tapered photonic crystal may find applications in optical coherence tomography (OCT), aiding optical imaging for biomedical diagnostics at the subcellular level, as well high-speed inspection of printed circuit boards.  In addition, students and postdoctoral researchers were active participants in all phases of this research: design, construction, and execution of experiments; detailed calculations; analysis of data; presentation of results at scientific meetings; and writing scientific papers.  Finally, the investigators on this project described the scientific process and results in a wide variety of presentations ranging from scientific conferences and seminars to public lectures.
