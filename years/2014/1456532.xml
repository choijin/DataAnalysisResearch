<AbstractNarration>Understanding how animals interact with their environment and influence the flow of energy and nutrients is critical to sustaining a healthy environment.  Suspension-feeders are animals that feed on particles (e.g., plankton) drifting in the waters of lakes and streams. Because these particles influence water clarity and chemistry, and support aquatic food webs, suspension-feeders can act as a master switch that controls food webs, and the physical and chemical properties of freshwater ecosystems, including their utility to humans. This project contributes to understanding several important management issues for freshwater ecosystems, including eutrophication and harmful algal blooms, biological invasions, fisheries, and biofouling. Better understanding of suspension-feeders should contribute to better management in all of these areas.  This project will also will contribute to better education and outreach about freshwater ecosystems for audiences ranging from amateurs and undergraduates to graduate students and professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will propose and test theories about (i) the amount and kinds of suspension-feeders in different kinds of fresh waters; (ii) the factors that control the abundance of major types of freshwater suspension-feeders; (iii) how the activities of different kinds of suspension-feeders differ from one another; and (iv) how substituting one kind of suspension-feeder for another (as is often caused by human activities) affects ecosystem functioning. The investigators will synthesize existing data, write a book, and develop lectures to share this new synthesis with researchers and students. This project will stimulate and direct new research on both suspension-feeders and freshwater ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Suspension feeders are aquatic animals that get their food by removing tiny particles such as algae from the waters of lakes and rivers. Familiar examples include mussels and clams, tiny crustaceans such as water-fleas (<em>Daphnia</em>), and the larvae of blackflies, among others.<em> </em>These animals can strongly affect the character of aquatic ecosystems. Some suspension-feeding animals provide important benefits to people such as keeping the water clear and preventing harmful algal blooms, but others (zebra mussels, for instance) can be major nuisances, especially when they are moved outside of their native homes.</p> <p>Although aquatic ecologists have understood for a long time that suspension feeders can play important roles in freshwater ecosystems, knowledge about these animals is still fragmented. Both popular and scientific understanding are weakened by the existence of poorly tested generalizations about suspension feeders. For instance, the widespread (but untested) belief that populations of non-native suspension feeders such as zebra mussels usually crash when left alone has been used to downplay the importance of such introductions and the need to manage them. In this project, Strayer combined data and ideas from his long-term work on suspension-feeding mussels with information and data collected by others to propose and test ideas about freshwater suspension feeders and their roles in ecosystems, and make publically available large data sets that he and others have collected.</p> <p>&nbsp;Previous work on the long-term dynamics of suspension-feeding mussels has focused on just a few simple patterns of population dynamics (boom-bust, long-term declines, stable populations, for example). Likewise, scientists have concentrated on a few simple kinds of interaction between suspension-feeding species. In contrast, this project?s analyses showed that several kinds of interaction among suspension feeders occur. Similarly, the long-term population dynamics of suspension-feeding mussel populations are highly varied, and cannot be reduced to just a few stereotypical patterns. Furthermore, populations of newly introduced non-native mussels may take several decades to settle down, resulting in long periods of changing dynamics and changing roles in ecosystems. The results of this project suggest that the size- or age-structure of mussel populations are especially important for interactions within mussel populations, interactions with other suspension feeders, effects on other parts of the ecosystem, and long-term population dynamics. As a result, two mussel populations with similar numbers of mussels but with different body sizes may act very differently. Finally, it appears that population dynamics and interactions among suspension feeders may differ greatly among different kinds of ecosystems, so that understanding the controls and impacts of these animals will require more explicit attention to the relationships between suspension feeders and the ecosystems to which they belong.</p> <p>Some of the findings may affect management of populations of zebra mussels and other invasive species. In particular, the analysis of zebra mussel populations from around the world shows that it is not typical for these populations to crash on their own, contradicting the belief of many scientists and laypeople. As a result, the strong ecological and economic impacts of these animals are not likely to go away on their own.</p> <p>The results of this project were disseminated via 4 papers in respected peer-reviewed journals (all open access: <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2701">https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2701</a>; <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/700571">https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/700571</a>; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fwb.13444">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fwb.13444</a>; <a href="https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lno.11029">https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lno.11029</a> ), 3 published data sets that are freely available (<a href="https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.m3t6764">https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.m3t6764</a>; <a href="https://caryinstitute.figshare.com/articles/Long-term_data_on_Hudson_River_Dreissena_zebra_mussel_and_quagga_mussel_populations/8300285/1">https://caryinstitute.figshare.com/articles/Long-term_data_on_Hudson_River_Dreissena_zebra_mussel_and_quagga_mussel_populations/8300285/1</a>; <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi:10.5063/F1RJ4GTV">https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi:10.5063/F1RJ4GTV</a> ), 5 presentations at national or international scientific meetings, and 2 invited departmental seminars.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/02/2020<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Strayer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456532/1456532_10358241_1593719562489_OPUS_outcomes_SF_photos--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456532/1456532_10358241_1593719562489_OPUS_outcomes_SF_photos--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Examples of suspension feeders"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456532/1456532_10358241_1593719562489_OPUS_outcomes_SF_photos--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Examples of suspension feeders"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Three examples of freshwater suspension feeders: zebra mussels (left), a water-flea (center), and a blackfly larva (right).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Heather Malcom (left); Wikipedia (center and right)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Strayer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Examples of suspension feeders</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456532/1456532_10358241_1593719706205_OPUS_outcomes_zebra_various--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456532/1456532_10358241_1593719706205_OPUS_outcomes_zebra_various--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Zebra mussel population dynamics"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456532/1456532_10358241_1593719706205_OPUS_outcomes_zebra_various--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Zebra mussel population dynamics"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Examples of population dynamics of zebra mussels in various fresh waters around the world, showing a wide range of population dynamics.</div> <div class="imageCredit">From Strayer et al.
