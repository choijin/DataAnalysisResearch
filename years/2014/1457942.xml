<AbstractNarration>The United States faces a national need to increase significantly the number of American scientists and engineers. This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Solano Community College (SCC) will address this need and contribute to the national effort to produce more STEM graduates by providing financial, academic, and personal support to academically-talented and financially needy students across all STEM disciplines at SCC. This project will pursue an innovative and promising 2+1 program for which students at SCC majoring in a STEM area will receive two years of support if they maintain a 3.0 grade point average (GPA). In turn, they will be awarded an additional year of support to continue their study, if they transfer to a four-year institution to be a STEM major. SCC will award twenty-five (25) to thirty-five (35) scholarships per year. Likewise, the project will build on existing student support services and develop new ones for the scholars.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2+1 STEM Scholarship Program at SCC will take a comprehensive approach and will have multiple interesting and creative components, which should not only be effective at SCC, but also have significant potential to serve as models for other institutions, especially community colleges. These components will include, but not be limited to: (i) offering S-STEM scholarships at high school graduations to recruit students who plan to major in a STEM discipline; (ii) providing multi-stage mentoring from peers to faculty members, with a particular approach to pairing first-generation college students with more advanced first-generation students; (iii) building partnerships with industry to provide more learning, internship, and career awareness opportunities for students, as well as to help improve curricula and meet industry needs; and (iv) providing financial and other support to S-STEM scholars who transfer as STEM majors to a four year institution. These initiatives will work in concert with existing support services at SCC. The investigators will explore and assess the effectiveness of the various components of the project, taken individually and in combination with each other. Their findings will add to the overall knowledge base of STEM education by providing a roadmap leading to successful student intervention strategies, especially related to understanding and improving the pipeline of students from high school through community colleges to four year institutions, many or whom are underrepresented minorities and/or rural and/or low income.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the 2+1 STEM Scholars Program was to provide financial support to academically talented STEM students with documented unmet need.  The program supported students from a variety of STEM majors at Solano Community College for up to two years and encouraged students to transfer to a university in a STEM major by providing the ?+1? scholarship.  The ?+1? was an additional scholarship awarded to students who were accepted and enrolled full-time in a bachelor?s degree STEM program at a university.  This additional scholarship helped students with the transition to a university and the additional expenses associated with attending a university.       The 2+1 STEM Scholars program also aspired to create a community of success for the STEM Scholars by providing support and enrichment activities.  The STEM Scholars met with a dedicated math &amp; science counselor at least once each semester to review their progress, update academic plans, and discuss any educational or personal concerns.  The program also provided many enrichment opportunities for the STEM Scholars such as field trips, informal problem solving seminars, conference attendance, volunteerism, internships, and university mentoring.  Over the 5-year tenure of the 2+1 STEM Scholars program, a variety of speakers were brought to a Solano Community College campus to present on a STEM topic of interest to the STEM Scholars and the greater Solano STEM student population.  Many of the featured speakers were selected from underrepresented groups to encourage Solano?s diverse group of students to continue their pursuit of a STEM major by allowing them to see people similar to them that are now researching and working in STEM fields.  Some of the speakers included a bit about the challenges they faced in their educational journeys and how those challenges were overcome.       Between Fall 2015 and Spring 2020, with administrative support from the Solano College Scholarship Foundation, the Financial Aid Office and Fiscal Services of Solano Community College, the 2+1 STEM Scholar Program provided 231 semester scholarships to 90 unique students worth a total of $479,843.  At the end of the fifth year, many of the recipients responded to a survey conducted by the independent evaluator indicating how the financial and educational support had encouraged them to persist with their STEM education.  The 2+1 STEM Scholars program is proud of an 83% total success rate consisting of students who have either already received an AS or BS in a STEM field, transferred to a university to pursue a STEM degree or are still currently studying in a STEM program at Solano Community College.       The 2+1 STEM Scholars program was designed to allow for a wide variety of STEM Scholars.  Applications were accepted from ten different majors with the most common majors being Biology and Engineering.  Fifty-one 2+1 STEM Scholars transferred to a four-year university.  For financial and personal reasons, many of the scholars transferred to schools within a commuting distance of Solano Community College and the majority selected schools from either the University of California (UC) or California State University (CSU) system.       As reported by the independent evaluation, the 2+1 STEM Scholars tended to persist and successfully complete the courses in their major and other required math and science courses at a higher rate than the overall student body.  Since the STEM Scholars are finishing the courses needed to complete AS degrees and/or transfer to a university, the grant has impacted the overall success and retention rates of the variety of disciplines that were funded.  Another interesting impact was that the STEM Scholars Program was generally just over 50% female, with no intentional effort made to recruit female participants.  Perhaps the above average representation of female students, compared to STEM programs in general, is due to the fact that the P.I. and the counselor for the program were female.  This The STEM Scholars Program has potentially impacted the gender diversity among the STEM workforce.        The most impressive impact of the 2+1 STEM Scholars? program is the effect that it has had on improving the economic conditions of the individual scholars and their families.  About 80% of the students funded have already or are expected to earn a bachelor?s degree in a STEM field which will greatly increase their chances at gaining employment that will allow them to be financially stable.  For these students and their families, this would constitute a considerable change to their current economic status and standard of living.  Six of the 2+1 STEM Scholars have graduated from the new B.S. program in Biomanufacturing at the Vacaville Center of Solano Community College and are almost certain to join the local biotechnology workforce with a bright future and opportunities for advancement.
