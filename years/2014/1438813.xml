<AbstractNarration>The 21st century workforce needs to have high levels of technological literacy, including skills ranging from computer use to software and hardware development. There are many barriers to the development of such skills including the high cost and inaccessibility of computing platforms, the relative lack of curriculum to learn computing, and the opportunity for learners to apply these skills in informal ways before using them in the workforce. In particular, while the cost of software development is decreasing, and curriculum for software development are beginning to emerge, there are extremely few learner-centric environments that allow people to explore the connection between technology software and hardware. This project modifies an existing, proven, learner-friendly software environment called NetLogo to run on cheap $25 computers instead of expensive desktop computers. In addition, the project will develop and test curriculum for youth to learn about the connections between hardware and software by building circuits that connect to these computers. The project will likely help increase opportunities to learn about the connection between hardware and software, due to the low cost and increasing popularity of these inexpensive computers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project rests in the technical development of this novel hardware/software environment, in studying whether and how agent-based modelling platforms can be used to support learners in computational thinking, and in documenting the affordances of the single-board computing platform for teaching computer science and engineering principles at the intersection between hardware and software. In addition to porting the NetLogo programming language to the Raspbian operating system for the Raspberry Pi single board computer, the project will develop curricula (covering basic programming, circuits, and agent-based modelling), and conduct research on how curricula to teach these concepts should be developed in the future. The thirty hour curriculum will be reviewed by experts, and pilot tested through two rounds of design trials in the lab and one field trial with young learners. These results are expected to inform both the field of learning sciences and the field of human-computer interaction research; and have broader impact through the dissemination of the curricula and bundling of the software with the Raspberry Pi low cost computers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project?s core motivation has been to increase the overlap between two promising approaches for involving learners in creative computational thinking and learning. Agent-based modeling (ABM) through NetLogo provides a low-threshold, high-ceiling environment for learning about emergent phenomena and complex systems by "growing" them from the simple behaviors of constituent elements (or "agents").  Physical computing offers learners the opportunity to create personally meaningful constructions that interact with the world &ndash; moving about in physical space and/or collecting data about the world.  Prior work identified possibilities in this overlap, but it remained non-trivial for early learners in either ABM or physical computing to create systems that integrated both. With the emergence of increasingly capable single-board computers, we felt we could support a hybrid approach combining ABM and physical computing.   Our initial efforts in combining ABM and physical computing were thus focused on single-board computers.  We selected the pcDuino: its Linux-style interface to Arduino-configured GPIO ports enabled us to customize a full version of NetLogo for it, along with a NetLogo language extension to control the ports. The results of this integration were dramatic, informing a 2-week curriculum we developed and implemented.  Students new to NetLogo wrote and refined programs for virtual robots on the pcDuino, treated as a computer.  They then wired their pcDuino to a robot chassis and used the same NetLogo logic to control the physical robot.  Other exciting hybrid constructions included networking the pcDuinos together in distributed simulations, and building hybrid physical-virtual systems. Many of these activities could have been conceived for physical computing devices connected as peripherals to computers, but there were dramatic advantages in (a) the rapid debug cycle; (b) the high reliability of a self-contained system; and (c) the continuity between computing environments for learners.  Raspberry PI released their third generation board halfway through this project, and we immediately confirmed that a similar build of NetLogo ran successfully on this hardware.  Connecting to the GPIO ports on the Raspberry PI is less straightforward, so we remained with the pcDuino; however, creating the corresponding language extension for Raspberry PI would be a direction for further research and development.   Moving beyond single-board computers, we then explored additional ways to strengthen the connection between ABM and physical computing more broadly. We enhanced NetLogo?s microcontroller support significantly, creating an Arduino extension (now shipped with all NetLogo releases), and an updated GoGo extension. Furthermore, we worked extensively with Parallax, Inc, to design and develop a wearable microcontroller, currently available as "BadgeWX." We also collaborated to iteratively refine a visual programming environment not only for the BadgeWX but also the entire line of Parallax propeller-based hardware.  This work is ongoing, but we have used the badges to create a variety of participatory simulations that combine NetLogo visualizations with physical interactions, using real-time or asynchronous displays of interactions.  We consider this direction to be a high-potential area for modeling and simulation in educational settings.  Given the visual programmability of the badges, it is possible to integrate this type of PartSim not only with "black box" code on the badge, useful in science and social science settings, but also with "gray box" (modifiable or hackable) code on the badge, in computer science settings.  Finally, the project has supported more experimental work connecting physical computing and ABM.  We have created a Bluetooth extension for NetLogo, allowing a range of physical computing devices (from android phones to Arduino constructions) to communicate in real time with NetLogo while untethered.  For longer-range settings, the second version of the Parallax badge has WiFi (as well as the original infrared) communications, allowing us to design widely distributed simulations.   The intellectual merit of this project has been to enhance and understand the intersection between ABM and physical computing. We achieved our initial development goals centered on NetLogo + powerful single-board computers, and then we expanded our focus to (a) conduct design-based research with the original platform, and (b) explore new directions to explore interactions between physical and virtual ABM.

We feel the future is bright for the hybrid of ABM and physical computing. With the increased maturity of NetLogo Web, additional opportunities are emerging.  For example, connecting physical devices to the browser is a challenge; but once achieved, it would be possible to engage young learners and novice programmers in creating and modeling systems involving the Internet of Things.
