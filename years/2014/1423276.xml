<AbstractNarration>Each human language is a system of conventions for communicating information.  Yet how does everyone know this complex system?  Describing it is difficult even for linguists.  Yet young children somehow figure out the rules and vocabulary of their native language.  Adults continue to learn when confronted with unfamiliar words, with new conventions associated with social media, or with the layout conventions of a new website. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project develops new artificial intelligence methods for tasks of this kind.  These methods will enable computers to deal with a wider variety of human language data, thus improving information access and global communication.  They will also provide insight as to why human intelligence is able to succeed at these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods will seek to discern the systematic structure that explains the patterns in naturally occurring linguistic data.  Specifically, our computers will analyze naturally occurring data in order to learn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* How to break down words into meaningful parts and reassemble those parts into new words.  This is a subject that linguists call morphophonology.  It is practically important in automated analysis and translation of speech and text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* How to break down sentences into meaningful phrases.  This requires determining the basic word order facts of the language -- the problem of grammar induction, considered to be a central mystery of human language learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* How to extract machine-readable data from large websites that present databases in human-readable form.  This involves automatically figuring out the database structure and layout conventions of a website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* How to track names across large quantities of informal text.  By discovering the principles that govern how people use and modify names, a computer can recognize that the nickname "Vlad P." or the misspelled patronymic "Vladimir Vladimirovich" might be variant ways of referring to "Vladimir Putin," especially in a political comment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address each of these domains in a principled way.  Our strategy in each domain is to develop a novel Bayesian generative model along with efficient, principled machine learning algorithms for approximate inference.  We expect to expand the range of modeling and inference techniques that are available to the natural language processing community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative technical directions include the automatic reconstruction of phonological underlying forms, a novel treatment of grammar induction as structured prediction, a nonparametric model of databases and database-backed websites, and a phylogenetic model of name variation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Artificial intelligence systems need to understand human language.  It would be impractical to teach all languages to a computer -- there are about 7000 languages today, and even in a single language like English, we see that an unlimited vocabulary of new words and names appears over time.  However, children are able to learn simply by observing how a language is used.  Under this award, we worked to give this this ability to AI systems.  We developed new machine learning algorithms that study language data to puzzle out the system by which a language expresses ideas in words.  They figure out how words are spelled differently in different contexts: for example, an English word like "stop" is spelled with a double "p" in the past tense ("stopped"), and "J. Lo" is an abbreviation for "Jennifer Lopez."  They are also able to puzzle out the word order of a language -- for example, does the verb go at the end of the sentence? do adjectives go after nouns?  how is punctuation used?  As a result, they are able to analyze new words and new sentences into their constituent parts.  We hope that the work will enable further technological innovation that benefits society.  Our algorithms can be used to improve global communication through enabling better machine translation, especially for rare languages.  They can also be used to improve information access by tracking where names are used across different documents, even if the names are not spelled consistently.  Our algorithms also contribute to the machine learning community.  Our work focused on the fact that words are systematically related to each other in different ways.  Our goal was to automatically discover these relations.  This involves a computationally difficult class of problems: to puzzle out these relationships  from a dataset, the computer must sort through an astronomical number of possible explanations of the dataset.  Our new methods for approximately solving these problems are advances beyond the algorithms that were previously known -- they get better results and are relatively fast.  They are not limited to language but could be applied to discover structure in other kinds of datasets as well.       Last Modified: 01/22/2020       Submitted by: Jason M Eisner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
