<AbstractNarration>As the global user base for online services continues to expand and new services and features are rapidly developed, data centers from which these online cloud services operate experience constant pressure to achieve higher performance and improve their quality of service. However, supporting the adoption of cloud services in all aspects of people?s daily lives requires expanding data centers to an extreme scale, with hundreds of millions of servers and ecologically unthinkable energy bills.  This research develops technologies to improve the performance and efficiency of future data centers, targeting higher performance and lower energy costs from each deployed server.  As such, it directly contributes to sustainable growth of data centers and online services, while at the same time training world-class experts specialized in tackling the challenges facing future data centers and clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research leverages a recently-codified phenomenon called "temporal streams" to solve a number of long-standing micro-architectural performance bottlenecks facing server systems in the cloud.  Many of the performance enhancing techniques developed over the course of the past several decades for the desktop, mobile, and super-computer domains provide limited benefits to server systems, because the size and complexity of a typical cloud workload requires significantly greater meta-data storage capacity than currently available to these techniques.  This work re-architects the meta-data storage of speculative structures, leveraging temporal streams to expand their effective capacity.  Specifically, this work targets instruction prefetchers, branch predictors, and hardware memorization as case studies to demonstrate the ability of temporal streaming to provide sufficient meta-data storage for these mechanisms when executing cloud workloads.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This CAREER award supported ramping up of the PI's research lab.  The project's research goals were to explore the concept of "temporal streaming" to identify and leverage opportunities for improving CPU performance.  The project's broader agenda was to maintain and improve the PI's lab computing infrastructure, fund travel of the PI and his students to conferences, enable research opportunities for promising MS and undergraduate students, enable PI collaborations, and develop hands-on course materials for undergraduate and graduate classes.  The study of temporal streaming culminated in a PhD thesis that measured the speedup opportunity and developed speculative techniques for improving CPU performance, paving the way for two new research projects that leverage these findings. This work directly resulted in two publications and the newly spawned research projects are ongoing.  The broader impacts of the project have been even greater, as the project supported multiple promising MS and undergraduate students who transitioned to PhD programs after having written multiple publications on a diverse range of topics and, in one case, being granted a patent. The award enabled the PI to establish multiple fruitful research collaborations, maintain the lab infrastructure used by all of the lab's PhD students, and supported the PI's work in developing a new undergraduate Cloud Computing course that was adapted into the curriculum, and in the development of popular graduate courses in Computer Architecture and Operating Systems.
