<AbstractNarration>In this project, a group of investigators from the University of Connecticut, the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, and Brown University will participate in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition to determine the biogeochemistry of nitrogen in the region.  In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. Nitrogen is one of the two major nutrients required universally by plankton in the ocean, and this study in the Arctic Ocean will increase our understanding of the ocean?s ecology, productivity, and carbon cycle. This study will also provide training for graduate and undergraduate students, and results will be shared through public outreach events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state of knowledge of Arctic nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry remains cursory as compared to that in other ocean basins despite the fact that understanding Arctic Ocean nitrogen cycling is central to understanding its global biogeochemistry. For one, benthic nitrogen loss on Arctic continental shelves may represent a globally significant sink of oceanic fixed nitrogen. Second, benthic nitrogen loss on the Arctic continental shelf and slope reduces the ratio of nitrate to phosphate substantially below the mean requirements of phytoplankton nitrogen, consequently limiting primary production at the ice-free surface of the western Arctic Ocean. In light of the rapid changes in Arctic climatology, the characterization of its biogeochemistry and establishment of a baseline from which to monitor future changes is critical. Researchers will use the stable N isotope (15N/14N) ratio in nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and nitrogen gas determined for a suite of dissolved, particulate, atmospheric, snow, and sea-ice samples to better constrain the spatial and temporal variability of biological nitrogen transformations in the Arctic.  Results from this study will provide a first order understanding of the contribution of water masses to the regional nitrogen budget, identify regional nitrogen sources and sinks, and diagnose important biological nitrogen transformations that occur on the Chukchi shelf, and in the central basins.</AbstractNarration>

Increased denitrification could, paradoxically, lead to a consequent reduction in overall plant production due to nitrogen scarcity.  The relative scarceness of studies addressing Arctic N biogeochemistry may be partly due to difficulty of access. The inherent spatial and temporal variability of biologically mediated fluxes compounds this problem with respect to understanding Arctic N-cycling; Shipboard ?direct? rate measurements, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, typically under-sample and cannot accurately estimate integrated fluxes. To remedy this, this project pursued geochemical approaches utilizing dissolved gas ratios, which integrate over the spatial and temporal variability of biological N transformations, as they bear the imprint of denitrification.The primary goal of this project was to develop a first order understanding of denitrification?s importance to the regional nitrogen budget, examine the importance of the Chukchi shelf/slope in this respect, and investigate the water mass connections using geochemical signals to Canada and Makarov Basins of the Western Arctic Ocean.  During the US Arctic GeoTraces cruise, samples were collected for laboratory based dissolved gas analyses however a significant number of samples appear to have been compromised.  We attribute this problem in part to harsh conditions during filling of sample bottles as any accidental inclusion of even very small gas bottles adulterates the results. To remedy this, we took advantage of another sampling opportunity in later summer of 2017 and an experienced gas sampler from our group participated in a cruise of the RV Healy to the Bering and Chukchi Seas.  Physical inspection of these samples upon their return to our lab was promising with respect to their integrity.    Specific objectives has been to produce a detailed sections of biologically produced N2 gas dissolved in seawater between the Bering Strait and the North Pole.  These data are then compared to another measure of denitrification (N deficit) determined from seawater nitrate and phosphate concentrations.  Large N deficits are known for the Pacific Inflow across the Bering Strait into the Arctic ocean and has been hypothesized to be a geochemical signature of high denitrification in sediments of the Chukchi shelf and slope.  The new samples collected on the RV Healy were from locations that were well suited to meet these objectives with respect to the highest N deficit waters found at intermediate depth above the Chukchi slope.  We found relatively large concentrations of biologically produced N2 gas at about 200 m over the Chukchi Slope, the same depth as a maximum N deficit and a minimum in O2.   We conclude that the observed N deficit in the Western Arctic Ocean is indeed produced by denitrification. As water column O2 gas concentration is not low enough to support denitrification, it is sensible to assume that Chukchi shelf and slope sediments are responsible.  We do have direct evidence from the minima in O2 gas concentration co-occurring with maxima in biologically produced N2 and N deficit.  The variations in oxygen isotope ratio support that most of the respiration that produced this O2 minima must have occurred in sediment.   These data further support biogeochemical impacts in the deep Arctic Ocean mostly associated with prior contact with shelf and slope sediments.
