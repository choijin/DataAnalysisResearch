<AbstractNarration>Throughout the Lake Superior region and the American midcontinent there is a record of prolonged and voluminous volcanic activity that nearly split North America apart 1.1 billion years ago. The resulting feature is known as the Midcontinent Rift. As a result of failing to break North America into separate continents, it preserves a rich record of tectonic history. This project will use magnetic measurements of rocks combined with very high precision isotopic dates on the rocks to determine how fast tectonic plates were moving in this region 1.1 billion years ago. The principal investigators will accomplish this by studying the lava flows in the field, obtaining new paleomagnetic data and developing high precision dates of rocks through uranium-lead geochronology. Overall, the research addresses a fundamental issue in understanding the nature of ancient plate tectonics and the tectonic evolution of the North American continent. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the proposed science matches well with California fourth grade science standards and the principal investigators have partnered with an Oakland Elementary School to develop an outreach plan with classroom visits that culminate in a field trip to UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Hall of Science in both project years. Hands-on activities will bring project science to life for these fourth graders from an economically disadvantaged community in East Oakland and provide opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to envision themselves involved in STEM research and other careers in geosciences. The research is also supporting graduate student training, the support of an early career researcher, and is contributing to research infrastructure at the collaborative institutions. Results of the research will be incorporated into research curricula and will be widely disseminated through presentations at meetings and publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The apparent polar wander path (APWP) developed from the ~1.1 Ga North American Midcontinent Rift reveals a progression in paleomagnetic pole positions consistent with significant paleogeographic change during the ~25 million year history of rift development. This progression implies fast rates for Laurentia's plate motion, but current rate estimates have large uncertainty when the precision on pole locations and ages are robustly integrated. Additionally, the rapid change in pole position leads to significant flexibility in permissable relative paleogeographic positions between Laurentia and other continents at the current level of temporal precision. We propose to obtain new precise ID-TIMS 206Pb/238U dates from Midcontinent Rift lava flows that we will pair with newly developed and existing paleomagnetic data in stratigraphic context. "Proof of concept" data demonstrate our ability to leverage recent advances in U-Pb geochronology to obtain dates with nearly an order of magnitude improvement in precision in comparison to existing dates on rift-related flows. By stratigraphically bracketing paleomagnetic data with new precise dates, we will robustly determine the rates of Laurentia's plate motion over 20 Myr, advance paleogeographic reconstructions at this time period of Rodinia assembly and further constrain the tempo of Midcontinent Rift development.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Throughout the Lake Superior region and the Upper Midwest of the United States there is a record of wide-spread and prolonged volcanic activity associated with a tectonic rift that nearly split North America apart 1.1 billion years ago. This rift is known as the Midcontinent Rift and underlies portions of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas. As a result of failing to break North America in half, the Midcontinent Rift preserves a thick and well-preserved stack of ancient lava flows. For this study, the researchers conducted geologic fieldwork in the Lake Superior region of Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ontario, Canada owhere these volcanics are well-exposed at the surface. Their work sought to test the hypothesis that North America moved at exceptionally fast rates--rates so fast that they break proposed plate tectonic speed limits. To test this hypothesis, the researchers developed paleomagnetic data from the volcanic rocks of the rift at UC Berkeley to constrain their past position and high-precision geochronology data at MIT to determine the age at which they erupted. The new dates include the youngest dates yet developed from volcanic rocks of the rift expanding the archive of information and giving new insight into the development of the rift itself. The paleomagnetic data filled in critical gaps in the existing record. Taken together these data reveal exceptionally fast plate motion. This rapid motion occurred leading up to a period of wide-spread and prolonged mountain building on the present-day eastern margin of the continent. The collision that resulted from this rapid motion was a critical step in the development of North America and it becoming the centerpiece in an ancient supercontinent known as Rodinia.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the principal investigator identified that the project science matched well with California fourth grade science standards and partnered with an Oakland Elementary School to develop an outreach plan.
