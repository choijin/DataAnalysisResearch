<AbstractNarration>Deaf individuals must rely more than hearing individuals on visual information to understand what is happening in the world around them. As a result, the brains of deaf people typically reorganize to help them make better use of the available visual information.   The questions addressed by this research project are whether and how greater reliance on visual information actually changes visual experiences. The project also investigates how differences between hearing and deaf people's visual processing develop across infancy, childhood, and adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is evidence that aspects of vision are altered or enhanced in deaf people, providing evidence for plasticity of the human brain to compensate for the absence of sound.  Yet, very little is known about how these alterations emerge during development.  This project investigates the consequences of altered early sensory experience during development, measuring perceptual sensitivity to motion, form, faces, and objects.  Deaf people may have altered processing of these aspects of vision for two reasons.  First, lack of auditory input compels deaf people to rely more on their intact visual modality, and, second, many deaf people use a visual language (American Sign Language, ASL), which may enhance certain aspects of visual processing that convey critical linguistic information.  To tease apart effects of deafness versus ASL language experience, the studies will compare visual sensitivity in Deaf and Hearing individuals who are either Signers or Nonsigners. Also, effects of deafness could occur during an early critical period rather than due to accumulated altered sensory experiences across the lifespan.  To address this possibility, the project will also involve studying a group of "Hearing Restored" children who received cochlear implants around 12-18 months, following a period of auditory deprivation starting at birth.  Results from these studies will reveal how sensory systems adjust to altered input and elucidate mechanisms of brain plasticity, which may have widespread implications for deaf and blind individuals, as well as for those who lose their hearing or sight later in life.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[              It is commonly believed that the loss of one sense heightens the other remaining senses; blind people have heightened auditory abilities and deaf people have heightened visual abilities, compared to people who have all senses intact.  This has been referred to as "cross-modal plasticity".   In the last 30 years, many studies have indeed provided support for enhanced or altered perceptual abilities in deaf (and blind) people.  Many deaf people use a visual language (American Sign Language, ASL) and so we have been investigating whether their plasticity changes arise from 1) their lack auditory input, compelling them to rely more on their intact vision, which may alter certain visual functions that are important for gaining information about the environment, and/or 2) their extensive experience with ASL, which may alter certain aspects of visual perception, particularly those important for processing of ASL.  Our first goal was to disentangle this in deaf adults by studying visual perception in deaf people who have a range of ASL skills. A second goal of this research program was to was to investigate when cross-modal plasticity emerges in deaf people:  Do these changes emerge early during development, perhaps during a critical period of development?   Or do these changes reflect a lifetime of adaptation?   We addressed these questions by testing vision across the life span in deaf people and hearing people (from infancy to adulthood), while taking into consideration the amount and timing of sign language and speech exposure over the course of the lifespan.  In doing so, we learn about the nature and timing of cross-modal plasticity that have yet to be addressed in a developmental fashion.  To date, we have tested 147 hearing adults, 35 deaf adults, 40 hearing infants, and 6 deaf infants.  on sensory, cognitive, and language proficiency.  Vision measures included sensitivity to  motion, face, shape, orientation, and contrast (infants tested with an eyetracker, adults tested with perceptual methods).   We also used the standardized Sensory Profile questionnaire (Dunn, 1999) to characterized each individual?s sensory responsiveness to every day stimuli in each sensory modality (e.g., visual, tactile, smell, taste).   Adults completed these forms for themselves and parents completed them for their hearing or deaf infant.  Cognitive measures consisted of a test of non-verbal IQ.   Language measures included detailed questionnaires documenting spoken and signed language exposure over the lifespan, and parents of infants completed a checklist to document their infants? language production and comprehension abilities (separate forms for spoken and signed language).  For signing adults, we additionally used an ASL proficiency test.  Our results show that deaf adults exhibit superior face discrimination abilities, slightly (but significantly) worse motion processing, yet do not differ from hearing adults for shape discrimination and contrast sensitivity.  Because these group differences were not modulated by ASL experience or ASL proficiency, we believe they are driven by deafness, and not ASL experience. From the Sensory Profile questionnaire, we learned that Deaf adults have a higher level of sensory awareness to daily visual and tactile stimuli, and are less distracted by sensory stimulation, compared to hearing people.  Further analysis will determine if altered visual perception is related to heightened sensory awareness, and if these results as due to the effects of deafness or ASL experience.   Data analysis for infants is underway, including data from deaf infants who later received cochlear implants.       In sum, the results of our studies elucidate which aspects of visual-cognitive processes are impacted by early sensory and language experiences during development, which we believe can impact education of deaf children.  The results are likely to aid in designing educational curricula and instructional video-based tools that are tailored to their visual and cognitive abilities.
