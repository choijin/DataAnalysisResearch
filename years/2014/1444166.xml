<AbstractNarration>US-Korea Workshop on Security and Privacy for Internet of Things&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the organization of an exploratory workshop on establishing research collaborations between George Washington University (GWU) and Korean researchers in Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency (KISA) and Seoul National University (SNU) on the emerging area of security and privacy for Internet of Things (IoT). IoT security and privacy is a topic that cuts across many facets of the society, from agriculture to transportation to health-care. Thanks to the unique IoT testbeds built by Korean researchers, this proposed workshop has the potential to foster substantial opportunities for future research collaborations that may lead to fundamental research breakthroughs in IoT security and privacy. These breakthroughs can bring about research and educational impacts with international reach. The project will also have significant educational impacts on undergraduate and graduate students from the US, especially GWU students who are involved in the study-abroad program in Korea University, Seoul, Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is expected to bring together synergized research expertise from the following two groups of researchers: (i) US researchers with extensive experience on foundational security and privacy issues related to IoT. (ii) Korean researchers who are excellent partners for the proposed workshop and the subsequent planned collaborations. Compared with other countries, the research of IoT technologies has seen much faster growth and adoption in Korea, provided a larger amount of funding, and accomplished better and more advanced results. The workshop brings US researchers to Korea so they can visit the Korean IOT testbeds and discuss with their Korean counterparts about both visions and concrete (technical) plans for future collaborations, which can in turn help realize major research impacts and pave the way to a successful realistic deployment of large-scale IoT system with proper security and privacy protection. Understanding the security and privacy issues in IoT and realizing the ideas in a practical system constitute a strong intellectual research endeavor.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This workshop aimed to promote establishing research collaborations between George Washington University (GWU) and Korean researchers from academic institutions and industries on the emerging area of security and privacy for Internet of Things (IoT). The main goal of the workshop was to gather an international forum on recent developments in theoretical and applied aspects of the field of security and privacy issues for the Internet of Things and to initiate collaborative research.  The project outcome is summarized in two areas in which the first one addresses technical findings and collaborative efforts developed as a result and the second one addresses broader impacts of this project.  The workshop found that Internet of Things (IoT) has internationally gained great attention in recent years and attracted research/development efforts  from academia, industries, and governments. There were four technical sessions comprising of 12 presentations: (1) Authentications and Challenges in IoT (2) IoT Privacy Research and Policy, (3) IoT Security Framework, and (4) IoT Security: Case Reports and Research Directions in Korea. Speakers were from academia, industries, and Korean government. Each presentation had follow-up discussions. Researchers on both sides found that these topics are fruitful for further collaborations. Three collaborative research proposals were developed and submitted for funding among workshop participants. Additional collaborative proposals between US and Korea researchers are currently under discussions. The interactions among the workshop participants at the U.S. and Korea sides have been truly substantial.  The workshop had educational impacts. Two undergraduate students from GWU who  have participated in the workshop are now engaged in undergraduate research in the area and  planning to pursue graduate programs. The workshop also had major societal impacts as IoT security directly relates to privacy of everyone. The discussions at the workshop can provide guidelines for future standards and technologies for practical solutions for  security and privacy in IoT.  Through international University-industry collaborations, there will be ample opportunities to apply basic research findings to practical problems that may open up a technology transfer opportunity.
