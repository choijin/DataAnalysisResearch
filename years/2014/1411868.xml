<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Gemini Planet Imaging (GPI) exoplanet survey, which is an extensive observational project using a new instrument to obtain images and spectra of extrasolar planets.  The data will be used to directly image Jovian planets (Jupiter-mass gas giants) around other stars, and measure the chemical composition of the planets? atmospheres.  The results will be used to test models of planet formation and evolution.  The funding will train and mentor two graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar in research.   The team will also carry out public outreach with the SETI Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GPI instrument is a new coronagraphic integral field unit commissioned at the Gemini Observatory.  It is capable of detecting and spectroscopically characterizing young Jovian planets reaching 10 million times fainter than their parent star at separations as close as 0.2 arcseconds.  Direct imaging of planets will yield information on planets typically not, or rarely accessible, by other methods (such as radial velocity measurements, transit observations, and gravitational microlensing).  The investigators will target over 600 young stars of spectral type A-M, and use the data to test formation paths of giant planets, dynamical evolution constraints and explore the bridge between giant planets and brown dwarfs</AbstractNarration>

Of the 600 targets in the project sample, 500 stars have been observed thus far, and 4 exoplanet systems, 4 brown dwarf systems, and 26 debris disks have been studied. Overall, the project results have revealed new features in the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, while detailing dust properties and the physical structure of the disks.     A new exoplanet, 51 Eri b, was discovered as part of this project, and its atmosphere spectrum measured with GPI reveals that it is the coolest imaged exoplanet known. 51 Eri b is the first detected imaged exoplanet that may have formed through the core accretion process which is how Jupiter is thought to have formed. The new GPI spectrum for one of the brown dwarfs observed for the project, HD 206893 b, shows the reddest spectral shape of any atmosphere, challenging current theoretical models which do not predict atmospheres similar to the observations.  The additional exoplanet and brown dwarf companion data from the project have made important contributions to mapping the orbits of the companions and characterizing the atmospheres over infrared wavelengths.     Many of the young targets for the study showed indirect evidence of disks of dust encircling the host stars, however the GPI project has provided images that directly image the size and shape of a light scattered off the dust disks, including polarized light. From the large set of disks spatially resolved with GPI, a range of disk geometries have been measured, from thin edge-on disks to face-on disks. With the high fidelity imaging possible with the extreme adaptive optics system of GPI, features such as brightness asymmetries and disk gaps are discernable in some of the systems, and links to interactions with planetary mass companions are measured for some systems with both an exoplanet and debris disk.
