<AbstractNarration>The project's purpose is to expand the University of South Alabama Cyberinfrastructure to improve collaborative research capability between scientists in the Mitchell Cancer Institute and the School of Computing. Infrastructure improvements are necessary to handle the high volume data transfer required for large databases and imagery data that form the core of this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research enabled by these campus network improvements includes investigations into the degree to which descriptive data driven analysis methods can discover relationships among groups of cancer mutations across user-defined tumor groupings.  Because the traditional hallmarks of cancer commonly arise in diverse forms of cancer, mutational interplay between seemingly unrelated genes must exist and must play a role in fine tuning tumor behavior to its environment. By employing a data driven approach, where each tumor genome is viewed as an independent evolution experiment, it is possible to evaluate the unique mutational signatures composed predominately of passenger mutations, in addition to the traditional focus on driver mutations. This project increases underlying data networking capacity by a factor of 10, and results in benefits to research and education across the University of South Alabama by transforming the campus core network to a high performance 10Gbps network.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the CC*IIE Networking Infrastructure: Data Driven Expansion project at The University of South Alabama  was to expand the networking capacity at the University of South Alabama (USA) School of Computing and the Mitchell Cancer Institute to facilitate the transfer of large data sets necessary for effective cancer, cancer informatics, and other healthcare informatics research.  To that end, a science DMZ has been successfully created along with upgrades to the university core and distribution network layers.  The specific network and infrastructure upgrades are shown in the figure below and included:  &middot;  Campus distribution nodes upgraded to 10Gbps (CSC 6509, Node 3, DataCtr VSS, INET, DMZ 4503, ScienceDMZ 4500X, CSCASA 5585X)  &middot;  Metro ring nodes upgraded to 10Gbps (Metro 4507, UMC 4507, UCW 4507, KPH 3750, MCRI 4507)   &middot;  Core nodes upgraded to 10Gbps (Core1 6506, Core2 6506)  These upgrades now allow researchers to seamlessly transfer large datasets between the School of Computing (located in Shelby Hall on the main campus) and the Mitchell Cancer Institute (located in a facility off campus). Several ongoing research projects are utilizing the enhanced network infrastructure including a project designed to develop a software tool that will automatically detect anomalous cell division behavior in time-lapsed images.     Experiments were conducted to measure the impact of the network upgrades. In particular, data transfer rates between Shelby Hall and the Mitchell Cancer Institute were collected using the Iperf testing tool.  Testing was performed over several days that included periods of low, normal, and high network traffic. The average up /down transfer rate was approximately 2.5Mbps.  The increased speed and capacity facilitates data transfer between scientists in the Mitchell Cancer Institute and the School of Computing, which will enable more and higher quality collaborative cancer informatics research.
