<AbstractNarration>Two-dimensional curves and three-dimensional surfaces lie at the core of computer graphics, but current approaches to creating and editing them are limited by the user's expertise.  Many of these tasks can be performed by anyone at a basic level, but expert performance is difficult to achieve.  The PI's goal in this exploratory research is to seek ways to transcend this limitation based on crowdsourcing, in which a crowd surpasses the skill of the individual (by many individuals each contributing a single input), and an individual surpasses his or her own abilities (by contributing many inputs) in what might be termed self-crowdsourcing (the PI points out it has been shown that the improving effects of crowdsourcing apply even to a crowd of one).  Project outcomes will positively impact not only the myriad applications of computer-aided design but also fields such as computer-assisted surgery, where the quality of a cutting path can take on life-or-death importance.  Individuals with a variety of motor impairments should also benefit from the ability to achieve high-quality physical performance in tasks as routine as signing a document.  To ensure broad dissemination of his findings, the PI will open source the software developed as part of this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's approach is interdisciplinary, fusing human-computer interaction, experimental psychology, and computer graphics.  The wisdom of crowds has been studied for scenarios where a single number is estimated, such as the weight or price of an item; however, techniques for averaging (or otherwise aggregating) high-dimensional physical or creative inputs have not been studied.  This research will involve three complementary thrusts: divide-and-conquer approaches for combining small contributions from a crowd of (novice) individuals to create a high-quality 3D shape from a 2D image; algorithms for preserving the temporal record of image and shape creation in a reusable representation called a time channel, to improve editability; and algorithms for aggregating repeated 2D and 3D curve drawings (self-crowdsourcing).  The work will lay the foundation for an understanding of the limits of crowdsourcing; in particular, the crowdsourced 2D-to-3D algorithm will test several long-standing hypotheses relating to novice creation of 3D shapes.</AbstractNarration>
