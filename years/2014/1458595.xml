<AbstractNarration>Because phylogenies (trees) showing the evolutionary relationships of species are so useful in bioscience and biotechnology, there has been a major worldwide effort to determine trees for various groups of organisms. This information can be knitted together into a single "Tree of Life" (ToL) covering millions of species, though it is often better to think of expert ToL knowledge as a forest of overlapping source-trees. Because this body of knowledge is complex, rapidly changing, and distributed among many online resources, getting the latest knowledge is a challenge.  The focus of this project is to get ToL knowledge into the hands of scientists, educators, and the public, by building a distributed system of internet services that work together with existing NSF-sponsored projects to deliver custom trees to users as quickly and easily as they currently get online driving directions. The resulting system will allow a greater range of life-sciences researchers to ask more complex and challenging questions relating to diversity and biological functions. The project will work directly with educators and with educational resources such as the Encyclopedia of Life, making it easy for millions of users to access the latest scientific knowledge of species relationships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phylogenetic trees are useful in all areas of biology, both to organize knowledge by guiding classification and for process-based models that allow scientists to make robust inferences from comparisons of evolved entities (genes, species, etc). Phylogenetic knowledge is disseminated today via a very large number of idiosyncratic pathways, most of which are not easily traceable. While experts continue expanding the Tree of Life (ToL) knowledge, addressing gaps and conflicts, our focus is on dissemination, putting ToL knowledge in the hands of researchers, educators, and the public. The goal of this project is to design and develop an open web-service architecture for ToL delivery, with the functionality necessary to integrate into scientific workflows, including name-resolution, tree discovery, subtree extraction, and scaling of trees. The architecture will be designed as a sustainable distributed collection of services and will rely on semantically rich descriptions to facilitate composition of services and to documents the tree discovery and reuse process. The project will cultivate this system as a community resource by (1) involving partners, domain experts, and a broader phyloinformatics community in the design process; (2) partnering with other projects to involve them as service-providers or consumers; (3) developing innovative clients demonstrating quantitatively important use-cases; (4) staging a hackathon for participants to add services or develop clients.  Results of the project will be accessible via www.phylotastic.org.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A comprehensive phylogeny of species, i.e., a tree of life, has potential uses in a variety of contexts, including research, education, and public policy. Yet, accessing the tree of life typically requires special knowledge, complex software, or long periods of training.   The Phylotastic project aims make it as easy to get a phylogeny of species as it is to get driving directions from mapping software. In prior work, we presented a design for an open system to validate and manage taxon names, find phylogeny resources, extract subtrees matching a userâ€™s taxon list, scale trees to time, and integrate related resources such as species images.   The Phylotastic project provided the implementation of a set of tools that together represent a robust, accessible system for on-the-fly delivery of phylogenetic knowledge. This set of tools includes a web portal to execute several customizable workflows to obtain species phylogenies (scaled by geologic time and decorated with thumbnail images); more than 30 underlying web services (accessible via a common registry); and code toolkits in R and Python (allowing others to develop custom applications using Phylotastic services).   The open platform for Web ser-vices composition supports both the portal, as well as it enables the creation of new analysis workflows, generated through a graphical interface and supported by automated planning algorithms. The Web services composition is guided by automated planning alg-rithms and built on a Web services registry and an execution monitoring engine. The platform provides resilience through seamless automated recovery from failed services.   The Phylotastic system, accessible via http://www.phylotastic.org, provides a unique resource to access the current state of phylogenetic knowledge, useful for a variety of cases in which a tree extracted quickly from online resources (as distinct from a tree custom-made from character data) is sufficient, as it is for many casual uses of trees identified here.
