<AbstractNarration>PI: Guldberg, Robert E. &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1411467&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is an interdisciplinary field requiring the integration of bioengineering principles, fundamental biological discoveries, and industry collaboration and partnership to achieve the ultimate goal of restoring function to injured or degenerated tissues. Damaged musculoskeletal tissues collectively represent the most common cause of pain and functional disability worldwide. The three-day Hilton Head Workshop for Regenerative Medicine is an annual workshop series that brings together regenerative medicine experts from a variety of scientific disciplines in a small conference setting to effectively convey knowledge and stimulate new ideas and work to overcome current gaps in the knowledge base that are needed to advance the development of regenerative medicine applications. Another important aspect of convening such experts in one location is the opportunity it presents to foster the development of new researchers and future leaders in the field. The workshop provides important opportunities for graduate student and postdoctoral trainees and young investigators to fully participate in the conference scientific program and to interact socially and connect with world renowned leaders and mentors in the field. The conference theme for the 2014 Hilton Head Workshop, to be held March 26-29, 2014 in Hilton Head Island, SC, is "Discovery-Driven Transformative Research" and will focus on highlighting research that has the potential to shift traditional research paradigms, pioneer discovery, and lead to the development of new and innovative technologies. A one-day pre-conference workshop is scheduled for Wednesday, Mach 26, 2014, titled "Challenges and Opportunities in Central Nervous System Regeneration" that will address current research advances in the field of neurobiology and neural cell regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The conference will advance knowledge within the broad, cross disciplinary community of those engaged in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine through the presentation of knew and transformative research. The conference engagement and networking opportunities have the potential to launch new collaborative research and education initiatives in the U.S. and will potentially foster new international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The multidisciplinary focus of the workshop and diversity of attendees has the ability to impact many sectors of engineering and science and to advance progress in academic-industry collaborations. While the workshop is kept intentionally small in participant numbers, the attendees and speakers come from all over the U.S. and abroad to offer new perspectives and forge new collaborative relationships. This conference has the ability to impact several levels of attendees, with particular focus on women, trainees and young investigators through the activities and events planned. This conference will inspire and help train the young future leaders of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 18th Annual Hilton Head Workshop for Regenerative Medicine was held on March 26-29, 2014 at the Harbour Town Inn and Conference Center in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The Hilton Head Workshop is an annual three and a half-day workshop series that has been organized and led by regenerative medicine leaders from Georgia TechÆs Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience since 1997. The goal of the workshop is to share new research discoveries with the regenerative medicine community and to promote academic-industry partnerships specific to the development of new biomedical technologies. The number of workshop attendees is intentionally kept small to facilitate interaction.  Registered workshop participants for this yearÆs workshop totaled 144 comprised of academic professionals (49%), pre-doctoral and postdoctoral trainees (29%), and industry representatives (22%). Nine international registrants participated in the workshop.     This yearÆs conference theme was "Discovery-Driven Transformative Research" and focused on pioneering and innovative research and advances in regenerative medicine technologies.  For this workshop, conference organizing partners were the Georgia Tech-Emory Regenerative Engineering and Medicine Center, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Pittsburgh/McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine.      A pre-conference workshop titled "Challenges and Opportunities in Central Nervous System Regeneration" was held on Wednesday March 26 for the purpose of advancing knowledge and identifying current challenges in regenerative medicine applications for treating disease and injury of the central nervous system such as spinal cord injury.     The workshop format was a single plenary session that promotes interaction among a diverse body of participants.  Examples of lecture topics included:  Engineering Tissues from Pluripotent Stem Cells, Understanding Stem Cell Behavior in Complex Environments, Nanomaterials for Stem Cell Delivery, New Approaches for Nerve Cell Regeneration, and Bone Fracture Healing through Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation.     The program keynote lecturers included Doug Lauffenburger head of MITÆs Department of Biological Engineering, Jeanne Loring of The Scripps Research Institute, David Schaffer of the University of California-Berkeley, Tim Schroeder of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Molly Shoichet of the University of Toronto, Marius Wernig of Stanford University Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and Stephan Duncan, Director of the Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Biology Program at the Medical College of Wisconsin.     Pre-doctoral or post-doctoral trainees had the opportunity to participate in podium talks, poster sessions, and the highly popular "rapid-fire" talks that allow for a brief five-minute presentation followed by facilitated discussion. In addition, trainees had the opportunity to connect with national and international regenerative medicine leaders throughout the workshop.
