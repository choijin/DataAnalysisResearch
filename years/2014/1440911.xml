<AbstractNarration>Young Women Growing Up Thinking Computationally (YO-GUTC) is the joint evolution of two successful broadening participation in computing programs: the Young Women in Computing program at New Mexico State University and the GUTS y Girls program at Santa Fe Institute. YO-GUTC is a 3-year program, targeting at least 120 high school women, and composed of a series of intensive summer workshops and community celebrations of young women in computing in the Las Cruces and the Santa Fe areas of New Mexico. YO-GUTC explores why some young Hispanic females who are interested in computer science majors or careers decide to leave the pipeline in high school while others persist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YO-GUTC will design, implement and evaluate instructional materials for summer workshops, develop an online community and social network, and study whether addressing the preparation gap, building community and online support systems, and aligning computing with Hispanic cultural values, can sustain young women's participation and interest in computing. Through longitudinal (over 3 years) interviews and surveys, students will be asked to share narratives about their developing computer science identities, computer science participation, and aspirations. YO-GUTC will pose research questions related to the underrepresentation of Hispanic women in computing, and investigate interventions to increase and sustain their interest and participation.</AbstractNarration>

The program is the evolution of a successful broadening participation in computing program: the Young Women in Computing (YWiC) program at New Mexico State University (NMSU). YO-GUTC developed over a 4-year period, composed of after-school meetings, summer workshops, and community celebrations of young women in computing in the Las Cruces area, New Mexico. YO-GUTC posed research questions related to the underrepresentation of Hispanic women in computing, and investigate interventions to increase and sustain their interest and participation. The demographics of New Mexico allowed NMSU to develop a deeper understanding of the issues specific to expanding Latina participation in CS.</span></p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p><span>The literature, and our own work, has investigated methodologies and best practices to inspire (initial) engagement of Latina students in computing. Unfortunately, the engagement, while necessary, does not address the larger issue of sustained participation, unless linked to a continuing process of skills development and preparation; this is critical if the engagement appears early in the academic pipeline, due to the institutional gaps in computing curricula. YO-GUTC&rsquo;s three primary strategies are to: (1) engage, prepare and retain young women in computing, especially of Hispanic background, through exciting learning experiences (via projects in areas of community relevance) that address the preparation gap in computing between young women and men; (2) foster growth of social capital through support systems; and (3) raise women&rsquo;s aspirations in computing beyond initial engagement and towards computing degrees and careers. We seek to advance young women&rsquo;s computing skills to a level beyond that of their male peers, building confidence, self-efficacy and respect. Regular academic-year club meetings and community CS celebrations will engage participants in rich computational projects, expose them to Hispanic women in computing fields, and build community support for participants&rsquo; endeavors in computing. During two-week girls-only summer workshops, participants will investigate topics of local and cultural relevance, view them through the lens of computational modeling, and analyze them using agent-based tools.</span></p> <p><span>Building on the strengths of YWiC, YO-GUTC designed, implemented and evaluated instructional materials for club meetings and summer workshops, developed a social network, and studied whether addressing the preparation gap, building community and online support systems, and aligning computing with Hispanic cultural values, can sustain young women&rsquo;s participation and interest in computing.

The program engaged 4 cohorts of summer camp students: 109 high school women (40% White, 50% Hispanic, 7% African American, 3% Native American) and 132 middle school women (33% White, 52% Hispanic, 4% African American, 9% Asian, 2% Native American).
