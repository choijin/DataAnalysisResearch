<AbstractNarration>This project will address two obstacles that hinder elementary science instruction: (1) a lack of content-specific teaching knowledge (e.g., research on effective topic-specific instructional strategies); and (2) the knowledge that does exist is often not organized for use by teachers in their lesson planning and instruction.  The problem is particularly acute at the elementary level, where many teachers have limited science background and many have not taught science before.  The project will collect existing empirical literature for two science topics and synthesize it with an often-overlooked resource -- practice-based knowledge.  The resulting knowledge resources will be made available to teachers on a website.  The resource will support elementary teachers as they plan for science instruction, and to enable them to productively adapt their own science materials to improve student learning.  The project will work with teachers in high minority schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to a developing theory of Collective Pedagogical Content Knowledge (C-PCK) which includes the research literature, practitioner literature and collective wisdom of practice.  The researchers will seek to understand how C-PCK can be made more useful for teachers.  The research questions are: (1) What are the strengths and weaknesses of the knowledge collection and synthesis method? (2) What factors must be taken into account in applying the knowledge collection and synthesis method across science topics? (3) What affordances and limitations does the web-based resource present for teachers primarily, and for teacher educators and instructional materials developers? (4) How does access to content-specific teaching knowledge affect teachers' planning and instruction?  Content-specific teaching knowledge will be collected through literature reviews (for empirical knowledge) and a series of iterative, on-line expert panels (to gather practice-based knowledge).  The two sources of knowledge will be synthesized for each of the science topics and organized in a web-based resource for teachers.  A group of pilot teachers will use the resource as they plan for and teach a unit of instruction on the science topics.  Project researchers will observe their instruction and interview the teachers to look for evidence of the resource facilitating their instruction.  In addition, researchers will administer assessments to teachers and their students to gauge changes on content knowledge that might be attributable to the resource.  Teacher feedback will be used to modify the web-based resource and maximize its usability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project, Knowledge Assets to Support the Science Instruction of Elementary Teachers (ASSET), was to create a resource for elementary teachers to help them incorporate what is known about effective teaching of a topic into their science instruction.   Perhaps the most widely recognized form of specialized knowledge for teaching--and arguably the one with the most potential for helping teachers overcome knowledge-related obstacles--is "pedagogical content knowledge" (PCK), an amalgam of pedagogical knowledge (general teaching knowledge) and content knowledge (knowledge of a specific discipline).  One model of PCK acknowledges both collective and personal aspects.  Discrete professional knowledge bases--disciplinary content knowledge chief among them--are the foundation for collective PCK (C-PCK).  Examples of C-PCK include an instructional strategy that has been found through empirical studies to be effective for teaching a specific idea, or recognition of a conceptual difficulty found through assessment studies to be prominent among elementary students.  Over the course of the study, researchers developed resources to address two disciplinary core ideas in the Next Generation Science Standards at fifth grade: (1) Structure and Properties of Matter (which we refer to as the small particle model, or SPM), and (2) Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems (which we refer to as Interdependence).  Developing a teacher resource infused with C-PCK first involved testing a method for collecting and synthesizing C-PCK.  The method included extensive reviews of both empirical and practitioner-based literature on each topic, as well as in-depth interviews with teachers focused on student thinking and instructional strategies related to SPM and Interdependence.  These findings were then embedded into individual instructional activities, called "student experiences," which were organized into a "driving question pathway" (DQP).  An example DQP--"What happens when you stir salt into water?"--challenges students to explain the apparent disappearance of dissolved salt using the small particle model.  Six of these DQPs were developed for SPM, each of which takes at most a couple of class periods.  Other examples include "What happens to the weight of an ice cube when it melts?" and "How can I smell something from across the room?"  Each DQP has a sequence of 4-6 student experiences that engages students with the small particle model and challenges them to use it to explain a phenomenon.  In Interdependence, the phenomenon of interest is changes in populations, which typically cannot be directly observed in a single class period.  Although the Interdependence resource follows the same DQP structure, the resource has only one overarching question (Why are the fish dying at Sunrise Farm Pond?), which motivates a weeks-long investigation through which students develop a model to explain why the fish are dying.  The teacher resources are freely available on a website: http://www.horizon-research.com/ASSET/.  Other products include literature reviews and conference papers, all of which are available on the Horizon Research, Inc. website: http://www.horizon-research.com.  ASSET also published an article in the journal Science and Children and a chapter in the book Pedagogical Content Knowledge in STEM.
