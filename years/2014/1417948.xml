<AbstractNarration>Data facilities provide a key resource in the pursuit of innovative scientific research by&lt;br/&gt;aggregating, preserving, and disseminating large quantities of data sets, including highly&lt;br/&gt;complex petabyte scale data to more simple metadata catalogs. The proposed workshop provides&lt;br/&gt;a forum for leaders from these facilities, regardless of scale, type or format of data, to&lt;br/&gt;gather and discuss commonalities and collaborative solutions to the increasing challenges&lt;br/&gt;associated with providing data access for researchers. In addition, this workshop will act&lt;br/&gt;as a key end-user Assembly Group during the EarthCube Test Enterprise Governance process to&lt;br/&gt;identify decision making processes and governance models that are most applicable to the geoscience&lt;br/&gt;data facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A steering committee of experts from across the Geosciences, including Atmosphere, Oceans,&lt;br/&gt;and Earth Sciences will act to identify key participants and create a quality agenda. Social&lt;br/&gt;scientists will be utilized to ensure developmental evaluation and learning loops are incorporated&lt;br/&gt;into the agenda; this includes the construction of key scenarios and exercises for discussion&lt;br/&gt;and breakout groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the meeting will include a set of common and unique requirements and challenges&lt;br/&gt;associated with the communication, collaboration, interoperability, and governance structures&lt;br/&gt;required to ensure that the capabilities and opportunities of existing and emerging NSF/GEO&lt;br/&gt;facilities are incorporated into the EarthCube concept.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report is written for the general public and must describe the outcomes or findings that address the intellectual merit and broader of impacts of your work as defined in the NSF merit review criteria in 200-800 words covering the life of the award. You can include up to 6 images.  This project began as an EarthCube End-User and Assembly development workshop principally targeted at NSF-funded data facilities. Convened by the EarthCube Test Enterprise Governance Project, the workshop sought to meet the following goals:  1.    Providing forum for a discussion on the unique requirements in scale, security, and policies associated with data management;  2.    Providing a forum for information exchanges, aligning best practices, and liaising between and among data facilities;  3.    Distributing a collection of best practices and lessons learned;  4.    Providing a testbed for collaboration between EarthCube cyberinfrastructure projects and existing facilities; and  5.    Authoring a charter for future coordination and collaboration among data facilities.   Over the course of the two day workshop held in January 2014, the 50+ attendees met all the stated goals of the workshop, and came together in agreement to found the EarthCube Council of Data Facilities under a founding charter that states:  "The mission of the Council of Data Facilities is to serve in a coordinating and facilitating role that includes advancing the following responsibilities and goals:  &bull;     Providing a collective voice on behalf of the member data facilities to the NSF and other data facility managers and funders, as appropriate.  &bull;     Identifying, endorsing, and promoting standards and best or exemplary practices in the organization and operation of a data facility.  &bull;     Collaborating with standard-setting bodies with respect to shared feedback on standards for data, models, software sharing interoperability, metadata, and related matters.  &bull;     Identifying opportunities for and supporting the development and utilization of shared cyberinfrastructure, professional staff development and training, and other related activities.  &bull;     Fostering innovation through collaborative and interdisciplinary projects.  &bull;     Increasing understanding and engagement with relevant stakeholders."   Using the remaining funds from the initial workshop, the Council of Data Facilities has continued to meet annually, to begin carrying out its stated goals. The Council now exists as a Standing Committee in the broader EarthCube governance structure, with a representative serving on the EarthCube Leadership Council.   As the Council enters its third year of existence, the focus will turn to how member facilities can more actively work with each other, as well as with EarthCube funded projects, and domain scientists to advance mutual goals, and broadening and enlarging participation by other, principally geoscience, data facilities. By continuing to carry out its mission, the Council has the potential to advance knowledge across the geosciences by promoting collaborations across domains and facilities in line with the broader goals of the EarthCube program. Additionally, by continuing to work within the EarthCube framework, and collaborate across facilities, the Council of Data Facilities has the potential to change the landscape of data sharing to better meet the needs of academic/research geoscientists.
