<AbstractNarration>Liquefaction is a significant seismic hazard in which the induced ground movements cause severe damage to the built environment.  Our understanding of the consequences of liquefaction is hampered by the limited field data that exist regarding liquefaction-induced movements (e.g., lateral spreading) during previous earthquakes.  This project will investigate liquefaction-induced lateral spreading during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes in New Zealand using displacements derived from satellite imagery and LIDAR.  These displacements will be integrated with subsurface, topographic, and geologic data to improve our understanding of the factors that influence liquefaction-induced lateral spreading displacements.  The results of this work potentially will have far-reaching impact on geotechnical engineering because of new insights into the phenomenon of lateral spreading provided by the dense spatial resolution of the deformations measured by the remote sensing techniques.  This work will substantiate a new displacement monitoring technique for the geotechnical community such that future earthquake studies and hazard mapping can take advantage of these techniques.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a combination of improved sensors (e.g., 50-cm resolution optical satellite imagery, 1-m resolution LIDAR) and advanced processing algorithms (e.g., precise georeferencing between images and datasets), it is now possible to monitor sub-meter displacements via remote sensing and at fine spatial resolution on the ground.  The unprecedented spatial resolution of the deformations produced by remote sensing combined with the availability of an enormous amount of subsurface data in Christchurch provide a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the characteristics that influence liquefaction-induced lateral deformations.  The project also will involve detailed geologic mapping and interpretation by engineering geologists, and this information will be used to gain further insights into the geologic constraints that influence the observed displacement patterns and lateral spread kinematics.  These data will allow us to investigate the influence and interconnections of the subsurface characteristics, spatial variability, geologic conditions, topography, ground motions, etc. on the observed movements; this understanding will improve both empirical and numerical models for predicting lateral spread displacements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Liquefaction-induced lateral spreading represents an important geohazard during earthquakes due to the significant movements (as large as many meters) that are induced. These movements have the potential to cause significant damage to a wide range of infrastructure over large areas.  High-resolution displacement observations of lateral spreading from optical image correlation were developed for the 2011 Christchurch (Mw = 6.2), New Zealand earthquake.  This was the first time that optical image correlation was used to document lateral spreading and the resulting data provided unprecedented insights into the detailed displacement patterns due to lateral spreading.  These data also enabled lines of research not possible before.  The displacement data from the 2011 Christchurch earthquake were used with surface and subsurface data to evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-practice predictive models for lateral spread displacements and to identify topographic and geotechnical factors that have a significant influence on lateral spreading displacements. The results showed the enhanced displacements associated with sloping ground, topographic terraces, and the presence of multiple river channels.  The results also showed important limitations in the existing lateral spread displacement predictive models.  Using the observations from the Christchurch earthquake, a large suite of finite element simulations were performed to investigate the influence of the height of the free-face (i.e., river channel), the thickness of liquefiable layers, sloping ground behind the free-face, and the presence of a topographic terrace.  The resulted showed that the dominant factor controlling the displacement pattern is the combined thickness of the free-face and liquefiable soil. The displacements are also affected by the presence of sloping ground behind the free-face, with the inland extent affected more significantly than the maximum displacement. The presence of a topographic terrace as far as 300 to 400 m from a free-face can increase the displacements in the area between the free-face and terrace by 0.5 m or more. A bilinear surface model was proposed as a framework for predicting displacement patterns at a free-face lateral spread site.    The high resolution displacement observations from Christchurch allowed for an exploration of machine learning (ML) approaches to predict earthquake-induced lateral spread displacements.  A dataset of more than 7300 lateral spread observations were used to train random forest classification models to identify lateral spread occurrence and to predict the amount of displacement. The best ML models accurately predicted the lateral spread patterns with an overall accuracy of 70-80%, even when the models were applied to an expanded dataset representing over 2 million displacement observations across Christchurch.  This research demonstrated that optical image correlation from satellite image pairs canbe used to create more complete databases of liquefaction-induced horizontal movements,which can be used to improve our understanding of lateral spreading using a wide range of approaches (e.g., empirical models, computational simulation, nachine learning). Future post-earthquake investigations and research should make use of optical image correlation to document the horizontal displacements associated with liquefaction.
