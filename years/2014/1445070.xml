<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a discovery, which involves storing hundreds of nanoliter-scale droplets in a microfluidic device with unprecedented capabilities to control the chemical composition of individual drops. This microfluidic dose response analyzer will deliver significant societal benefit by transforming the way preclinical drug discovery is conducted in the pharmaceutical industry. It will guide decision-making early on in the drug discovery process helping to reduce drug development cycle time and cost. The project will result in a prototype with defined design criteria and performance parameters, as well as validation data on cell-based assays. This technology uses significantly less sample and reagent volumes, eliminates pipetting errors and allows automated reagent delivery and washing. These features will lead to significant cost savings, high-resolution data and simpler workflows compared to multiwell plates and pipetting systems that occupy the current market space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the technical obstacles as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Current microfluidic drop methods lack the ability to store cells at precise coordinates on a substrate, followed by addition or removal of media or drugs. As a result, such approaches have difficulty culturing cells and screening for drug efficacy, while retaining the benefits of nanoliter reagent volumes. In this project, this bottleneck will be resolved by coalescing stored and moving drops in a uniquely designed microfluidic network. A working prototype and validation data will be produced by optimizing device design, cell density and flow conditions. In addition, personnel involved in this project (graduate and undergraduate students) will receive training in innovation and entrepreneurship. The PI and co-PI have been involved in the University Accelerator Program which will form a natural channel for students working on this project to learn about entrepreneurship.</AbstractNarration>
