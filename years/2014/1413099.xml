<AbstractNarration>One of the principal unsolved problems in modern astrophysics is the formation and evolution of galaxies. Astronomers wish to understand when galaxies &amp;#64257;rst emerge, how star formation changes over the history of the universe, as well as the physical constituents of galaxies. This award will resolve long-standing questions about galaxy evolution by performing a massive survey of the neutral hydrogen gas of hundreds of galaxies over the past 4.6 billion years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survey, named CHILES (the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey), takes advantage of an enormous program with NSF's Very Large Array (VLA) of radio telescopes to observe a section of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. Over 1,000 hours of VLA observing time have been granted, and the CHILES survey will be the first to provide details on the neutral gas distribution and kinematics for individual galaxies over several billion years of cosmic evolution. The data and associated products will be made available to the public, providing a legacy dataset for the entire astronomical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative award will also provide funding for six graduate students across the United States, creating a new cohort of skilled radio astronomers. Finally, the research team will incorporate the results of the survey into their general astronomy classes and in their numerous public outreach presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of this project has been to carry out the first true deep field to explore the evolution of the gas content of galaxies over the past 4.6 billions years of cosmic evolution.  Our major activities focused on: preparing and carrying out 1000 hours of observations at the Jansky Very Large Array; designing a fully automated pipeline to calibrate and flag the data without user intervention; optimizing the imaging of the data; scientifically explore the first 180 hours of data, and; preparing for science to be done with the full 1000 hours of data.  We were originally allocated 1000 hours to be observed over three consecutive B configurations of the VLA, however, due to the new practice of dynamic scheduling at NRAO, we were forced to extend the observing over 5 B configurations and will get all of our data by Summer 2019.  Our project is a true path finder for future surveys for redshifted HI. The large instantaneous bandwidth, the huge number of channels (31000) and the very strong Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) all posed significant challenges.  Two major challenges for surveys like CHILES are removing RFI without flagging too much data and, then, calibrating parts of the spectrum that are affected by extremely strong RFI.  A major outcome of our work is that we have developed innovative new techniques for dealing with both of these challenges and we are now ready again to operate a pipeline in fully automated mode.  These are hard-earned lessons that will benefit future deep radio surveys.  Although the testing of the pipeline was done by people at the University of Massachusetts, Virginia Tech, Columbia University and ASTRON in the Netherlands, the construction of the pipeline itself was done by Pisano at West Virginia University and it is available for general use via GitHub  https://github.com/djpisano3/chiles-pipeline.  To make accurate images of the sky our main challenge has been to remove signal from sources far from our targeted field center.  Additionally, the very nature of the JVLA introduces an extraneous  ripple in our data. We designed, tested, and implemented computational approaches to correcting for the ripple and to remove the signal from sources outside of our main targeted field.  Because of the unprecedented size and complexity of this survey, we explored different computing environments to optimally process this unusually large data base, concluding that imaging is best be done at a cloud computing platform (e.g. Amazon Web Services). This  work was led by our collaborators at ICRAR in Australia.  The results are published in Astronomy and Computing (Dodson et al 2016)   We imaged HI in emission from a galaxy at at z=0.376 - the most distant galaxy ever imaged in HI emission.  The galaxy is gas rich in HI and unusually gas rich in molecular gas. Its gas fraction and star formation rate are very unusual for low redshift galaxies with similar stellar mass. The galaxy looks more similar to galaxies found at high redshift and forms an ideal laboratory for studying the so called clumpy disk galaxies often seen at higher redshifts. This was published in ApJ Letters (Fernandez et al 2016)  We studied the morphology of galaxies at large scale over densities near z=0.12 and 0.17 as a demonstration that even spectral windows that are most seriously affected by RFI can be calibrated properly and yield new scientific insights.  We looked at the environment of these galaxies using a group catalog and their relative location in the cosmic web and introduced a method to estimate the significance on a pixel by pixel basis for integrated HI images that will again be useful for future HI surveys. This work was led by Hess at ASTRON and is published in MNRAS (Hess et al 2018).  We analyzed the use of a new topological algorithm to identify large scale structure in the CHILES volume and quantified the distance of galaxies to their nearest filaments. We used our method to recover known correlations between galaxy mass and color with distance to the filaments. In addition we show the predicted HI mass fraction as function of distance to filaments (Luber et al 2018 submitted).  This is a collaborative project and all of the above activities were carried out by people at different universities.  The CHILES team at the University of Wisconsin was especially involved in gathering and analyzing ancillary data, particularly optical spectroscopy taking advantage of our access to the Southern African Large Telescope.   The broader impacts of our work focuses on the aforementioned development of new tools that will be useful for future large astronomical surveys and the training of a new and diverse group of astronomers.  To date, three students have earned their PhDs working on CHILES and there are at least six more to come.  Two of those students are Native Americans.
