<AbstractNarration>This award is being made jointly by the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative and Organismal Systems and the Instrument Development for Biological Research program (IDBR) in the Division of Biological Infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how the brain enables us to think, act, learn, and remember is challenging. Progress has been impeded by lack of a dynamic picture of interactions and properties that emerge when tiers of interconnected brain cells (neurons) are activated in response to experiences. These interactions cause changes in our behaviors and can affect subsequent activities of these neurons, a process called plasticity. This proposal will develop and use newly created, complementary technologies that will non-invasively control, measure, and analyze brain network dynamics and change in real time. Neuroscientists, engineers, and chemists from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will work together, each bringing cutting-edge methods to bear on this problem. Approaches include: 1) analyzing slices of brain tissue that maintain dynamic properties in a dish; 2) real-time, label-free imaging of neuron activity by novel optical methods; 3) activating and measuring neuronal activity with flexible, clear electrodes that interface directly with cells; and, 4) measuring and identifying patterns of brain chemicals released by experiences. These approaches will be applied together to better understand the dynamic geography of brain information processing and plasticity. Such comprehensive studies of brain dynamics in space and time have never been done. In the future, these technologies can be applied to many brain regions to advance understanding, broadening their impact. Students will be trained beyond usual disciplines, so that neuroscience, imaging technology, engineering of new materials for electrodes, and high-resolution analysis of neuron-to-neuron signals will be taught and used together. Outcomes will contribute to a workforce trained in new ways to tackle problems beyond current boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What dynamic interactions and emergent properties of neuronal cells and circuits encode experience and generate changes in complex behaviors? Understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of signal flow and evolution in multi-tiered neuronal circuits has been elusive. The proposed study will address this gap through transformational research that bridges excellence in fundamental neuroscience with innovative technologies in non-invasive imaging, materials development, and neurochemical analysis. Focus will be on processing of a surrogate sensory signal in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's circadian pacemaker, that generates long-term behavioral change. This initiative will enable a pioneering program to develop and integrate novel non-invasive imaging of action potentials assessed by quantitative phase imaging of optical signals, stimulation/sensing by original, transparent, biocompatible electrodes, and chemical analyses of complex peptide-release signatures to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of information flow in rat SCN circuits. These approaches will be applied together to better understand the dynamic geography of brain information processing and plasticity. Such comprehensive studies of brain dynamics in space and time have not been done previously. In the future, these technologies can be applied to many brain regions to advance understanding, broadening their impact. Students will be trained beyond usual disciplines, so that neuroscience, imaging technology, engineering of new materials for electrodes, and high-resolution analysis of neuron-to-neuron signals will be taught and used together. Outcomes will contribute to a workforce trained in new ways to work beyond current boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Progress in understanding how the brain enables us to think, act, learn, and remember is a challenge in neuroscience that has been impeded by lack of a dynamic picture of the interactions and cellular properties that emerge in activated neurons and associated brain cells. We know that multiple tiers of interconnected brain cells (neurons) are activated in response to experiences, which, in turn, cause changes in our behaviors and can affect subsequent activities of these neurons. This process is called &lsquo;plasticity.&rsquo; We have developed novel optical technologies that enable us to image living, label-free brain cells in real time and, thus, investigate these dynamic cellular activities as they are occurring. We applied a new method, <em>spatial light interference microscopy</em> <em>(SLIM),</em> to quantitatively measure the phase differences through a transparent object [1]. SLIM is based on phase contrast imaging, which is a qualitative imaging method effective in imaging transparent objects such as unlabeled, live cells. Under this NSF award, Multiscale Dynamics and Emergent Properties of Suprachiasmatic Circuits in Real Time, we introduced a light-stimulation system into SLIM, by coupling a projector into the illumination port. We examined live brain slices of two regions: 1) the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and related pathways controlling biological responses to daily cues, most notably light, and 2) the hippocampus, which is involved in learning, memory, and responses to environmental stimuli. They are ideal models for investigating long-term changes in behavior altered by experience. Using our combined expertise in developing novel optical imaging technologies, analyzing dynamic properties of cells from the SCN and hippocampus, and measuring and identifying chemicals from these imaged cells, we developed technologies that advance our understanding of how brain cells develop, respond to stimulation, and move essential molecules within and among cells for communication and activation. Examples of our progress have been published in 13 peer-reviewed journal articles, presented via over 40 posters, seminars, or invited talks; and featured in numerous news reports and other public outlets. In addition, the technologies developed have enabled 18 undergraduate and 8 graduate students, including 11 women and 6 under-represented minority students to expand their research skills and knowledge in neuroscience, chemistry, and engineering. Ten of the undergraduates participated directly on the project as research assistants or REU students, while others benefited indirectly by working with graduate students on the project and reviewing literature and attending research seminars. Finally, a significant and direct outcome of this work is the recent award of an NSF research training grant (NRT) in Understanding the Brain: Training the Next Generation of Researchers in Engineering and Deciphering of Miniature Brain Machinery (MBM). This research traineeship program will provide 60 trainees over the upcoming five years the opportunities to work across disciplines of neuroscience, cell and developmental biology, molecular and integrative physiology, chemistry, chemical and biomolecular engineering, bioengineering, electrical and computer engineering, and psychology in courses and laboratory modules on development of miniature brain machinery that use the new methodology developed under this award.</p> <p>References:&nbsp;</p> <p>[1] &nbsp;Z.
