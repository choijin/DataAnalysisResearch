<AbstractNarration>Attention is about enhancing what is important to us and suppressing what is not. Nearly everything we do, ranging from reading a book to looking for a friend in the mall, requires attention. One of the fundamental questions in cognitive neuroscience is how networks of neurons in the brain flexibly control the allocation of attentional resources to the task at hand. Dr. Mingzhou Ding of University of Florida will investigate this question using innovative computational tools. The novel set of theoretical constructs and effective physiological measures proposed in this project will help to better understand attention as well as its impairment.   As such, the results can inform dysfunctions of attention control that are characteristic of many devastating neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease and ADHD by providing objective and quantitative markers for the affected individuals.  In addition, the planned free distribution of the software codes implementing the novel methods used in the project and the large amount of well-characterized human and monkey electrophysiological data that will be made available will benefit a much broader community of researchers in science and engineering, many of whom have no access to such data and methodology.  The project will also enhance the educational mission of the NSF by providing materials for course development and resources for mentoring the next generation of interdisciplinary cognitive neuroscience researchers at both graduate and undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Combining theoretical/computational approaches with experimental approaches, Dr. Ding will test a novel computational model that links ongoing neural activity prior to the appearance of a sensory stimulus with selective enhancement and suppression of stimulus processing by analyzing brain electrical signals (electroencephalography, EEG) in both humans and monkeys. Furthermore, Dr. Ding will apply novel measures to multiple types of neural data to go beyond the conventional EEG measures observed from outside of the human brain. This project aims to provide not only new insight into our current understanding of attention processes, but more importantly, new tools and approaches that will enable neuroscientists to characterize the interaction between neural signals from different regions inside of the brain (source analysis), particularly how electrical activity in one brain region influences the other (Granger causality). These new tools and approaches are expected to be applicable to the investigation of a wide range of cognitive functions, and is thus potentially transformative in making EEG, a relatively inexpensive and widely available brain imaging tool, useful for understanding cognitive functions in natural context.</AbstractNarration>
