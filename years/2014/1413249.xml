<AbstractNarration>The investigator studies two problems, each exploiting redundancy of representations in mathematics and engineering, and develops new methods to recover a signal from a nonlinear processing scheme.  The first problem is related to signal reconstruction from magnitudes of a redundant linear representation (the so-called phase retrieval problem).  The second problem involves a geometric analysis of frames and connections to deep problems in mathematics (such as the Kadison-Singer problem).  This analysis leads to faster methods that offer better quality and resolution of the reconstructed signals in applications from X-ray crystallography, data communication on fiber optics, and speech processing.  Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project are trained for a globally competitive STEM workforce by learning to develop new mathematical tools to solve real-world problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies two problems, each exploiting redundancy of representations in mathematics and engineering.  The first leads to new methods to recover a signal from a nonlinear processing scheme.  Recently two far-reaching discoveries have been made that connect the nonlinear information (magnitudes of frame coefficients) to certain scalar products in larger embedding spaces.  This way the original problem of recovering a signal, which is fundamentally nonlinear, is recast into a linear reconstruction problem coupled with a rank-one approximation problem.  When the linear redundant representation is associated with a group representation (such as Weyl-Heisenberg, or windowed Fourier transform), then the relevant tensor operators inherit this invariance property.  Thus a fast (nonlinear) reconstruction algorithm is possible.  This approach suggests a new signal representation model, where signals are not represented simply by vectors in a Hilbert space, but rather by operators in a larger dimensional Hilbert-Schmidt-like space, similar to the quantum state theory.  The methods developed here borrow from a wide range of mathematical areas such as harmonic analysis, operator theory, and algebraic geometry.  In turn this approach allows for stable and efficient solutions relevant to areas of electrical engineering as diverse as array signal processing, speech processing, quantum computing, and X-ray crystallography.  The second problem expands the solution of the Kadison-Singer problem in a different direction in frame theory.  Specifically the issue is to "thin out" frames to subsets that remain frames and have density arbitrary close to one, the critical density associated to a Riesz basis.  Such a result belongs to a larger body of results describing the geometry of frame sets.  The unifying concept in all these problems is redundancy of representations and atomic decompositions.</AbstractNarration>
