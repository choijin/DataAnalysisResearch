<AbstractNarration>The project, CBMS2015, will be coordinated by the Conference Board for the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) and will be managed by the American Mathematical Society (AMS). CBMS2015, will be a comprehensive survey of the nation's undergraduate mathematical and statistical sciences programs at two-year and four-year institutions scheduled to commence in the fall of 2015. This project will continue a cross-sectional survey of undergraduate mathematics programs that has been done every five years since 1965. CBMS surveys track changes in the curriculum, pedagogy, enrollment levels by individual courses, bachelor's degrees granted, and program faculty in US undergraduate mathematical sciences programs. CBMS2015 will provide current national benchmark data that the Nation's mathematical sciences department chairs called for in the 1999 AMS publication "Towards Excellence: Leading a Mathematics Department in the 21st Century".  A comprehensive report describing the findings of this survey will be distributed in the spring of 2017 to science policy leaders at the national level and to all mathematics programs in the US and will also be freely available in print and online. The findings of the survey will be promoted to the mathematical sciences community at relevant professional meetings and in appropriate publications. Improving the Nation's undergraduate STEM efforts depends on improving undergraduate mathematics and statistics, and planning future reforms begins by knowing the present. The survey report will provide data on crucial issues within the mathematics community, catalyzing other educational research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The statistical design of the stratified random sample survey and associated statistical analysis will be conducted by statisticians at Westat, Inc. in consultation with a steering committee appointed by CBMS. The final report will be written by the project's senior personnel and published by the American Mathematical Society. The survey's evolving structure will contribute to educational survey research methodology. In addition, CBMS2015 will focus on a selection of topics of importance to leaders of various organizations concerned with undergraduate education in the mathematical sciences. The topics include, but are not limited to: (1) evidence-based teaching practices; (2) practices in distance-learning courses; (3) instructional strategies in College Algebra, Calculus I, and Elementary Statistics; (4) instructional strategies and delivery methods in developmental mathematics; (5) assessment of mathematics and statistics programs; (5) data on gender and under-represented groups; (6) research and internship opportunities in the mathematical sciences for undergraduate students; and (6) other full-time faculty (faculty at four-year departments that are full-time, but not eligible for tenure).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education, and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Guided by a steering committee of faculty and administrators from these institutions, the PIs for the project established a set of questionnaires for these three departmental domains that explore such topics as:  Course enrollments by mathematical subject and instructional methodology Characteristics of bachelors programs and degree recipients Characteristics of course sections and instructional staff Faculty demographics Special topics    In addition to tracking many of these factors longitudinally through prior CBMS Surveys, conducted every five years since 1965, the new Survey examined a number of special situations, including curricular innovation, distance learning, and dual enrollment.  Subcontractor Westat, Inc. provided the technical and infrastructure support needed to conduct the study so as to optimize its statistical significance.. The company was involved with every phase, starting with advising the steering committee and following through with  question validation, form testing, sample selection, programming, sending the questionnaires, follow-up on non-response, data cleaning and validation, and preparation of tables for further analysis by the PIs for a final report.   The final report, Statistical Abstract of Undergraduate Programs in the Mathematical Sciences in the US, by R. Blair, E. Kirkman, and J. Maxwell  was published and released in May 2018. Following is a brief selection of findings detailed in this report.  CBMS is one of the few national surveys that covers mathematical sciences in two-year colleges. Approximately 54% of the sampled departments responded. Here are a few findings for two-year colleges:  Between 2010 and 2015, enrollment in mathematics fell by 4% to 2.0 million. Between 2010 and 2015, enrollments in statistics course increased by 104% to 445,000; calculus enrollments nudged up by 1% to 152,000. 58% of responding departments implemented pathways course sequences, which include foundations, quantitative reasoning/literacy, and statistics as alternatives to many traditional pre-college courses. The percentage of full-time faculty who are women continued an increasing trend over the last few surveys, and reached an all-time high of 52%. The percentage of full-time minority faculty also reached an all-time high of 23%.   For four-year colleges and universities  sampling frame includes 1,470 bachelors-, masters-, and PhD-granting programs that offer undergraduate degrees in mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, mathematics education, actuarial science, computer science, and joint majors with other academic areas. These programs were stratified by degree offerings, and in academic year 2015 ? 16, a total of 365 departments were sampled. Of these, a total of 269 responded.  Here are a few factoids regarding the four-year programs. In the study period:  The total number of students earning bachelors degrees from all mathematical sciences departments increased by 18%. The total number of full-time and part-time mathematical sciences faculty increased by about 7%, much of that growth fueled by a 27% increase in the number of part-timers. Women comprised 31% of all full-time mathematical sciences faculty, 22% of all tenured faculty, and 36% of all tenure-eligible faculty?all figures up a percentage point or two from 2010.   Overall, the CBMS Survey paints a picture of growth in the numbers of students enrolling in mathematics and statistics, increasing diversity in course options and curricular pathways for them tailorable to career goals and needs of other disciplines, a shift toward course delivery by instructional staff  who have non-tenurable and part-time appointments, and a increasingly invetive pedagogical strategies. As of this writing, work has begun on a 2020 CBMS Survey, agian with generous support from the National Science Foundation.
