<AbstractNarration>Frontier Probability Days 2014 is a three day conference to be held at The University of Arizona, in Tucson, May 18 - 20, 2014.  The purpose of the meeting is to bring together leading regional and national researchers in probability theory and its applications, graduate students and others, to foster interactions and stimulate research activity in this area.  The format consists of 7 plenary talks and several shorter presentations. The plenary speakers represent a spectrum of leading work in probability and its applications.  Topics of interest for the conference include disordered and interacting systems, random matrices, stochastic analysis and probabilistic applications to biology and dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference meets approximately once every two years in the Intermountain West of the United States.  This is the fourth meeting of the conference.  The previous three meetings ran successfully in 2007 (Boulder), 2009 (Salt Lake City) and 2011 (Salt Lake City).  Roughly, 40 outside participants are expected to come to Tucson for the conference.  Much of the NSF support will be allocated to students and junior researchers.  A special feature of the conference is its attention to "applications of probability."  Part of the intent of the meeting is to help broaden participation with other fields, a source of inspiration for both more applied and theoretical aspects of probability research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website:  math.arizona.edu/~fpd/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of Frontier Probability Days 2014       (FPD) was to       connect regional researchers from the Intermountain West with top       national       researchers in probability and stochastics, and to provide an       opportunity for       young researchers to network and showcase their work.  A special feature of the FPD was to showcase a main speaker from applied mathematics, who       develops deep       applications of probability in his research, along with other main       speakers       working more directly in the area of probability.  The conference took place May 18 &ndash; May 20, 2014       at the       University of Arizona in Tucson.  The same       format was followed, as in previous instances of the meeting held       in 2007,       2009 and 2011, of 7 one hour plenary talks and several shorter 20       minute talks       spread over 3 days.  The       main speakers       were Michael Damron (Indiana), Greg Forest (UNC), Todd Kemp       (UCSD), Kavita       Ramanan (Brown), Firas Rassoul-Agha (Utah), and Brian Rider       (Temple).   There was strong attendance at the conference       with 40       outside and nearly 20 local participants, comprising students,       postdocs, and       faculty from ~30 different universities in the region and beyond.  In particular, the program       was able to fit 18       short talks from mostly junior researchers.        A comprehensive conference website, which also holds slides of all       presentations, is found at http://math.arizona.edu/~fpd/       Last Modified: 01/16/2015       Submitted by: Sunder Sethuraman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
