<AbstractNarration>This award funds travel support and stipends for 21 participants, mainly early-career researchers, to attend "The Second Workshop on Measuring Precise Radial Velocities," which will take place July 6-8, 2015 at Yale University, New Haven, CT. The workshop will provide a unique opportunity to gather scientists with a broad range of specialized expertise to reflect on both the big picture and the details at every level of searches for extrasolar planets using the Doppler Radial Velocity technique.  Succeeding in this effort will require significant improvements to spectrometer capabilities in order to detect the very small gravitational pulls of such small planets on their host stars. The workshop will document the established state of the art Doppler precision from various facilities, assess different spectrometer designs and the scientific analysis for recent results, and discuss methods for assessing the statistical significance of weak detections.</AbstractNarration>

We held primer sessions on Sunday July 5th, 2015 to introduce students and researchers who are new to the field to critical concepts surrounding high precision challenges and analysis tools so that they could get the most out of the workshop meetings.  More than 150 researchers attended this meeting and about 75% of the attendees were students or postdoctoral fellows.   The workshop focused on instrumentation (Monday), statistical analysis tools and techniques for distinguishing photospheric velocities from the orbital motion of the star (Tuesday) and the path toward higher precision RV measurements (Wednesday). Researchers from major Doppler survey programs presented a summary of their current precision and showed that the state of the art precision is 1 m/s (a factor of ten less than we need to detect Earth analogs around other stars).

The workshop served to educate emerging researchers about the critical challenges for high precision radial velocity measurements.
