<AbstractNarration>The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) will host a conference with a special focus on closing the achievement gap through the preparation of effective science and mathematics educators and collaborative interdisciplinary partnerships. The book "Closing the Achievement Gap from an International Perspective: Transforming STEM for an Effective Education" will be used to highlight innovative interventions other countries have implemented to address the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) achievement gap.  Co-authors of the book will be invited to participate in the conference along with scientists, teacher educators, and policy makers to discuss effective strategies for closing the STEM achievement gap. The strategies will inform the future direction of educator preparation in developing effective science and mathematics educators and improving PK-12 STEM education. The objectives of this proposed conference are to: (1) review current research on the achievement gap in mathematics and science with a focus on school-related variables that adversely affect outcomes from low-income and minority students; (2) discuss teacher quality and effective teaching in STEM; (3) identify effective strategies and models that promote equity in education and close the STEM achievement gap; and (4) build collaborative, interdisciplinary partnerships for addressing the U.S. achievement gap in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference participants will identify social and cultural barriers that contribute to persistent education inequities and achievement gaps in STEM and discuss effective education policies and innovative initiatives that select countries have applied to promote progress in narrowing STEM achievement gaps. During the conference, a panel discussion will take a systematic view of the subject, beginning with a cross-national analysis of teacher qualifications and the achievement gap that spans 50 countries with special interest in the United States, Canada, Mexico, England, Turkey, China, Japan, Brazil, Singapore, Korea, South Africa, and Australia. Through an examination of international models of system-changing initiatives that promote gains in STEM achievement for minority and low-income populations, conference panelists will explore lessons learned and effective strategies from other countries that are potentially transferable to the American education system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ AACTE successfully completed a conference titled "Progress and Factors that Contribute to Closing the STEM Achievement Gap." The conference, generously funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) focused on identifying and discussing effective strategies and models that promote equity in STEM education, teacher quality and effective teaching in STEM, and developing the groundwork for future partnerships between educator preparation programs and STEM disciplinary providers.   Significant outcomes are:  AACTE will develop a session at its Annual Meeting to address efforts for recruiting, preparing and retaining highly qualified STEM teachers in hard-to-staff schools. AACTE will develop a Topical Action Group (TAG) to convene peers for continued discussion around the recruitment and training of high quality science and math educators committed to working with disadvantaged youth. With the expansion of AACTEÆs Holmes Scholars, a program that supports doctoral candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, a STEM initiative will be included as students at earlier points in their career are engaged.  AACTE has developed institutional partnerships for furthering collaboration and will seek articles and blogs for inclusion in the Resource Library and in Ed Prep Matters. Partner with key organizations to develop and implement a capacity-building initiative for minority-serving institutions.  AACTE will convene webinars to increase attention to STEM initiatives.            Last Modified: 01/29/2016       Submitted by: Sharon P Robinson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
