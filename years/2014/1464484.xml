<AbstractNarration>The noble gases play an important role in understanding mantle structure and in quantifying mass and volatile fluxes in and out of the mantle. The isotopic composition of non-radiogenic noble gases in the Earth's mantle can constrain the sources of volatile sources on our planet and the mechanisms through which volatiles are incorporated into the solid Earth. Furthermore, the isotopic composition of the noble gases in Earth's mantle can provide important clues to the origin and evolution of the atmosphere. For example, the modern atmosphere was traditionally thought to be secondary, i.e, derived from mantle degassing after the dissipation of a primary atmosphere that the Earth might have acquired during the accretion process. Theories on the origin of the early atmosphere through degassing of the mantle are now being challenged by new noble gas data and neon isotopes. This research will use new developments in noble gas mass spectrometry that allow much higher resolution and precision measurements than previously available to examine a suite of heavy noble gases and their isotopic ratios to determine the composition of the most depleted mantle domains and understand how they relate to normal and enriched Mid Ocean Ridge Basalt sources. Issues such as: (1) the noble gas elemental abundance ratios in depleted, normal and enriched mantle domains, (2) whether isotopic anomalies in argon and xenon in different mantle domains are related to ancient mantle differentiation events or to the on going process of plate subduction and recirculation that introduces atmospheric noble gases into the mantle; (3) the proportion of Pu- to U-derived, fission generated Xe in depleted, normal, and enriched mantle domains; (4) whether there time-constants associated with mantle degassing can be determined; and (5) whether the non-radiogenic isotopic compositions of Xe and Kr are solar, chondritic, or air-like, will be addressed.  Answers to these questions will allow determination of the flux of volatiles and material from plumes in the mantle into the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) source and the degree of mixing between MORB and plume sources. It will also provide key insights on Earth structure and mantle flow. In addition, the research seeks to constrain sources of Earth volatiles and the recycling of noble gases between the crust and atmosphere and the mantle, and the formation of Earth's atmosphere. Broader impacts of the work include new analytical method development that will increase the infrastructure for science, use of a an NSF-funded mass spectrometry facility, and student support, including support of a student whose gender is under-represented in the sciences. Additional impacts include incorporation of research results into graduate and undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ubiquitous shallow-level atmospheric contamination has until now severely limited our ability to probe the noble gas composition of the Earth?s interior. To overcome this problem, we developed an inexpensive and effective strategy of bottling samples in ultra-pure nitrogen as soon as basalt samples dredged from the seafloor where brought onto the ship deck. The success of our protocol now opens the door to investigating the noble gas composition of the Earth?s interior from a significantly larger suite of basalts recovered from the ocean floor in future expeditions.  The most significant scientifc outcomes from the project are:  1) Multiple magma ocean and atmospheric loss episode occurred during Earth's accretion. The last of these magma ocean episodes was associated with the Moon-forming giant impact. We presented evidence to indicate that Earth's present day inventory of water, carbon and nitrogen were likely residual to the atmospheric loss episodes associated with accretion. That is, water, carbon and nitrogen that we see on the present day Earth was largely delivered prior to the formation of the Moon and not after Moon formation.  2) We presented high-precision measurements of the fission isotopes of xenon in basalts from the Southwest Indian Ridge and find that recycled atmospheric Xe dominates the Xe inventories. While significant injection of xenon from the atmosphere into the mantle is evident, we also find differences in the extent of degassing between the source of mid ocean ridge basalts and the source of basalts in mantle plumes. Mid ocean ridge basalt sources consistently show loss of plutonium-244 (an isotope that was present on the Earth only during its first 500 million years) produced fission xenon compared to the plume source, which indicates a greater extent of degassing of the upper parts of the Earth?s mantle relative to regions near the core mantle boundary. The prevalence of recycled atmospheric Xe in mantle sources indicates incorporation of depleted recycled material from the surface into mantle sources that appear primitive in their helium and neon isotopic compositions. Consequently, the composition of the mantle source with primitive helium and neon cannot be interpreted as the composition of the bulk silicate Earth.  3) From measurements in mid ocean ridge basalts we presented evidence that the injection of argon, xenon, water and halogens back into the Earth's interior is strongly coupled and that water subducted into the mantle retains modern day seawater-like chlorinity. These observations not only demonstrate that seawater subduction exerts a strong control on the volatile element composition of the mantle, but that these diverse volatiles travel as a coherent group through the processes of subduction, mantle convection, and ultimately resampling at mid-ocean ridges.
