<AbstractNarration>Boston University is conducting a Phase 2: Research and Evaluation project to analyze the outcomes of two Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship programs in mathematics, one running from 2007 to 2012 and the other from 2009 to 2015 in collaboration with Math for America Boston. The 48 graduates of the programs are the subjects of a mixed-methods longitudinal study that examines the effectiveness and quality of their teaching and their retention in the high-need schools where they are initially assigned. Effectiveness is analyzed from samples of instructional materials and student work, focusing on the cognitive demands of the assigned tasks. Comparison groups include alumni from BU's other mathematics education programs; members of the Teach for America Boston corps, who take several education courses at BU and are granted expedited licensure; and mathematics teachers trained in other programs who are teaching in the same schools as the Noyce Scholars. This evaluation effort is totally external to the Noyce Scholarship programs themselves and so offers an unbiased view of their effectiveness. The study design includes faculty from the School of Education and a biostatistician from the School of Public Health. The results, to be widely disseminated, are of interest not only to education researchers but to policy makers and the teacher education community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This three-year study tracked the career trajectories of secondary mathematics teachers (grades 6-12) who received a scholarship from three NSF-funded Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship programs at Boston University (BU). The principal goals of this study were to: 1) Continue the longitudinal monitoring of BUÆs Noyce Scholars through and after their mandatory teaching requirements; 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of BUÆs Noyce Scholars Program in Mathematics, and the impact of BUÆs Noyce Scholars in the classrooms and schools where they teach; and 3) Investigate widely applicable research questions about the recruitment and retention of highly qualified individuals who have science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors to teach mathematics in high-need schools.  To achieve these goals we tracked the career trajectories of 52 individuals who were offered Noyce Scholarships at Boston University. 48 of these 52 individuals completed the program and were considered "Noyce Scholars." For the purpose of making a meaningful comparison, we also tracked 110 secondary mathematics teachers in the Boston area who were recruited and placed by Teach For America Boston. The comparison mathematics teachers also received some training through BU, but they entered the field through a different recruitment, placement, and training process. The comparison teachers were certified through an alternative pathway, rather than a university-based training and certification program. However, both the Noyce and TFA programs had similar goals related to placing highly trained individuals as teachers in high need schools.  The major findings of this evaluation were 1) BUÆs Noyce-prepared mathematics teachers were more likely to have an undergraduate STEM major than their TFA counterparts; 2) BUÆs Noyce teachers remained in teaching longer than their TFA counterparts, and were significantly less likely to discontinue teaching after completing their service requirements; 3) TFA teachers were placed in schools with a higher proportion of low-SES students compared to the initial schools of BUÆs Noyce-prepared mathematics teachers, and TFA teachers were more likely to be hired in a charter school; and 4) Noyce teachers teachers reported higher levels of satisfaction with their working conditions, preparation program, and career pathways than their counterparts.  Intellectual Merit: As part of this study we also developed survey items deigned to assess teachersÆ content knowledge and orientation to teaching mathematics. These survey items are serving as the basis of ongoing efforts to develop meaningful measures of secondary mathematics teachersÆ dispositions and potential effectiveness. Creating meaningful evaluation tools such as this survey is a critical area for development in the evaluation of secondary mathematics teaching because state assessments at the secondary level are not necessarily aligned with a specific grade-level courses.  Broader Impacts: Locally, the evaluation efforts related to BUÆs Noyce Scholarship programs has shaped the design of BUÆs secondary mathematics teacher preparation programs. This has lead to concrete improvements in teachersÆ evaluations of the program and its effectiveness. This evaluation has also informed the broader question of STEM teacher recruitment, placement, and retention in high-need schools. The results of this research have been shared in local, regional and national conferences, and publications based on this work are forthcoming.
