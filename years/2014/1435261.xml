<AbstractNarration>Markov chains are mathematical objects used to model random phenomena, such as customer flow within a call center, traffic flow on a highway, as well as protein production within a cell.  This project focuses on the development of new methods towards studying, for such a phenomenon, both its long-run behavior, as well as its behavior over moderate time frames.  If successful, these methods will provide new insight into the behavior of systems that can be modeled with Markov chains, and could lead to improved methods toward managing such systems.  For example, such information could be used to set staffing levels in a call center:  a study of its long-run behavior may suffice when customer arrivals are relatively stable over time, but a study over shorter time scales is needed if the arrival rate fluctuates too often.  This research plan will provide training for graduate students to prepare them for research-based careers in academia, government or industry, and the results of this study will be published in the appropriate scholarly journals, and incorporated into graduate courses taught by the PI.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The methods developed within this project will build on new "random-product representations" recently discovered by the PI, and will be used to analyze both the stationary distribution, as well as the time-dependent distributions of a Markov chain.  Examples of the types of chains that will be studied include hysteretic reflected Brownian motion, various types of two-dimensional random walks on the nonnegative quarter-plane, Markovian queueing systems under the influence of an external Markovian environment and other `matrix-geometric' models, as well as other types of Markovian queueing networks not included within the above-mentioned types of chains.  The results of this study should lead towards understanding what characteristics of a Markov chain lead to stationary distributions having a "product-form-like" structure.  Having such insight should prove useful, as such a distribution often yields analytically tractable performance measures that aid in further understanding the behavior of the underlying Markov chain.  The techniques used in this study should draw from many concepts found within the theory of random walks, and the theory of Laplace transforms should play a large role in the study of the time-dependent behavior of the above-mentioned types of Markov chains.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the research performed under this project was to better understand both the short-term and the long-term behavior of a class of stochastic processes known as Markov chains.  These processes have been used for many decades to model many types of random phenomena that naturally appear in fields like Biology, Computer Science, and Industrial Engineering.  More precisely, this research has led to the creation of new results that give additional insight into the behavior of various types of Markov processes known as Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) processes, which are a versatile class of stochastic processes that are well-suited for modeling many types of random phenomena appearing within the above-mentioned fields.  A classical example of a stochastic process that can be modeled as a QBD process is a queueing system where the arrival and service rates of customers are governed by the behavior of an external environment:  such systems are important to study, given that in real-life systems, arrival and service rates typically vary over time in some manner.  The research performed under this project has also led to a new understanding of both the short-term and long-term behavior of what are known as block-structured Markov processes---which are a generalization of the QBD processes discussed above---as well as new, more detailed results that lend additional insight into both the short-term and the long-term behavior of many special types of queueing systems.  The majority of the results derived through this project built off of a new method, discovered by the PI, of understanding how Markov chains behave over both the short-term, as well as the long-term.  Three different graduate students from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson University have contributed to the research performed under this project.  Through their participation, these students gained valuable experience in learning how to develop and further refine their research ideas and results, and they also learned how to properly write up and submit their results for publication, so that others in the scientific community may further build on their work.
