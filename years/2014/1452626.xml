<AbstractNarration>Dr. Rebecca Fischer has been granted an NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship to carry out a research and outreach plan at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum for Natural History and the University of California, Santa Cruz. This research will focus on the delivery of carbon to the Earth early in its history and the role of carbon in our planet's formation. Simulations of planetary growth will be used to learn about the timing and source regions of volatile delivery to the Earth. High pressure experiments will provide insight into the effects of carbon on core/mantle chemical reactions that took place during core formation. Modeling of the core formation process will apply results from these experiments and simulations to investigate the effects of carbon on the core's composition. This work has implications for the distribution and abundance of carbon in the deep Earth, the origins of Earth's volatiles, and the composition and formation of its core. Fischer will be involved in mentoring undergraduate students and service activities in the scientific community while supported by this fellowship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will feature a novel combination of experimental and numerical methods. N-body simulations of terrestrial planet accretion in our Solar System will be used to explore the effects of imperfect accretion on resulting planetary chemistry with a focus on volatile delivery. Carbon is known to affect the metal/silicate partitioning of many elements at moderate pressures, but this has never previously been investigated at the higher pressure-temperature conditions of Earth's core formation. Fischer will use laser-heated diamond anvil cells coupled with high precision analytical techniques to study these effects of carbon, and use modeling to determine how carbon affects the composition of Earth's core. This highly interdisciplinary study will create new applications of data and simulations to the study of planetary formation and core segregation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In order to track the Earth&rsquo;s carbon, we first need to know how much carbon is in the Earth and where it came from. To address this question, we used numerical models of the formation of the Solar System, and analyzed these models to see where the material originated that eventually made its way into the Earth as our planet was forming, using isotopes of the elements ruthenium and molybdenum as tracers. This allowed us to see when the Earth likely received material from the outer Solar System, which is the most likely to contain significant amounts of carbon, and where in the outer Solar System that material came from. Second, we need to understand when Earth&rsquo;s iron-rich core formed. Specifically, we wanted to know if the delivery of carbon to the Earth happened before, during, or after core formation, so that we could determine if some carbon might have gotten into the Earth&rsquo;s core. We worked on this question by modeling isotopes of the elements halfnium and tungsten, which decay radioactively and act as a timer of core formation. This modeling allowed us to set better uncertainties on the core formation timing that geochemists measure using these elements. Third, we need to know how the Earth&rsquo;s core formed. Here again we used modeling, and this let us answer questions about the physical conditions and mechanisms of core formation, in particular regarding the chemical interaction between the Earth&rsquo;s rocky mantle and metallic iron-rich core. We constrained processes such as the depth, pressure, and temperature of core formation, and how much the mantle and core interacted. Finally, we needed to understand the behavior of carbon deep inside the Earth, so that we could quantify how much should be in the mantle versus the core. We performed experiments in our laboratory in which we recreated the extreme pressures and temperatures of core formation on a very small scale, subjecting a mixture of rock, metal, and carbon to these conditions. After the experiment, we chemically analyzed the material to see how much carbon went into the rock versus the metal (the mantle vs. the core). The results of these experiments tell us how much carbon might be in the Earth&rsquo;s core today, and how much total carbon there is in the Earth. Our findings have applications to other types of scientists, like geochemists who measure isotopes; geophysicists who study the material properties and seismology of the Earth&rsquo;s core; and geomagnetists, who study how Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is generated (it may be influenced by the presence of carbon in the core). Carbon is a very important element, because it is one of the building blocks for life, so it is important to know how much is in the Earth, where it is within the Earth, and where it came from. Another aspect of our project was explaining the results to the public, which occurred primarily within the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s National Museum of Natural History, where I brought meteorites and rocks from inside the Earth, along with our device for generating extreme pressures, and spoke with members of the general public about our projects.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/21/2017<br>      Modified by: Rebecca&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fischer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
