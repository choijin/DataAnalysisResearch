<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel grants to 20 students to attend the IEEE Cluster 2014 Conference which will be hosted in Madrid, Spain, in September 2014. The students will participate in the regular conference activities and a special student program comprised of sessions that target research presentation training, research experience and career guidance, and industry interaction as well as two lunch sessions with invited speakers. The students have the opportunity to present their own work, and receive valuable feedback from both fellow students and experienced researchers working in the field of cluster computing, and interact with academic and industry researchers in the cluster computing community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is often used as the primary venue for interaction between academic and industrial researchers and designers. Historically, the conferences have attracted top research papers from both academia and industry, and many innovations published in the proceedings have been influential in the understanding of emerging applications and computing systems. Increasing the attendance of students in will expose more students to the exciting developments in the field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the field, which will impact both industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>

Most of the students can potentially work as researchers, academics, or engineers in the field of High Performance Computing using large-scale clusters. It is one of the missions of this conference to promote the Cluster community and support the students in finding the right professional ecosystem, improving their skills, and contributing to the common effort toward scientific and technology innovation. To this end, the Mentoring Program at the IEEE Cluster conference in 2014 and 2015 was built as a series of sessions in which students interacted personally with mentors. The sessions were shaped on the model of meetings between a group of students and their advisers. The goal of the mentors was not only to convey information to the students, but also to interact with them in a friendly manner to guide the studentsÃ† own reflection. In the Mentoring Program, the topics of discussion were the many aspects of a professional life in the world of research, including communication skills, career planning, and personal life organization. The Mentoring Program consisted of four key sessions: Tuesday, 14:00 &ndash; 15:30: Session on poster presentations and scientific communication Tuesday, 16:00 &ndash; 17:30: Session on career challenges Tuesday, 19:00: Informal dinner with mentors Wednesday, 12:30 &ndash; 14:00: Session on paper writing Each of the session started with a presentation of the mentors in the form of a personal testimony of their situation when students or junior professionals.  A group of 7 students (5 students from USA instructions received financial support from this grant) were able to actively participate in the IEEE Cluster 2014 conference, get engaged in the community, and meet mentors in ad-hoc sessions.  The low number was due to the fact that the conference took place in Spain.  A group of 32 students (6 female students, 2 undergraduate students, 27 students from USA instructions received financial support from this grant) were able to actively participate in the IEEE Cluster 2015 conference, get engaged in the community, and meet mentors in ad-hoc sessions. The significant larger number of student was due to the fact that the conference took place in the United States in a strategic location easy to reach from most American instructions.
