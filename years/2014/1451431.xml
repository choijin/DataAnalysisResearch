<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. In this Cyberlearning EAGER project, the team is exploring the idea of the post-digital textbook. They envision the post-digital textbook being used in many of the same ways textbooks are used now and, in addition, providing a platform for collaboration, curation, and personalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The imagined post-digital textbook will go beyond digitizing print books and adding animations and simulations where there were once pictures and may be radically different than today's textbooks. The term "textbook" is used, however, to connote that this new genre of technology will assume the persistent, powerful role textbooks currently play. Several theoretical perspectives (cognitive, constructivist, and socio-cultural) are being leveraged to develop foundations for what the post-digital textbook might be. The team is combining such theory with a study of existing educational technologies and pedagogical practices to develop an understanding of the possibilities and then refining those ideas using design charrettes. The investigation centers on two core behaviors that they want the post-digital textbook to address: facilitating knowledge curation and serving as a collaborative resource. The team is iterating on an initial set of goals, affordances, and behaviors to create an initial design spec for this new genre using four activities: synthesis of the literature, user-centered design, participatory design, and expert consultation. This work will serve as the foundation for a follow-up project to explore the design space of the post-digital textbook within the formal learning environments for which it is being designed.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to derive design principles for the digital textbooks of the future, termed postdigital textbooks. The postdigital textbook is an interactive learning environment that is used in similar ways to current textbooks. It is the primary instructional resource in a formal learning environment and serves as a grounding mechanism for classroom curriculum and discourse. However, it is more than simply a digital copy of a print textbook; it provides a platform for collaboration and knowledge curation using advanced learning technologies. This project combined synthesis of the literature, user-centered and participatory design, and the creation and evaluation of technology prototypes to explore the ideal properties of the postdigital textbook.</p> <p>One thrust of this project was to conduct a systematic review of literature to extract desirable student behaviors from multiple theoretical perspectives that could be incorporated into the postdigital textbook. Since different learning theories tend to focus on different aspects of learning, including multiple theoretical perspectives creates a framework with broad generalizability and applicability. The project team reviewed 230 papers, across eight theories, and data from 80 representative studies (10 per theory) were extracted for final synthesis. The theories were: knowledge building, inquiry learning, problem-based learning, cognitive load theory, multimedia theory of learning, mental models, schema theory, and sociocultural learning theory. The twelve student behaviors that had the most cross-theoretic validity (i.e., appeared in six or more learning theories) were: generating explanations, generating questions, writing notes, engaging in discussion, solving problems, analyzing problems, constructing a drawing or concept map, organizing notes, observing others, searching for information, and reflecting.</p> <p>A second thrust of this project was to engage in user-centered and participatory design activities to identify student perceived needs from a postdigital textbook. Four design activities were conducted with both high school and college students: Participatory prototyping (15 participants), a diary study (18 participants), a creative writing exercise (30 participants), and co-design workshops incorporating multiple techniques (12 participants). Some key findings are: Students desire to be able to organize and compare knowledge easily, interact with other students, and be aware of what other students in the class are doing. These needs align well with the theoretical behaviors surveyed above. However, students also seek out automation (e.g., of note-taking), immediate assistance, convenience of accessing information, and efficiency; qualities that may make studying and homework completion quicker but are not necessarily beneficial for learning.</p> <p>The final thrust was to develop and evaluate technology prototypes while integrating lessons from the above two thrusts. For example, one prototype was developed to integrate multiple theoretically beneficial behaviors related to concept mapping. This prototype facilitates students in creating a concept map, taking notes associated with concepts, organizing their notes (by organizing the map), and searching for information online and integrating it with the map. However, it also includes features designed to appeal to student perceived needs such as automation, efficiency, and convenience. Concepts are created easily by highlighting text, concepts are hyperlinked to the place where they were created (allowing students to navigate through the textbook using their concept map), and students are provided with initial templates that they can build upon to make their map. Two studies have been conducted with the concept map prototype, one with 38 undergraduate and graduate students, and a second with 30 high-school participants. Key findings are that the hyperlink feature improves student reading processes, and that templates may inhibit learning unless students interact with them in constructive ways.</p> <p>A second prototype is a question-and-answer integration with the textbook, where students can ask and answer questions of their classmates directly within the textbook. This prototype applies the theoretically productive behaviors of generating explanations, generating questions, and interacting with ones&rsquo; peers, as well as responds to student needs for interaction and assistance. In a pilot study with 9 undergraduate students, student interactions using the prototype were relatively shallow and limited to factual question and answer. Based on these results, the prototype was redesigned to both improve its usability and emphasize the importance of transactive contributions using a &ldquo;microtask&rdquo; model, where students engage with the learning environment by asking questions, answering questions, and identifying contributions of their peers that build on previous posts.</p> <p>This project achieved its intellectual merit goals through the synthesis of multiple sources of information to create design principles for the postdigital textbook. Overlaps and tensions were identified between theoretically-important behaviors, extracted through a systematic review, and student needs, identified through participatory and user-centered design. Prototypes were created that attempted to leverage these overlaps and resolve these tensions, and then additional design principles were generated through the evaluation of these prototypes. This project achieved its broader impact goals, as lessons learned from this project can be applied in the future design of digital textbooks, potentially improving both their learning&nbsp;benefits and their perceived utility to students.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/31/2017<br>      Modified by: Erin&nbsp;Walker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1451431/1451431_10328218_1509389715853_concept-map-prototype--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1451431/1451431_10328218_1509389715853_concept-map-prototype--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Concept Mapping Application"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1451431/1451431_10328218_1509389715853_concept-map-prototype--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Concept Mapping Application"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Screenshot of the concept map prototype.
