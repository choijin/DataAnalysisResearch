<AbstractNarration>Ionized plasmas make up 99% of the directly observable matter in the universe, and a better understanding of turbulence in nearby space plasmas can be applied to many space and astrophysical environments, and to technological problems such as magnetic spacecraft radiation shielding, propulsion (ion engine, solar sail), improving space-to-ground communication and navigation (GPS) links, device fabrication, and fusion energy generation. A new high-power, high-frequency transmitter at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico offers opportunities to study ionospheric plasmas in a carefully controlled way.  This award is for the development of a six-element medium and high-frequency (MF/HF, 0.3 to 30 MHz) imaging radio array. There will be three primary uses of the array: (1) Imaging and spectral and temporal study of radio emissions generated within the relatively narrow beam (about 10-deg full width) of the new Arecibo Observatory transmitter during ionospheric radio wave interaction experiments (heating campaigns); (2) Oblique-angle radio emission observations and multiple bistatic radar observations with an HF radar in Cayey, Puerto Rico; and (3) Direction-finding radio emission observations and radar imaging studies of the ionosphere within the wide transmitter beam of the HF radar in Cayey. Arecibo Observatory HF campaigns are anticipated to be twice a year for about two weeks each, so imaging with multi-kilometer-scale spacings would be done then, using temporary field sites. 20-km to 100-km spacings would also be done using temporary field sites, at least initially. At other times the array would be located at a permanent site at the Interamerican University campus in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, where 10-m to 300-m antenna spacings would be used. The 12-km array (array 1) would image the structure of stimulated radio emissions (SEE) from the HF interaction region with the goal of determining the exact geometries of the source regions of the many SEE spectral features with respect to the geomagnetic field. The array would also show whether or not the polarization of SEE varies between spectral features. Radio images of the geometric and polarization properties of the emissions promise to reveal new details of the physics of the emissions. The Bayamon and Aguadilla campuses of Interamerican University of Puerto Rico are private, primarily undergraduate institutions with nearly all Hispanic, mostly low-income students. The instruments to be developed would enhance the overall capabilities of the atmospheric, space, and radio research infrastructure at Interamerican, including the ongoing development of a graduate program emphasizing atmospheric and space research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We depend on the earth's atmosphere in many ways.  The atmosphere provides oxygen to breathe, and rain that waters plants provides fresh water to drink.  The atmosphere lets sunlight in, and keeps dangerous radiation out.  The earth's upper atmosphere shields us from cancer-causing gamma rays, X rays, and ultraviolet radiation.  A result of that shielding is the creation of the upper atmospheric layer of electrons and ions known as the ionosphere.  The ionosphere may degrade our GPS navigation and satellite communication systems.  On the other hand, the ionosphere makes shortwave communication possible, which has often been a life-saving channel during disasters that cause other systems to fail.  Remote sensing is an important way that we can learn more about the atmosphere, and in particular the ionosphere.  The ionosphere is filled with ions, which give it its name.  Ions are atoms and molecules that have lost electrons.  The "lost" electrons move about, guided by their electrical repulsion to other electrons, their electrical attraction to the positive ions, and by the earth's magnetic field.  Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic waves, and, because of that electrical nature, radio remote sensing is an especially important way to study the ionosphere.  The ionosphere itself is an emitter of radio waves, sometimes naturally, and sometimes in response to interactions with man-made transmissions.  The ionosphere also reflects radio waves, so that we can also use radar to study the ionosphere, in which we transmit radio waves and receive the reflections.  When we observe these radio waves, we can dissect their history in time, study their frequencies, and calculate where they come from, and so learn the ionosphere and how and when it might affect our communication, navigation, and electrical systems.  We can also measure the polarization of the radio waves, which, like polarized sun glasses, can help us obtain a clearer picture of the ionosphere.   Our goal for this National Science Foundation project has been to create a system that greatly improves our ability to know where radio waves are coming from, by making radio and radar pictures of the ionosphere.  These pictures divide the sky into pixels, and we can then see how the waves change in time, in frequency, and in polarization within each image pixel.  There are two important parts in achieving that capability.  One is the radio receiving system, which must be an array of antennas with precise timing between them, down to billionths of a second, so that we can know exactly when each radio wave arrived at each antenna.  The other is the analysis software, which must compare signals at each moment in time between each pair of antennas in the array.  A basic version of this method is used in radio astronomy.  An important difference is that stars and galaxies usually do not change rapidly, but the atmosphere changes rapidly, so we need a quick "snapshot" for our radio image.

This all means that the radio imaging calculations for the atmosphere are much more complex than the imaging calculations done in radio astronomy.  During the course of this project we have made first steps in all of these areas, but there is much more to be done.  Although this specific project has ended, we are continuing work on improving these capabilities.  The radio receivers of this project can also be used in a number of other ways.  The receivers can be used independently from the imaging array, at temporary field sites, for a wide range of measurements.  For example, they may be used for radio and radar observations of meteors, which can help us understand the effect of metals and minerals from the meteors on our atmosphere.  The radio receivers may also be used for high-resolution radio observations of lightning, and of atmospheric electrical phenomena known as sprites.  Data from these observations can be used to help improve models of atmospheric chemistry, which can be applied to the early earth and to the atompsheres of exoplanets, and in that way aid in the search for extraterrestrial life, and in our understanding of the origins of life on earth.
