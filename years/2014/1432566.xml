<AbstractNarration>The algebra-based Introductory Statistics course is both a gateway and gatekeeper course for students interested in pursuing careers in the sciences.  The research literature suggests that students struggle with fundamental statistical concepts for a variety of reasons, one of which is often a lack of understanding of the algebraic methods applied in statistics.  For hearing and sighted learners, vision is one of several modes for accessing classroom-based instruction.  For deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) learners vision is the primary access channel.  Traditional in-class instruction dynamics, which often include simultaneous presentation of multiple sources of visual information supported through mediated communication by interpreters or captionists, places additional demands on DHH learners. To address this challenge, a team of mathematicians, learning scientists, interpreters, and instructional designers will design, implement, and investigate a set of video-based supplemental online learning tools (SOLTs) that have the potential to enhance the academic success of DHH students in the foundational course in statistics.  Visual/graphic and textual representations of statistical concepts will be accompanied by sign language, voice, and captioning.  The objectives of this effort include (1) development of a pilot collection of SOLTs for learning complex statistical concepts in mainstream postsecondary learning environments and (2) testing of the efficacy of these materials in experimental and natural class settings.  The team is examining the proposition that SOLTs will allow students to select from multiple communication options and to control the pace of learning, and thus experience increased ease of communication, higher levels of engagement, and eventually greater mastery of statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project will integrate development and implementation activities with a comparative mixed methods evaluation research design to investigate student understanding of statistical concepts using concept inventories, tests and homework, and data from focus groups on student perceptions of the effectiveness of the different visual presentation modes on their learning.  To test the efficacy of the SOLTs a one-group pre/post design will be combined with a post-test only design with nonequivalent groups under two conditions, an experimental setting and a natural classroom setting. The project has the potential to increase the learning of statistics by DHH students as well as students who are predominately visual learners and to contribute to the literature on the influence of different visual presentation modes on the learning of statistics.</AbstractNarration>

The Introduction to Statistics course is a gateway for the development of students into research scientists. Low incidence learners such as the DHH often receive less attention from mainstream instructors who believe that, with sign language interpreters and other support services, DHH students have equal access to learning in their classrooms. Yet access often falls short of "equal" due to variations of instructional skill, interpreter knowledge of the language of the discipline, and the lack of alternative representations of content. DHH learners have historically received less attention from educational researchers due to a perception that results would have a relatively low impact on the field and benefit a small number of individuals.&nbsp; Our Supplemental Online Learning Tools (SOLTs) began as videos that integrate visual representations of complex concepts with signed explanations to support DHH students learning foundational statistics concepts (see images for screenshots from two versions of a SOLT).</p> <p>In our experimental setting, the students who participated in testing the SOLT videos showed an increase in statistics knowledge after viewing the videos.&nbsp; This is promising, but does it mean that creating these types of videos should be a priority?&nbsp; There are many video resources available online.&nbsp; Not all of them are accessible for students who are deaf or hard of hearing.
