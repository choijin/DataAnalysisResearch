<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for undergraduate students to conduct experimental, observational, theoretical, and computational research activities in earth science, planetary science, and astronomy at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City. Eight students per year will be selected to perform research into topics ranging from meteoritics, to volcanology, to experimental and theoretical astrophysics. The participants will be rigorously trained and well-educated in the fundamentals of the scientific enterprise, and will receive valuable research experience in an active, immersive, integrated research and education environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it recruits from a nationwide pool, this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site particularly leverages longstanding collaborations between scientists in the City University of New York (CUNY) system and at AMNH. CUNY is a 269,000-student urban public university network whose students primarily come from communities underrepresented in science. The CUNY/AMNH partnership will therefore enhance the REU Site's ability to recruit students in urban, traditionally underserved populations. Aside from their primary research activities, REU interns will also participate in Museum programs; attend field trips, colloquia, and conferences to present research; and present their work in a scientific symposium open to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Friends and colleagues, Dr. Jim Webster and Dr. Charles Liu directed a research center for undergraduate scientists in the fields of earth and planetary sciences and astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City.     Jim, Charles, and their colleagues at AMNH and at the numerous campuses of the City University of New York (CUNY) annually assessed several hundred applications for 8 NSF-funded student researcher positions, and then hosted the students at the AMNH for ten weeks during the summer.  The student researchers became true junior colleagues, conducting a wide variety of studies including laboratory analyses of rocks, minerals, gems, and meteorite samples; experimental research on volcanic processes that is based on melting rock samples at high temperatures and pressures in a laboratory; supercomputer simulations of complex physical systems like infant solar systems, plasmas, and the large-scale structure of the universe; and reduction and analysis of numerous astronomical data sets ranging from brown dwarfs and low-temperature stars near the Sun to distant galaxies and supermassive black hole systems billions of light-years away.  The student researchers made meaningful progress in all their research projects, and with support from this grant, a majority of them were able to present their work at major professional conferences each year. Examples include the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, the American Astronomical Society and meetings of the American Geophysical Union, American Astronomical Society, and the Geological Society of America.  Their research work was also incorporated into full-length professional publications in the leading scientific journals of their fields, written by the students themselves as well as by their research mentors.  This undergraduate research site at AMNH proved to have a reach that extended well beyond these 8 NSF-funded student researchers.  Together with their CUNY and AMNH colleagues, Charles and Jim were also able to welcome other undergraduate researchers not supported by this grant into this student research community of earth and planetary sciences and astrophysics.  All together, more than 40 other students from a wide variety of academic, economic, and ethnic backgrounds were able to participate in field trips, museum exhibition and laboratory tours, seminars, professional development activities, and other social activities throughout the summers.  At the end of each 10-week summer period, all the students presented their work at a research symposium held at AMNH, open to the entire museum community and to the general public.  Together, these student researchers have contributed to humanity's understanding of Earth and the universe, and have also taken important steps toward joining America's scientific community.  With their work and their interactions with people of every background and profession, they are sharing scientific knowledge with all of us, and achieving the crucial goal of increasing the scientific and technological capabilities of our nation.
