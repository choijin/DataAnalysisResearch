<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Tyler L. Kelly is "Exotic Mirror Symmetry Constructions." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Cambridge (U.K.), and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mark Gross.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award is being supported by funding from the Office of International and Integrative Activities, International Science and Engineering Section, International Postdoctoral Fellowship Fund.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mirror symmetry is a duality from string theory that explains a relation between different geometric shapes and the ways that geometers study them. In particular, given a particular symplectic space M there exists another space W so that various geometric and physical data is exchanged. The space W is known as the "mirror" of M. This duality between the spaces and the data they provide for one another has been a key part of geometric research for the past thirty years, and has steered the field.  A key question in this research is: given the space M, how does one construct the mirror W? There have been various proposals in the mathematical and physical literature for W, but there was an important issue. These proposals did not always give the same mirror for the same space M. Some constructions of W were not even self-consistent, potentially giving different answers. One key outcome of this project is solving this discrepancy in the context of a framework for mirror symmetry proposed in 1994 by Maxim Kontsevich.

By using mirror constructions, collaborators and the PI were able to isolate special algebraic spaces that should have analogous number theoretic properties by noticing that their mirrors shared other interesting geometric data.   Lastly, through the work with collaborator David Favero, the PI and Favero have been able to construct some foundational results on certain technical tools (factorisation categories for Landau-Ginzburg models) in order to isolate interesting building blocks for algebraic structures related to interesting algebraic spaces.
