<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating an innovative self-X smart battery technology to fill the need for renewable energy, electric transportation and electric grid applications.  Battery units are composed of individual cells connected together to provide the overall energy storage capacity of the battery. The self-X smart battery can automatically configure itself to self-balance from individual cell state variations, self-heal from failures of individual cells, and self-optimize to achieve optimal energy conversion efficiency. These features prolong battery operating time and lifespan while ensuring the overall safety of the system. An improved battery system is important because it will provide a cost-effective, highly efficient, flexible, reliable, scalable, and ubiquitously deployable energy storage solution to address national needs in the fields of renewable energy and transportation electrification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a prototype of a self-X smart battery the uses a power electronics-based switching circuit to demonstrate self-balancing from cell state variations, self-healing from failures of cells, and self-optimization to achieve the optimal energy conversion efficiency through self-configuration of cell connections.  As compared to the leading battery design and management technology, these features provide the advantages of improved energy conversion efficiency and reliability, longer operating time and lifespan, and reduced operation and maintenance costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following limitations in existing solutions as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) the state-of-the-art switching circuit is separated from the battery pack without considering system integration and packaging issues; 2) the state-of-the-art individual power switch in the switching circuit has limited condition monitoring and control functions and needs an appropriate electrical insulation and grounding design for real-world applications; 3) the state-of-the-art online state of charge estimation method is an open-loop method subject to problems of wrong initial state of charge and accumulating estimation errors; and 4) the state-of-the-art solution does not offer an efficient online state of health estimation method.  These limitations will be addressed in this project by designing 1) a power electronics-based switching circuit as an integrated part of the metal connector grid of the battery cells/modules in a battery pack; 2) a low-cost, high-efficiency power switch with integrated condition monitoring and control functions, an optocoupling-based electrical insulation, and a proper grounding design; 3) an closed-loop online state of charge estimation algorithm; and 4) a maximum capacity degradation estimation-based online state of charge estimation algorithm.  In addition, the graduate students involved in this project will receive technology translation experiences through the development of the self-X smart battery prototype.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under the support of this NSF Accelerating Innovation Research - Technology Translation (AIR-TT) project, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) has developed three laboratory-scale, smart, lithium-ion battery system prototypes using an innovative self-X (i.e., self-configuration, self-balancing, self-healing, and self-optimization) battery technology proposed by the principal investigator under the support of a prior NSF grant, and has partnered with McNeilus Truck &amp; Manufacturing, Inc. to have further developed a full-scale, self-X, smart lithium-ion battery system prototype that can be used for the next-generation plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.  The self-X, smart battery system prototypes incorporated multiple innovations developed by UNL, including modular and reconfigurable battery packs, reconfigurable and scalable battery system designs, condition monitoring, power management, and protection schemes, and a new universal space vector pulse-width modulation method for controlling the switching devices of the three-phase battery system prototypes.  The self-X, smart battery system prototypes overcame the design deficiencies in existing multicell battery systems by automatically reconfiguring themselves to self-balance from cell state variations, self-heal from failures of cells, and self-optimize to achieve optimal energy conversion efficiency and prolonged battery operating time and lifespan while ensuring safety of the system.  The results of this project can significantly enhance the performance of battery storage systems in all aspects, including energy efficiency, safety, reliability, and lifespan and, therefore, offered more competitive energy storage solutions for the applications such as electric vehicles, grid storage, data centers, etc.  Through the collaboration with McNeilus, the results of this project have accelerated technology translation to facilitate commercialization of the self-X, smart battery design.  In addition to batteries, the proposed self-X design is transformative to the design of other cell-based energy storage systems, such as ultracapacitors and fuel cells.     The findings of this project have generated five peer-reviewed papers published, two journal papers under peer review, three journal papers to be submitted for peer review, one U.S. patent application, one Ph.D. dissertation completed, and one Ph.D. dissertation to be completed in 2019.  The project team has developed models and software for simulating the self-X, smart battery systems, including the condition monitoring, power management, and protection schemes.  Based on the models and software developed in the project as well as the results of the project, the principal investigator has developed seminar and course materials on self-X, smart batteries and their applications in electric-drive vehicles, renewable power generation, and power grids.  The seminar and course materials have been used to teach undergraduate and graduate students and educate professionals about emerging battery system technologies.  A large amount of data has been generated from computer simulations and hardware tests conducted during this project.  The data provided excellent resources for teaching and further research in the field.  Moreover, the project team has given presentations and seminars on the findings of this project and hosted demonstrations of the self-X, smart battery systems developed in this project for K-12 school students as well as professionals from the academia, industry, and government at a variety of events, including technical meetings, UNL research fairs, invited seminars, laboratory tours, and the NSF AIR-TT Grantee Meeting in June 2016.
