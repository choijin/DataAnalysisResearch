<AbstractNarration>The DEEPWAVE (DEEP propagating gravity WAVE) experiment will observe one of the most dynamically active regions on Earth in terms of gravity wave (GW) forcing, deep upward GW propagation, and overall effects throughout the lower atmosphere, stratosphere and MLT. The program will use the NSF/NCAR GV, HAIS instruments, dropsondes and ISS to attempt to follow deeply propagating GWs from their tropospheric source to their mesospheric breakdown, and to pursue the scientific objectives of understanding deep GW propagation and testing new GW observing systems.  Other NRL Activities will be support under this Cooperative Support Agreement.</AbstractNarration>

The study contributed to improved understanding, modeling, and parameterization of atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) by observing and characterizing them over their entire life cycle (0-100 km altitude) in localized "hotspot" regions identified in the satellite record.  The project provided significant training opportunities for a wide range of audiences, including scientists and the public.
