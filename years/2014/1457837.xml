<AbstractNarration>Pollination is essential to human well-being, as well as fundamental to maintenance of biological diversity. Research showing large-scale declines of plants and pollinators highlights the concern that pollination services are at risk; the problem arises in part because plant habitat is increasingly fragmented into unconnected patches that pollinators may not be able to reach. However, the pollinators and their plants are interrelated in a network of shared plant species and pollinators and so the functions of hosts and pollinator have redundancy. Fragmentation and loss of native habitats is associated with pollinator declines, but according to theoretical models, the structure of pollination networks is expected to make them generally resilient to change because of the redundancy. However, if plant species that are depended upon by many pollinator species (i.e., "keystone species") are lost, pollination webs may be more vulnerable, resulting in sudden network collapse. This research will address two overarching questions: (1) What are the consequences of keystone plant decline and extinction to the broader pollination network? (2) Can landscape connectivity and consequent greater pollinator movement across patches buffer pollination networks against network collapse? The research itself promotes the progress of science and has implications for national welfare given its potential contributions to the maintenance of pollinator species diversity.  Additionally, this work will continue to capitalize on the charisma and diversity of tropical hummingbirds to transmit ideas about the importance of the conservation of pollination services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous NSF-funded work has shown that the movement of hummingbird pollinators is strongly restricted by landscape fragmentation, which results in pollen limitation and subsequent regeneration failure in a common keystone forest herb (Heliconia tortuosa). Under the network collapse hypothesis, reduced H. tortuosa densities will limit nectar resource availability thereby decreasing pollinator visitation to fragments and resulting in eventual network collapse. In this instance, landscape connectivity will decrease the minimum number Heliconia required to maintain network structure. Under the robust network hypothesis, the behavioral plasticity of pollinators will confer resistance to the network, even if some plant and hub pollinators are missing or at low abundance. H. tortuosa will be removed from isolated and connected forest fragments to determine whether altered densities of this species affects (a) hummingbird movement, (b) plant reproduction and genetic diversity, and (c) the structure of the pollination network.  Hummingbird movement will be quantified for all species in the network using Radio-Frequency Identification Devices (RFID). This method will enable observations of the entire hummingbird pollinator community at an unprecedented temporal resolution (seconds) and spatial scale. Broader impacts will include educational and outreach efforts that include substantial media coverage; international citizen science; educational games and student-driven data collection that meet Next Generation Science Standards; and public education efforts.</AbstractNarration>
