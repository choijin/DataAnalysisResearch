<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a record of the stable-isotope ratios of water from an ice core at the South Pole, Antarctica. Water-isotope ratio measurements provide a means to determine variability in temperature through time.  South Pole is distinct from most other locations in Antarctica in showing no warming in recent decades, but little is known about temperature variability in this location prior to the installation of weather stations in 1957. The measurements made as part of this project will result in a much longer temperature record, extending at least 40,000 years, aiding our ability to understand what controls Antarctic climate, and improving projections of future Antarctic climate change. Data from this project will be critical to other investigators working on the South Pole ice core, and of general interest to other scientists and the public.  Data will be provided rapidly to other investigators and made public as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will obtain records of the stable-isotope ratios of water on the ice core currently being obtained at South Pole. The core will reach a depth of 1500 m and an age of 40,000 years. The project will use laser spectroscopy to obtain both an ultra-high-resolution record of oxygen 18/16 and deuterium-hydrogen ratios, and a lower-resolution record of oxygen 17/16 ratios. The high-resolution measurements will be used to aid in dating the core, and to provide estimates of isotope diffusion that constrain the process of firn densification. The novel 17/16 measurement provides additional constraints on the isotope fractionation due to the temperature-dependent supersaturation ratio, which affects the fractionation of water during the liquid-solid condensate transition. Together, these techniques will allow for improved accuracy in the use of the water isotope ratios as proxies for ice-sheet temperature, sea-surface temperature, and atmospheric circulation. The result will be a record of decadal through centennial and millennial scale climate change in a climatically distinct region in East Antarctica that has not been previously sampled by deep ice coring. The project will support a graduate student who will be co-advised by faculty at the University of Washington and the University of Colorado, and will be involved in all aspects of the work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  This project developed a record of the concentration of isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water, from an ice core drilled at the South Pole.  These isotope concentrations provide information about the atmospheric temperature at the time when the ice fell as snow.   The statistical features (the power spectrum) of the isotope concentrations provide information about the thinning of the ice through time. Isotopes were analyzed at very high resolution (1/2 cm) through the full 1751 m depth of the core, resulting in temperature and ice-thinning record for the past 55,000 years.  Among the important findings is that the temperature at the South Pole during the last glacial period &ndash; about 20,000 years ago &ndash; was 6 &deg;C colder than today.  This amount of cooling is significantly less than the value of 9 &deg;C that previous, less accurate results, had implied.  The smaller value of 6&deg; C is in much better agreement with the independent results from numerical climate models.  This project also produced a 55,000 year-long record of snow accumulation rates.  Broader impacts:  Results from this project have been widely disseminated in seven peer-reviewed publications to date, in public talks, and in educational material via the SPICEcore.org and icecores.org web sites.  Two graduate students and a postdoc were trained as part of the project.  Data from the project are freely available at the US Antarctic Program data center.
