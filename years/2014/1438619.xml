<AbstractNarration>1438619 (Smith). In the U.S. and other developed nations, high quality drinking water is typically provided through centralized water treatment and distributions systems. In the developing world, these systems are often unreliable, unable to meet the demand for treated water, or simply do not exist. As a result, 3-4 billion people do not receive reliable, high-quality water delivered to their households. The World Health Organization has indicated that one possible solution to this problem is to decentralize water treatment so that people treat their water right before they consume it in their homes. Designing such "point-of-use" water treatment technologies is a challenging problem, as they must be low cost, technologically effective, simple to use, and socially acceptable. For this study, a porous ceramic tablet infused with nanoscale patches of silver and/or copper is proposed for point-of-use water treatment. The ceramic tablet is most applicable to developing-world water treatment and further, it addresses the three elements of the Triple Bottom Line: social, economic, and environmental sustainability. The ceramic tablet will be simple and inexpensive to manufacture. For use, the tablet would be placed into a 10-20-L household water storage container, where it gradually would release ionic silver and/or copper into the water. The tablet design is such that silver/copper concentrations in the drinking water will be sufficient to disinfect waterborne pathogens while not exceeding the drinking water standards of 0.1 mg/L (silver) or 1.0 mg/L (copper). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, multiple tablets will be fabricated using different raw materials, including two clay types, sawdust with varying particle sizes, silver and copper nitrate at different concentrations, and with and without the use of different reducing and capping agents. During firing, ionic silver and copper will be reduced to zero-valent metallic oxidation states, forming "nanopatches" throughout the porous ceramic. The tablets will be characterized using transmission electron microscopy to determine nanopatch morphology and size distribution and using mercury porosimetry to evaluate ceramic pore-size distribution. Through simulation and fundamental experiments on porous media diffusion, sorption to ceramic pore walls, and oxidation kinetics, the relative importance of these transport processes will be determined and the tablet design will in turn be optimized. Disinfection kinetics will be quantified for viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens for a range of water chemistries and turbidities. Both short- (24-hr) and long-term (6-month) performance tests will be conducted. A field test of this technology will be performed in conjunction with the University of Venda (UNIVEN) and three rural communities located in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Local potters working at a previously established ceramic filter factory in Ha-Mashamba, S. Africa will be taught to produce ceramic tablets. These tablets will then be field tested in two nearby rural S. African communities. The tablets will be evaluated as stand-alone water purifiers, and in combination with more conventional ceramic water filters. Field work will leverage resources of a recently awarded Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Program called "Water, Society, and Health." A life-cycle analysis of this technology will be performed with consideration of economic, environmental, and social factors. Its performance in these categories will be compared to centralized water-treatment and distribution systems and other point-of-use water treatment technologies. Existing point-of-use water treatment technologies have either a relatively high entry-level price point (&gt; $30) or are depleted after a single use (Aquatabs, Pur sachets, etc.). By comparison, the ceramic tablet water purifier is a potentially disruptive technology that that likely could be sold for $5 or $6 while lasting for 6 months without any special action by the end user.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the developed world, most people receive water from a centrailzed water-treatment plant.  The water is purified at the plant and sent directly to homes and office for human consumption.  The water has a chlorine residual, is available 24/7, and is highly regulated and tested to insure high quality.  However, 2-3 billion people do not have this level of service, particularly in the developing world.  There simply are not sufficient financial resources to provide consistent and safe potable water to our developing world population.  The World Health Organization and other agencies have suggested that this problem could be reduced by decentralizing water treatment, wherein people treat their water in their home immediately prior to consumption.  However, development of treatment technologies for this approach represent a challenging design problem.  They must be technologically effective, socially acceptable, extremely inexpensive, and simple to use.  These are challenging design criteria.  In this work, we have developed a new household-level water treatment technology that addresses many, if not all, of these design criteria.  We have develeoped a novel method of depositing nanoscale "patches" of metallic (zero-valent) silver and copper onto a porous ceramic tablet.  This tablet can then be placed in a household water storage container containing 10-20 liters of water.  Once in the container, water permeates the porous tablet and contacts the silver and copper "nanopatches".  This in turn results in silver and copper oxidation and the formation of silver and copper ions in the bulk solution.  Silver and copper ions are highly effective antimicrobial agents.  Once in solution, these metal cations effectively disinfect the stored water, making it safe for human consumption.  We have shown effective disinfection for a wide range of pathogens, including Adenovirus, coliform bacteria and E. coli, and the protozoan pathogens Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia.  Furthermore, disinfection is generally not affected by changes in natural water chemistry, with the possible exception of high levels of chloride ion that are sometimes found in shallow ground water in relatively arid agricultural regions.  Our work has also demonstrated that the silver/copper ceramic tablets are effective for the disinfection of mosquito larvae, which could in turn help to reduce mosquitos as a vector of multiple diseases.  The technology has been systematically optimized so that a single ceramic tablet can disinfect 10-20 liters of water per day for 12 months.  Therefore, on ceramic tablet can treat over 7000 liters of water for a family over the course of a year.  The technology requires minimal user behavior modification.  The user simply placed the tablet in their 10-20-liter water storage container at night, fills it up before bedtime, and the water is safe to consume the next morning.  The user then only needs to refill the container each evening.  The tablet has been optimized to produce silver levels in the water around 30 micrograms per liter, which is sufficient for disinfection but well below the USEPA and WHO drinking water standards for silver of 100 micrograms per liter.  Unlike chlorine, these silver levels do not change the taste of the water, making it more socially acceptable to users than other chlorine- or iodine-based disinfectant technologies.  In addition to laboratory testing, the technology has been evaluated in three separate field studies in rural South Africa, with the most recent field test involving a cohort of 400 families.  The technology was highly effective in reducing waterborne pathogens in the drinking water of the participants.  Given the disruptive and promising nature of this technology, our intellectual property has been licensed from the University of Virginia to Silivhere Technologies, Inc., and the technology has been commercialized and called the MadiDrop ("Madi" is a South African word for "water").  Almost 40,000 MadiDrops have already been sold.  It is currently being used in more than 40 different coutries.       Last Modified: 07/11/2019       Submitted by: James A Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
