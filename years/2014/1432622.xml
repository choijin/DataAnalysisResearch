<AbstractNarration>Bay Path College will increase the academic success, engagement and retention of undergraduate women enrolled in baccalaureate degree programs in Biology, Forensic Science and Cybersecurity. The purpose of this design and development research project is to refine, expand and pilot strategies that will lead to improved learning, engagement and retention outcomes, particularly among low-income, minority and first-generation college students.  The project seeks to implement and extend recommendations for effective teaching in the biological sciences promulgated through the Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education Initiative.  This will include an expansion of course redesign and faculty professional development to implement active, student-centered teaching and learning strategies in upper-level science courses, and integrate core concepts and competencies throughout the curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project activities will be coordinated through the new Bay Path College Center of Excellence for Women in Science, a facility designed to nurture women's scientific career aspirations and ensure they develop the experience, skills and confidence to be competitive, to succeed and to thrive in their professional lives. The project will also build upon successful results from a prior NSF grant through the Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) Program.  Broadening participation of students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM will be achieved through high impact practices, including early student research, mentoring by faculty and STEM professionals, academic enrichment and career exploration through internships and other experiential learning opportunities.  These strategies are expected to improve the academic achievement, engagement and retention of all participating students.  Formative and summative evaluation will address two questions (1) Does course redesign through implementation of Vision and Change recommendations lead to improved student learning outcomes in these courses at Bay Path College?  And (2) Does broadening student participation in high impact learning experiences through the project lead to increased student engagement and retention in STEM in the first two years, and are there differences for low-income Pell-eligible, minority and first-generation college students?   Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to determine the effectiveness of course redesign on student learning.  Students will participate in the National Survey of Student Engagement during their first and final years of college.  Dissemination of new materials and results will be presented at national meetings such as the High Impact Technology Exchange and the National Association of Biology Educators conferences.  Journal articles will be submitted to The American Biology Teacher.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project goal was to improve the academic success, engagement and retention of women in science, particularly low-income, minority, and first-generation students by: (1) expanding course redesign and faculty professional development to implement active,  student-centered teaching and learning strategies in upper-level science and/or math courses, and to integrate Vision and Change core concepts and competencies throughout the curriculum and (2) by broadening participation in high impact learning experiences. We set out 5 specific objectives to accomplish these goals:      1.     Redesign 6 upper level science courses &ndash; provide faculty professional development to implement active learning  2.     Increase % of students who benefit from peer mentoring support to at least 50%  3.     Increase participation in research for upper level science majors to at least 30%  4.     Increase participation in high-impact educational experiences to a minimum of 50%  5.     Increase the 2-year retention rate for all 1st year full-time science majors by at least 25% above the current rate (i.e., from 51.5% to a minimum of 70%)     Objective 1: Course Redesign and Faculty Professional Development      We have achieved and exceeded this outcome as shown below:     1.     We redesigned 6 upper level science courses producing extensive Curriculum Guides for each course including the following: Assessment of Current Course and Priorities for Redesign, Curriculum Innovation Trends in STEM and the Sciences, Key Features of Redesign and Their Pedagogical Rationale, Instructional and Assessment Practices Expected of All Instructors, Course Team Information, Course Resource Plan, Weekly class schedule, format and space usage before and after redesign, Formative Assessments, Summative Assessments, Course Map t, syllabus, and assessment report.  Significant learning gains were achieved in all redesigned courses. We used the PULSE Vision and Change Rubrics to determine strengths and weaknesses by mapping our curriculum which we then used to improve each course to adhere closely with the V&amp;C recommendations.  We have redesigned our entire science and math curriculum for student-centered, active learning as well.     2.     Science and math faculty asked for additional faculty development to learn how to enhance quantitative literacy skills in our students.  We developed a Quantitative Literacy Faculty Learning Community which met each month, engaged in 5 faculty development workshops and accomplished the following: SWOT analysis of math and science curriculum and redesign of 21 science and math courses to incorporate new curricula aimed at enhancing quantitative literacy.      Objective 2: Increase % of first and second year students who benefit from peer academic tutoring or mentoring support to at least 50%      We have achieved and exceeded this outcome as shown below:     We embedded 2-3 "Peer Lab Assistants" in each lab period of gateway courses (year 1 and 2) and were not utilized simply as lab helpers but as CURE and lecture/lab assignment tutors that also held review sessions outside of labs and often virtually. 100% of freshmen and sophomores received this extra course support. Major specific peer mentors were also assigned to all freshmen.  Objective 3: Increase participation in research for upper level science majors to at least 30%      We have achieved and far exceeded this outcome as shown below:      &middot;       An average of 65% of upper level students engaged in CURE research (9 courses) alone (100% of underclassmen engaged in CURE). We instituted CURE throughout all four years of our science curriculum and 2 non-science major courses. Both underclassmen and upper classmen reached and exceeded the benchmark using the EDAT assessment tool for constructing a hypothesis and experimental design.    &middot;       Results using nationally vetted assessment tools demonstrated exceptionally high gains for students at all levels as a result of engaging in CURE in the areas of perceived cohesion, project ownership, positive emotional state, sense of belonging, and science motivation.    &middot;       When individually mentored research projects are considered, 78% of upper classmen alone have engaged in research while all underclassmen engage in CURE.   &middot;       78% of STEM students present their work as scientific posters and/or platform talks at our newly formed Freshmen Poster Symposium/   &middot;       25% present at our newly formed Regional Natural Science Conference   &middot;       25% present at our All-University Annual Symposium       Objective 4: Increase participation in high-impact educational experiences to a minimum of 50%     We have achieved and exceeded this outcome as shown below:     78% of upper classmen ad 100% of under classmen engage in research alone.  Also, when our other high-impact experiences (e.g. speakers, career seminars, field trips, career exploration, etc.) are taken into consideration, 70.5% of our students participate in in high-impact experiences.     Objective 5: Increase the 2-year retention rate for all 1st year full-time science majors by at least 25% above the current rate (i.e., from 51.5% to a minimum of 70%)     While we come close to this ambitious objective (64.4% 2-year retention), we have had great success in achieving our project goal of improving retention of low-income (74.35% retention), minority (86.89% retention) and first-generation (83.06% retention) women in science.
