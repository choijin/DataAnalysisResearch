<AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring 4G long term evolution (LTE) and WiMAX wireless system, enables research projects aiming to develop a real-time wireless video surveillance network to evaluate delay tolerant-base content sharing system, to utilize localization and tracking using sensor data, and to enhance health monitoring. The instrument expands the overlapping areas of surveillance networks, content sharing systems, wireless sensor networks, robotics, virtual reality, and health monitoring, specifically fostering research collaboration in these areas. The overall goals for this work include &lt;br/&gt;- Training undergraduate and Master?s students in wireless networks research, &lt;br/&gt;- Developing hand-on laboratory-based course modules, and &lt;br/&gt;- Engaging in outreach efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Already, the number of devices exceeds the number of wired Internet connected devices, and the gap continuous growing.  This acquisition allows researchers to utilize the strength of wireless networks. The wireless video surveillance network is a sensor network where each node is equipped with camera framing a video scene of the region of interest. High bandwidth of 3G LTE and WiMax can support real-time observation of people and vehicles in a busy environment. On the other hand, the increase in multimedia content makes providing good-quality services in wireless networks a challenging problem. 4G LTE and WiMAX systems have a high bandwidth that can provide reliable service. The instrumentation allows the researchers to configure the 4G LTE and WiMAX wireless system, measure the link performances, (such as RSSOI (receive signal strength indicator), CINR (carry to interference plus noise ratio); and bandwidth on different locations. Additionally, different applications will also be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument supports new undergraduate laboratory classroom modules and STEM recruiting and outreach efforts. The instrumentation can be used in courses such as High Speed Network to provide a quantitative exercise in network configuration and testing. The institution also strives to increase representation of underrepresented minorities within the student population trough mechanisms such as AIM (Academically Interested Minds). The students gain experience in various aspects of multimedia communication and wireless and,in harmony with the REU site program and college-level undergraduate research incentive program, undergraduates will be integrated into respective research programs. Training will also be offered to a broader body of students at the institution and beyond and underrepresented students will be sought. While disseminating the novel principles and methods of multimedia communication developed, an undergraduate research program on the topic will also be established.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Five 4G-LTE base stations were installed in three different locations across Kettering University campus. Several servers were installed to control and manage the 4G-LTE system as well as to connect with GENI rack, which provide the resources to other institutions.   This 4G-LTE system is already used for education and research.  PI-Yunsheng Wang created a new course: CS491 Advanced Mobile and Wireless Networks for undergraduate and graduate students for summer and fall terms 2015. The students utilized the 4G-LTE system to do their course projects. PI-Yunsheng Wang supervised a undergraduate students for 3 month co-op research in 4G-LTE system configuration and application development.   The new building Kettering University GM Mobility Research Center is fully covered by the 4G-LTE system we installed, which can support vehicle network communications across the test track with LTE technic. Researchers can compare the performance between LTE, DSRC, and WiFi for V2X applications. 4G-LTE cellular network supporting makes Kettering University GM Mobility Research Center test track unique across the country, which was highlighted in several media reports.
