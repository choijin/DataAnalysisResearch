<AbstractNarration>The IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Symposium is the premier venue for cybersecurity research, and has been for much of its 30-plus-year history. Student attendance at S&amp;P is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity. The 2015 Symposium will consist of approximately 40 technical papers, a keynote speaker and a series of work in progress presentations. In addition to the core research papers, the symposium will also feature Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide valuable background to students who are learning the literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation in this IEEE Symposium by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Organizers will make particular efforts to encourage participation of women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
