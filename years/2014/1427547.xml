<AbstractNarration>Many autonomous systems today, such as personal or service robots, are designed primarily to perform tasks independently and in isolation. Integrating these robots with human partners can often result in poor performance, as the robot does not know how to interpret human interaction, and cannot merge information from this  interaction with a model that guarantees robot performance.  This research brings together key elements that are just now reaching a sufficient level of maturity for integration: firstly, natural language processing and probabilistic modeling to capture human input, and secondly probabilistic synthesis and verification of the combined human-robot systems to ensure correct performance. The outcome will be theory and software to enable correct, effective and natural interactions between robots and humans to be realized. This research will impact most future autonomous systems which require interactions with humans, including service, personal and planetary robots. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop models and algorithms for synthesizing and verifying an integrated human-plus-robot system based on natural language interaction. Algorithms are being developed for probabilistic modeling and inference of natural language, including the grounding of the constituents of the language into the physical world and the human's expectations. These models will enable the development of a distribution over specifications for control synthesis, which will in turn enable the development and verification of correct-by-construction controllers to a particular level of probability. The out years will consider interactive human-robot dialogue to resolve conflicts, and "open world" scenarios to enable on-line learning of new models over time. It is expected that this research will enable high reliability and performance in many autonomous systems because of the inherent interaction with humans.  Outcomes include open source data and software; community workshops; and undergraduate and graduate student education in the unique area of language, modeling and verification for robotics.</AbstractNarration>

The following summarizes the specific outcomes of the project:  Verifiable models for natural language symbol grounding: We developed a new symbolic representation that encoded propositions, sensors, and actions for use with a verification framework. This model, called the Verifiable Distributed Correspondence Graph (V-DCG), addresses one of the principal research challenges of this proposal by demonstrating how we could extract specifications that could be verified for correctness from natural language in a collaborative human-robot interaction setting.  Abstract symbol grounding: We developed a new model of language grounding that introduced abstract symbols, and showed not only how abstract symbol grounding can be learned efficiently, but abstract symbols can make overall inference faster.   Declarative symbol grounding: We developed a novel mode of incorporating declarative information into our approach to symbol grounding, called the Temporal Grounding Graph (TGG). To support this inference, we developed a novel Markov logic network model that enables a robot to infer symbolic plans from natural language commands in scenarios where the workspace is partially observed or the robot's background knowledge is insufficient.
