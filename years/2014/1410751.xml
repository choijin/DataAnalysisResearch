<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical: This SusCheM award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Harvard University is part of a broad effort to "domesticate" bacterial biofilms for the extraction of rare earth metals and materials. Biofilms are communities of bacterial cells living inside a self-generated biopolymer matrix. This project aims to genetic engineer a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of E. coli to produce altered forms of this biopolymer matrix that have beneficial functions. Specifically, biofilms will be modified the surfaces of proteins with metal binding capabilities. This modification will allow the biofilms to selectively bind to rare earth elements. Rare earths are essential for a variety of cutting edge technologies, including smartphone displays, electric vehicles, and wind turbines. As such, their availability is critical to technological innovation and resource independence in the United States. Despite this, more than 90% of the world's rare earth metals are mined and extracted outside United States because of the lack of environmental and sustainable technologies. The engineered biofilms research proposed aims to develop cheaper, sustainable, green and environment-friendly technologies to extract rare earth metals in USA. Integrated with the research plan will be an intensive student trainings program that will incorporate new teaching initiatives in the fields of biomaterials and bioengineering, and recruiting and mentorship of several graduate and undergraduate students with a focus on women and underrepresented minority students. Undergraduate students will be exposed to STEM topics with a focus on genetic engineering through established internship programs in the Campus. Coordination of outreach activities with local high schools to stimulate interest in STEM education is also part of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:  The overall goal of this SusCheM project is to develop a platform for genetically engineering bacterial biofilms that can serve as scalable materials with programmable, non-natural functions. With this award, the Principal Investigator will study the genetic modification and characterization of the proteinaceous mesh-like surface coating present in biofilms secreted by bacteria. This proteinaceous surface coating called 'curli' contains structural proteins, which self-assemble into an encapsulating network of amyloid fibers in the biofilm. This research involves genetic fusion of peptide motifs to the 'curli' proteins such that the fused peptides are on the surface of the amyloid fibers in the biofilm. These modified 'curli' proteins will be studied for structural and functional properties with a focus on specific metal binding capabilities. The peptide modified biofilms will be produced, and their ability to form extracellular amyloids networks will be characterized as a function of peptide linker length. A plate-based screening strategy will be used to evaluate the composition and metal binding properties of the engineered biofilms and identify those that can selectively and efficiently enrich rare earth elements. The system will also be integrated in a laboratory scale continuous flow separation apparatus to evaluate its potential in an industrially relevant model. Ultimately, the results of this investigation will facilitate the development of a wide range of biofilm-based materials using renewable sources. The research will be integrated with a cross-disciplinary mentoring plan in which graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in subfields of molecular biology, materials science, and chemical/biological engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant supported the development of new methods for the fabrication of functional materials for a wide range of applications. The primary research outcomes were the advancement of knowledge regarding bacterial secretion systems and fibrous protein-based materials, and a new class of affinity filtration membranes produced entirely by engineered bacteria and capable of selectively removing individual heavy metals from complex mixtures. This technology has potential for leading to water remediation and natural resource extraction techniques that are sustainable and can replace wasteful and inefficient current practices. Other aspects of the project pushed the boundaries of microbial engineering and biomanufacturing techniques to be relevant for materials fabrication. These techniques could extend the relevance of biological manufacturing into the realms of biodegradable plastics, wound healing materials for the inside of the gastrointestinal tract, chemical catalysis, and electronic devices. The grant supported the research and mentorship of more than a dozen undergraduates, 5 masters students, 4 Ph.D. students, and 5 postdoctoral researchers over its lifetime. Most of these individuals are now working independently in research jobs in industry, government, and academia. The grant also supported the establishment and ongoing sustenance of a new course on cellular engineering and a Harvard student organization that fields a team to compete in an annual synthetic biology research competition (iGEM). The grant has supported the generation, archiving, and distribution of physical and informational resources in the form of course curricula, genetic parts for microbiological engineering, engineered bacterial strains, and biological fabrication protocols. The results of this grant are supporting commercialization efforts originating in the principal investigator?s laboratory.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Neel&nbsp;S&nbsp;Joshi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410751/1410751_10312156_1569350022809_Film_Noemie-1copy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410751/1410751_10312156_1569350022809_Film_Noemie-1copy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bacterially produced filtration membrane"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410751/1410751_10312156_1569350022809_Film_Noemie-1copy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bacterially produced filtration membrane"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Affinity separation membrane for  the removal of specific metals from water samples, produced by engineered bacteria and composed of customized curli protein fibers.</div> <div class="imageCredit">No?mie Dorval Courchesne, James Weaver</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Neel&nbsp;S&nbsp;Joshi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bacterially produced filtration membrane</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410751/1410751_10312156_1569858299488_BINDEarththumbnail--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410751/1410751_10312156_1569858299488_BINDEarththumbnail--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Biofilm Earth"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410751/1410751_10312156_1569858299488_BINDEarththumbnail--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Biofilm Earth"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">False-colored electron micrograph of engineered bacterial biofilm growing on a glass bead</div> <div class="imageCredit">Richie Tay, Giorgia Cannici</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Neel&nbsp;S&nbsp;Joshi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Biofilm Earth</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410751/1410751_10312156_1569858427592_IMG_7260--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410751/1410751_10312156_1569858427592_IMG_7260--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 Harvard iGEM team"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410751/1410751_10312156_1569858427592_IMG_7260--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 Harvard iGEM team"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Harvard iGEM team presenting their work on engineering biofilm proteins at the 2017 Jamboree event</div> <div class="imageCredit">Neel Joshi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Neel&nbsp;S&nbsp;Joshi</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 Harvard iGEM team</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
