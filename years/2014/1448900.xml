<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a testing system that will facilitate glaucoma drug development in a more cost-effective manner.  This will enable better treatment of glaucoma and ultimately prevention of vision loss.  This work will overcome a major limiting factor for glaucoma drug discovery, and provide scientists and doctors with a unique tool to understand the physiology of the human eye as related to glaucoma.  Commercially, this project will allow for high-throughput testing of new glaucoma therapies, making this technology highly desirable to the pharmaceutical industry.  Longer term, this technology has the potential to provide a healthy transplantable tissue that can cure glaucoma. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to address the lack of effective in vitro model for testing targeted glaucoma therapies.  This work will be the first-of-its-kind, exploring the feasibility to bioengineer a physiologically-relevant 3D human trabecular outflow tract utilizing co-culture and cell differentiation methods along with microfabrication techniques.  It is based on the development of a custom-built system that will incorporate the bioengineered tissue into a platform that mimics the flow of aqueous humor and pressure changes in the human eye.  At the conclusion of this project, it is anticipated that the bioengineered tissue will behave similarly to its in vivo counterpart, and be usable as higher throughput testing platform for drugs affecting the outflow physiology of the human trabecular outflow tract.  In addition, this project will lead to a platform that could be used by other scientists to study and understand the biology of the human trabecular outflow tract.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project addresses the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapies.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the tissue directly linked to this disease: the human trabecular outflow tract.  The absence of a clinically relevant in vitro testing platform that incorporates the trabecular outflow tract and mimics the ocular fluid dynamics has hampered the development of novel glaucoma therapeutics.  To overcome these challenges, we engineered commercially viable biomimetic conventional outflow tract models integrated with a perfusion platform that emulates the aqueous humor outflow dynamics through this tissue.  Such models were designed and created using a 3D multi-culture techniques consisting of primary cells sequentially seeded on a highly porous microfabricated, coated-scaffold.  These 3D model constructs were incorporated in a multi-channel perfusion platform that allowed for constant pressure and flow monitoring. We demonstrated that these models exhibited characteristics and physiological responses to elevated pressure, pharmacotherapies and gene transfer as those described in the human eye.  Considering the well-documented responsiveness of these models to pharmacological agents, this approach can also be used to predict the physiological and toxicological response of medications; facilitating more rapid development of technologies for glaucoma diagnosis and treatment.   The successful completion of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will help accelerate novel glaucoma drug discovery; enhancing the success rate of glaucoma medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.
