<AbstractNarration>High-power photon sources at mid-infrared wavelengths have commercial potential in areas having large societal impact. The proposed work will create a new device that can be used in ultra-sensitive systems for environmental (greenhouse gas detection, ground water and wastewater monitoring), industrial (chemical process sensing and automotive emission sensors), and homeland security (explosive detection) applications. The device could also be used as an enabling component in new systems being developed for biological imaging and in areas such as cancer cell detection. In all of these applications, the higher output powers expected with the "transistor-injected quantum-cascade laser" should allow systems with greater sensitivity than systems where mid-infrared photons are generated with conventional options. The anticipated ability to modulate at high speed (&gt; 20 GHz) also opens the possibility of producing free-space optical links in non-absorbing atmospheric windows. Such links could be used either in place of or to augment microwave-frequency point-to-point communication channels. This work will also provide other societal benefits. Basic knowledge gained will be incorporated into courses at the University of Illinois on compound semiconductor devices, and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed literature and at conferences. The funding provided will allow undergraduate and graduate research projects to proceed. The PI is also committed to advancing STEM education, and has provided seminars to high school students and teachers during various REU/RET programs at Illinois. The PI is also committed to the education of women and underrepresented groups, and a portion of the project funds will be used to support a female graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the objective of this research program to design, fabricate, and test a novel device architecture for the generation of coherent radiation at mid-infrared and longer wavelengths. The transistor-injected quantum cascade laser is proposed as a 3-terminal device that allows independent control of the field across a quantum cascade region located in the reverse-biased junction of a heterojunction bipolar transistor and the amplitude of the injected current, controlled using the forward biased emitter-base junction. Independent control of cascade structure field stabilizes parameters such as state energy and lifetime that fundamentally impact laser operation. This approach provides several advantages over the 2-terminal quantum cascade laser, which is the incumbent solution for the generation of mid-IR coherent radiation. First, free carrier absorption is lower in the proposed device because both the cascade region and surrounding portions of the p-base and n-collector are within the depletion region of the base-collector junction. Because free-carrier absorption is a key contributor to internal loss at long wavelength, threshold current densities are projected to be lower and both slope efficiency and wall-plug efficiency higher. Additionally, because the field in the cascade region can be fixed at a value that provides optimal resonant coupling between the energy levels in adjacent wells and stable energy state lifetimes, the gain as a function injected current is expected to be more stable and have better linearity. Higher drive currents will not cause gain reduction due to field-related misalignment of quantum states and modification of state lifetimes. Finally, because a small base current is used to control the operation of the device, modulation in the multi-gigahertz frequency range is expected to be possible. Successful demonstration of this device has the potential to create new areas of research in both mid-infrared wavelength through terahertz frequency devices and in the applications for those devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report: The Transistor-Injected Quantum Cascade Laser, An Improved Coherent Mid-IR Source  Lasers in the very long wavelength portion of the electromagnetic spectrum have important applications in environmental sensing, medical imaging and cancer detection, communications, and defense.  The capability to use these devices in a system to see the "fingerprint" of molecular vibration makes them extremely useful in detecting the presence and quantity of a chemical species or biological agent.  The objective of this program has been to study a new type of laser for these wavelengths that has been projected to have superior performance and controllability of wavelength and laser power: the Transistor-Injected Quantum Cascade Laser (TI-QCL).  This device incorporates a structure capable of lasing in the mid- to far-infrared (wavelengths beyond about 3 microns) into a transistor similar to those used in cellular telephones to create a three-terminal laser that uses the transistor effect to separately control the electron flow into the lasing section, which controls output power, and the voltage bias across the lasing section, which controls wavelength.  An illustration of this device is shown in Figure 1.  Work on this program has consisted of the development of computer models to assist in device design, the development of processing methods to fabricate and form electrical connections to devices, and the development of systems and methods for measuring the electrical and optical properties of these 3-terminal devices. With regard to computer modeling, code has been written to determine the quantum state energies and quantum wave functions as a function of the device layer structure and applied voltage. This code has been used to determine transition energies and rates, and to visualize the electron density.  An illustration of the graphical output of this simulation tool is shown in Figure 2.  Modeling of the optical properties of laser stripes fabricated with various etch depths and stripe widths has also been performed to allow photomasks to be designed.  With the application of these tools to device design, epitaxial layer structures have been specified and procured.  A transmission electron microscope photomicrograph of a portion of the structure is given in Figure 3.  Fabrication processes for the TI-QCL such as wet and dry etching, contact metal deposition and annealing, thinning, cleaving in laser bar and die, and mounting to In-plated Cu heat sinks have also been developed.  A scanning electron microscope photomicrograph showing the cross section of a fabricated device is presented in Figure 4.  Finally, apparatus has been set up to measure the performance of the fabricated devices.  An example of the measured output is shown in Figure 5.  A noteworthy finding has been that the voltage applied across the base-collector junction can be used to control the band-to-band recombination in the transistor base.  This could become a useful way to modulate the output in a related device, the transistor laser.  Beyond the technical broader impact discussed above this program has enabled the completion of a Ph.D. by a female student, has involved two other graduate students who will be continuing the work, and has enable two undergraduate researchers (one female) to be involved with the project.  Work has been disseminated at technical conferences and through publication in peer-reviewed journals.  Sufficient progress has been made under the program to gain the interest and sponsorship of industry, and work will continue under that sponsorship. Successful demonstration of lasers is expected to lead to larger programs targeting applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring, chemical processing, and defense.
