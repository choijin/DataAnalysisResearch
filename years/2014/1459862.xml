<AbstractNarration>This project addresses coronal mass ejections (CMEs) which are violent expulsions of plasma from the Sun that contribute to space weather. It is vital to understand how these eruptions happen and how they propagate towards Earth in order to accurately predict their behavior. The current fleet of solar and space observatories provides unprecedented temporal and spatial coverage of the surface magnetic field, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray coronal structures. In this study, data-constrained simulations of CME initiation and propagation will be performed starting from realistic initial conditions for the magnetic field and plasma of an active region that contains a flux rope on the verge of eruption. These simulations will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the processes behind the eruption and early development of CMEs. &lt;br/&gt;The project has the following science objectives: 1) Develop models of CME initiation that are highly constrained by observations in order to study the early development phases of CMEs; 2) Constrain CME properties near the Sun (kinetics, morphology, shock and compression region parameters) based on the flux rope properties and the ambient coronal field, and 3) Reproduce the observed three-part and two-front structure of CMEs and their in situ properties using data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. &lt;br/&gt;Data-constrained non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) models of observed erupting active regions will be used as initial conditions to the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) global MHD code. The initial conditions on the active region and flux rope plasma will also be constrained by data using recently developed analysis techniques. These tools will be used to propagate more realistic CMEs to 1AU. The properties of the simulated CMEs (direction, velocity, acceleration, morphology, and shock-driving capability) will be compared with all available observations (coronal EUV and X-ray, white-light and in situ data).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are impulsive eruptions of plasma and magnetic fields from the surface of the Sun, and one of the main phenomena that drive space weather in the heliosphere. After more than four decades of observing CMEs, many outstanding issues remain that prevent us from being able to reliably forecast their occurance and subsequent propagation.  During this award period, we have achieved the following accomplishments:   1) We developed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic models of CME initiation that are highly constrained by observations in order to study the early development phases of CMEs. We implemented a non-linear force free field (NLFFF) reader in the Space weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) of the University of Michigan. This reader adds the difference between the NLFFF and the potential field to the Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM) within the SWMF. This added free magnetic energy is multiplied by a factor slightly larger than one to drive a realistic CME eruption.  2) Within this project, we studied the 2011 March 7th CME event and followed its evolution numerically via the AWSoM model for days, in which time it propagates beyond the STEREO A satellite. Our results show that many of the observed features near the Sun (e.g. EUV waves and flux rope deflection) and in the heliosphere (e.g. shock propagation direction and shock properties at STEREO A) are reproduced.  3) We performed the first ever numerical simulations of three-dimensional CMEs that involved the study of the interaction of CMEs with the Alfven wave turbulence and showed how this results in temperature anisotropies and instabilities due to temperature anisotropy in the environment of a fast CME near the Sun.     The scientific results of this work are relevant for the development of better space weather predictions, and therefore addresses the link of science with societal needs: the mitigation of the adverse conditions in the space environment that can cause disruption of satellite operations, navigation, communications, and power grids       Last Modified: 08/16/2018       Submitted by: Bart Van Der Holst]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
