<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Cheuk-Yiu Ng of the University of California-Davis to conduct experimental studies to look at the reactions between molecular ions and neutral molecules.  In these experiments, Professor Ng and his group will vary the internal energy of the ion (changing its rotational and vibrational energy) to see how this effects the chemical reactivity.   The inclusion of a large number of undergraduates in the Ng laboratory is a notable element of this award. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will receive  technical training in laser science, optical and vacuum methods, and spectroscopy, preparing them for research careers or entry into the skilled technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Cheuk-Yiu Ng and his research group will use high power, narrow-bandwidth lasers to generate short-wavelength radiation in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral region.  This radiation will be used to produce molecular ions (nitrogen, water, oxygen carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide +1 cations) in specific rovibronic states in a molecular beam.  Past work by other scientists has shown profound reactivity differences for molecules with varying amounts of vibrational and rotational energy, but relatively little is known about reactivity differences in molecular ions.  The total cross section and branching ratios will be measured for a variety of collision partners, including hydrogen, methanol, methane, ammonia, acetylene, ethylene, propane, diacetylene, hydrogen cyanide and water. These reactions are important in the chemistry of the upper atmospheres of planets as well as in the chemistry of cometary comae.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A centrral fundamental question for chemists to ask is "What forms of energies or quantum states of a molecule are more effective in driving the chemical changes of interest?"  We have developed a novel molecular beam vacuum ultraviolet laser pulsed field ionization-photoion ion source, which has allowed the preparation of gaseous cation in single quantum rovibronic states in the form of a pulsed beam with narrow kinetic energy spreads.  This state-selected methodology is generally applicable for quantum-state-selection of most cations, and thus represents a significant technical advance in quantum selected studies of atomic and molecular cations. By implementing this ion source with the double-quadrupole-double-octopole mass spectrometer developed in our laboratory, we have been able to perform integral cross section measurements down to thermal energies. A variety if ion-molecule reactions, involving quantum-rovibronic-state-selected reactant cations, N2+(X: v+; N+), H2O+(X: v1+v2+v3+; N+Ka+Kc+), H2+(X: v+; N+), O2+(X: v+), O2+(a: v+), and neutral reactants, Ar, H2, HD, D2, O2, N2, CO, H2O, CH4, and C2H2 have been examined.  These ion-molecule reactions are known to play a pivotal role in the chemistry occurring in planetary atmospheres and cometary comae.  The most surprising results of these experiments are the strong rovibrational-state dependences observed at low collision energies (0.03-1.00 eV).  In addition to provide acurate product ion branching ratios for modeling chemical atmospheric evolutions, the absolute integral cross sections determined here have also served as benchmarks for state-of-the-art quantum dynamins calculations.  The strong rotational enhancement and vibrational inhibition effects observed at low collision energies for the H2O+ + H2 (HD, D2) reactions have been confirmed by qyantum dynamics calculations.
