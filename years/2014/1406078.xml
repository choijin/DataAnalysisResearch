<AbstractNarration>Abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab10) is a chromosome found in maize that breaks the rules of Mendelian genetics. The general assumption of genetics is that every trait, gene, and chromosome has a 50% chance of being passed on to the next generation.  In most varieties of maize, Ab10 cheats these odds and shows up in 70-80% of offspring. However, other varieties suppress this selfish activity. This research will investigate how the individual maize plant fights back and stops the selfish chromosome from spreading quickly through the population. The use of high-throughput sequencing across a geographically diverse group of maize varieties with the ability to suppress Ab10 will identify the genes that evolved to police selfish elements and restore balance to the genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Selfish elements are likely common in nature. An understanding of the race between a cheating chromosome and the genes that evolved to stop it tells the story of natural selection acting at the DNA level. Ab10 cheats during meiosis, a crucial process by which an organism parcels its DNA into gametes (seeds and pollen) and then passes it on to its offspring. Understanding how the selfish chromosome is halted illuminates the steps of the careful dance of chromosomes through meiosis and into the next generation.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, we were trying to find the factors associated with the movement of heterochromatic domains containing the TR-1 repeat by analyzing gene expression in meiocytes from lines that differ with respect to the presence or absence of this form of neocentromere activity.   Prior data had shown that neocentromere activity on heterochromatic domains containing the major 180 bp knob repeat is activated by a specialized kinesin gene that encodes a microtubule-based motor protein.  Given that 180 bp repeats and TR-1 repeats have a similar manner of neocentromere activity, we speculated that TR-1 repeats would be driven by a similar gene.  To identify the TR-1 gene, we chose to assay three different variants of maize Abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab10) that is responsible for both forms of neocentromere activity:  Ab10-I, which shows both 180 bp and TR-1 activity, Ab10-II, which shows 180 bp activity but no TR-1 activity, and K10L2, which shows TR-1 activity but no 180 bp activity.  Two isolates of Ab10-I and Ab10-II were used, and one isolate of K10L2.  For each of these we had paired wild type samples from the same ears, and all treatments were performed in triplicate. For each separate plant, the anthers, containing meiocytes, were first dissected to verify that the anthers were undergoing meiosis.

A much more nuanced and thorough analysis is required before we can conclude that no genes are correlated with TR-1 activity.
