<AbstractNarration>This project at CUNY New York College of Technology will contribute to the national workforce by providing scholarships and educational support to academically promising students with financial need in associate degree programs in computer science and chemical technology and baccalaureate degree programs in applied mathematics and biomedical informatics. Because retention and graduation rates in computer science and applied mathematics reveal a profound underrepresentation of women, the project will place a heavy emphasis on recruiting and enrolling greater numbers of female students and in providing evidence-validated interventions to support their retention, graduation, and workforce entry. The college is a Hispanic Serving Institution ranked third in the nation in the number of associate-level STEM degrees awarded to Black students, 23rd in degrees awarded to male students, and 48th in degrees awarded to women. Because the college is a minority-serving institution, improving retention and graduation will increase the participation of underrepresented students in STEM undergraduate and graduate programs and the New York City workforce, having ever-widening social and economic impact on individual students, the institution, and the wider community. Using an active dissemination agenda the institution will share key strategies and outcomes to other CUNY institutions, peer Hispanic Serving Institutions, and other non-research-intensive undergraduate institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through well crafted activities the project will (1) recruit and increase participation in four targeted science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors, focusing on women, promising underrepresented students from local minority-serving high schools, and undeclared and liberal arts students with strong math preparation; (2) retain and graduate academically talented, low income students in STEM programs by strongly encouraging students to register for 15+ credits per semester to promote timely progress to graduation; (3) provide comprehensive support structures at critical junctures that include financial support, academic advisement, academic support, and career counseling, using a natural cohort approach to developing a professional STEM identity; (4) increase internal transfer of students from associate degree to baccalaureate degree programs and STEM graduate study or workforce placement through advisement; and (5) evaluate and assess the program, employing a cycle of continuous improvement and well-defined metrics of project success. The project will build upon intensive analysis of institutional data on retention and graduation in the targeted programs and will implement a comprehensive set of academic and social interventions such as Peer-Led Team Learning and other cohort-strengthening high impact practices that have proven effective with low-income students. In addition, the new baccalaureate program in Biomedical Informatics at the college will develop competencies in computer applications in the use of conformational and genomic data to elucidate biological phenomena and the secure electronic storage, retrieval, and use of biomedical information in healthcare delivery and research, reflecting the latest approaches in a burgeoning and rapidly changing field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advancing Student Futures in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics  New York City College of Technology (City Tech), The City University of New York (CUNY)  ABSTRACT  New York City College of Technology, the urban technology college of the vast City University of New York (CUNY) system, is a designated Hispanic-Serving Institution currently enrolling 17,300 students, of whom 63% identify as Black or Hispanic. City Tech is nationally ranked by the NSF based on the number of associate-level STEM degrees awarded to Black students, women, and other minorities, and is recognized as a vital engine of regional and national economic mobility. This NSF-sponsored grant program (2015-2020) aimed to expand the reach of the College by nurturing academically promising urban students, with a particular focus on women students, in select associate degree (Computer Science, Chemical Technology) and baccalaureate degree (Applied Mathematics, Applied Chemistry, Biomedical Informatics) programs through graduation.  Intellectual Merit  City Tech's S-STEM program deployed a multifaceted, evidence-based strategy to provide both academic and financial support to at-risk students, and investigated the outcomes of these interventions particularly in an urban academic setting. The strategy involved need-based financial assistance tied to a matrix of constant support in virtually all aspects of the scholar's college life. This support included close academic advisement, tutoring, leadership opportunities, research opportunities, and periodic co-curricular activities that fostered a sense of community, in addition to career counseling and, in some cases, guidance towards baccalaureate or graduate and professional studies. Improvements in key metrics?cumulative GPA, retention and graduation rates, time to graduation, participation of under-represented minority (URM) students and women in STEM majors - have been analyzed and presented in peer-reviewed publications and in conference proceedings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.  Broader Impacts  City Tech's S-STEM program exceeded its proposed reach, providing 216 full-semester scholarships to a total of 94 scholars, of whom 49% are women and 47% self-identified as URM. The grant contributed directly and demonstrably to an increase in overall enrollments of women and URMs in the selected STEM majors in the College. Participation of women in the program also expanded markedly throughout the duration of the grant. Notably, of the scholars pursuing Computer Science and Applied Math, where profound gender imbalances still persist, 36% were women, significantly higher than the national average. As of this writing, 69% of scholars have graduated, augmenting the national STEM workforce in diverse paths, including emerging fields such as Biomedical Informatics, while 18% are still enrolled full time and on track for graduation. Among baccalaureate graduates, 73% achieved academic distinction (cum laude/magna cum laude/summa cum laude), including two scholars who were honored as College valedictorians. The program's success across key metrics validates our student support strategy as a viable and robust template for similar future efforts within CUNY as well as other urban STEM programs.
