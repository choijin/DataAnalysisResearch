<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to create a new intellectual partnership between US- and Australia-based researchers to explore the dynamics of a coupled natural-human system: the restoration of ecosystems to provide ecological services. The foreign collaborators are conservation ecologist Kerrie Wilson (University of Queensland), and environmental economist Marit Kragt (University of Western Australia). Increasingly, societies are calling on ecological restoration not just to reverse the degradation of habitats for flora and fauna, but to yield valuable material and non-material benefits to humans, such as water quality, carbon sequestration, pollination, and recreational opportunities. This work will explore an understudied social dimension of ecological restoration through a series of stakeholder surveys. It aims to elucidate the relationship between what people know, how much they care, and whether they act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research asks the basic question, "How does what people know influence how they act?" Answering this question is fundamental to understanding what makes for "actionable science," and to developing resilient natural-human systems, shaped by people to meet their needs sustainably. Our pilot study will advance understanding of a major component of the socio-ecological system surrounding habitat restoration, while laying the groundwork for future work that will explore how stakeholders, scientists, land managers, and policymakers interact with ecosystems to determine ecological trajectories. The findings will be directly useful to resource management, especially conservation planners and restoration practitioners. The project will lend international experience to an early-career, female scientist exploring a new scientific direction under the mentorship of the foreign collaborators. An undergraduate student will be trained in research and teaching skills, and the PI?s experience with new methods will enrich coursework at a primarily undergraduate institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ecosystem services are the benefits that people derive from the functioning of intact ecosystems like forests and wetlands. For instance, birds and bats that shelter in a forest may fly out and consume mosquitoes and crop pests in the surrounding croplands or suburbs. This pest control service is valuable, and must be replaced by costly and potentially dangerous insecticides if the forest is cut down. Ecosystems provide many other services like this: available naturally for free, but expensive or difficult to replace if the ecosystem becomes degraded.  When people undertake the restoration of degraded ecosystems, it is often for the benefit of plant and animal habitat, but it should also bring back natural ecosystem services that benefit people. More and more, land managers and the government are looking to restoration to provide these services, and market-based mechanisms are being developed to ensure them.  The questions motivating our research were:  1) Suppose that when you restore an ecosystem, you have to choose between certain services, because managing the restoration one way prioritizes one service but not another. How do we choose which are the most important?  2) What if the ones that public thinks are most important are not the ones that land managers are trying to restore, or government agencies are trying to fund? How do we reconcile these different priorities so that conservation dollars are efficiently spent?  We did our research by surveying different groups of people. We designed an online survey for the general public that asked people which services they preferred. We also gave them a hypothetical restoration scenario and asked them to say how much money out of their own pockets they would be willing to pay to make the restoration happen.  For the government, we looked at what restoration projects were actually funded, and analyzed the text of their goals to see if they were prioritizing certain services.  For the land managers who actually do the restoration work, we asked them to rank their goals when they do projects.  Our analysis showed that priorities are pretty well aligned between government, practitioners, and the public. However, when compared to the government and the managers, members of the public assign relatively more importance to ecosystem services as opposed to habitat benefits. And the government is somewhat more concerned about providing jobs and educational/cultural benefits to the public through restoration than the managers are.  We also found that willingness to pay among the public was higher when the project had significant benefits for ecosystem services, and not just for habitat. People were more willing to pay if they thought the project would benefit them personally, and if they were disinclined to see potential downsides to the project.  Next we're planning to analyze how people's willingness to support restoration with their own dollars relates to their beliefs about the environment, and to their core values. We think this will be pretty interesting, because the conventional wisdom is that people support environmental causes when they are altruistic or biosphere-focused in their values.
