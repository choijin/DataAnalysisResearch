<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Kathryn A. Lindsey is "Spaces of Dynamical Systems." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Chicago, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Amie Wilkinson.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the 3 years of the fellowship, the PI conducted research in pure mathematics in the field of dynamical systems under the supervision of Amie Wilkinson at the University of Chicago.  The PI co-authored 5 research papers on topics in complex dynamics and Teichmuller dynamics.    Highlights of these papers include the following results:  (1)  With M. Younsi, the PI classified which subsets of the complex plane are  otally approximable by polynomial Julia sets.  (2)  With J. Chaika, the PI proved that the horocycle flow in almost every direction on any flat surface is dense in the SL2R orbit closure of that surface.    (3)  With L. DeMarco, the PI explored a construction suggested by W. Thurston of 3-real dimensional objects associated to connected polynomial Julia sets.   The PI disseminated these discoveries through written research articles and lectures at conferences and seminars.  During the tenure of the fellowship, the PI gave 27 invited lectures on her research; 11 of these lectures were at national and international research conferences, and 16 were in seminars or smaller workshops.     The PI contributed to local and scholarly communities through various outreach and mentoring activities.  During summers 2015 and 2016, she taught units on dynamical systems in the U. Chicago Research Experience for Undergraduates program, and supervised three undergraduate summer research projects in mathematics.  During summer 2017, the PI taught a 2-week course for local 9thand 10thgrade high school students on complex dynamics as part of the Young Scholars Program at U. Chicago.  The PI also served as organizer of the U. Chicago Dynamical Systems research seminar during academic year 2015-2016.
