<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this study is to understand how material is transported by fluctuating motions in the ocean and the atmosphere.  The project involves creating a number of models which can be run in real-time and can be used to illustrate visually the distinction between stirring and diffusion and the rapidity by which both together can homogenize a tracer. The approach can help in the understanding of the importance of eddies and weather systems in determining the transports and distributions of pollutants, components of ecosystems, heat, and ozone. The models will be made available on the web as well as in an interactive textbook on numerical fluid mechanics.  The project includes training of a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate eddy mixing processes using idealized flow models for which the diffusion can be precisely controlled. The specific aims of the study are to contribute to improved understanding of: (1) the ways in which fluxes are non-local (i.e., depend on more than just the value of the gradients of the mean at the point of interest), (2) the effects of inhomogeneities both in the means (where the non-local nature of stirring comes into play) and in the eddy properties, and (3) how fluxes for reacting fields such as biogeochemical variables differ from passive tracers. Simulations together with analytical methods will be used to gain a deeper insight into the processes acting and the interplay among them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project studied the basic theory of the way turbulence mixes material carried along with the flow.  It applies to a wide range of phenomena, from stirring coffee to the 1000 km scale weather patterns in the atmosphere and the 100 km scale eddies in the ocean.  The project demonstrated mathematically and illustrated with examples that (1) mixing is non-local, because the eddies can carry material long distances and for long times (2) when the material is undergoing chemical or biological reactions the flux is different.  If multiple components are involved in the reactions, the transport of one depends on the structure of all of them.  For example we consider a predator (e.g. zooplankton, Z) and prey (phytoplankton. P), we could have a situation where, in the absence of stirring, P is uniform even though Z is not. Stirring a uniform P would not lead to any flux without reaction, but would when predation is considered.  Climate models rely on representing process which are too small compared to the computational grid, and which can include effects not included in the large-scale dynamics of the model.  These "mixing parameterizations" are an essential part, since they can determine how, for example, heat enters or leaves the ocean.  We examined non-local mixing in the surface layer of the ocean, calculated the non-local structure of the mixing, and showed that it differed from conventional approaches.  We believe that the formulation of turbulent transport studied in this project can suggest approaches to parameterization which fully respect the relevant physics.
