<AbstractNarration>Accurate human motion tracking and activity recognition are important in supporting numerous areas of computer science and engineering research, ranging from user modeling and human robot interaction to graphics and animation. A good resource of annotated datasets and annotation tools is particularly important in research involving physical human limitations, persons with chronic disabilities, such as post-stroke, ALS, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Cerebral Palsy, and others. Currently, a comprehensive community CRI with human activity data and analysis tools is not in place. The development of new methods and algorithms that will improve and enable real-world motion tracking applications is hampered by an inherent difficulty: the lack of large sets of training and testing data. This planning activity brings together experts in computer vision, machine learning, data mining, user interface design, assistive environments, human robot interaction, databases research, big data involving real time human activity, therapists, clinicians, device makers and sensor developers in order to identify the specific human activity data that should be collected and processed when building a repository of automatically and accurately annotated video data of human motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, a repository of automatically and accurately annotated video data of human motion has the potential to impact the research of several disciplines using human motion tracking and recognition by significantly improving the ability to recognize behavioral markers for assessing the confluence of environment, drugs, human psychology and thus extend clinical and psychological areas. However, due to big data issues (volume, velocity, variety, veracity, arising from multisensory visual input of human behavior), the tasks of automating data collection and especially annotation are non-trivial. Traditionally, video data of human motion are collected and annotated manually. Due to the large amount of data generated by video sensors, this task is very tedious and error prone. For this reason, most existing datasets are very small and specialized to the problem for which they were collected. This project will gather input from the research user communities on how to best develop such a CRI repository of human activity.  A workshop will be organized with invited experts who will help identify the specific human activity data that should be collected and processed. The input solicited during the workshop will help define the features and facilities of the proposed Smart-Move repository, a spatiotemporal annotated human motion repository by focusing on the following: (1) determining the specific activities to be captured and the methods of multisensory data collection; (2) tools for accurate real-time annotation and storage of the collected data;  (3) search facilities to enable researchers to contribute and provide feedback;  (4) event recognition and data summarization tools to enable researchers to analyze their own new big data automatically; (5) feasibility of the proposed data collection and analysis using a strategically chosen set of multi-stream data to keep the overall project cost low; (6) limitations when modeling heterogeneous types of human activity data collected by different sensors or of different sample frequencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcomes Report for Planning Grant Award Number: 1405985  CI-P: Planning for SMART-MOVE: A Spatiotemporal Annotated Human Activity Repository for Advanced Motion Recognition and Analysis Research  PI: Fillia Makedon (UTA)  Awardee: University of Texas at Arlington  Program Officer: JIE YANG; email: jyang@nsf.gov ; Phone:  (703) 292-4768  Introduction  The objective of the CI-P planning grant Smart Move Project is to research the creation of a large and comprehensive community repository of human motion activity that enables researchers in the field to understand human behavior and intent.  Such a repository is currently not in place. Motivation  The collection and analysis of human motion data is often done manually, a task that is tedious and error prone, due to the large amounts of data generated by the video sensors. Thus, most existing datasets are small and specialized to a particular problem for which they were collected. The Smart-Move planning project was to organize meetings and workshops to collect community feedback as to the type of CRI resource needed and how to design it, what data to collect and annotate, how to overcome operational obstacles associated with recognizing human motion and its feasibility and applicability. A community of users was identified for whom the proposed repository would enhance their productivity and advance their research. Summary of Planning Activities  During the planning period, the PIs invited ~50 world experts to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing datasets and ways to address the lacking infrastructure. The PIs planned several workshops, made the planning activities known in many conferences and meetings they attended, including conferences such as Petra (www.petrae.org). Invited speakers and panel participants addressed (1) Appropriate human motion activity data to be collected and sensors to be used; (2) Development of tools for automatic data annotation, searching and others; (3) Automatic "event recognition" and "data summarization" and (4) Feasibility of the community infrastructure. Project Outcomes and Findings Through the many research contacts that were established, research needs and opportunities were identified and related to ongoing challenges of algorithm development and optimization for big data applications, as well as related work in machine learning, data mining, big data analysis, software engineering, and embedded systems. The outcomes and findings include the following:  1. Understanding human behavior from motion activity is a very complex big data problem that requires the collection and fusion of large amounts of multisensing data and interdisciplinary expertise. This is particularly true if human motion is to be used to understand conditions such as, stress, fatigue, deception, drowsiness, excitement, pain, etc.  Thus, focusing on specific applications of national strategic importance is a reasonable approach. 2. In preparation for a community CRI proposal, the PIs put together a multidisciplinary team of experts in the area of human motion activity as related to vocational training. Two NSF grant proposals were prepared, one of them funded (PFI) and the other one pending (CPS). 3. A medium IIS &ndash; CRI proposal was submitted (no. 1629924), entitled, "CRI Proposal: II-New: Big Data Analytics Research Accelerator (BDA)", to study how to overcome big data challenges in building a human activity repository. The BDA proposal aimed to overcome obstacles such as, being able to quickly test an algorithm, reproduce research across applications, or to quickly evaluate work through experimentation. It was to develop critical CRI infrastructure using open-source solutions for big data, to enable researchers to look up and compare information quickly, without having to go down into fine-grain detail about the data.  This proposal was not funded but it provided a valuable resource to develop a future CRI community grant. Intellectual Merit  The project offers scientists an advanced integrative computational infrastructure that tags data semantically, making it easier to test hypotheses, recognize new relationships and explore different research alternatives through a one stop distributed repository infrastructure. The Smart Move repository can advance discovery by enabling information researchers to express their algorithms more expressively, enable easy reproducibility of experiments, reference and query different data sources, support data-intensive research activities, accelerate research through the abstraction of implementation details, and foster cross-disciplinary research. Broader Impacts  The project facilitates data sharing and collaboration among its users, leads to a deeper understanding of a problem, provides ways to compare findings, and enables the creation of new relationships among datasets that may lead to unexpected discoveries. Applications include: Healthcare (improve healthcare training and delivery, identify best practices, improve decision-making, and provide access to computational resources to novices); Manufacturing (work efficiency/safety), Training (shorten learning curve); Cybersecurity and Privacy. The project provides rich and compelling resources to engage students into Big Data Science research.          Last Modified: 09/24/2017       Submitted by: Fillia S Makedon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
