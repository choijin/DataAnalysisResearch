<AbstractNarration>This project has the goal of improving  understanding of the basic dynamical processes that drive tropical/extratropical interaction on the intraseasonal time by performing both idealized numerical model experiments and diagnostic analyses. Enhanced understanding of tropical/extratropical interaction is crucial for improving medium range (1-4 week) weather forecasts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent studies have shown that different phases of an active tropical Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) are followed 1-4 weeks later by the excitation of the dominant Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns (both the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Pacific/North American patterns), and coincide with large changes in the frequency of occurrence of these teleconnection patterns. It has been found that probabilistic weather forecasts based on both MJO and El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation phases outperform state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models for North America with lead times of 2 to 4 weeks. Changes to Arctic surface air temperature have even been observed following an active MJO.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Teleconnection patterns are spatial patterns associated with weather and climate that extend over very large distances, from an entire ocean basin, such as over the North Atlantic Ocean, to an entire hemisphere. As such, teleconnection patterns correspond to simultaneous changes in weather at distant locations.   Interest in teleconnection patterns stems in part because they tend to persist for two to three weeks.  Therefore, an improved understanding of teleconnection patterns has the potential to improve weather forecasts with lead times of two weeks and beyond.  The research for this proposal focused on the mechanisms that drive teleconnection patterns, and the impact of these teleconnection patterns.  Research from this grant has enhanced our understanding of how large-scale convection in the tropics (regions of thunderstorm activity in the tropics that span more than 1,000 km) excites teleconnection patterns in the extratropics.  The two most prominent forms of tropical convection are the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  The MJO has a period of about 30-60 days and the ENSO 3-7 years. The results from this grant showed that both the MJO and ENSO have a very large impact on teleconnection patterns.  For example, our results show that both the MJO and ENSO excite the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific/North American teleconnection (PNA) patterns, the two most prominent patterns in the Northern Hemisphere. In the sea level pressure field, the NAO has a dipole spatial structure over the North Atlantic, and the PNA a quadrupole structure that spans the North Pacific and North America. Both teleconnection patterns are associated with large changes to the weather which can persist for two weeks or longer. The MJO and ENSO influence how long the teleconnections remain active, which is particularly relevant for longer range weather forecasts. It was found that particular teleconnections, such as the PNA, are particularly sensitive to details in the tropical convection, such as whether particular centers of tropical convection are stronger or weaker than average.  Our results also showed that impact on tropical convection on teleconnection often includes a pathway through the stratosphere.  Teleconnections were also found to have a large impact on the weather and climate in the Arctic.  For example, it was shown that the poleward transport of warm, moist air into the Arctic by teleconnection patterns is followed by an increase in downward infrared radiation at the Arctic Ocean surface and the subsequent melting of Arctic sea ice.  These results suggest that much of the inter-decadal Arctic warming trend, i.e., the so-called Arctic Amplification, does not arise from the commonly accepted mechanism of ice-albedo feedback. (Arctic Amplification is an important topic, because during the past few decades the Earth's surface has been warming most rapidly in the Arctic.)  These results suggest that Arctic Amplification arises from a slow long-term increase in the frequency of warm, moisture air intrusion events into the Arctic. Our findings also suggest that the teleconnection patterns associated with Arctic sea ice loss are ultimately driven by tropical convection.  Another aspect to teleconnection patterns we have examined involves constructive interference.  This phenomenon takes place when the teleconnection patterns grow and take on a spatial structure that resembles the time-mean waves in the atmosphere. When constructive interference takes place, it was found that the Arctic warms, the winds in the stratosphere weaken, and the negative phase of the NAO is excited.  The constructive inference was found to be preceded by tropical convection.  These results suggest that constructive interference could be a very important predictor for long range weather forecasts.  Another lesser known teleconnection pattern, known as the circumglobal teleconnection pattern was investigated.  As indicated by its name, this pattern is observed at all longitudes.  It was found that an active circumglobal teleconnection pattern excites extreme cold events in the eastern US that persist for about 10 days.  The findings of this reserach on teleconnections has also given insight into inter-decadal changes in climate.  Our results have shown that much of inter-decadal climate variability can be understood as arising from inter-decadal changes in the frequency of intra-seasonal (2-3 week) teleconnection patterns.  These findings suggest that a fruitful approach for investigating climate variability is to examine the processes that causes slow changes in the frequency of intra-seasonal teleconnection patterns.
