<AbstractNarration>Banta, Scott &lt;br/&gt;1402656 &lt;br/&gt;Columbia University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The separation of important molecules from complex solutions is often accomplished using proteins or peptides that have been engineered to bind the target with high affinity and selectivity. One challenge in this approach is the recovery of the target, and reuse of the binding peptide. The PI has been working with a unique peptide (called the beta roll) that is unstructured in the absence of calcium, and folds into a flattened corkscrew shape in the presence of calcium. The PI has previously engineered one face of the corkscrew for self-assembly, and has preliminary data showing the peptide can be engineered to bind to a model target protein (lysozyme). The goal of this NSF project is to develop a high throughput method to engineer new beta roll mutants that can bind to different protein targets that are important in biotechnology. The incorporation of these new engineered peptides into a bioseparations platform would be very beneficial, as it would allow for target proteins to be bound in the presence of calcium and then released upon calcium removal. This process could improve performance and reduce the costs associated with critical protein molecules, especially therapeutic proteins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the key challenges in affinity-based separations is the elution of the target molecule from the affinity binding reagent. The PI proposes to expand the directed evolution approach to substantially increase the affinity of the beta roll peptides to desired targets and expand the number of targets for molecular recognition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A method for selection from a randomized library has been developed, but higher affinity binders will require a directed evolution approach where genetic diversity is incorporated into the library. New beta roll peptides with high affinity for GFP and two common protein expression and purification tags will be researched: the maltose binding proteins (MBP) and the glutathione S transferase protein (GST). By immobilizing these evolved, high-affinity beta roll peptides on a suitable support, the PI may be able to demonstrate the use of these peptides to affinity purify MBP- and GST-tagged proteins, and use calcium chelation to elute the purified proteins. The resin can be regenerated via calcium addition and the performance of this system can be compared to traditional methods for purification with these fusion tags (amylose resin and GSH resin). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this proposal results from the use of a unique peptide with an intrinsic triggered conformational change as a starting scaffold for the engineering of biomolecular recognition. The calcium-induced conformational change of the beta roll peptides is a powerful molecular switch that can be exploited to reversibly disrupt engineered biomolecular interactions. Using this peptide as a starting scaffold, we will be able to generate a collection of peptides that can bind target proteins in a calcium-dependent fashion, and these new peptides will be valuable biomolecular recognition elements for affinity bioseparations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impact of this proposal arises from the use of protein engineering to develop a new binding motif for use in applications such as biosensors and bioseparations. The use of intrinsically disordered scaffolds for biomolecular recognition has not yet been reported in the literature, and this proposal will demonstrate that these systems can be engineered to be high affinity binders, which will be boon to those working in areas such as biosensors, smart drug delivery, bionanotechnology, and bioseparations. Funding will also be used for the mentoring of students and to continue existing outreach activities in the local community.</AbstractNarration>

We have extensively characterized this unique structural transition and we have begun to engineer these peptides for useful biotechnology applications. The intellectual merit of this proposal stems from the hypothesis that we could engineer these peptides to bind to useful protein targets in the folded state, and this binding would not occur in the absence of calcium when the peptides are in the disordered state.  During the course of this project, we have created a large randomized library of peptides, and selected members of the library that are able to bind lysozyme, a useful model protein.  The initial native beta roll peptide had some weak affinity to lysozyme, and we were able to identify mutants that exhibited enhanced binding in the presence of calcium and no binding of lysozyme in the absence of calcium.  New proteins were made by connecting these engineered peptides together, and a sequence with two consecutive copies of our best engineered peptide exhibited an apparent dissociation constant of 65 nM for lysozyme in the presence of calcium.  We demonstrated the broader impact of this advance by using the peptide in affinity chromatography experiments.  The peptides were immobilized on solid beads and a mixture of E. coli proteins spiked with lysozyme was introduced to the column in the presence of calcium.  The peptides selectively bound the lysozyme, and other proteins were washed away.  The column was then washed with a calcium-free buffer, and this disrupted the structure, releasing the purified lysozyme.  We have also previously engineered beta roll peptides to self-assemble and form protein hydrogels upon calcium addition.  The new lysozyme-binding peptide was also introduced into the system, creating a designed protein that would both bind lysozyme and form a hydrogel in the presence of calcium.  This work demonstrates the potential impacts that could be obtained when using conformationally dynamic peptides as starting scaffolds for protein engineering efforts.  A graduate student was funded on this project and she is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, and she plans a career in academia.   Several undergraduate students were exposed to research opportunities during the course of this award.  This work led to three peer-reviewed publications, a PhD dissertation, and many presentations at national meetings and academic departments around the country.
