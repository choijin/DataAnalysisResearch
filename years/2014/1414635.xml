<AbstractNarration>The need to implement cost-effective, preventative measures to slow or reverse the deterioration of civil infrastructure is becoming increasingly important. However, while this need is recognized, it is challenging to efficiently implement infrastructure maintenance plans due to uncertainties inherent to the process. Traditionally, variations in engineering properties are accounted for by overdesigning, which is an inefficient use of money and resources. Use of reliability analysis has allowed for better understanding of how much overdesign is needed, but still results in inefficient designs. The next step in designing for uncertainty is to develop a method for finding a balance between cost and safety. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Hongwei Huang at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, where a multi-million dollar research project on subway tunnel maintenance is being performed.  Information gathered from this research project will be used to validate a tunnel maintenance decision-making model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue of cost-effectively preventing infrastructure deterioration is a problem of rapidly growing importance with a global impact.  The uncertainties associated with the infrastructure maintenance process pose considerable challenges to the planning of maintenance programs for underground urban transportation systems.  To characterize these uncertainties, reliability models have been widely studied for maintenance optimization, but accurate information is necessary for these reliability-based methods to be effective. Noise in the model inputs quickly cause suggested maintenance schemes to become inefficient and costly. Through implementation of a robust optimal maintenance decision method that considers design parameters (easy to control) and noise factors (hard to control) separately, the effect of noise factors can be minimized.  This research will allow the validation of such a model, leading to enhanced decision-making capacity during maintenance planning. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was conducted to investigate the state of practice of subway tunnel maintenance in Shanghai, China and begin the work for implementing robust maintenance practices.  Tongji University was chosen because it is located in Shanghai, China, home to the longest metro system in the world.  The Chinese government is investing tremendous resources to create a robust and state of the art infrastructure system.  This was a remarkable opportunity to learn from the best in the field while gaining access to information and methodologies that are not available in the United States.  The research focused on the implementation of automated tunnel monitoring equipment and development of a general methodology for prescribing optimal placement of sensors within the tunnel network. The framework uses statistical measures of the surrounding soil characteristics to relate sensor spacing to accuracy.  This methodology equips decision makers with a tool that will allow them to determine the trade-off between an efficient use of resources (i.e. how much to spend on automated monitoring equipment) and the required accuracy of sensor measurements.  The results can be used to meet the aforementioned price or performance requirements, or it can be used to prescribe the optimal combination of cost and performance.  Ultimately, this method will help transit authorities confidently make decisions that will save public funds.
