<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: This SusChEM project utilizes nontoxic bismuth as a constituent to broaden and enhance the performance of III-V semiconductor alloys for a replacement of HgCdTe alloys. This work advances the materials science knowledge base of sustainable III-V bismides to enable novel devices needed for present and future engineering grand challenges, such as mid- and long-infrared lasers and detectors for homeland security and pollution detection and efficient infrared lasers and detectors for information and communication technology. Compared to HgCdTe alloys, III-V bismides are sustainable, safer, and more secure without toxic element mercury and the very rare element tellurium. This project integrates innovative and fundamental materials research and education, and brings together researchers and students with broad areas of expertise to study narrow bandgap III-V semiconductors alloyed with bismuth. The research findings guide the design and engineering of III-V bismuth superlattice materials and devices over a wide range of narrow bandgap energies, and could enable the development of devices with exceptional performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This research project alloys bismuth with arsenic in the group-V sublattice to develop III-V materials in the technological important 8-12 micrometer atmospheric transmission window. Specifically, the semi-metallic compound InBi is alloyed with conventional III-V bulk and superlattice materials to create alloys with significant and highly exploitable electrical and optical properties  that outperform and replace HgCdTe. In particular, InAs/InAsBi and GaSb/InAsBi superlattices strain balanced and lattice matched at the GaSb lattice constant, offer the prospect of alloying technologically important 0.61-nm semiconductors with semiconducting InAsBi (Bi mole fractions &lt; 7.3%) and semimetallic InAsBi (Bi mole fractions &gt; 7.3%). These systems allow the growth of arbitrarily thick, coherently strained layers in the readily accessible GaSb lattice constant without misfit dislocations. Furthermore, the heterostructures offer an opportunity to design the topography of the band structure and thus allow  studying quantum phase transitions of surface states using the effective bandgap of the superlattice as a tuning parameter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of new semiconductor materials significantly impacts technology.  This project develops a new class of high-performance optoelectronic materials that cover the technologically important mid and long infrared spectrum.  These materials are highly tunable and can be fabricated on environmentally-friendly and commercially-available gallium antimonide substrates.  Efficient optical emission and detection across the infrared spectrum is desirable for a variety of commercial, medical, academic, and homeland security applications including detectors and emitters for autonomous vehicles, greenhouse gas detection, highly-secure short-range free-space telecommunications, guidance technology, threat-detection systems, and lighter and more sensitive thermographic cameras.   In particular, III-V compound semiconductors containing dilute amounts of the element bismuth are synthetized using molecular beam epitaxy and optimized in terms of material performance and optical quality.  Spectroscopic ellipsometry and temperature and excitation dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements point to well defined absorption cutoffs and efficient luminescence performance.  Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry measurements show excellent structural and crystalline properties.   At comparatively low temperatures (&le; 300 &deg;C) the element bismuth readily incorporates into the host material, however this results in degraded optical performance.  At higher temperatures around 400 &deg;C the fraction of bismuth incorporated is greatly reduced, nevertheless in excess of 2% BI incorporation is achieved and the desired optical quality is demonstrated.  Growth temperatures and elemental fluxes are optimized for best optical performance, paving the way for the employment of these III-V alloys in high performance infrared devices.   The III-V bismuth material system offers a device designer a wide range of degrees of freedom to independently specify biaxial strain, emission wavelength, and electronic band structure alignment.  Software models and design tools are developed to design cross-sections and to predict the emission wavelengths and optical performance of bulk, quantum well, and type-II superlattice structures containing the recently developed materials.  By varying the composition of the constituent elements, the design degrees of freedom are optimized for desired optical properties and material performance.  The material designs are optimized for the strongest spatial overlap of the electrical carriers, thus maximizing optical emission and absorption transition strength.   As the heaviest non-radioactive element, the group-V element bismuth is abundant and relatively non-toxic compared to the heavy elements, mercury, thallium, and lead.  Moreover, bismuth reduces the host material bandgap at a greater rate per unit strain than either arsenic, antimony, or indium, while lifting the valence band edge for tunable and improved electrical carrier confinement in mid and long infrared heterostructures.
