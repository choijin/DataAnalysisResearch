<AbstractNarration>Workshop on Research Directions for Cyber Physical Systems Related to Future Energy and Power Grids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning and development of the future grid requires additional research, particularly research that can be used within the next 5-10 years. Many organizations such as NSF, DOE, EPRI, ARPA-E, and NIST have focused on different aspects of the research ranging from a short-term, two to three year horizon, to a long term, strategic, 20-30 year horizon. Many workshops, symposia, and conferences have supported the exchange of research and development results. However, the research efforts are not currently well coordinated for the time horizon of 5-10 years where tangible and innovative commercial solutions could be deployed.  This proposed workshop will focus on this 5-10 year time horizon with a goal of bringing together national industry and research community leaders, as well as the executives from the end-user and manufacturing industry, to discuss and coordinate a research strategy and related action plan to meet industry needs for new solutions in response to the new developments affecting the grid.&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives are to actively involve major players from various industry sectors, government organizations, and universities to create a common understanding of and map out the appropriate directions in research priorities and associated activities. An important initial step will be to convene a broad and representative assembly of the stakeholders to initiate this effort, which this workshop will accomplish. Spacific activities include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Invite a key industry figure to open the workshop, outline the motivation, and set the discussion stage for how the goals and objectives may be achieved over the horizon of interest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Invite CEOs of major utilities and manufacturing industries to state their requirements and expectations regarding research needs and technology deployment over the next 5-10 years&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Involve CTOs and CIOs of major companies seeking their views on what advancements in the control, communication, and information infrastructure are needed over the 5-10 year horizon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Attract top managers at NSF, DOE, EPRI, ARPA-E and NIST, other appropriate agencies to articulate their plans for the 5-10 year horizon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Assure participation of recognized experts from academia and research organizations who can add to the discussions or answer questions as needed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Formulate a prioritized and achievable list of expected research accomplishments over the 5-10 year period with measurable improvements for the energy cyber-physical system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Formulate an action plan to secure adequate funding to achieve the targeted goals, laying the foundation for a new collaborative funding opportunity for industry-university partnerships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was related to organization of a workshop on research directions for cyber physical systems related to future energy and power grids held in Arlington May 4-5, 2015. This workshop was a joint effort among several key research organizations: NSF, DOE, EPRI, ARPA-E and NIST. Details of the overall collaborative arrangement and results from the Workshop discussions are provided in the Workshop Final Report.   Intellectual Merit:   The planning and development of the future grid requires additional research, particularly research that can be used within the next 5-10 years. Many organizations such as NSF, DOE, EPRI, ARPA-E, and NIST have focused on different aspects of the research ranging from a short-term, two to three year horizon, to a long term, strategic, 20-30 year horizon. Many workshops, symposia, and conferences have supported the discussions of the research roadmaps, as well as exchange of research and development results. However, the research efforts are not currently well coordinated for the time horizon of 5-10 years where tangible and innovative commercial solutions could be deployed.  This workshop focused on this 5-10 year time horizon by bringing together national industry and research community leaders, as well as the executives from the end-user and manufacturing industry, to discuss and coordinate a research strategy and related action plan to meet industry needs for new solutions in response to the new developments affecting the grid. Faculty from academia have also attended and added their prospective and learned what the industry needs and expectations are.                                         After an extensive discussion, the Workshop participants identified the following research topics that should be addressed in the near future (5-10 year time horizon):   Characterize uncertainty and develop analytical tools that incorporate uncertainty for operations and planning decision-making in the presence of renewable resources   Develop better short term forecast methods to enable more effective scheduling of variable generation Incorporate PMU and other synchronized real-time measurements in control algorithms for enhanced grid operation Determine the impact of reduced inertia on system dynamic performance and develop methods to mitigate detrimental impacts of low inertia Develop techniques for high-resolution identification of load composition to facilitate effective demand side management. Create real-time scalable and reconfigurable test beds based on multiple hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) technologies Create simulation and testing tools for architecture and device large-scale testing Develop resiliency models and metrics with multiple weighted indicators based on electrical, economic, and social factors for rate of return assessment of resilience improvements, for investment analysis, or for establishing incentives for adoption of resiliency measures. Increase resiliency of the grid through smart control and smart protection, centralized data, large dynamic data sets, model validation and operations, "no regrets" and best transmission system configurations Study how should we reconfigure the electric power grid to rely more on microgrids; redefine the technical interface between transmission and distribution systems to coordinate both systems and integrate distributed energy resources efficiently; design the architecture for integrated T&amp;D operation.    Broader Impacts:   To ensure the success of the development for the next generation grid in meeting needs and expectations, federal, state, and local governments expanded their roles in grid expansion through various public-private partnerships, such as the funding through the American Reinvestments and Recovery Act of 2009, creation of an organization for promotion of Interoperability (Smart Grid Interoperability Panel-SGIP), endorsement of the Green Button Initiative, community energy storage, and many other initiatives.
