<AbstractNarration>The anthropogenic elevation of atmospheric CO2 is causing the oceans to become more acidic, which may make it more challenging for corals to build their skeletons and, ultimately, entire reef structures.  How corals respond to future ocean acidification will largely depend on how the pH of the internal fluid from which they produce their skeletons-their so-called calcifying fluid-is impacted by the surrounding seawater. It is therefore essential that current methods are refined to accurately measure the pH of corals' calcifying fluids in order to understand and, ideally, predict their responses to CO2-induced ocean acidification. In this project, a three-pronged approach to measure calcifying fluid pH within three species of reef-forming corals will be used to assess how their calcifying fluid pH responds to experimentally induced ocean acidification. This research will improve our understanding of corals' responses to ocean acidification and thus has the potential to inform the decisions of policy makers and legislators seeking to mitigate the deleterious effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on marine ecosystems. The work will support the development of three early career scientists, a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students, and undergraduate researcher assistants-several of whom are from underrepresented groups in the earth and ocean sciences. Results will be widely disseminated through publications, conference presentations, the PIs' websites, an educational film, coursework, and outreach activities at area schools, museums, and science centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corals and other types of marine calcifiers are thought to begin the mineralization of their calcium carbonate skeletons by actively elevating pH of their calcifying fluid, thereby converting bicarbonate ions (comprising ~90% of seawater dissolved inorganic carbon) to carbonate ions, the form of carbon used in calcification.  This project will compare the combined boron isotope, pH microelectrode, and pH-sensitive dye approach to measure the calcifying fluid pH of three species of scleractinian corals, and to assess how their calcifying fluid pH (a primary factor controlling their calcification) responds to experimentally induced ocean acidification. As a result this multi-pronged approach to measuring calcifying fluid pH of the same coral species under equivalent culturing conditions will permit the first systematic cross-examination of the validity of these independent approaches. The combined approach will also yield values of calcifying fluid pH with uncertainties that can be quantified via inter-comparison and statistical treatment of these independent measurements.  Importantly, this multi-pronged approach will be used on three coral species that due to differences in the carbonate chemistry of their native waters possess differing capacities for proton regulation at their site of calcification; a deep, cold-water coral (strong proton-pumper); a shallow, temperate coral (moderate proton-pumper); and a shallow, tropical coral (weak proton-pumper). Target outcomes of this research include (1) cross-examination of the validity of three independent approaches to estimating coral calcifying fluid pH, (2) quantification of uncertainty associated with the three approaches to estimating coral calcifying fluid pH, (3) advancement of our mechanistic understanding of coral calcification, (4) exploration of the mechanism by which ocean acidification impacts coral calcification, (5) elucidation why corals exhibit such varied responses to ocean acidification, (6) identification of coral types most vulnerable to ocean acidification, (7) exploration of so-called "vital effects" that limit the use of corals in paleoceanographic reconstructions, and (8) quantitative constraint of existing models of coral biomineralization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project objective: The objective of the funded project was to employ a multipronged, comparative approach to measuring pH of the coral calcifying fluid (pH microelectrodes, boron isotopes) under normal and acidified seawater conditions. Funding from this award supported a wide range of experimental and field-based research projects in pursuit of this and related objectives, which are summarized below.     (1) Conducted controlled laboratory experiments investigating the impact of ocean acidification (OA) and warming on net calcification rates of 4 species of scleractinian corals (3 tropical, 1 cold-water), showing that warming exacerbates the negative impacts of OA by reducing the symbionts whose photosynthesis would otherwise be enhanced under the high-CO2 conditions associated with OA.     (2) Investigated changes in the carbonate chemistry of the calcifying fluid of 3 coral species in response to CO2-induced OA using boron isotopes and pH-sensitive microelectrodes, showing that corals maintain their calcifying fluids at elevated pH relative to external seawater (~8.5 - 9.5 vs. seawater pH of 8), thereby converting dissolved carbon within this fluid into CO32- for calcification.     (3) Investigated the impact of OA and warming on gene expression of the coral Siderastrea siderea, showing that coral exposure to extreme thermal stress elicits a more adverse transcriptomic response than exposure to extreme OA.     (4) Investigated the impact of warming and CO2-induced OA on the dissolution kinetics of dead shell material produced by corals and other reef-dwelling marine calcifiers, showing that dissolution rates of biogenic carbonates vary systematically with inorganic mineral solubility, that dissolution rates increase with temperature, and that all biogenic carbonates exhibit baseline dissolution even in highly oversaturated seawater.     (5) Investigated the impact of CO2-induced OA on calcification and boron isotopic composition of 3 coccolithophore species, showing that coccolithophores respond to OA by changing their carbon source for photosynthesis.     (6) Performed a forereef-backreef-nearshore reciprocal coral transplant experiment on the Meso-American Barrier Reef System (MBRS) to isolate the effects of reef-zone-specific genotypes on the response of S. siderea to warming.     (7) Calibrated the relationship between CO2-induced OA and clumped isotope composition (&Delta;47CO2) of 5 bivalve and 1 coral species, showing that seawater pH can influence shell &Delta;47CO2 and that this should be accounted for in &Delta;47CO2-based reconstructions of paleo-seawater temperature for these species.     (8) Investigated the impact of OA and warming on the &delta;18O composition of an urchin (Echinometra viridis), showing that &delta;18O was negatively correlated with seawater temperature and suggesting that fossil echinoid &delta;18O is a potential archive of past oceanic temperatures.      (9) Performed multi-elemental, &delta;18O, and &delta;13C measurements of S. siderea cores obtained from the MBRS and S. siderea specimens reared under 25, 28, and 32 &deg;C to explore the use of multi-elemental- and &delta;18O-paleothermometry for the S. siderea species.     (10) CT-scanned S. siderea coral cores to identify annual growth bands and reconstruct annual growth histories, showing that growth histories over the past century vary by reef zone and latitude.     (11) Developed novel microphotographic techniques for quantifying the impact of OA and warming on the corallite morphology of corals, showing that both OA and warming impair rate of coral growth, only OA affects corallite structure.     (12) Analyzed the &delta;11B of a range of calcifying marine organisms cultured under a range of pCO2 conditions as a proxy of calcifying fluid pH, showing that a diverse range of marine calcifiers precipitate their CaCO3 from a discrete calcifying medium with a pH that is greater than external seawater pH and that elevation of calcifying fluid pH is a polyphyletic response to OA.     (13) Analyzed the &delta;11B and &delta;13C composition of annually resolved coral cores from the MBRS as a proxy for past OA, showing that the evolution of the carbonate system on coral reefs over the last ca. 100 years was not controlled solely by anthropogenic CO2.     (14) Investigated the impact of seawater temperature on the lithium isotopic composition (&delta;7Li) of various species of marine calcifiers, showing that &delta;7Li within brachiopods is the best proxy of seawater temperature, while &delta;7Li within calcitic mollusks is the worst.     (15) Applied the empirically derived multi-elemental proxy of seawater temperature to cores of S. siderea to reconstruct MBRS water temperatures, showing that there are hot-spots and cool-spots to thermal trends, with the latter serving as potential thermal refugia for corals and other thermally sensitive reef species.     The project supported the training of 11 undergraduate researchers, 3 Ph.D. students, 2 Master’s students, 2 research technicians, and 4 postdoctoral researchers. Research results have been disseminated through more than 8 invited presentations at universities, 14 invited presentations at other private or public institutions, more than 31 conference presentations.
