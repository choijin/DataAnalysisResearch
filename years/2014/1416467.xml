<AbstractNarration>The broader impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in two main application areas: infrared cameras and telecommunications components.  Tunable infrared lenses will enable highly capable miniaturized infrared cameras, resulting in improved systems for security, automatic navigation, and safety.  In communications, tunable infrared lenses will reduce component costs by eliminating active alignment requirements, and can enable new functionality in configurable optical design.  There are impacts, too, in scientific research, which will benefit from the availability of a continuously variable infrared lens for use in optical experimentation.  Finally, there will be substantial economic and employment benefits stemming from successful commercialization of this technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a new type of device for infrared optics and photonics: tunable lenses with focusing and beam-steering properties that can be adjusted without the use of mechanical parts.  The devices are compact, low-power, robust, and inexpensive; they promise to enable a broad array of new applications in infrared imaging and communications.  The tunable lenses contain two immiscible liquids with different refractive indices, and the curved interface between the two liquids forms a lensing surface.  The liquid interface can be altered by an applied electric field to change the focusing properties of the lens or to tilt it in order to steer light in a desired direction.  The project will develop electrowetting optics with a new set of materials optimized for use in the short-wave infrared band between 0.9 and 1.7 microns, which is used for night vision, sensing, and telecommunications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research work performed during this Phase I project led to the achievement of unique new tunable optical devices for use with infrared light.  Two types of devices were built, both using movable fluids to provide adjustment of the optical properties.     The first devices built are adjustable lenses with focusing properties that can be tuned by an applied voltage.  These lenses exhibit excellent optical quality, a large clear aperture, and a broad focal tuning range.  Indeed, the performance of the prototype lenses exceeded the program targets in each of the defined metrics.  The lenses contain two immiscible liquids with different refractive indices.  The curved interface between the two liquids forms a lensing surface that can be altered by an applied electric field.  This innovation builds upon an established technology of tunable liquid lenses for use at visible wavelengths.  Using new designs and materials, we extend this operability for the first time to the short-wave infrared band between 0.9 and 1.7 microns.  The tunable lenses are extremely compact and require no mechanical movement.  They have potential use in short-wavelength infrared imaging, as well as in components and systems for telecommunications.  Tunable infrared lenses can enable highly capable miniaturized infrared cameras, resulting in improved systems for security, automatic navigation, and safety.     Further work during Phase I pioneered fluidic shutters for use in blocking or transmitting infrared light.  Prototype devices demonstrate the ability to shutter an aperture at will, and judicious choice of materials enables operation over a very wide range of wavelengths.   Among other applications, these devices have potential use in reducing the cost of infrared cameras and improving their performance.
