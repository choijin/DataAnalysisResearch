<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program is supporting fundamental research of Professor Paulo Almeida at the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) to address the organization of biological membranes from the point of view of the physical chemistry of interactions in the lipid bilayer. Professor Almeida will employ a combination of computer simulations, calorimetry, and fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the nature and the strength of those interactions. Professor Almeida will further integrate the research and educational components of this project within a new program designed to improve the quantitative skills of undergraduate students in the STEM fields, especially chemistry, while fostering the connections between biological and physical sciences, as a means of bridging the communication gap between these disciplines. UNCW is a primarily undergraduate institution, where participation of undergraduate students in research is a high priority. What is distinctive in this project for undergraduate education is that it combines a fundamental problem of active research in biophysical chemistry with extensive use of quantitative methods. Undergraduates will be involved early on in their studies, emphasizing learning by doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lipid bilayers composed of sphingomyelin, unsaturated phospholipids, and cholesterol are the simplest model for the lipid component of the outer leaflet of eukaryotic plasma membranes. The interactions of cholesterol with the other lipids are of particular importance,and they remain poorly understood. Membranes of saturated phospholipids and cholesterol have been described as mixtures of  liquid ordered and liquid disordered phases. However, no phase separation has been observed in binary mixtures.  Alternatively, ordered phospholipids and cholesterol have been proposed to form a "condensed complex." The liquid ordered phase would then consist of these complexes. This research seeks to explore an alternative in which the liquid ordered phase is a thermodynamic state of the phospholipid, which is well populated in the presence of cholesterol but rare in its absence. The project is designed to test these competing hypotheses through computer simulations and experimental studies, and to determine the magnitudes of the interactions in lipid mixtures that increasingly mimic the composition of biological membranes.</AbstractNarration>

The lipid bilayer forms the matrix of the membranes that enclose all biological cells. Lipid bilayers of sphingomyelin, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and cholesterol are the simplest model for the lipid component of the outer monolayer of eukaryotic cell plasma membranes. Bilayers of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol have been described as mixtures of a liquid ordered and a liquid disordered phase, depending on the conformational order of the lipid chains. However, no phase separation was ever actually observed in DPPC/cholesterol. Alternatively, ordered phospholipids and cholesterol were proposed to form a "condensed complex." The liquid ordered phase would then consist of these complexes. Almeida proposed an alternative view in 2011: that the liquid-ordered is a thermodynamic state of the phospholipid, which becomes well populated in the presence of cholesterol. This project had two main objectives. First, to rigorously test the two competing hypotheses: the condensed complex and the liquid-ordered thermodynamic state model. A multidisciplinary approach was be used, combining computer simulations, calorimetry, fluorescence energy transfer (FRET), and direct determination of interactions (by nearest neighbor recognition). Second,  to determine the magnitudes of the interaction energies between lipids in these membranes and to use those interactions in computer simulations to understand the behavior of these membranes, particularly in regard to the lateral organization of the lipids in the membrane, specifically examining the possibility of lipid separation in different domains or phases. The nature of lipid-lipid interactions in phospholipid/cholesterol membranes is a basic science question, essential to understand the function of eukaryotic cell membranes. Of primary importance is the interaction of cholesterol with ordered phospholipids. However, the fundamental nature of this interaction ternary mixtures of an ordered lipid (DPPC or sphingomyelin), a disordered lipid (POPC) and cholesterol is not known. Here, we used interaction energies derived from experiment in computer simulations of the lipid organization in membranes composed of these three types of lipids. The main outcomes of this investigation are that both models, based either on the liquid-ordered state hypothesis or on the condensed complex hypothesis, are able to account for the experimental calorimetry data with similar success. However, the complex model yields much better agreement with experiments (FRET) that measure the extent of domain formation (phase separation) in the membrane.</p> <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">One of the main goals of this project was the training of undergraduate students in quantitative scientific approaches.
