<AbstractNarration>This project studies two different problems in decision making under uncertainty. The first deals with the resolution of uncertainty over time. The choices that individuals make reflect not only their concern for the uncertain ultimate outcome but also their interest in how this uncertainty will resolve over time. We develop a new model of preference for temporal resolution of uncertainty that is simpler than existing models, closer to many standard dynamic models of economics and finance and, therefore, requires less data on individuals' beliefs about the future. Our second projects deals with ambiguity; that is, situations in which individuals find it difficult to quantify the uncertainty they are confronting. We propose a framework in which decision makers distinguish between unambiguous and ambiguous events and use the former to calibrate the latter. Thus, each unambiguous event, A, is calibrated by two events, the least likely unambiguous event more likely than A and the most likely unambiguous event less likely than A. Our goal is to develop a subjective (i.e., preference-based) theory of uncertainty that permits ambiguity perception and yet is amenable to suitably modified versions of probability theory and statistics. Models of temporal resolution of uncertainty and models of ambiguity both have many applications in macroeconomics and finance.  Both of these lines of inquiry are limited by difficulties in developing and testing models.  Our simpler models should facilitate these applications and make it easier to identify their parameters and find the relevant empirical evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our model of temporal resolution of uncertainty differs from the Kreps and Porteus' model by allowing for preference for early resolution without requiring sensitivity to higher order information that does not affect fundamentals; it is analogous to standard dynamic models of choice without preference for timing of resolution. In such models, the decision maker derives utility each period from her possibly random consumption in that period. In our model, the decision maker derives utility only from her beliefs about what she will ultimately consume, not from her beliefs about how her beliefs will evolve. This part of the research has the following goals: (i) provide an axiomatic foundation of risk consumption preferences. (ii) Develop and analyze appropriate measures of preference for early/late resolution of uncertainty. (iii) Investigate the implications of risk consumption preferences in various applications. Our model of calibrated ambiguity offers a new notion ambiguity perception (which we call qualitative uncertainty relations).  Our main result establishes an inner probability representation for qualitative uncertainty analogous to the Dempster-Shafer theory.  To be able to distinguish ambiguity perception from ambiguity attitude, we allow the qualitative uncertainty relation to be incomplete. This incompleteness reflects the fact that when there is ambiguity, a decision maker's perception of ambiguity by itself, is not sufficient to determine her ranking of bets. The goal of this research is to provide a representation theorem for qualitative uncertainty relations and use it to study updating, inference and the relationships among existing models of ambiguity and evidence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposal consists of two separate research projects on decision making under uncertainty.  The first develops a framework for describing and quantifying the perceptions of decision makers who perceive both risk and ambiguity.  The second project studies the preferences and behavior of decision makers who expect to get more information regarding the risky project that they are holding.  Consider a decision maker with the following beliefs: she believes that party A is just as likely to win the next election as party B; that is, forced to bet on the outcome of the election, she would be indifferent between betting on party A and betting on party B.  Similarly, assume that the same decision maker is indifferent between betting on heads or betting on tails in an upcoming coin toss.  Finally, assume that she would rather bet on heads (or tails) than on either outcome of the election.  Such a person?s perception of uncertainty cannot be described with probabilities. If there were probabilities corresponding to her betting preferences, the probability of A winning the election would have to be 1/2; and the probability of B winning the election would have to be 1/2 because these two are complementary events. Similarly, the probability of heads and the probability of tails would both have to be 1/2.  Hence, the decision maker would have to be indifferent among all of the four bets.  The decision maker might perceive more ambiguity when betting on the outcome of an election than when betting on a fair coin.  In the first project, we provide a new generalization of the notion of probability that is consistent with the preferences described above. We call this notion an uncertainty measure and show how an uncertainty measure can be extended into a general class of preferences over arbitrary uncertain prospects.  Models of ambiguity have been used recently to analyze financial markets and macroeconomics problems.  Our approach facilitates a richer class of models and enables the separation of decision makers' perception of ambiguity and attitude towards ambiguity.  In the second project, we consider a decision maker who holds a risky position, for example her retirement account or a valuable asset. For simplicity consider a situation in which the decision maker will not be selling or adding to the risky asset until the terminal date.  Our main hypothesis is that even if we hold the ultimate distribution of outcomes fixed, the decision maker might have a preference over how the uncertainty resolves over time.  We develop a theory of preference for information (or equivalently preference for temporal resolution of uncertainty) that is consistent with various nuanced attitudes observed in recent empirical and experimental studies. One such example is called the ostrich effect; the observation that investors are more likely to check how their portfolios are doing after observing an increase in its value of their portfolios than after a recent drop in the value of the their portfolios.  A typical decision maker of the sort considered in economic models would have no value for information other than its instrumental value.  That is, if there are no relevant decisions to be made such as selling off some of the assets, information would not have value and the decision maker would be indifferent as to how uncertainty is resolved. Even models that incorporate preference for early or late resolution of uncertainty are not consistent with preferences that depend on the recent experience of the decision maker and hence they are inconsistent with the ostrich effect.  Our model enables researchers to incorporate such attitudes into the analysis of dynamic economic agents.  The first paper is coauthored by the two principal investigators. The second paper is coauthored by the two principal investigators and Paulo Natenzon of the University of Washington in St. Louis.
