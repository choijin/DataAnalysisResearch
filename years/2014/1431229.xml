<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation improvement grant will support the investigator, a PhD candidate, for one semester of research at the Rotman Institute of Philosophy at the University of Western Ontario. At the Institute, the researcher will work with two specialists in his area of specialty, the foundations of quantum physics. He will work with these experts to develop an ontological framework for characterizing quantum information as a foundational approach to quantum mechanics. His mentor advocates a principle-based approach to quantum information, which leaves open the question of the underlying ontology. The researcher will show that the principle approach is incomplete, and that it does not mesh well with the ways in which theorists use quantum information-theoretic principles in some contexts of active research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's interdisciplinary impact will be disseminated not just within the philosophical community, but also to physicists working in related fields. It will have an impact on the researcher's teaching both inside and outside of the classroom. He plans to design an upper-level undergraduate course in the foundations of quantum theory, which could be cross-listed in philosophy and physics departments. In addition, he plans to engage in scientific community outreach through general audience lectures, and Rotman sponsored blog posts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this research project is to attempt to clarify the relationship between quantum information&mdash;an interesting and fruitful research program&mdash;and the foundational problems at the heart of quantum theory that philosophers take seriously. While quantum information science has made incredible breakthroughs in demonstrating the power and usefulness of quantum systems, what it says about how to understand the structure of reality is much less clear. This project aims to clear some of the conceptual space in that debate in order that we might better understand the degree to which we able to use the impressive power of the quantum information approach to understand our world.  Quantum theory, although it is the most predictively successful physical theory ever, is open to many interpretations, or ways of understanding what it tells us is true about the world. Our picture of reality, at the most fundamental level, is intimately connected to our interpretation of quantum theory. This research attempts to establish that there are limitations to the ability of quantum information to address these interpretational issues of quantum theory. In particular the "measurement problem" cannot adequately be addressed by the resources of quantum information.   It is argued that the measurement problem, when properly understood, is a problem about the underlying ontology of the world, of which fundamental physical theories are descriptions. Several proposals about how to understand the properties of the fundamental "stuff" of the world, that constitutes all matter, have been made. Each of these interpretations of quantum theory solve the measurement problem effectively. However, an interpretation based on quantum information theory denies the fundamentality of the underlying ontology, and conceives of quantum theory as being about constraints on information states. In this way, it is argued, a quantum information-theoretic interpretation cannot solve the measurement problem.  The broader impacts of the research are that, by drawing attention to some of the philosophical challenges scientists face, it can help provide those outside the academy with a better understanding of how scientific reasoning works, which can provide a broader sense of ownership of scientific discourse.
