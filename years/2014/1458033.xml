<AbstractNarration>The state of Nevada, located in the core of the Great Basin, contains a unique flora and fauna, but is also a region under threat by invasive species, water diversions, and other land-use practices. A host of taxa and entire communities are endangered and in decline. The Great Basin, which is high in fish endemism, has experienced 12 fish extinctions in the past 100 years, more than any other region in North America. Eight of these have occurred in Nevada, with seven extinctions endemic to Nevada alone. Almost a third of the remaining ichthyofauna is federally listed. Given the dramatic changes in the region, and those yet to come, museum collections play a significant role in supporting organismal science, providing baseline information about regional biodiversity and chronicling biotic change over decades.  The fluid collections at University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) are a pivotal resource, ranking among the most extensive holdings of Nevada material and containing irreplaceable specimens of extinct, extirpated, and endangered taxa. Through the opening of public exhibit space, the new Natural History Museum is playing a unique role in biodiversity education in Nevada. Undergraduates, graduates, and alumni are engaged in all aspects of the museum, including hosting K-12 visits and the creation of public displays and outreach content, developed with an eye towards meeting the state's soon-to-be-adopted Next Generation Science Standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UNR has recently consolidated the majority of its natural history collections, formerly housed in widely disparate, off-campus locations, into a single, newly-renovated space on-campus.  This award supports integration of fluid collections into this resource, making ca. 28,100 herpetological and fish specimens (including extinct and endangered taxa) accessible for researchers and managers. In addition to moving material to a central, on-campus location, specimens will be transferred to new, more appropriate containers, fully catalogued, digitized, and georeferenced for publication through online database portals. Securing, preserving, and ensuring access to these collections will allow research and management communities the ability to reconstruct the evolutionary and ecological history of the Great Basin. Impacts of this project include both scientific and societal benefits, including expansion of an already successful K-12 outreach program, and establishment of a consolidated web presence for both fluid collections and natural history museum. All data resulting from this project will be posted online (http://arctos.database.museum) and shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and educators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the land-grant institution in our state, the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) serves an important function, educating our students and the public about the natural resources and biological diversity in Nevada. To further this goal, UNR created an on-campus, natural history museum in 2013 to meet teaching and research needs in the life sciences, as well as serve the public interest in science education in Northern Nevada.  This new museum successfully consolidated formerly dispersed plant, insect, and dry vertebrate collections (mammals, birds, eggs, nests) in one space, built an adjoining teaching lab for undergraduate courses and visiting K-12 groups, and created exhibits in a display space dedicated to public engagement and outreach.  However, the museum lacked adequate space for housing irreplaceable liquid vertebrate collections (fish, amphibians, and reptiles), which were held in an off-site facility outside of town, and that were at risk of loss because they were stored in old and inappropriate jars and crocks with unknown liquids.  In addition, the museum also lacked a web presence for both research and public outreach, and our ability to host visiting school groups was at capacity.  Thus, the purpose of this NSF award was to: 1) rescue liquid collections and move them on-campus; 2) create a functional website and place vertebrate collections online; and 3) expand public outreach activities.  In the span of this award (2015-2017) we have accomplished all of these major objectives.  In addition, we have used this award to leverage additional institutional support and gifts from donors.  We completed a full inventory and catalogue of our vertebrate collections; we fully digitized these collections (i.e. we put them into an electronic database); we have published most of the vertebrate collections online so that researchers from around the world can access the specimen records.  We also secured the liquid collections by transferring the entire reptile and amphibian collection and fish collection into new, appropriate jars with fitted lids and new labels, and into fresh ethanol (the museum storage benchmark).  We then worked with our institution to renovate two new spaces on-campus to house the liquid collections, one for the reptiles and amphibians, and another for the fish; we moved these collections to campus.  We also used this award to fund the creation of a fully functional website that leads students and researchers to the appropriate faculty, staff, and museum collections, and that leads K-12 teachers to an outreach page where they can use an online calendar and scheduling software to book a visit to the museum.  Finally, we a used this award to expand our outreach capacity.  We funded a STEM outreach coordinator who oversaw graduate and undergraduate students, who then provided science education modules to visiting K-12 groups.  We created 10 distinct outreach modules that make use of our museum collections and our public displays, and that follow next generation science standards to cover specific core ideas (tailored to specific grade levels).  We also used this award to create new public displays that include live animals.  These displays are especially engaging and captivating, and are used in our outreach modules to discuss conservation principles and scientific ideas, and to highlight the biodiversity and natural heritage of Nevada.  During the course of this award, we hosted hundreds of visiting groups, totaling nearly 6,000 students (many from rural areas or disadvantaged backgrounds).  Beyond these goals, this award was important in providing training to our undergraduate and graduate students in public outreach and education, as well as in museum practices.  Dozens of our undergraduate and graduate students (mostly women) conducted public outreach through museum events and our K-12 outreach modules.  These experiences are especially meaningful in connecting local children to young scholars, demystifying the university experience, and personalizing science. Currently, our museum is thriving, and we have leveraged the resources provided through this award to continue our outreach program, and the collections improvement grant ensures that our irreplaceable specimens of our local wildlife and plants will continue to be available for enjoyment and education in Nevada for generations to come.
