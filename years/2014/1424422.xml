<AbstractNarration>Tax rebellions do not occur in a social vacuum.  Taxation offers a blueprint, in symbolic and concrete terms, for uncovering the fundamental structures of social, economic, and political life. This research will further understandings of how the legacies of past social hierarchies contribute to contemporary tax debates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing ethnographic content analysis of archival data collected from historical societies and libraries, this project examines three case studies of rebellions against property taxes.  Particular attention is placed on the relationship between changing social structures and property tax revolts in the United States.  Primary data will be collected from a wide variety of documentary and media sources and analyzed with qualitative analytic computer software to test the central tenets of relevant theories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scholars cannot explain what provokes tax rebellions, why specific tax reforms are demanded, and how only some taxes inflame animosity (Martin 2008). Yet when minorities have historically gained access to public services, backlash against property taxes soon follows. Why are property taxes hated so much? Though the analysis remains ongoing, "American Property Taxes and Changing Social Structures" shows how racial conflict holds some answers.  Utilizing a historically-comparative research design, the study is predominantly anchored in two of the most formative property tax rebellions in the United States&mdash;a tax commonly labeled "the worst tax in the civilized world" (Seligman 1895:61). One rebellion regards the collective action leading to the enactment of the Alabama Constitution of 1875. The other regards the collective action leading to the passage of CaliforniaÆs PeopleÆs Initiative to Limit Property Taxation in 1978, otherwise known as Proposition 13 or the "Jarvis-Gann Amendment." More specifically, an ethnographic content analysis (Altheide 1987; Altheide and Schneider [1996] 2013) is performed on over 10,000 primary and secondary texts from various archival sources that document these tax rebellions.  Completing the analysis permits the study to uncover the mechanics for how racial ideology changes (and does not change) in patterned and resilient ways over time, as well as how it shapes policy formation within the realm of the fiscal state. At their most basic level taxes carry, in the words of Joseph Schumpeter ([1918] 1991), "the thunder of history" (p. 101).

Unbeknown to numerous students of law and society, fiscal sociology, and racial structure is the role race plays in shaping discourses (and practices) of property taxes throughout American history. Engaging in what Diane Vaughan (1992) labels theory elaboration, "American Property Taxes and Changing Social Structures" begins with a highly macro-oriented racialized social system outlined by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva (1997), grounds it in the substantive area taxation, empirically scrutinizes its conceptual components, and both confirms and complicates its application by transitioning focus from the general to the specific.  Whereas Bonilla-Silva's (1997) framework conceptually "fits" many empirical observations of the project, it is revised and expanded for repeated "negative cases" in which the theory does not apply.

Such a point complicates common narratives among the social science literature that advances the idea of ideological displacement, whereby one stream of ideas in the contemporary era substitutes for another stream of the past.
