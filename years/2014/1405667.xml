<AbstractNarration>Decision makers ranging from operators to policymakers need accurate, representative, intuitive, and repeatable measurements of Internet connectivity. Policymakers rely on data about Internet speeds to inform regulation and investment decisions. Human rights activists monitor the state of Internet reachability from a wide range of countries and Internet service providers and report broadly on those findings. Application providers, Internet service providers, and network operators all need to know the performance that a user is experiencing to allow them to better tune their services. These decision makers require an infrastructure that can measure Internet connectivity from the perspectives of typical users. Towards this goal, this project will develop an infrastructure to gather reliable, repeatable measurements from vantage points that reflect the connectivity experienced by home Internet users.  In addition to yielding valuable data about characteristics of Internet connectivity, the infrastructure will also serve as a platform for researchers to perform repeatable experiments and gather data on the Internet as seen from the home.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By developing software that will run on commercially available home gateway routers and which will allow researchers to securely dynamicly load sandboxed applications, this project will develop an open network measurement observatory for researchers, operators, and policymakers.  The project will combine elements of the BISMark and Wireless@Home measurement projects with the Seattle testbed in order to provide researchers with the ability to install sandboxed measurement applications on the home gateway.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project has been to develop, deploy, and maintain an "observatory" for the Internet?s last mile that allows researchers, operators, activists, and policymakers to perform measurements and gather data about network availability, reachability, topology, security, and performance. A cornerstone of this infrastructure are of programmable measurement devices, deployed globally on Internet access links. This infrastructure will allow researchers to ask targeted questions such as "What is the user experience for my application for the top three service providers in the US market?" and "What are network latencies on inter-continental links to Africa?" The UW-Madison team built a part of this infrastructure, specifically focused on the wireless performance and experience. For example, the team developed analytics toolkits that allows an Internet Service Provider to better understand what causes performance issues within a home environment. A particular focus was on wireless interference from diverse sources, e.g., garage door openers, electronic toys, and even microwave ovens. Different software components were developed and released through the open-source path for public use. The systems developed were also deployed in Madison, Wisconsin so that their efficacy could be studied at some scale. Deployments in different settings illustrated the benefits of these tools in understanding performance issues faced in these environments. The technologies developed were also incoprorated into educational materials in graduate and undergraduate courses at UW-Madison.
