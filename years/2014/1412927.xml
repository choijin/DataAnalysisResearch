<AbstractNarration>Populations of bacteria or viruses exhibit strong adaptivity through emergence and fixation of beneficial mutations. For instance, such mutations can be related to bacterial resistance to antibiotics or emergence of viral strains transferable from animal to humans.  Currently, there exist various mathematical models which describe the evolution of bacterial or viral populations, but mathematical tools which can be used to study evolutionary trajectories of large bacterial or viral populations are still lacking. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to develop proper mathematical tools for studying rare mutational events in bacteria or viruses. In particular, the investigators will use the large deviation approach for population trajectories to develop theoretical foundation and practical computational tools to study the evolutionary trajectories of bacterial populations with concrete applications to the analysis of long term laboratory experiments on Escherichia Coli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large deviations technique will be developed in a novel context of discrete models for population histograms. In contrast with the classical Wentzell-Freidlin approach for "small" diffusions, there is no general derivation of cost functions for discrete Markov chains with continuous state space, so that concrete analytical and numerical results for discrete models are rather scarce. However, large deviations offer significant computational advantages in the context of evolutionary dynamics described here due to the special structure of this problem.  In particular, the cost function for evolutionary trajectories will be derived in an explicit form. This will lead to the development of a novel discretized difference equation for cost minimizing trajectories, thus enabling an efficient numerical "geodesic shooting" in reverse time to compute the most likely population evolution between given initial and terminal states.  This novel algorithm will be used to estimate (very small) probabilities of rare genetic events such as the transitions between two successive genotype fixations and to compute the most likely sequence of genotype fixations leading from an ancestor genotype to a currently dominant genotype. Moreover, the numerical codes developed in the course of the proposed research will be used to study various epistasis scenarios. Thus, this work will generate innovative computational and conceptual tools leading to a better understanding of genetic evolution of bacterial or viral populations.</AbstractNarration>

Predictive studies of these evolutions have strong potential impact on questions such as bacterial resistance to antibiotics or emergence of viral strains transferable from animal to humans. But existing stochastic dynamic models for these populations still lack applicable algorithmic tools to quantify genetic evolution trajectories in the fitness landscape : currently published analyses tend to rely on intensive simulations, which are not efficient to evaluate key rare events such as specific chains of beneficial genotype fixations.  In this work we developed mathematical foundation to analyze radical shifts in bacterial populations. I our work we relied on the Large Deviations Formalism. In particular, we carried out the following asks - 1. Several important theoretical advances in the rare-event approach have been made. Large deviation formulas have been derived explicitly in path space.2. Fast computational schemes have been implemented using OpenMP. This has enabled the computation of most-likely paths for relatively high-dimensional problems.3. We developed a practical link between our stochastic Markov chain models and actual experimental data via a fast algorithm for parameter estimation.  The most significant outcome of this project is that we were able to develop a large-deviations approach which can be implemented fully at the numerical level.     Broader Impacts: Three graduate students worked on this project. They successfully defended their dissertations.     We implemented several particular evolutionary models and analyzed the most-likely evolutionary trajectories connecting various population with given genetic compositions. These examples are quite interesting for evolutionary biology; they describe scenarios under which genotypes of intermediate strength can become dominant in the population.
