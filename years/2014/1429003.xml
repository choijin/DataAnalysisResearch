<AbstractNarration>University of Northern Colorado (UNC) requests $139,948 over 36 months for the acquisition of an HPC Cluster for Multidisciplinary Research and Education. Research projects include biology, computer science, mathematics, and atmospheric sciences. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed UNC HPC cluster is available to all of UNC, including training courses for new users. It is expected that some courses (specifically bioscience and computer science) will utilize the cluster. Outreach activities include the UNC 'Frontiers of Science Institute' which is a summer program for Colorado high school students in STEM disciplines. The PIs plan on implementing a program with the UNC Math and Science Teachers Institute to train K-12 teacher in advanced topics.</AbstractNarration>

Characterization of non-model organisms: Utilizing massively parallel DNA-sequencing data, the cluster has been used to generate and characterize de novo DNA sequence assemblies from several different venomous snakes and fruit bats. Atmospheric Modeling: A new configuration of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) has been set up on the cluster and is currently being used as a weather forecast model with a high-resolution inner nested grid that encompasses Colorado.   To date, the results of research enabled directly or indirectly by the cluster have been published in more than five scientific manuscripts.  The cluster has also enabled training courses for undergraduates and graduate students.
