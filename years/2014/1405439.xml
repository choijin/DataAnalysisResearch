<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will undertake a series of systematic investigations of the structural aspects of nanometer scale and mesoscale coordination polymer heterostructures.  The goals are to better understand how coordination polymer networks accommodate the presence of an interface and, therefore, how interfaces can be used to control properties.  Specific studies will elucidate the nature of structural changes induced by an interface, for example biaxial or isotropic, and how the structural changes differ if the strain is compressive vs tensile.  The depth away from the interface that strain or structural reorganization persists and the limits of structural parameters that allow epitaxial relationships between the heterostructure components will also be explored.  After comparing static structures, elastic processes and how a light- or thermally-induced structural event in one component is manifested in the other component via the interface will be investigated.   Studies will focus on cyanometallate coordination polymers of the Prussian blue analogue family, taking advantage of more than twenty easily accessible and air-stable analogues based on first-row transition metals.  A wide range of heterostructures are known, allowing for systematic variation of the parameters to be studied via control of particle size, structure, composition and component thickness.  The principal method of analysis will be X-ray diffraction, using both laboratory and synchrotron sources.  Data from X-ray scattering will be complemented by electron microscopy and electron diffraction.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simple promise of composite particles, or "heterostructures", is combining more than one property in a single material.  However, beyond simply adding properties, synergy between components can lead to new behavior and new function.  When heterostructures lead to "more than the sum of the parts", it is the interface between the constituents that causes the new properties.  The goals of the project are to learn how interfaces change the structures of a new class of materials, called coordination polymer heterostructures, and to then develop insights into how these heterostructures can be used to control properties.  Generalized results can inform many areas of current materials science, including magnetism, battery technology, thermal properties of materials, gas storage and separations, catalysis, as well as applications in bioanalysis and biomaterials.  The research tasks are designed to be platforms for graduate and undergraduate student education, preparing them with the "21st-Century Skills" needed to contribute to a high-technology workforce.  The research activities emphasize collaboration between disciplines, both among US institutions and with international partners, and will make significant use of the Advanced Photon Source, a major US multi-user facility where students receive training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this Division of Solid-State and Materials Chemistry Project was to explore the fundamental chemistry and physics behind a recently discovered class of magnets whose magnetic strength can be altered using light.  There are many possible applications of light-switchable magnetic materials in areas such as information storage, sensing and signaling or the conversion of light to energy, but to date there are no examples with adequate properties to be of technological importance.  Understanding the mechanism by which this new class of materials operates should lead to new ideas for even better light-switchable magnets.  The new class of magnets is sometimes referred to as mesoscale coordination polymer heterostructures, see Figure, which means they are made from two different synthetic hybrid organic/inorganic solids arranged in small submicron or nanometer scale particles or thin films with an interface between the two materials.  If one of the components was magnetic, it was discovered its magnetism could be altered when the other component absorbed light.   The SSMC project demonstrated the cause of the new properties is the light-absorbing material changes volume by undergoing a phase transition and this volume change exerts a stress on the magnetic component, affecting its magnetism.  The main experimental methods used in the studies were magnetometry, to measure the magnetic properties, and X-ray diffraction, to look for structural changes.  Many of the X-ray diffraction experiments were performed at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratories making use of its unique synchrotron X-ray source.  With an understanding of the mechanism in hand for how the magnetism is switched with light, several new examples were synthesized and some of the properties improved.  For example, the original examples only occurred at very low temperatures, below 60 K.  The newer examples switch magnetism with light up to 125 K, still below room temperature, but above temperatures easily accessible with liquid nitrogen cryogens.  Importantly, the work helps define strategies for further improvements.  The project provided several opportunities for student mentoring.  Over the course of the three-year project, six different Ph.D. students participated in aspects of the work and the results were included in their dissertations.  By the end of the project, four of these students had graduated, taking jobs in US technology companies.  While working on this project at the University of Florida, the graduate students and P.I. participated in public outreach activities targeting several audiences.  High-school students are brought to the lab each year as part of the Unversity of Florida?s Chemathon and introduced to aspects of the research.  The lab also participates in Molecular Mania, an annual event attracting hundreds of children and their parents with fun chemistry and physics experiments for the kids and introductions to the research projects for the adults.
