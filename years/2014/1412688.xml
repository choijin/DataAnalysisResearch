<AbstractNarration>Cell division is a fundamental process for virtually all living systems. The generation of two identical daughter cells requires not only that each cell receives an equal complement of  genetic material (DNA) but also that the other contents of the cell be divided equally. The process of physically separating the two daughter cells is known as cytokinesis, and this process involves a contractile ring that physically constricts the cell and splits it in two. Cytokinesis utilizes many of the same same mechanisms that are used to regulate cell shape change during migration. Cell shape is dependent on a dynamic structure (the cytoskeleton) that is comprised primarily of the protein actin, and whose behavior is regulated by a number of small signaling molecules. Several conflicting models have been proposed to explain how these small molecules interact to control the cytoskeleton, but the explanatory power of these models has not been clearly established. This project will investigate the regulation of the cytoskeleton by these small  signaling molecules and help to clarify the mechanisms by which they function.This research will provide training and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with a concerted effort to recruit underrepresented minorities including Native American Indian and  Hispanic students. Outreach into high schools will also be performed with the intent to generate in students a long-term interest in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a toolbox of molecular and pharmacological reagents will be combined with biophysical measurements and high-resolution light and electron microscopy to examine how the G proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 coordinate cytokinesis-related shape change in large embryonic cells. Aims 1 and 2 will use a combination of live cell imaging and biophysical analyses to determine what elements of Rac and Cdc42 signaling antagonize Rho-dependent cytokinesis. Aim 3 will take advantage of a unique preparation of the contractile ring to both define its 3D structure and determine how the different elements of Rho signaling contribute to its assembly and function. The results of these studies will advance knowledge in the field of animal cell division research by extending our understanding of the precise 3D architecture of actin and myosin II in the contractile ring that drives cytokinesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction: Cell movements, division and differentiation are mediated by a series of structural, contractile and motor proteins collectively referred to as the cytoskeleton.  One major component of the cytoskeleton is composed of actin filaments and their associated proteins and this actin cytoskeleton is in turn regulated by the activity of the Rho family of GTP-requiring proteins (which includes the proteins Rho, Rac and Cdc42).  In this project we used the early embryos of the sea urchin as a model system for studying how the Rho family of regulatory proteins influences the actin cytoskeleton during the cell division and development that accompanies embryogenesis.  Intellectual Merit: Previous work had demonstrated that Rho proteins help orchestrate the cytoskeletal changes that accompany cell division (or cytokinesis), however the precise structural organization of the contractile ring that accomplishes cytokinesis had not been fully elucidated in animal cells.  We used sophisticated super-resolution light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to define the structure of actin and myosin filaments within the contractile ring of first division sea urchin embryos.  This published work supported the long-standing purse string hypothesis of cytokinesis with the first real ultrastructural evidence of a muscle-like arrangement of actin and myosin in the contractile ring. In addition, we showed that the G protein Rac tends to antagonize the formation of the contractile ring during cell division through its stimulation of a particular form of actin filament organization. We also determined that this form of Rac-stimulated actin structure is present in the polar lobe of scallop embryos, a structure that undergoes a cytokinesis-like process but never completes the division. In gastrula stage sea urchin embryos, we published work examining the role of Cdc42 in which we discovered that it tends to impact the actin-based structure and motility of migratory cells that are responsible for forming the mesenchymal layer of the embryo.
