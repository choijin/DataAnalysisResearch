<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in reducing manufacturing costs in the $32 billion touchscreen module market and eliminating use of the rare-earth metal, Indium. Touchscreen modules are used in mobile phones, computers, point-of-sale terminals, and other display products. Existing methods to produce the transparent conducting film in touchscreen modules require many process steps and have low throughput. . By using much higher-speed processes and greatly reducing the number of process steps, this method enables 80% cost reduction in production of touchscreen sensor films. The phase II project will further develop the process to produce patterned sensor films over large areas and integrate with equipment that scales well to manufacturing. Analysis shows that the payback time on capital expenditure for new equipment required by the process will be under one year. Cost reductions enable gross margin increases of 50% and make US-based manufacturing of touchscreen modules feasible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop high speed laser crystallization (HSLC) of printed aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) nanoparticle layers on glass to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) for the Touch Panel Industry. Sputter deposition of ITO layers for touch panels has been the Industry standard for many years. Sputtered ITO requires costly vacuum systems with slow growth rates during ITO deposition. In addition, touchscreen sensors require expensive patterning using slow and costly photolithography process steps. Indium is a rare-earth material used in multiple large volume markets which has experienced high price volatility. R&amp;D in Phase II will focus on producing patterned AZO films and working prototypes over large areas with a figure of merit higher than industry standard touch films with a projected cost structure lower than what is currently capable in large volume manufacturing . HSLC rapidly converts nanoparticles into crystalline films with superior properties at energy efficient ambient conditions. The advantages of this environmentally benign process include high throughput, high efficiency, high optical transmission, and low cost.  Technical results will also advance printable electronics for other applications and markets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The technology for this project focused on developing an alternative technology for consumer touch screens that would reduce cost by eliminating photolithography. Figure 1 shows the current estimated cost reduction which would cut costs by 50% in the manufacturing of touch electrodes on glass.  The incumbent process technology, sputtered ITO films and photolithography, still holds &gt; 90% of the market even with the emergence of several new technologies (Ag NWs and metal mesh). Photolithography is very costly due to the number of low-throughput process steps, as well as expensive chemical processing (6 to 8 in total including wet-etching for ITO (indium tin oxide) electrode patterning). It was also envisioned that aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) would allow replacement of the metal indium, which is extremely expensive and subject to significant price volatility.  In contrast, this project developed a 4-step additive process to produce the patterned, transparent conducting patterns using ink-jet printing of touch electrode and laser heating of the electrodes to activate and optimize the material performance. The AddiLat solution is eco-friendly as it significantly lessens chemical processing and does not use rare earth metals for AZO.  Cost is lower due to higher speed processing, as well as reduction in electrode material waste, process steps, chemical handling, equipment, labor, and overhead. The initial focus of the effort was on aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) films for the touch electrodes.  Initially, it was assumed that AZO nanoparticle dispersions meeting small size with tight size distribution could be purchase in the open market.  There was a comprehensive survey of AZO nanoparticles at the start of the Phase II and an adequate AZO nanoparticle supplier could not be found that met the required specifications.  Thus, an in-house nanoparticle synthesis process was developed.   Indium tin oxide (ITO) films were also printed, as there was concern that laser treated ink jet printed AZO films would not meet touch screen sheet resistance requirements for consumer touch screens. Overall technical results of direct ink jet printed ITO and AZO films are listed in table I.  Technical results near the end of the SBIR determined that ITO nanoparticles films produced approximately the same resistivity as ITO sol gel films for an equivalent optical transparency.    Major conclusions for commercialization derived from the Phase II technical results were:   Sol gel solvent based AZO and ITO inks can made at scale to be cost competitive with other ink jet printed ITO replacements Nanoparticle inks will be more expensive than sol gel inks and detail cost analysis must be proven before companies or investors will fund commercialization UV laser treatment worked well for AZO films, but more work is required to determine if process is viable to produce sub 100 ohm-square films. Ink jet printing of ITO films can produce sub 100 ohm-square which may be a commercially viable product, if indium-based inks can be made cost competitive with PDOT derivative inks Additional heating of films at high temperature and subsequent laser treatment may be a competitive disadvantage to other emerging printed touch electrodes that can be printed and activated at lower temperatures There were concerns on ability to produce small feature size (sub 25 micron) for high end consumer touch products, limiting commercialization to secondary touch markets.
