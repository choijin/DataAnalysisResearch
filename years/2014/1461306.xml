<AbstractNarration>The D0 experiment operated at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) proton-antiproton Tevatron collider from 1992 until 2011, and has produced nearly 500 scientific publications to date. Notable among the results during that period was the discovery of the top quark in 1995. During this period, the Tevatron was the world's highest energy collider. This position now goes to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (proton-proton), but the Tevatron still has some advantages because it is a proton- antiproton collider. This makes a large number of proton and antiproton constituent particles, quark-antiquark collisions, as opposed to the LHC collisions that are dominated by intermediary particles called gluons. This enables unique measurements of quark-dominated processes, including some aspects of single top quark production via the Electroweak interaction and asymmetries between forward and backward produced top quarks or hadrons containing bottom quarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of the D0 data continues with some 40 additional publications expected over the next two years. These will contain further studies of the top quark, the Higgs boson and the nature of the strong force.  This award will fund one of the two spokespersons of the D0 experiment. The spokespersons are responsible for all physics analyses and guiding them toward publication. They provide mentoring for the graduate students and postdocs conducting analyses, and oversee the internal review of analyses by more senior members of the collaboration. In addition, the spokespersons represent the collaboration to the FNAL Directorate, the funding agencies, other experiments, and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 500 students have been trained within the D0 experiment, and a similar number of postdoctoral fellows have matured as scientists within the collaboration. The training of students and postdocs will continue through the analyses conducted during this grant. As in the past, we expect that these young men and women will enter careers in physics education and research, medical science, information technology, financial firms and government service. The mentoring of these people is one of the most important tasks of the D0 spokespersons, and provides one of the most lasting impacts on society by the experiment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project supported one fo the co-spokespersons of the DZero experiment that collected data at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider until 2011.  The very large DZero data set was analyzed throughout the award period, yielding 30  published papers.  All of these results were guided by the PI.   Highlights of these analyses include:  1)  The electromagnetic and weak interactions are unified into the 'electroweak interaction' in the Standard Model of particle physics.   The electroweak interaction is broken into its weak and electromagnetic pieces at high energies through a symmetry breaking mechanism that requires a Higgs boson.  DZero measured the fundamental parameter of this symmetry breaking with the best precision so far achieved at hadron colliders, rivalling the precision from previous measurements in electron and positron collisions.  However the two previous measurements disagreed with each other rather significantly,.  The DZero measurements gave a value of this parameter that is between these earlier ones, helping to reduce this long-standing puzzle.  2)  DZero and the CDF experiment jointly made a measurement showing  that the HIggs boson has zero spin and positive parity, as predicted for the Higgs boson in the Standard Model.  3)  The top quark discovered by the DZero and CDF collaborations in 1995 seems to play a key role in the electroweak symmetry breaking and on the stability of the early universe.  It is widely expected that new physics beyond the Standard Model will affect the properties of the top quark.   During the grant period, DZero provided one of the most precise determinations of the top quark mass,;measured its polarization (the tendency of the quark spin to align preferentially along some axis) and the correlations of the spins of the top and anti-top quarks; and measured the asymmetry between the production of top quarks emerging into the hemisphere containing the incoming proton and that containing the incoming anti-proton.   The latter measurement removed an earlier indication that this forward backward asymmetry disagreed with the Standard Model.  4) Evidence was found for a new exotic meson containing two quarks and two anti-quarks.  Ordinary mesons contain just one quark and one anti-quark.  Such structures had been seen before, but DZero 's object was the first to have all four quarks/anti-quarks of different 'flavor' (bottom, strange, up and down), and th us is a textbook example of such exotic states.  5)  Most collisions between protons and anti-protons involve the interaction between a quark or gluon in one incoming particle with a quark or gluon in the other incoming particle.  DZero observed several processes involving the interactions of two separate quark/gluon encounters.   The rate at which such double interactions occurs allows a measurement of the spatial extent of quarks or gluons within a proton.  The results show that the gluons are more tightly contained than the quarks.       Last Modified: 01/15/2018       Submitted by: Paul D Grannis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
