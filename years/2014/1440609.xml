<AbstractNarration>Scientific challenges are often addressed by a team of people from multiple science disciplines, institutions and geographic locations.  These teams use computation, communication and data resources scattered across many sites or institutions.  Because of the need to authorize access to these resources, it is currently a non-trivial problem for a team to set up the needed working environment, and that problem delays research projects and consumes time and other resources.  The sources of difficulties include: campus and research communities are familiar with their own Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions but are not familiar with the entire solution space; general purpose solution software has been developed in different environments but adoption outside the original environment has been limited; and members of domain science teams are not expert in distributed systems integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designing a system architecture supporting self-managed collaboration and federation of services named  "FeduShare".  The FeduShare framework builds on existing Identity Management solutions such as the InCommon federation, Shibboleth servers and the GENI solutions for people/resource management/authorization that build upon them.  Case studies used to inform the investigation include InCommon based logins for shell-based access to campus computing clusters, and the integration with identity management in GENI for the purposes of establishing seamless end-to-end communication paths.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research collaborations that cross campus boundaries occur very often.  These collaborations typically share resources such as storage, file systems, computational systems, and special research internet networks; these are called campus information technology (IT) resources and services, or cyberinfrastructure (CI).  Campuses have moved to centralizing management of CI with the ability to burst to the Cloud for extra capacity; therefore researchers who need to share such CI now turn to their campus IT organizations to ask for help in setting up reliable access control that easily lets the right collaborators in and securely prevents access by any unauthorized persons.     FeduShare?s intellectual merit is that it addresses a cyberinfrastructure gap that exists between national and campus access control designs.  Access control is usually a CI component that is invisible to the end user &ndash; unless it doesn?t work end-to-end and becomes a barrier to getting work done easily. Large scale national research programs such as XSEDE, Open Science Grid, science gateways such as iPlant, and the GeNi network have solved the problem of distributed access to CI by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to identify people, resources and systems.  Unfortunately, university campus IT organizations do not use PKI (with a few exceptions) to identify people.  Instead, they use Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), a federated trust fabric such as InCommon and software such as Shibboleth.  Also, campus IT organizations have built access control systems that recognize only persons who are local to the campus.  As a result, three problems arise for research collaborations:  (1) how to allow a researcher to list their self-selected collaborators, who could be from anywhere, as a meaningful entity (Virtual Organization, or VO) recognized by the campus IT access control systems; (2) how to provide access to campus managed CI for those VO members using SAML based access control; and (3)  how to connect campus-managed CI as a ?last mile? endpoint from national PKI-based CI into the campuses.       The FeduShare project solved these problems for some common use cases, including: (1) use of home campus single-sign-on for SSH console logon to a High Performance Computing cluster managed by a different; (2) using CILogon 2.0 Virtual Organization manager (coManage); and (3) adding a SAML Attribute Authority to the GeNi CI to make GeNi-defined groups and roles available to campus managed systems.  These solutions can be re-used, and campus IT staff gained a greater understanding, both technically and culturally, of their role in global collaboration for research.  The extensible use cases and training for campus IT staff demonstrate FeduShare?s broader impacts.      FeduShare outcomes were derived from partnerships we built among campus identity and access staff at Clemson University and the University of Utah, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, and the GeNi project office at Bolt, Baranek &amp; Newman.  This partnership was enhanced by collaboration with the United Kingdom?s JISC Moonshot (now called JISC Assent) team.  Our advisory board included representatives from XSEDE, Open Science Grid, NASA Identity and Access Mangement, Shibboleth development, and distributed file system developers at the University of Michigan.   Our specific products include:  A public web site describing the FeduShare framework and conference presentations https://sites.google.com/site/fedushare/  A github repository containing open source code and Shibboleth configuration documentation https://github.com/fedushare  A detailed technical report https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NudKLZJ5VjLMqh2wbFZ1u6984am2Eam7Kgyi2Hd83IQ/ Integration of FeduShare code with JISC Assent GUI SSH clients for windows, mac, and linux      Referring back to the three problems identified above, the FeduShare project demonstrated that university campus federated single-sign-on via  InCommon and Shibboleth can indeed be used to:  (1) Eliminate the need for campuses to create "Guest" or "Affiliate" user names to provide access to campus managed resources.  Instead, a Clemson person could use Clemson sign-on to use the HPC system at Utah, and a Utah person could use their Utah single-sign-on to use the Clemson Palmetto cluster.  (2) Demonstrated how to use Shibboleth configuration to map SAML space global user names to local HPC account names.  (3) Demonstrated how to use the Internet2 Trust and Identity in Higher Education (TIER) Co-Manage software product to self-manage collaboration memberships and make that membership information available in a trusted manner via SAML Attribute Assertions  (4) Demonstrated how to add Shibboleth Attribute Assertion server to the GeNi identity and access framework and use it to make GeNi group (experiment) and role information available via SAML Attribute Assertions to resources that are not part of the GeNi infrastructure.  (5) Demonstrated the role of campus IT staff and the systems they manage in developing a global CI that easily supports collaboration.
