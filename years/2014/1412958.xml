<AbstractNarration>This project is aimed at understanding a variety of fundamental questions in the theory of computation.  It will be carried out via the postdoctoral mentoring program at the Institute for Advanced Study, and as such the specific topics of focus will evolve with the postdocs present each year. Current foci include, among others, the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The power of formulas. &lt;br/&gt;Formulas is the most basic mathematical and computational descriptive mechanisms. Understanding their minimal length for natural problems captures at once limitation on the space requirements, as well as the potential parallelism inherent in the problem. The award will focus on the most challenging direction, which has so far resisted attack - proving limitation of formulas. More generally, the researchers will pursue proving limitations of other natural computational models, especially arithmetic computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The power of relaxations&lt;br/&gt;The "meta-algorithms": Linear and semi-definite relaxations of integer programs, are among the most fruitful and powerful techniques for solving (or finding approximate solutions) to optimization problems. The award will focus on understanding the limits of these techniques. This work ties in naturally to understanding the limitations of natural proof systems and of natural strategies for search algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Peeking inside the "black-box"&lt;br/&gt;One of the most useful paradigms in programming and learning is the encapsulation of objects as black-boxes, to which only input-output access is allowed.  With this utility come limitations which can hopefully overcome if we are allowed some access into the internal workings of the black box.  Modeling such access, in scientific experiments, machine learning and computational complexity is a challenge the researchers plan to pursue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational complexity, a foundational core of computer science, has proved itself a remarkably deep and fruitful fountain of problems, ideas and techniques over the past decades.  The research agenda is expected to be a driver of innovation in Theoretical Computer Science and related disciplines. Some of the areas of study have potential implications outside theory, especially machine learning, coding theory, scientific discovery and more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the educational side, the mentoring program furthers the quality of IAS postdocs to serve as outstanding teachers, graduate advisors and academic leaders and innovators in one of the most exciting branches of science today.  Whether IAS alumni pursue a career in academia or industry their impact on technology and on the training of new generations undergraduate and graduate education is immense.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary:  This proposal represents a combination of ambitious research and educational objectives. For research, the proposal aimed at making progress on fundamental problems in the theory of computation, the mathematical theory underlying computer science. For education, our postdoctoral program aims to train the best minds to become intellectual leaders, via dedicated mentoring and an enriching academic environment. The outcomes of these 5 years of support, summarized below demonstrate success in achieving these objectives.  Intellectual Merit:   Computational complexity, a foundational core of computer science, has proved itself a remarkably deep and fruitful fountain of problems, ideas and techniques over the past decades, and served as a driver of innovation in Computer Science and related fields. The research products of participants supported by this grant include results in the following diverse array of problems:  The design of new algorithmic techniques for complex optimization problems, as well as finding limits to their power. The relative power of classical and quantum computation. Error correction in a variety of models and applications, including ultra-fast error-detection and correction, and codes for interactive computation. Computational learning theory, in particular the limitations of low memory for basic learning tasks, as well as new models of interactive, distributed and fair learning. Connections to the mathematics of symmetries, and its uses for understanding algorithms, randomness and computational complexity.    A common thread is the numerous interconnections between these and other areas, and ideas flowing between them enriching each other, which were always present in the field and are demonstrated in these works.  Broader impact:  As mentioned, a major goal is the mentoring and training of postdoctoral members to becoming intellectual leaders of the future. It is a pleasure to say that most graduates of our program have proceeded to take research and teaching positions in top universities, in which they will be able to generate impactful research and provide excellent education to generations of computer science students.  Many of the research outcomes described above may prove to have an impact on new technologies and applications. This include the following topics:  Error correcting codes, which underlie essentially all storage media and communication applications. New algorithms for optimization problems, and limitations of such algorithms. Quantum computation and communication, which may become a reality as quantum technologies seem to get closer and closer to producing scalable computers. Fairness in algorithms, a new foundational study of how to formalize the social responsibility of letting algorithmic decisions guide many aspects of life such as assisting government agencies, judges, loan officers, employment agencies and more.     A major outreach activity of PI Wigderson during these 5 years was the completion of a comprehensive, broadly accessible book, titled Mathematics and Computation: a theory revolutionizing technology and science. The book was published in fall 2019 by Princeton University Press, but is also freely available from the author website. Here is a short description:  This book, designed for interested laymen, students in related fields, as well as researchers provides a broad, conceptual overview of computational complexity theory, the mathematical study of efficient computation, that underlies such revolutions as internet security, electronic commerce and quantum computing. The book explains the motivations and ideas leading to key models, notions, results and challenges.
