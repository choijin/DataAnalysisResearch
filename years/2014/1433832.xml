<AbstractNarration>The University of Chicago proposes a project to develop an online resource of tools and recommendations for K-12 computer science leaders in schools and districts. The Toolkit will use three organizational frameworks--implementation pathways, user needs by role, and topical Q&amp;As--to make it as useful as possible. The Toolkit will curate existing resources and tools currently under development, and it will generate new tools, reports, and recommendations, all focused on helping education leaders make well-informed decisions about their computer science programs. The goal of this project is to present the best available, timely information about developing and leading a K-12 computer science education effort in a format that is easily accessible to school district and state leaders, empowering them to make stronger decisions in their efforts to broadly change educational outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an unprecedented time for the computer science education field as funding, public awareness, and employment needs are all merging for potentially coordinated support. The committed, long-standing leaders of the computing community, however, have little experience in leading larger, distract-based efforts. This project brings expertise from mathematics and science education reform communities to the newly emerging computing efforts. The Toolkit will translate this experience into the context of computer science and, thus, will contribute to a foundation of knowledge on the design, implementation, and evaluation of computer science education investments. The work will increase the scale and effectiveness of computer science teaching and learning. It will leverage and accelerate the many efforts already underway.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project created LeadCS.org, a website for K-12 education leaders in schools and districts and their partners looking to begin or improve a computer science education initiative. It houses a collection of research-based tools and recommendations as well as an infrastructure for adding more tools and resources for the computer science education and broader education leadership community.  LeadCS.org advances knowledge by providing the field with new information and guidance for leading computer science education initiatives. Its tools are wide-ranging and as such inform leaders who are both, at the outset of their computer science education programs as well as those who, while already having well-established programs, seek to grow and improve their programs. Some LeadCS.org tools provide summaries and syntheses of current information, data, and projects. Other tools are "voices of experience" with recommendations coming from leaders who have already navigated the change process. These tools provide key advice from leader reflections on the most critical supports, barriers, and lessons learned in the process of implementing a computer science program. Still others provide guidance and frameworks for leaders ready to take actionable steps toward bringing computer science to their students.  LeadCS.org is a key resource for supporting our society as it seeks to realize the emerging priority goal of providing quality computer science education to its learners. There is no "one size fits all" solution to computer science education. Each school and district brings its own set of assets, needs, and challenges that will contribute to how computer science education emerges in that setting. Still, both literature and experience suggest some strategies and decisions might be more promising in some contexts than others. LeadCS.org tools have been designed to surface that learning. Therefore, leaders can use these tools flexibly, in different combinations and in sequences, to make better and more informed decisions about computer science in their unique contexts.  The tools in LeadCS.org are organized into several categories: communication, courses, equity, infrastructure, instructional resources, partnerships, rollout, standards &amp; outcomes; and teachers. Within these categories, users can find tools that have been collected, cultivated and developed to help them learn, plan, and take action to bring computer science learning opportunities to their students. Additionally, LeadCS.org users can access tools through several avenues.  First, users can look at questions that are likely to reflect their concerns. For example, within the equity category, a user will see the following:  1) How can I involve more girls in computer science in my school?; 2) How can I best include students with disabilities in computer science?; and 3) What can I do to involve more students who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science? Clicking on a question of interest will bring the user to at least one associated tool.  Additionally, users can search simply by category and tool name. For example, in the "Standards and Outcomes" category, users will see links to tools entitled, "Content Standards in K-12 Computer Science Education" and "The Landscape of Testing in Computer Science."  Finally, users can access the tools by following "Leader Pathways." These are descriptions of steps that teacher leaders, school leaders, district leaders and stakeholder leaders have taken to initiate and grow computer science education efforts in their own communities. Users can learn about the actions individuals in roles similar to their own have taken and learn from and adapt them to their own settings.  This is a time of unprecedented opportunity for computer science education. The last few years have seen a large increase in efforts to develop and expand computer science learning opportunities in K-12 education settings at the federal, state, and local leve...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
