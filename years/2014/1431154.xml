<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Prof. Joseph Masco, Ph.D. candidate Ella Butler will undertake an ethnographic study of food scientists, flavor chemists and sensory scientists working on the development of new, nutritious, appealing processed foods. Her focus will be on how scientists work to replicate the properties of taste, flavor and texture of foods if they substitute other  ingredients for sugar or salt through, for instance, phantom aromas, chemicals designed to stimulate neural pathways to produce imagined sensations.  This project works at the intersection of neurobiology, memory, health, the senses and chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the national concern with the ill effects of many processed foods on the health of the American population, this study will be of broad interest. As public commentators, health professionals and political leaders grapple with how to deal with rising levels of obesity and diabetes, the processed food industry has received serious criticism. This anthropological approach will convey the perspectives of the scientists who are working to craft healthier but still tasty products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Ella Butler completed anthropological fieldwork for her NSF-funded project entitled: 'Doctoral Dissertation Research: Developments in the Food Science of Nutritious Processed Foods.'  Her research was an ethnographic study of the work of food scientists, flavor chemists and sensory scientists working in the United States.  The research involved participant observation and interviews with food scientists in university food science departments, visits to flavor companies and sensory evaluation companies, and attendance at industry trade shows and scientific conferences.  Ella was interested in how scientists who study the sensory properties of food understand the relationship between sensory experience and food products.  To this end, she looked at the experimental methods and concepts that scientists bring to their work in order to see how they understand sensory experience as something that can be evaluated, measured, utilized or reproduced.  In addition, she was interested in the kinds of institutional positions that food scientists hold, and the way that institutional factors, funding structures and media representations inform scientific research.  The challenge of making healthier foods through scientific research into taste and flavor was an area where these questions became particularly salient.      Through participant observation, interviews and archival research over a period of 15 months, Ella accomplished the objectives of the research.  She has presented the results of the research at national and international academic conferences and is currently preparing an article for publication.  The NSF-supported research will serve as the empirical basis for a broader argument within Ella?s dissertation concerning how the senses feature in scientific experimentation, and how scientists in turn understand the senses.      The dissertation will be completed by June 2018, and will make an important contribution to the anthropology of food, the anthropology of the senses, and the social study of science and scientists.
