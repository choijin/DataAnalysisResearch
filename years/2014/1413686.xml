<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this 3-year project is to investigate the thermal and magnetic structure of sunspots by using simultaneous high-resolution observations of magnetic field and mass motion at different heights in the solar atmosphere.  The project will shed more light on four major science topics, namely: (i) three dimensional magnetic structure of sunspots; (ii) three dimensional thermal structure of sunspot; (iii) effect of magnetic field on spectral line profiles; and, (iv) magnetic and velocity structure near solar flare locations.  The first three topics also have broader implications to stellar astrophysics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project includes observations of the Sun that have application to space weather, stellar astrophysics, and training of both undergraduate and graduate students to becoming the next generation of solar physicists.  In particular, this 3-year project will: (i) enable better understanding of the magnetic field structure of Sun-like stars and their chromospheric activity; (ii) provide improved understanding of the magnetic field, mass motion, and thermal structure of active region chromospheres to help identify unstable magnetic configurations that may impact space weather; (iii) help identify specific science problems for which the higher spatial resolution of the future DKIST will be crucial; and, (iv) contribute to educating undergraduate and graduate students in observational solar physics.  The project will involve undergraduate students from the California State University at Northridge, which is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution, as well as an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF-funded project "Three-dimensional thermal and magnetic structure of sunspots and active regions" was focused on the detailed study of the structure of the solar photosphere and chromosphere in sunspots and their surroundings. To execute the project, a series of observing campaigns at the NSF’s Dunn Solar Telescope in Sunspot/NM (https://www.nso.edu/telescopes/legacy-telescopes-2/ , https://sunspot.solar/ ) was conducted between 2015 and 2017. Overview images of those and other data can be found at https://www.nso.edu/telescope/dunn-solar-telescope/cbeck/default.html .  The intellectual merit of the project is to understand the physical mechanism of the Inverse Evershed Flows that transfer mass end energy mostly from the super-penumbral boundary into the sunspot. In order to accomplish this goal, we carried out the following task.  After a selection of the best-suited data sets, the properties of the flow field in the solar chromosphere in the so-called superpenumbra, the immediate vicinity of the sunspot’s outer boundary, were investigated. It was possible to demonstrate that the flow field is dominated by an inflow of material into the sunspot at chromospheric heights, the so-called inverse Evershed flow. From the detailed analysis of the observations through newly developed tools (Beck et al. 2015, 2019), we were able to demonstrate that the inverse Evershed flow:  -        follows magnetic field lines of about 10-20 Mm length at a maximum height of 1-3 Mm  -        ends in the outer penumbra of sunspots, where closed magnetic field lines are prevalent  -        attains supersonic speeds near its downflow points causing a shock front with abrupt deceleration and local heating  -        is inclined towards the surface near its endpoints  -        has a typical lifetime of individual flow channels of a few ten minutes with no oscillatory behavior  -        exhibits a positive difference in the magnetic field strength between its inner and outer footpoints.  With these findings, we were able to demonstrate that the inverse Evershed flow is driven by a so-called siphon flow mechanism, where the difference in magnetic field strength leads to a difference in gas pressure that can drive mass flows along the field lines. Such siphon flows had been proposed to exist in the solar atmosphere in the past but could only be confirmed in a few rare cases. Our results show that they actually are a dominant driver of the thermodynamic evolution in the solar chromosphere in the vicinity of sunspots. The results were published in a series of papers (Choudhary &amp; Beck, 2018; Beck &amp; Choudhary 2019, 2020; Beck et al. 2020, in press).   The attached figure shows a sketch of the magnetic topology and flow geometry in the photosphere and chromosphere that complies with our findings (adapted from Beck &amp; Choudhary 2020, ApJ, 891, 119; Fig. 20).   The figure describe the vertical magnetic fields of the umbra do not connect back to the solar surface locally and do thus not take part in the large-scale flow patterns. The photospheric Evershed flow is an outflow away from the umbra along nearly horizontal magnetic field lines. The chromospheric inverse Evershed flow is an inflow towards the umbra in higher atmosphere layers that is inclined towards the surface. The inclination of the inverse Evershed flow to the surface supports the existence of two components with different field inclinations in the penumbra, the so-called uncombed penumbral model.     The broader impact of the project is the development of the data analysis tools to process the spectropolarimetric observations of the sunspots in photospheric and chromospheric spectral lines rapidly. We plan to use these tools to develop a comprehensive package analyzing sunspot and active region observations that will be very useful for space weather studies. The other broader impact outcome is the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the cutting edge research in the field of observational solar physics.
