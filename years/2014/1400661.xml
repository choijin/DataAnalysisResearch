<AbstractNarration>Abstract(Jarosz,1400661): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of approximately 60 US participants, primarily graduate students and young researchers, and 10 invited speakers participating in the  "7th Conference on Function Spaces" to be held on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville from May 20-24, 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be talks by internationally known speakers on a wide variety of topics including spaces of functions, topological and Banach algebras, and operators.  In addition to plenary talks there will be many contributed talks by graduate students, postdocs, and young researchers, up to 10 a day in parallel sessions.  There will also be a two hour recorded open forum led by experts to discuss recent trends and new problems in the field of function spaces.</AbstractNarration>

The support was primarily offered to junior mathematicians, including graduate students who had otherwise very limited access to travel support; we also offered support to few distinguished experts in the field.     The Conference was attended by over 120 participants from almost 30 countries. It was devoted to the area of mathematics called functional analysis, primarily to study of function spaces, function algebras, spaces of analytic functions, geometry of Banach spaces, and related topics. Participants delivered approximately 100 lectures concerning the latest developments.       We had five morning plenary sessions with 20 longer lectures delivered by leading experts. Each day of the Conference we also had three parallel afternoon sessions &ndash; these lectures were shorter and more specialized.  We had sessions devoted to Banach Algebras, Topological Algebras, Banach Spaces, Operators on Banach Spaces, Spaces of Analytic Functions, Isometries and Small Bound Isomorphisms of Banach Spaces, Spaces of Analytic Functions, Spaces of Harmonic Functions, and Non-Archimedean Function Spaces.     The Conference also provided forum for exchange of new ideas and stimulated national and international research collaboration.     Proceedings of the Conference were accepted for publication by the American Mathematical Society in the Contemporary Mathematics series; the book should be available later this year.
