<AbstractNarration>The brain communicates and forms memories through a specialized group of cells called neurons. These cells form connections through extensions called neurites. Neurites are formed when neurons alter their protein skeleton to reach for other cells. Disruptions to the cellular skeleton can harm memory formation. Tropomodulins (Tmods) are a family of proteins that contribute to the formation of the cellular skeleton in neurons. During seizures, strokes, and methamphetamine exposure and also in Down syndrome and epilepsy, the amounts of Tmods in the brain have been shown to be vastly altered. Understanding the role of Tmods in brain development will elucidate these conditions and may lead to treatments. Previous studies have shown that variation in Tmods' roles in neurite formation correlates with structural differences. The goal of this project is to determine the atomic structure (determinant in protein function) of Tmod2 for comparison with the known structure of Tmod1. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Fadel Samatey, an expert in protein structure at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. A solved structure for Tmod2 will uncover details about Tmods' finely tuned role in brain development and disruption in disease states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction are techniques that will be used to determine protein structure. This project aims to screen for and optimize crystallization conditions for the leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of Tmod2 and then determine its structure by X-ray Diffraction. This domain is important for localization of Tmods in muscle cells, thymosin binding and Tmod's actin nucleation ability. Comparison of Tmod structures will lead to residues for mutagenesis that will connect the structure of these proteins to their roles in neurite formation. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Brain cells use proteins to sense their local environment and signal to other cells to form connections. After a signal has been received, a host of changes occur inside the cell that lead to an extension called a neurite. The changes inside the cell involve many proteins including actin. Actin is a globular protein that forms long filaments to alter cell shape. Tropomodulins are a family of proteins that cap one end of actin filaments and stabilize the filament. Tropomodulins are fundamental for the development of many organs including the heart and nervous system. The first goal of this project was to determine the atomic structure of tropomodulin2, the neural specific tropomodulins. This project was conducted in collaboration at The Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) with Professor Fadel Samatey. Professor Samatey is an X-ray Crystallography and protein structure expert. The major choke point of crystallographic studies is finding conditions that cause the protein to form crystals. We were able to surpass this point and begin refining the crystallization conditions for tropomodulin2. Additional refinement of the crystallization conditions is necessary to solve the structure. The fellow received significant training in protein refolding and crystallography. The second goal of this project was to receive training in the culture and differentiation of PC12 cells, a model system to study the formation of brain cell extensions. Laurent Guillaud, a post-doctoral research in the Cellular and Molecular Synaptic Function Unit at OIST, provided the training. Additionally, several tropomodulins mutants were checked for expression in this system. Dr. Guillaud&rsquo;s training has enabled further studies using this system at Washington State University. The Fellow had a particular interest in working in Okinawa to support the relations between the people of Okinawa and The United States. Several thousand US military service men and women have been positioned on Okinawa since World War II. This USA Military presence on the island has caused considerable tension with the inhabitants of Okinawa. OIST is a new university in Japan with a focus on positive international relations. The spirit of OIST is a perfect match with NSF&rsquo;s East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/01/2015<br>      Modified by: Kevin&nbsp;T&nbsp;Gray</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
