<AbstractNarration>Recent research indicates that engaging students in research projects early in their careers helps them to understand how science is practiced, improves their understanding of basic science concepts and increases their potential to complete a degree in science and will help them to better understand how science affects their daily lives. This EAGER pilot project will establish a consortium of scientists and educators (from the University of California-San Diego (UCSD) and three Hispanic serving community colleges Cuyamaca, Palomar and Mount San Jacinto colleges) that will engage 3000 students per year in original research, using DNA barcoding to investigate the distribution of insects within their local areas; a project that will serve both science and the students well.  Hispanic students in particular have very high intentions to major in STEM but very low retention rates (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd). They  may have the most to gain from an authentic research experience at the start of their academic careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science involved is also important as the project will help chronicle the biodiversity of the local area, something that is just beginning to be known. For example, despite 250 years of modern taxonomy scientists estimate that 70% of all insect species have never been named, described, or documented. Given the importance of insects to the environment in which we live there is a pressing need to catalogue the distribution of insects across wide areas of the earth.  With the advent of modern methods of identifying species, it has become increasingly easy to engage undergraduate students in this process.  The San Diego Biodiversity Project seeks to address this knowledge gap while engaging undergraduate students across the region in cutting-edge, original, collaborative research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an expansion of a project UCSD established in 2012 (NSF TUES #1140640). Students will collect and barcode invertebrates from their campus environs, learning the basics of ecological field methods, DNA extraction and amplification, sequencing, and bioinformatics while helping to create a species inventory for their campus. They will upload their data to the Barcode of Life Database, contributing to the international effort to document all species. In the UCSD pilot, about half of the species that students collected were new to the database.  The project will, in addition to revising an existing database portal to accommodate college-level use and to emphasize the scientific contributions the students are making, provide: staff and equipment to jump-start the lab work at each two-year school, workshops for joint curriculum development, assessment, and IRB proposal development, and an assessment consultant. UCSD is providing staff expertise for curriculum development, hosting a student research symposium, and summer orientations for potential transfer students. The project is designed to establish long-term collaborations among faculty across campuses and facilitate community college student transfers to research universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the participant schools will assess the project to determine if it is contributing to the learning outcomes specific to each course. They will also develop a research plan to better understand how underrepresented minorities are affected by course-based research in terms of student confidence in science, retention in STEM, and/or interest in pursuing science at a research-oriented university.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/)</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to incorporate authentic research into the biology curriculum at multiple campuses in the region, particularly Hispanic-Serving Institutions.  Students at both 2-year and 4-year schools participated in a project to catalog arthropod biodiversity from their campus and/or nearby ecological reserve.  Students collected unknown invertebrates and generated DNA barcodes for each specimen.  Students compared the DNA sequence data from their specimen to a library of sequences in the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) to identify their specimens, or in some cases determine that they were the first to submit a particular taxa to BOLD.   This project is scientifically important because invertebrate biodiversity is so poorly known (May 2010) and appears to be disappearing (Hallman et al. 2017).  Undergraduate students are helping to develop a baseline inventory of arthropod species on or near their campuses.     In collaboration with the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario we developed a system for students to manage their data and communicate their results to the scientific community.  The University Student Data Portal (Uni SDP, http://uni.boldsystems.org/index.php/SDP_Home) is a classroom-oriented interface with the professional Barcode of Life Database (BOLD).  This is the method by which instructors can manage a classroom project (monitor work, assign grades, etc.) while at the same time students can share data across classrooms and institutions and ultimately make their data public through BOLD.  There are currently 1242 specimens from 9 different schools on the University Student Data Portal.  These records belong to 79 invertebrate families and 114 species. Vouchers are deposited in 12 different institutions. For the 4 collaborating schools in this project, the overall sequencing success (the number of specimens that produced a useable DNA sequence) was 60%.  The community colleges alone had a 73% success rate.      This project is generally a month-long module embedded in a longer laboratory course.  In collaboration with Dr. David Hanauer, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, we assessed the effect of such a short-term original research project on student engagement and retention in STEM (Hanauer et al. 2018).  The Persistence in the Sciences (PITS) Survey showed that even a month-long research module such as this one can confer benefits in terms of student engagement and retention.  The impact is not as large as a longer experience, but it is important in meaningful ways.  The "project ownership" suite of questions are the most impacted by our project, and previous research has shown these questions to be better indicators of greater persistence in science.      We also developed an interview protocol in which we asked students to compare the more traditional parts of their laboratory course to the research experience.  It appears that student perceptions of the two aspects of their lab course are different. Students appreciate learning basic processes and procedures in traditional labs but they express a personal investment and the sense of participating in science in this research module.  For example, many students said something similar to this quote: "When we uploaded to BOLD, that was not just something personal like writing in my own notebook. It was uploading so that others can be able to access that data as well, so it's kind of a bigger community." Students were clearly engaged, "So like I just tell my friends about it all the time."     A final goal of the project was to introduce community college students to a research university.
