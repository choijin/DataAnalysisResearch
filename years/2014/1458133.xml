<AbstractNarration>The Chemistry First Scholars program will offer scholarships to 20 students, with financial need and academic merit, who are seeking to become successful chemists.  The project will attract and support through to graduation at-risk, first-generation students in chemistry, thereby increasing the number of quality professional chemists, and the project team will continue to reach across campus and provide leadership to other STEM departments in promoting best practices for support systems for STEM students. Such practices include identification of Faculty Mentors to help students dentify individual chemistry career paths, opportunities, and professional programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will use a three-tiered, inclusive academic support program in the chemistry major, developed through institutionalization of efforts from a prior S-STEM project.  The three-tiered student support structure will rely first on building a natural student cohort.  A Chemistry Learning Community (CLC) will begin in the first year and last through to graduation.  There will be a total of four CLCs over the project period.  The three-tiered model follows best practices in supporting first generation students through all phases of their college career.  The Chemistry First Scholars program will partner with the existing UNC Asheville Scholars Program to strengthen community among chemistry majors and to engage and support at risk, low income, first generation students. The Director of the Academic Assessment act UNC-Asheville, an independent evaluator, will coordinate the assessment the project.  Success will be measured through the assessment and evaluation of student academic performance, project activities, and project deliverables.  Project deliverables include the number of scholars funded, the total number of scholarships awarded, the graduation rate of scholars and career placement following graduation.  To investigate the impact of the program on student retention, progress, and success in chemistry, relative to past years, the information and results gathered from the prior S-STEM project will serve as a pre-project baseline. In so doing, the project will contribute to a growing body of knowledge regarding attributes and practices of successful programs for students who demonstrate financial need.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina Asheville (UNC Asheville) received a National Science Foundation S-STEM grant in 2015 to (1) provide 20 students interested in completing a chemistry degree an opportunity to earn scholarships based on academic merit and financial need, and (2) to develop a three-tiered student support structure for all UNC Asheville chemistry majors focused on intentional support of first-generation students, of which UNC Asheville has a significant population.  Broader Impacts:  This program has provided previously unavailable scholarship dollars for 25 chemistry majors with academic merit and financial need in four cohorts (Classes of 2019-2022); 17 Chemistry Scholars have graduated with chemistry degrees and 8 are on track to graduate in December 2021 or May 2022, after grant funding ends.  32 total students have been supported with S-STEM scholarships [17 (53%) of whom are first-generation students], with 25 earning or soon earning a degree.  The persistence rate of the 17 first-generation Chemistry Scholars (76%) is similar to all Scholars (78%), indicating that the S-STEM program is supporting first-generation Chemistry Scholars to the same degree. To attract first-generation chemistry students to UNC Asheville, a long-term recruiting plan was developed based on building relationships with regional highschool chemistry teachers.  An annual Chemistry First Prospective Scholars and Teachers Day (Chemistry First Day, CFD) was developed to bring both highschool teachers and their interested students (with or without parents) to an on-campus event including informational and active learning sessions in order to give a meaningful campus experience focused on chemistry.  CFD partnered with Admissions in the informational components of the session.  The recruitment plan was enhanced by other Admissions events on and off campus, and through marketing materials.  14% of highschool students who attended CFD enrolled at UNC Asheville for their undergraduate degree; there has been a 198% increase in enrolled students from the 11 participating highschools since implementing CFD.  Intellectual Merit:  The student support elements of the project involved partnering with the Academic Success Center, Career Center, and the University's former AVID for Higher Education Scholars Program for first-generation students.  The project built upon efforts of a previous S-STEM award and created/expanded a three-tiered educational support structure to target support for first-generation chemistry majors specifically.  Support elements implemented were based on proven pedagogical theories and practices that build on creating a learning community that includes Chemistry Scholars and other chemistry majors.  The three tiers of the program are: TIER 1 includes creating the chemistry learning community and supporting it through cohort building activities, mentoring, and first-year academic support in General and Organic Chemistry courses.  A program-specific first-year seminar course, required of all UNC Asheville students, was designed to give targeted support in the first-semester transition to college, a critical time period for supporting first-generation students.  (Freshman year.) TIER 2 continues the learning community and includes faculty and peer mentoring, seminars focused on chemistry careers, and early undergraduate research opportunities for Chemistry Scholars in order to help first-generation chemistry majors learn about career paths in chemistry and strengthen their identity as chemists. (Freshman &amp; sophomore years.)  TIER 3 includes mentored undergraduate research experiences (for BS students) and focused career mentoring/building with resume preparation, field trips, seminar series. (Junior and senior years.)  The support structure of the program has maintained the previous growth in the number of high-quality chemistry graduates (see image), where the number of graduates/yr have increased from a pre-S-STEM baseline of 8.5 to 25.5 (in classes of 2019-22), and has increased the support and preparation of first-generation students to enter the chemistry workforce.  Survey results on student perceptions of the learning community show positive responses for "a sense of community among chemistry majors" and "between chemistry students and faculty", with an increase from a 45% positive pre-program baseline to means of 94% and 88% for freshman Scholars and means of 87% and 88% for all freshman chemistry majors, further increasing to means of 100% and 100% for sophomore Scholars and 89% and 97% for sophomore chemistry majors.  Attrition of students leaving the chemistry major during the first semester of college was also less than that for other STEM majors, with an average of 0% change in the number of interested chemistry majors compared to a 4% decrease in other STEM majors surveyed.  Evaluation of student career preparation showed that the career mentoring and Career Center partnership increased student engagement with the Career Center outside of program elements by 18%.  The number of chemistry graduates has increased from a pre-S-STEM baseline of 8.5/yr and pre-grant baseline of 23/yr to 25.5/yr in this project (see image).  This continued increase in chemistry graduates emphasizes an impact of the program on attracting and retaining all chemistry majors; this meets another objective of the 2014 S-STEM program solicitation, "the national need to increase substantially the number of American scientists and engineers".
