<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities program (CRIF), West Virginia University will acquire an infrared spectroscopy system equipped with a high pressure reactor. A basic infrared spectrometer system provides spectroscopic data in the infrared region of the spectrum. These data give information about the vibrational frequencies of a substance, thus providing insight on the chemical composition and structure of the materials under investigation. Infrared spectroscopy is a widely used tool in understanding the properties of chemical and biological systems and in materials research. The in situ high pressure reactor will allow the study of reactions and products subjected to pressures above ambient conditions. This tool will advance the training of students in their research and course work at all levels. The instrumentation will be made available to researchers at other institutions in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as studying (a) heterogeneous oxidation of biomass materials and catalytic conversion of combustion pollutants, (b) catalytic C-C bond forming reactions including reductive coupling of carbon monoxide and dehydrogenative cross-coupling, (c) organometallic reactions catalyzed by late transition metals ligated to an ambiphilic, multifunctional, and 1,2,3-triazole ligand systems, and (d) palladium-catalyzed pathways for making nitrogen heterocycles of biological importance.</AbstractNarration>
