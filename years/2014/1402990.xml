<AbstractNarration>This project aims at developing an integrated experimental and educational framework for understanding of dynamical spin pumping, spin injection, and generation of pure spin currents in graphene-based spintronics devices. A series of experimental and theoretical research activities have been strategized in collaboration with the Graphene Research Centre at the National University of Singapore. The goal of the proposed research is to develop nanoscale devices for information processing where a complete control of the magnetic state is possible without relying on charge currents. Within emerging spintronics technologies, the generation and control of pure spin currents is becoming of paramount relevance. The unique property of graphene offers the advantage of pure spin current devices as preeminent candidate for the next generation of information processing and storage hardware. The proposed research will be integrated with a series of educational and training activities, including training of graduate students at the interface of fundamental and applied physics, and gain experience from international collaboration. The PIs are committed to involving underrepresented groups in the research activities at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes a series of experimental and theoretical research activities for the understanding of injection and control of pure spin currents in graphene-based spintronic devices that uses dynamical spin pumping and the spin-Hall effect (SHE). The goal is to develop nanoscale devices for information processing where a complete control of the magnetic state is possible without the direct intervention of net charge currents. The proposed devices will make use of the unique properties of graphene to allow generation and manipulation of pure spin currents for controlling the magnetic state of the device that not possible with spin transfer torque devices based on non-gateable elements. The specific objectives of the project are to: a) understand dynamical spin pumping from a ferromagnet (FM) into single-layer and multi-layer graphene (Gr) under different structural conditions exfoliated, chemical vapor deposition grown, and hydrogenated graphene) and for different interfacial configurations (FM/Gr and FM/MgO/Gr); b) understand the SHE in single-layer and multi-layer graphene under different structural conditions and study its behavior as a function of the gate voltage; and, c) develop graphene-based gateable pure spin current valves that uses both dynamical spin pumping and SHE to allow for an efficient control of magnetic state of the devices and explore their potential applications for next generationlow-power high-speed MRAM, information processing and storage devices.</AbstractNarration>
