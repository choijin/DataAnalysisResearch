<AbstractNarration>With the end of Moore's Law, all computing systems (smart phones, watches, laptops, and even the cloud) of the future must intelligently manage energy, parallelism, and even trade reliability and lifetime for increased computing performance and storage capacity.  This daunting task involves decision making in real-time (milliseconds), in a system with many devices (billions of transistors), and very complex behavior (100 million line software) with consequences for performance or lifetime as much as 100-fold.  The Research Infrastructure to explore Volatility, Energy-efficiency, and Resilience (RIVER) at the University of Chicago will create a scientific vehicle that enables research on this critical management problem for applications that underlie extraordinary information access and intelligent behavior we depend on in today's information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RIVER project will design and create an observable, controllable computing system  (a research infrastructure) where reliability, lifetime, power, volatility, parallelism, and performance can be varied across as wide a range as 10,000-fold.  Under flexible software control, the system will support power capping, clock speed scaling, and enable deep customization of solid-state storage. All of these properties will be supported with fine-grained control and complemented by extensive detailed monitoring.  Research results will involve new ways to control and intelligently manage computing performance and lifetime with quantitative improvements as large as 100-fold; such large change may be breakthrough capabilities for those applications in the new reality of hardware technology.  The RIVER project will advance computer systems, software, algorithms, and applications research. Because of the broad societal importance of computing, the potential impact of these core capabilities could touch many aspects of government, education, and commerce. The RIVER system and tools will be used in undergraduate and graduate classes, thus exposing them to realities of future computing, and will be shared with other universities to maximize impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The RIVER project designed and created a cloud computing research infrastructure for exploring research questions related to energy-efficiency, reliability, predictable performance, scalability, program correctness, and performance.  Because the technologies that support these characteristics are typically hidden from users in commercial cloud systems, such research is not possible there.  The design and construction of the RIVER testbed was performed by a collection of six faculty and six graduate students.  They explored both hardware and open software alternatives (such as Openstack, linux, and more), designing a deployment, modifying software as necessary, and building the system.  This effort was both a technical and an educational success.  Technical: the RIVER system operated successfully for over four years (and continues), and flexibly supported a wide array of systems research in the focus areas (listed above), and produced a large number of highest quality research insights and results.  Education: the design and construction of the RIVER testbed exposed both the faculty and the students to hands-on experience with the capabilities and shortcomings of the cloud software and hardware technology.  This exposed the "real" problems, and improved the impact of research dramatically.  Further, the success of RIVER inspired the University of Chicago Computer Science department to dramatically expand its systems research activity (includes cloud), adding nearly a dozen faculty to the team in the period of this project (5 years).  RIVER's availability as a scientific testbed has enabled the computer systems faculty to be extraordinarily productive, publishing over 18 top research papers in peer-reviewed conferences in the past year alone.  The rapid growth and rise of this team has been noted across the US and global computer science community.  The large, dynamic team that the RIVER testbed was critical in helping to create is not not only creating a wealth of advanced research innovation and invention, but at steady state producing approximately 20 PhD, and 200+ undergraduates each year for the workforce.
