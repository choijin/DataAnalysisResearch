<AbstractNarration>Fouque&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1409434&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Challenging nonlinear problems arising naturally in the context of risk management under uncertain or randomly fluctuating volatility and under liquidity constraints are addressed in the first part of the project.  This work has direct applications to problems faced by practitioners in the financial industry, including pension funds managers.  The second part of the project is a study of systemic risk and mathematical analysis of the stability (or instability) of our banking system.  The recent financial crisis has revealed a lack of understanding of the risk of cascade of defaults in banking networks.  To help assess measures of such systemic risks, the investigator develops and analyzes new stochastic games models of borrowing and lending among banks.  A graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher are engaged in the project each year.  This project, including its training component, contributes to the effort started by the regulators in the recent creation of the Office of Financial Research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In the first part of the project, the investigator establishes new results in the theory of asymptotic analysis and homogenization of nonlinear partial partial differential equations, with direct applications to several important and practical problems in financial mathematics.  These problems include risk management under uncertain volatility, portfolio optimization under stochastic volatility, and investment with co-integrated assets.  In the second part of the project, he studies stochastic games models of inter-bank borrowing and lending with applications to measures of systemic risk.  New mathematical problems arise naturally; they include backward-forward stochastic partial differential equations and stochastic games with delay.  A graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher are engaged in the project each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was in two parts:  (1) Developing asymptotic methods for nonlinear problems arising in financial mathematics,  (2) Advancing a program of research in the area of systemic risk in financial markets.  Intellectual Merit:  For the first part, the PI and his graduate students have succeeded in establishing an accurate approximation for the price of an option in a model where volatility is uncertain and varying between stochastic bounds. This approximation reduces considerably the calibration complexity as well as the size of the computation. Approximation formulas have also been obtained for the problem of portfolio optimization under stochastic volatility models. These formulas and their accuracy are important for designing near-optimal portfolios and the corresponding strategies. A study of this problem within rough volatility models driven by fractional Brownian motions has been started and is part of our current and future research.   In the second part, the PI and his collaborators have developed a practical model of inter-bank borrowing and lending where banks try to minimize their costs while satisfying stability criteria imposed by the regulators. Nash equilibria have been identified for this stochastic game by use of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Partial Differential Equations. Mean Field Games limits of this model, as the number of banks becomes large, have also been studied allowing for explicit formulas. In another direction, the PI and his collaborators have introduced a new class of Systemic Risk Measures based on acceptance sets and scenario-dependent allocations. This approach is novel and led to a very interesting notion of fairness of risk allocations, a central issue in ranking financial institutions according to their systemic riskiness.   Broader Impacts:  Understanding volatility behavior and optimal investments strategies is of prime interest to mutual fund managers in charge of a considerable amount of money in retirement saving accounts. New tools for describing and measuring systemic risk of the banking system have been proposed and presented to the regulators.  The research has been published in top international journals in the field, numerous plenary talks have been given in conferences, and four graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow supported by the grant have been trained in these areas of research.
