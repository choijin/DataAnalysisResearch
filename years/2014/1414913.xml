<AbstractNarration>Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are microscopic organisms with important implications in environmental sciences, magnetism, medicine, and biotechnology among other fields. These bacteria are of interest because of their complex membrane structure and their ability to form tiny magnets inside their cells. To make the magnets, MTB use iron present in their habitat. When the magnets are formed and become enclosed in a membrane, they are called magnetosomes. The latter allow MTB to navigate along Earth's magnetic field. The transport of iron from the environment to the cell is not well understood. This research will study the bacterial cell membrane using high-resolution microscopy.  This technology will allow the analysis of the cell membrane to better understand the transport of iron from the environment into the cell, and the formation of the magnetosomes. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Yoshihiro Fukumori, an expert on MTB and microscopy analysis at Kanazawa University. The knowledge gained through this study will provide insight about the bacterial membranes that will benefit the aforementioned disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this study is to visualize and analyze cell membrane structural dynamics of MTB. This will be achieved by studying Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1, or M. magneticum MS-1, using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). High-speed AFM has provided new opportunities in microbiology for studying single cells and molecules in a near-native state. This research will provide important information about the complexity of Gram-negative cell membrane and insight about processes like binding, diffusion, drug resistance, transport, and osmotic pressure. The images will be stored in university servers and permission for their use can be requested from the investigators. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has provided new opportunities in microbiology for studying single cells and molecules in a near-native state.  In AFM, a sharp tip is scanned over the surface of a sample; the interaction force between the tip and the sample is measured, and recorded as three-dimensional images (Dufr&ecirc;ne, 2008).  This technique has been widely used to image biomolecules including antibodies, cells, membranes, proteins and nucleic acids (Henderson, 1994; Oestreicher, et al., 2012; Prozorov et al., 2007; San Paulo, et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2010) because of its ability to visualize biological specimens without the need for a vacuum and freezing.  Furthermore, it can provide information about cell-wall elasticity, and measure cellular interactions such as adhesion and biofilm formation (Lower et al., 2005; Lower et al., 2001).  The objective of this study was to visualize and analyze cell membrane structural dynamics of Gram positive bacteria.  This was achieved by isolating Bacillus subtilis from natto, and visualizing it using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM).  Briefly, bacterial cells were grown in LB medium, collected during exponential growth phase, and treated following the method by Yamashita et al., (2012).  Subsequently, cells were analyzed using the HS-AFM.  This instrument has an improved performance (i.e., higher imaging rate).  This allows visualizing the structure dynamics, and processes of biological molecules directly in physiological solutions at sub-second resolution without affecting the moleculeÆs function (Ando et al., 2013; Ushihashi, and Ando, 2012).  The images were analyzed with the AFM software, and stored in the lab server.  The cells had a rod shape which is characteristic of the genus Bacillus. The height and width were measured vertically along the axis to estimate cell diameter.  The images revealed small particles in the surface of the cell. These particles will be further examined by both molecular techniques and additional microscopy analysis.  The results from this project have provided valuable information about Gram positive cells.  To our knowledge, this is the first time that B. subtilis has been imaged and analyzed using HS-AFM.     References:  Ando et al, 2013 Annu. Rev. Biophys 42:393-414.  Dufr&ecirc;ne, 2008 Nat. Rev.
