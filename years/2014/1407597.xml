<AbstractNarration>This project will carry out experiments to study the performance of advanced strategies for adaptive optics, a cutting-edge modern technology that uses fast-moving deformable mirrors to rapidly compensate for the fluctuations in image quality produced by the shimmering atmosphere.  Adaptive optics has flourished in recent years, delivering dramatically sharper images but usually only over a rather limited portion of the sky.  The technical innovations to be investigated under this program will utilize multiple deformable mirrors optically matched to different layers of the turbulent atmosphere, and this "multi-conjugate" approach will result in high-quality corrected images over a substantially larger region of the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adaptive optics system at the 1.6 meter solar telescope at Big Bear, CA, has delivered high-quality solar images in a single-deformable-mirror mode, providing detailed information about complex spatial structures on the surface of the sun at unprecedented spatial scales.  The system features three deformable mirrors, each having 357 actuators, and multiple pupil positions in which the deformable mirrors may be placed.  When considering the more complex architecture of an adaptive optics system capable of a multi-conjugate observing mode, a number of technical issues have yet to be addressed.  These issues include such fundamental questions as the optimum placement in the beam train of deformable mirrors and wavefront sensors.  The current project will address these issues directly, experimentally. A number of science goals, including the onset and evolution of solar flares, flare triggering mechanisms, and magnetic reconnection events, require diffraction-limited observations over the large field of view promised by the multi-conjugate observing mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing training for the next generation of instrumentation scientists, these investigations by their potentially path-finding nature will provide a vital form of broader impacts in advancing the art of adaptive optics at many observatories, for both solar and night-time observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Correction of atmospheric turbulence by adaptive optics (AO) has brought about a revolution in daytime and nighttime astronomy.  For studies of the Sun, every major solar observatory is equipped with an AO system characterized by a single deformable (DM) that changes shape more than a hundred times a second to compensate for atmospheric turbulence in a small area at the center of the field of view (FOV).   The signal to rapidly re-shape the DM is derived from a wavefront sensor (WFS) that measures the wavefront many hundreds of times a second and this information is processed in real-time to guide the changes in the DM.  The WFS locks onto some feature on the Sun that is slowly evolving compared to the terrestrial atmosphere?s turbulence and this "guide region" (or guide star in nighttime astronomy) may be regarded as stable and is updated every few minutes.  This technology has been gradually, but steadily improving over the last twenty years, or so.  However, single DM AO is inadequate for the scientific issues the Sun presents us.  The dynamical action on the Sun is rapid and typically covers a wider field than a single DM can correct and this precludes collecting observational data required to understand things like the origin of explosive events on the Sun that can effect satellites, telecommunication networks, power grids, etc. in what is broadly called  "space weather".       Our ATI effort was to create multi-conjugate AO (MCAO), which enables thre requisite wide field AO correction with a rapid temporal cadence.   Our system used three DMs and nine simultaneous guide regions to correct atmospheric turbulence over a field several times wider than with a single DM so as to capture fuller elements of rapid solar dynamics.  Each of the three DMs covers a different altitude range in the Earth?s atmosphere so that there is, for the first time, a reasonably complete detection and correction of turbulence over all altitudes in the Earth?s atmosphere over a fairly wide field (see Figure 1).  Our MCAO system is called "Clear" .  For details, images and movies about Clear, see https://cuna.nso.edu/clear .  The MCAO pathfinder, Clear, on the New Solar Telescope in Big Bear Lake has provided the first-ever MCAO-corrected observations of the Sun that show a clearly and visibly widened corrected field of view compared to quasi-simultaneous observations with classical adaptive optics (CAO) correction with a single DM (again see Figure 1).  In A&amp;A (v. 597, L8, 2017) and in https://cuna.nso.edu/clear , one can see a rough trebling of the corrected FOV in a rapid switching from single DM AO to MCAO.  This result is repeatable.     This success is a tour-de-force with available hardware and will be a key instrument for exploring in the Sun from Big Bear to address many basic questions that have eluded observational answers.  Further, the technologies developed here will be of great benefit to other solar telescopes, especially the 4-m DKIST solar telescope now under construction in Hawaii.  Still, many questions remain to be answered, but our stunning success with this pathfinder instrument, Clear, is a great step forward.      In the process of this work, three young scientists have made significant contributions and are poised for leadership positions.  Dirk Schmidt has managed the team and is responsible for the control system, Jose Marino is responsible for the simulations and Nicolas Gorceix for the optical engineering.
