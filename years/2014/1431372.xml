<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this Rapid Research Award (RAPID) study is to identify the feasibility of using natural fibers and bio-degradable synthetic fibers in conjunction with microbial calcite to control airborne dusts caused by wind erosion through field tests.  The long-term goal is to apply this technology for the reduction of the spread of global desertification that is being occurred in many parts around the world.  The field tests are therefore planned to be conducted in desert environments, including two control sites, two sites with sand mixed with different amount of medium only without bacteria, two sites with sand mixed with different amount of medium containing bacteria, and four sites with sand mixed with different amount of medium containing bacteria and natural or bio-degradable synthetic fibers.  Detailed field instrumentation will identify the weight loss per unit surface area of desert sand by measuring the average sand surface elevation change over a period of approximately four months.  Relative effectiveness of utilizing medium, bacteria, and fibers will then be evaluated through a quantitative analysis of weight losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust suppression has been one of the most critical problems associated with construction earthwork, quarries, open pit mining, unpaved roads, landfills, etc.  Currently available methods of dust suppression are predominantly chemical or mechanical.  By virtue, they are known to be associated with certain health and environmental problems.  Effective but safe dust control method will therefore have significant positive impacts in many ways. This study introduces a new, advanced and innovative approach for dust suppression that is environmentally safe and friendly.  Eventually, the developed technology is expected to be used to reduce the spread of desertification that is currently being occurred in many parts around the world.  Results of this study may also provide an important inroad for many difficult engineering problems that have challenged engineers, including the expedition of soil consolidation, improvement of extremely soft soils, reduction of soil permeability, containment of contaminated aquifers, etc., using bio-based geotechnology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of this study was to assess the field performance of a noble soil remediation technique utilizing microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) with fibers through a pilot-scale field application.  Two types of fibers were used: synthetic fibers and biodegradable synthetic polymer fibers.  Specifically, the field performance of the fiber reinforced MICP was monitored using a custom-assembled electronic instrumentation system on desert sand in Kuwait.  Results of laboratory and field experiments indicate that MICP is certainly an effective means of reducing the wind erosion of sandy soils and, furthermore, the use of MICP in combination with various types of fibers may increase the efficiency of MICP to a higher level.    The broader impacts resulting from this study will be immediate and substantial due to the fact that the development of effective and environmentally safe methods for reduction of wind erosion has been one of the most prime interests among many scientists and engineers.  For application in much wider areas, special techniques of mixing and/or spraying may have to be developed.  In addition, field application of MICP needs to accompany an establishment of surface vegetation that can survive in arid environments.  With this combination, immediate wind erosion resistance can be provided by MICP.  As time passes and the effectiveness of MICP diminishes, the role of resistance against the wind erosion is gradually passed on to the vegetation.
