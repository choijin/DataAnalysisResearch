<AbstractNarration>This award to the National Academies will provide partial support for the core activities of the Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy (COSEPUP). COSEPUP has a charge 'to deliberate on initiatives for new studies in the area of science and technology policy, taking especially into account the concerns and requests of the President's Science Advisor, the Director of the NSF, the Chairman of the National Science Board, and the chairmen of key science and technology-related committees of the Congress.' Its work has addressed issues of critical importance to Federal Agencies and the Nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key issues that COSEPUP is addressing or has recently addressed include maintaining the excellence of human resources for U.S. science and engineering research, promoting effective management of U.S. federal research investments, and ensuring research integrity and the responsible conduct of research. Since its inception, the National Science Foundation has supported COSEPUP activities. This award will provide funds for core support of COSEPUP, to continue its work as an independent advisor on issues relating to national science and technology policy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

In late July 2020, the Academies' Intelligence Community Studies Board launched, in collaboration with COSEMPUP, a new study on the Intelligence Community and the Science and Technology Research Environment.   In the fall of 2020, the Academies' Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy and Committee on Science, Technology, and Law, in collaboration with COSEMPUP, launched a study on Protecting Critical Technologies for National Security in an Era of Openness and Competition.   At the request of National Academy of Sciences President Marcia McNutt, COSEMPUP assisted with the development of a mission statement for a proposed Strategic Council for Research Integrity.  The Council would be convened to assist in safeguarding the health and welfare and elevating the excellence of the whole research enterprise.   The committee is engaged in ongoing discussions with NSF, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and National Institutes of Health leadership in discussions about policies, strategies, and tools to mitigate against potential threats to U.S. national security and economic leadership.  Section 1746 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116- 92) charged the Academies to convene a standing national science, technology, and security roundtable.  This roundtable was established in September 2020 and will provide, for a period of five years, a neutral venue where individuals from the national intelligence and law enforcement communities can meet with representatives from industry and the academic research community to discuss current threats, benefits, and potential risks.
