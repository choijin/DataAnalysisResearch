<AbstractNarration>This I-Corps team has developed a wireless indoor tracking technology, and its unique properties will enable a plethora of new applications in many different areas including intelligent home automation, location based security, sports training, fine-grained indoor navigation, robotics, digital arts, education, entertainment systems, and body motion tracking for biomedical applications and film making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existing local wireless tracking techniques are computing and resource intensive, provide a limited tracking speed, and require a line-of-sight (LOS) channel for achieving a reasonable spatial resolution. The wireless tracking technique proposed is unique because of its non-line-of-sight (NLOS) capability, low power requirement, and excellent spatial and temporal resolutions make it an excellent candidate for an intuitive 3D man-machine interface in different applications including home automation, security, robotics and entertainment systems. Mobile smart devices penetrated the market largely because of their intuitive and easy-to-use 2D touch-screen interface; however, the industry is badly looking for an intuitive 3D user interface solution for maximizing user experience and market expansion. The proposed technology will provide a solution for a truly natural, intuitive, and immersive 3D user interface.</AbstractNarration>

The team also got a $50,000 matching grant from Elevate Ventures. During the course of the project, the team has successfully developed a series of prototypes including hardware, firmware, software development kit (SDK), and example mobile virtual reality apps. The latest prototype provides a high positional tracking accuracy (&lt;1mm), a high tracking speed (&gt;100 positional readings per second), a low power consumption (&lt;50mW for receiver), a low latency (&lt;20msec), and a wide tracking range (3 ~ 5 meters). The prototype is completely untethered and powered by a USB battery, which is crucial for mobile applications. The prototype supports both Bluetooth and USB links. The developed software development kit (SDK) supports a wide range of platforms including Windows, Android, and Unity. An example mobile VR app incorporating the user&rsquo;s head and hand positions as inputs has been developed. The team presented the prototype and the example mobile VR app to several leading mobile virtual reality (VR) headset and 3D motion capture system manufacturers.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/11/2016<br>      Modified by: Byunghoo&nbsp;Jung</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1439535/1439535_10301627_1457728837423_Screenshot2016-03-1115.36.19--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1439535/1439535_10301627_1457728837423_Screenshot2016-03-1115.36.19--rgov-800width.jpg" title="3D Input System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1439535/1439535_10301627_1457728837423_Screenshot2016-03-1115.36.19--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="3D Input System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">3D input system for mobile virtual reality.The system consists of a transmitter, a tracking module, and a paired computing unit (mobile phone).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mohit Singh and Byunghoo Jung</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Byunghoo&nbsp;Jung</div> <div class="imageTitle">3D Input System</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
