<AbstractNarration>The rapid biodiversity change in North America has significant effects on essential ecosystem services, from impact on soil health and nutrient cycling, to agriculture, forestry and water quality. Exploding populations of invasive species threaten fresh water and terrestrial habitats and potentially impact the natural resources of the nation. Easy access to robust, expertly vetted baseline data for species occurrences, abundances, and distribution ranges, and monitoring how these parameters have changed through time, will facilitate the protection of the nation's natural resources, and vastly improve the capacity for effective restoration, land management planning, and conservation management.  Numerous undergraduate students will receive training in digitization technologies and a modular exhibit will be developed to engage public interest in biodiversity changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective monitoring requires easy electronic access to historical specimen baseline information for temporal and regional species diversity comparisons that can facilitate informed land management decisions. Vast amounts of specimen data are housed within the nation's natural history collections, but most of these data are not readily accessible from digital resources. Size and complexity of scientific specimen collections require major technological advances in capturing specimen data. The goal of this four-year collaborative project is the rapid digitization of  &gt;2 million specimens and their locality data from ten arthropod and mollusk collections housed at six major US museums in six states (Il, OH, AL,MI, DE, PA). This project will significantly automate specimen data capture by utilizing optical character and voice-recognition technologies. The digitized data from this project will be immediately deployed for habitat-based distribution modeling and analyses.This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The rapid ongoing change in North American continental biodiversity has significant impacts on all constituent ecosystems, from terrestrial to aquatic.  Understanding the scope of that change requires a high-resolution picture of preexisting biodiversity levels and natural history museum collections contain that information.  The TCN "InvertEBase: Reaching back to see the future: species-rich invertebrate faunas document causes and consequences of biodiversity shifts" is a collaborative effort to digitize specimen records from ten arthropod and mollusk collections housed at six major US museums in six states: Field Museum of Natural History, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Auburn University Museum of Natural History, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, Delaware Museum of Natural History, and Frost Entomological Museum at Pennsylvania State University. The shared goal of all InvertEBase participants was rapid data entry and networking of georeferenced locality data to form a solid foundation for distribution mapping and to examine change over time due to large scale perturbations.   The UMMZ mollusk collection (5 million specimens) houses extremely important NA freshwater and land snail collections, with excellent taxonomic and geographic coverage. A large fraction of the freshwater lots predate the major wave of extirpation and extinction associated with 20th century watershed industrialization, making these specimen records essential for this TCN’s theme. The UMMZ Insect Collection (~7 million total) is centered on NA, especially the Great Lakes region, with in-depth sampling from 1904 onwards.     Over the whole grant period from 2014 to 2019, almost 110,000 mollusk specimen records were newly entered, more than 11,000 lots were imaged, and 33% of the total localities in the UMMZ mollusk database were georeferenced. This was a collective effort involving a total of 53 participating students: 6 graduate, 45 undergraduate and 2 high school students.  Currently, more than 160,000 mollusk specimen records are available through a number of portals including iDigBio (164,380), GBIF (164,768; 45% with coordinates) and invertEBase (105,094;  10% with images).  In addition, almost 290,000 insect records were migrated to iDigBio (287,300) to GBIF (288,321) and to SCAN Symbiota (285,758) portals.  These new online records afford easy access to robust, expertly vetted baseline data for species occurrences, abundances, and distribution ranges, and monitoring how these parameters have changed through time, will facilitate the protection of the nation's natural resources, and vastly improve the capacity for effective restoration, land management planning and conservation management.
