<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes improving the transportation planning process through better and more frequent data. An integral part of transportation planning at the federal, state, regional, and local levels of government involves testing infrastructure, policy, or population changes with travel demand models. Improved travel demand models enable more accurate predictions and more efficient funding to achieve important regional transportation goals, such as decreasing congestion on a specific corridor, enhancing regional economic growth, improving safety, and attainment of air quality standards. Unfortunately household travel surveys, the backbone data for these models, are increasingly expensive. They are so prohibitively expensive that sample sizes typically represent less than 0.5% of the population, and they are only collected about every ten years. Furthermore, only 5-10% of households respond to surveys, creating a significant nonresponse bias. This SBIR Phase I project aims to create a replacement for traditional household travel surveys with up-to-date, inexpensive, readily available, and representative data. The goal is to transform the practice of travel and urban modeling, helping the nation achieve important transportation and infrastructure goals for the future.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine whether synthetic household travel data can be created by combining targeted marketing (i.e. consumer) data and anonymous mobile phone data from many different sources to create realistic synthetic household travel data for a full population in such a way that individual privacy is protected while near real-time travel data is provided to decision-makers. The process will use statistical weighting, imputation, simulation, and data fusion techniques to create synthetic household travel data at a fraction of the cost of current survey-based data collection methods. By fusing data together to create inexpensive, up-to-date, and detailed synthetic household travel data at regular intervals for nearly 100% of the population, researchers and decision-makers alike will be far better equipped to make important transportation decisions that affect our lives each day.</AbstractNarration>

Federal funding is often tied to these travel forecasting models to demonstrate that an infrastructure project or policy is worthy of its required investment. To build the travel forecasts, household travel surveys (HHTSs) are typically conducted.  Since the 1940s, HHTSs have been used to collect demographic and socioeconomic information that are linked with individual travel behavior. The surveys ask detailed questions about each person in a household (including children) like age, gender, education, relationship to family structure, and employment status; they ask for household data like income and number of vehicles; and they also ask each person in the household to fill out a travel diary. The travel "diary" describes a personÆs sequence of trips over 24 or 48 hours, detailing exactly when, why, where, and how a person travels. Traditional HHTSs have evolved from paper-based to computer network assisted and GPS- or smartphone-based surveys.  However, HHTS have low sample sizes (&lt;1%), very low response rates (&lt;5%), significant sampling biases, very large gaps between surveys (~10 years), and most importantly a prohibitively high cost ($300-350 per household). Even more, newer forecasting methods attempt to capture a higher level of detail, thereby requiring an even more onerous and invasive survey with lower response rates. However, due to the strong statistical link between oneÆs demographic and socioeconomic information and their travel behavior, which is important for forecasting, transportation engineers and planners continue to collect HHTSs.

The results obtained from this project indicate that our SynHHTD replicate travel behavior as effectively as a traditional survey does with a 95% decrease in cost per household. The systematic data synthesizing process results in a significant increase in data frequency and timeliness as well. The next step in our development is to extend the synthesis process to implement visitor travel behavior and household travel dynamics (particula...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
