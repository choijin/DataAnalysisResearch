<AbstractNarration>Vahedi Tafreshi, Hooman / Chase, George &lt;br/&gt;1402655 / 1402336 &lt;br/&gt;Virginia Commonwealth University / University of Akron &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient removal of finely dispersed droplets from gases or immiscible fluids is crucially important in a vast variety of applications such as diesel fuel purification to prevent corrosion and engine damage, pollution control for environmental protection and our health and safety, efficient water management in fuel cells, and even fog collection for water harvesting, among many others. Understanding the dynamics, coalescence, and migration of liquid droplets is the fundamental knowledge required for the proper design of liquid-liquid and liquid-gas separation fibrous media. As the physics of droplets coalescing on fibers of different wettability is highly complicated, the existing droplet separation media are generally manufactured through a series of inefficient and expensive trial-and-error processes. This proposal is a combined experimental-computational study to develop a generalized theory to describe the coalescence and movement of droplets on a fiber and between fibers, and thereby provide a more accurate method of designing liquid-liquid and liquid-gas separation media. The proposed research is a coupled multiscale-simulation-multiscale-experiment approach that 1) circumvents the need for excessive computational power, and 2) allows studying the physics of the problem at a fundamental level while producing an applied theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this research will lead to the creation of enabling knowledge to design coalescing fibrous media based on engineering science, rather than trial-and-error. Educated design of droplet separation media can lead to significant savings in energy costs and the costs associated with pollution control. This work involves multiple students from K-12 through graduate. Students from underrepresented minorities will be recruited to participate in the proposed research program. Videos and images of droplet motions on fibers from experiments and models will be made available to the public for educational use. Educational materials will also be developed and incorporated into new graduate/undergraduate courses on multiphase transport in porous materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fundamentals of interactions of droplets with solid surfaces are well documented in literature.  In physics, for example, the Young?s Laplace equation relates the pressure difference across a gas-liquid interface and the curvature of the surface.  Young?s equation for surface wetting relates the surface tension and the contact angle of the drop on the surface.  Such relations are well understood and are easily applied in systems with simple geometries.  Many practical systems have complicated geometries for which the physics of interactions of drops with solid surfaces are not as well understood or modeled.  This project focused on interactions between drops and fibers.  Potential applications include separations of drops from gas or immiscible liquid flow streams for material purification, process control, environmental protection, health and safety, and water harvesting (from fog).  This work was a collaboration between two universities, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and the University of Akron (UA).  The intellectual merit of this work was the combination of computer simulations and experiments used to predict and observe drop shapes and drop motions on fiber structures of increasing complexity.  Drops were observed on single fibers, at the junction of two crossed fibers, on the surface of woven fiber mats, and in the depth of 3-D fiber mats.  Drops were induced to move by drag flow of air or an immiscible liquid.  Correlations were deduced for drag coefficients and minimum flow conditions (minimum Reynolds number) for initiating drop movement. Long term these results will be used to improve models to predict drop movement in or on fiber materials.  The broader impact of this research was the creation of greater understanding of movements of drops on fibers.  These results are expected to lead to improved engineered design of drop-fiber systems, such as coalescing filters, based on engineering science, rather than trial-and-error. Educated design of such media should lead to significant savings in development costs and operational (energy) costs. This work involved multiple students from k&ndash;12 through graduate.
