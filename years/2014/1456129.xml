<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research effort will study magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling through a coordinated campaign of observations and modeling using the Poker Flat Incoherent-Scatter Radar (PFISR), the Resolute Bay Incoherent-Scatter Radar (RISR), a variety of optical instruments, the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), the Homer Very High Frequency (VHF) radar, and the Global Ionospheric-Thermospheric Model (GITM).  The ionosphere, thermosphere, and magnetosphere comprise a tightly coupled system at high latitudes. The ionosphere is the mediating element in this view, facilitating the transfer of free energy generated by solar wind-magnetosphere coupling into heat and bulk motion of the neutral atmosphere. This mediation occurs through electric fields, particle precipitation, diffusion, and field-aligned currents, agents that act collectively to structure the plasma density and composition within the system. Although elements of this system have been studied in considerable detail, their nonlinear interactions, and the global implications of these regional processes, remains poorly understood and inadequately observed. The electronic steering capability of PFISR offers a unique diagnostic to fill this gap. Using a dense grid of beams, a three-dimensional, time dependent view of the ion-neutral interactions can be developed. These results, in coordination with observations by common volume optical, and VHF and HF radar observations, allow access to system dynamics and system responses which were previously unobservable. The experimental campaign, involving twenty researchers from nine institutions, will be carried out over two winter seasons. The results will be used to address fundamental questions of the physics of the upper atmosphere and its coupling to the magnetosphere and the lower atmosphere, which have remained obscured for lack of key data. As a result, although it is understood that small-scale processes play critically important roles in this coupling, they have been difficult to include in quantitative models. The new information will be implemented in the GITM model validating the new understanding of the coupled magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere, and thereby providing enhanced simulation capabilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PINOT project was a collaborative effort between many different institutions to use the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter radar along with supporting instrumentation to investigate the processes in the thermosphere, ionosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling regions.  The main objectives of our part of the project were to use simultaneous high-resolution low-light level imaging to observe the dynamic auroral structures that occur within the radar field of view.  In addition, the use of multiple imagers, each with different narrowband filters, allowed us to infer estimates of the precipitating electron characteristics.  Intellectual Merit: Investigating the auroral structures, we found that in some cases there is a correlation between ground magnetometer deflections and the optical phase of large-scale pulsating auroral structures.  This indicated that there are horizontal ionospheric currents associated with these pulsating auroral structures and therefore they must also have field-aligned currents associated with them.  In collaboration with other colleagues, we were part of an investigation of the development of the bead structure with the aurora just before substorm onset.  In addition, we used the optical auroral image data in conjunction with DMSP satellite overpasses to investigate the precipitating electron energy associated with different types of pulsating aurora and found the energies to be in the 3 keV to 20 keV range.  Under this project, we also had the opportunity to operate an imager at the HAARP ionospheric heater site, where we obtained excellent high resolution images of the artificial airglow created during ionospheric heating experiments.  Broader Impacts: This project provided an excellent opportunity to increase collaborations with colleagues in the radar and ionospheric heating community.  The calibrating of the imager data which was done in collaboration with a NASA sounding rocket campaign provided a part of the thesis for a graduate student and is published in JGR.  The main results of these projects have been published in the following artices.  Grubbs, G., II, R. Michell, M. Samara, D. Hampton, and J.-M.
