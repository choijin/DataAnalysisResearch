<AbstractNarration>This award funds work to study the physical and chemical processes involved in extrasolar planets, which are planets that orbit other stars.  The PI will focus on planets that are so close to their host star that much of their atmospheres are being blasted away by the star?s heat. The PI will also conduct public outreach, write briefs on exoplanet research for high school students, and train and mentor a graduate student in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bulk of this work focuses on thermal atmospheric escape that is driven by external irradiation. The PI and her team will generate a flexible framework for modeling thermal atmospheric escape over a range of planetary masses, radii, and environments. The researchers will then use this framework to generate easy-to-use expressions for escape from hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. These expressions will allow other researchers to translate the planetary and stellar properties of their favorite systems into (1) the physical regime in which atmospheric mass loss occurs, and (2) the mass-loss rate in that regime. This work will be accomplished through the expansion and application of an algorithm, created by the PI, to estimate thermal&lt;br/&gt;escape rates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the development of models of atmospheric escape from extrasolar planets that orbit close to their host stars and experience large fluxes of ionizing radiation.  This radiation heats the upper atmospheres of the planets, leading to atmospheric escape.  Using analytical and numerical techniques, the researchers investigated how much atmosphere is lost, the geometry of atmospheric outflows, and the observational signatures that may result from outflowing material for planets orbiting a range of different stars.     Escaping atmospheric gas has been observationally detected for several extrasolar planets.  These detections take advantage of the fact that once per orbital period, the planets pass in front of their host stars from the perspective of observers on Earth.  One important result of the work supported by this grant is that signatures of escaping gas may be observationally accessible over a longer time-baseline than the time when the planet itself is passing in front of the star.  Escaping gas is dense enough far from the planet to obscure the star in Lyman-alpha well before and/or well after transit.  The geometry of the outflow and hence of the obscuration signature is a strong function of the stellar wind that shapes the large scale structure of the outflowing gas.  This work will inform experimental design of future studies of outflowing atmospheres.  In the near future, as the TESS mission finds more nearby targets for observation and as a newly detected helium line that can be observed from the ground is explored, the prospects for statistical tests of atmospheric escape will be improved.  The work supported by this grant will enable upcoming tests of atmospheric outflow physics.  Understanding how atmospheric mass loss occurs is important for our understanding of the potential atmospheres of observed small planets, where atmospheric escape or the lack thereof is critical for shaping the atmospheres on which life may rely.   This grant supported the education of two graduate students and one undergraduate student.  Results were disseminated in published papers, conference and colloquium talks and posters, and talks for the general public.  Work by the PI on reducing sexual harassment in the field of astrophysics was supported by the broader impacts component of this grant.
