<AbstractNarration>Paleoclimate evidence shows that rainfall over heavily-populated regions of East Asia is susceptible to change.  Recent cave speleothem records from China going back a quarter of a million years convincingly show that the climate over East Asia underwent large and abrupt swings during this time period.  These oscillations occur at multiple timescales, from a few hundred to tens of thousands of years, and they are tied to distinct and varied forcings on the global climate system during Earth's climate history.  The standard interpretation of the speleothem records is that the East Asian summer monsoon intensified or diminished during these oscillations. However, this description is qualitative, and does not factor in the complex behavior of today's East Asian climate which exhibiting both abrupt temporal and spatial shifts as it progresses through the season, in particular from Spring to Meiyu rains, and from Meiyu to Summer rains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores the hypothesis that changes to the north-south position jet stream impinging on the Tibetan Plateau are the underlying cause of the abrupt climate changes in the past.  Emerging dynamical studies of the modern East Asian climate suggest that it is the latitudinal position of the jet relative to the Plateau that determines the rainfall seasonality -- when the jet is South of the Plateau, it is in a Spring rainfall regime; when it goes just North, then Meiyu; and when the jet goes well North of the Plateau, Summer. The hypothesis provides specific predictions that can be tested for different past climate scenarios, in particular during the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger events recorded in ice core records over Greenland; and changes to insolation from changes to the Earth's orbital configuration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jet transition hypothesis will be tested using three complementary approaches: &lt;br/&gt;i) Examination of the association between jet streams and East Asian rainfall changes in state-of-the art simulations of two particular past climate scenarios (mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum) by various modeling groups around the world;&lt;br/&gt;ii) Idealized climate model simulations using a high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model necessary for resolving the fine-scale features of East Asian climate;&lt;br/&gt;iii) Investigating the modern climate data and high-resolution simulations of 20th century climate to see if similar jet-rainfall relationships hold for climate changes over this historical period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves international collaborations with scientists from Taiwan and China, and supports a graduate student at UC Berkeley. Public lectures on paleoclimate changes (with focus on East Asia) will be offered at the Lawrence Hall of Science, using the "Science on a Sphere" (SOS) setup for climate data visualization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The densely populated region of East Asia is susceptible to large swings in the summer rainfall climate.  Much of the rainfall occurs in the early summer, where an organized rainband forms over East Asia and extending out into the western Pacific (figure 1).  Paleoclimate proxy records over East Asia in particular from cave oxygen isotopes also show large, rapid and sustained changes to the rainfall, suggesting that the same may be in store for future changes.  The underlying question is why the East Asian Summer Monsoon (hereafter EASM) is so 'tippy'.  We introduce a hypothesis that it is the configuration of westerly jet stream over Asia, modified the Tibetan Plateau, that is the reason for this sensitivity (figure 2). This is in contrast to the more traditional focus on the monsoonal flow.  The 'Jet Transition hypothesis' states that the latitude of the core westerlies relative to the Tibetan Plateau sets the intraseasonal stage of the EASM (Spring, pre-Meiyu, Meiyu, and Midsummer).  In the current seasonal evolution, the westerlies transition from south to north of the Plateau as summer progresses, and this results in a marked modification of the downstream circulation that impacts East Asia.  Loosely speaking, the Plateau acts as a fulcrum that levers relatively small changes to the westerlies to large changes in the circulation and rainfall over East Asia.    We explored a number of climate scenarios to test this hypothesis, ranging from paleoclimate to modern-day and future. In all instances examined, we found that the change in the East Asian summer rainfall was linked to changes in the westerlies.  For example, we found that Earth's orbital changes from precession led to an earlier seasonal northward jet migration during the early Holocene, and the timing of the EASM stages changed accordingly with a relatively short Meiyu period and earlier transition to Midsummer.  Our hypothesis was also able to explain apparently contradictory observations over central eastern China during the Younger Dryas that suggested enriched cave isotopes corresponded to wetter conditions, contrary to previous findings.  Our explanation was that the westerlies do not migrate as far north as in today's climate, and as a result there is a prolonged Meiyu stage and rainfall over central eastern China.  We also found an analog to this behavior in observed year-to-year variability, in that we showed the well-known 'tripole' mode of interannual rainfall variation resulted from variation in the timing and duration of the Meiyu stage, controlled by the jet.  We found that the westerlies play a key role in amplifying EASM rainfall extremes a future climate scenario.  Using a set of state-of-the-art simulations of the 21st century, we found a pronounced intensification of the June East Asian rainband by the late 21st century, with a doubling of the frequency of extreme rainfall over southeastern China (figure 3).  This intensification is caused by a delay in the northward transition of the westerly jet off the Plateau; the jet impinging on the Plateau creates atmospheric circulation conditions downstream that intensifies the rainband.  We also showed that the rainband intensifies in a similar fashion after an El Nino event, thus demonstrating the validity of the mechanism we proposed.   Finally, we explored the climate dynamics basis of our hypothesis. We showed that the termination of the Meiyu stage was controlled by the position of the westerlies at the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, around 40N; when the jet migrates off the Plateau, the influence of the Plateau on the westerlies weaken, and the Meiyu stage terminates.  We generalized this finding to explain the entire sequence of intraseasonal stages of the EASM, linking each stage to a specific configuration of the westerlies relative to the Plateau.  The extratropical northerly winds generated by the westerly interaction with the Plateau topography plays a key role in setting up the intraseasonal stage and associated rainfall pattern.  The project trained a number of young climate scientists, including three UC Berkeley undergraduates who have since gone on to graduate studies in climate science.  It  formed the basis of the dissertation project of a female graduate student who has since graduated with her Ph.D. and is continuing in the field as a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA.  It also facilitated collaboration with paleoclimate scientists from China and the US, and with climate modelers in the US, Taiwan and Germany.  The project contributed to the publication of 13 manuscripts, of which 4 were led by the PI and 3 by the graduate student.  The PI and the graduate student have also given a number of talks at various venues on this work.  The PI has additionally given public talks on the global climate every year using the "Science-on-the-Sphere" housed at the Lawrence Hall of Science, and in particular using a visualization of a climate change scenario developed by one of the undergraduates on this project.
