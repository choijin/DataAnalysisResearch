<AbstractNarration>The Modeling Hydrologic Systems in Elementary Science (MoHSES) project involves research and development to investigate 3rd-grade students' model-based reasoning about hydrologic systems and how teachers scaffold students' engagement in modeling practices.  The research builds upon existing modeling frameworks to guide the development and integration of a long-term conceptual modeling task into the Full Option Science System (FOSS) Water module. The participants in the study include ten 3rd-grade elementary teachers recruited from diverse settings. The team utilizes an extensive classroom observation system, in-depth interviews with students and teachers, and student artifacts to investigate the following research questions: (1) How do 3rd-grade students construct, use, evaluate, and revise conceptual models of groundwater systems to reason about geospheric components of the water cycle? (2) Are 3rd-grade students able to construct more scientifically-accurate models of groundwater cycling over time? (3) What instructional strategies do 3rd-grade teachers use to support students' model-based reasoning about groundwater systems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research can help build a foundation in model-based reasoning about complex global environmental and scientific phenomena in early learners. Investigations of elementary students' model-based reasoning about the water cycle, are largely absent from the literature. The data collected from this project can help inform science curriculum materials development and elementary teacher preparation efforts designed to foster reform-oriented, model-centered elementary science learning environments. This research also informs the development of learning progressions that account for elementary students' learning within a core component of the Earth Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Modeling Hydrologic Systems in Elementary Science (MoHSES) exploratory Discovery Research K-12 project, funded by the National Science Foundation, involved research and development to investigate elementary teaching and learning about water.  Over its 5-year lifespan, project activities directly impacted 15 3rd-grade teachers and an estimated 1200 3rd-grade students, as well as two science education Ph.D. students.  The MoHSES project resulted in the development of an enhanced, freely-available version of the 6-week FOSS Water unit that supports elementary students to engage in scientific modeling.  It also contributed to the development of an empirically-grounded learning performances framework aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  Project research and methods have been disseminated through 12 articles and book chapters and over 25 conference presentations.  This research has illustrated benefits of various curricular and instructional approaches to supporting 3rd-grade students? use of models to reason about water.  Project findings have also provided evidence for how elementary teachers conceptualize and engage in instruction that fosters scientific modeling in 3rd-grade classrooms.  Most importantly, project research documents the positive, comparative impact of the revised version of the Water unit on 3rd-grade students? model-based explanations about water systems.  Overall, the MoHSES project has afforded novel science education innovation in elementary science learning environments and a foundation for future work supporting early learners? 3-dimensional science learning.
