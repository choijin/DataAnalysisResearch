<AbstractNarration>Excessive alcohol use and alcohol use disorders are a leading public health concern in the U.S. Several vulnerable groups of youth are at elevated risk for mental health symptoms and alcohol use due to their unique experiences and backgrounds. Despite identifying the elevated risk for excessive alcohol use among vulnerable young adults, researchers have yet to understand how modifiable interpersonal (relationship with peers and parents) and contextual (school environment and safety) factors influence their alcohol use. Consequently, there are large gaps in the available research regarding how indicators of risk and protective factors differ between youth groups. Despite the current disparities research documenting the elevated risk of youth alcohol use, studies do not provide adequate information for the development of targeted prevention and intervention strategies that address alcohol use among vulnerable young adults. Thus, opportunities to tailor prevention and intervention strategies to best meet the needs of this at-risk population are missed. Consequently, studies are needed that capture the rich and unique between- and within-group experiences that characterize the lives of t vulnerable populations to determine how these modifiable factors contribute to their short- and long-term alcohol use. The current project applies a multidisciplinary approach to address the current alcohol use disparities present among vulnerable youth groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the above issue, this project: (1) identifies modifiable interpersonal and contextual factors associated with alcohol use; (2) evaluates modifiable interpersonal and contextual factors unique that contribute to elevated levels of alcohol use; and (3) conducts focus groups with selected subpopulations to analyze, critique, and discuss empirical findings from Aims 1 and 2 to help inform prevention and intervention strategies targeting young adult alcohol use. Results identify amendable influences associated with youth alcohol use disparities. Further, findings from within-group studies provide a greater understanding of the factors unique to these groups that contribute to elevated levels of alcohol use. Using advanced longitudinal statistical techniques, the current project progresses the extant literature forward by: (1) expanding the prevalence research to identify how factors influence alcohol use among subpopulations of vulnerable youth groups; (2) assessing these factors in a developmental context by evaluating their influence over time as they transition to young adulthood; and (3) focusing on previously ignored within-group differences that contribute to alcohol use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the current study are used to produce translational research for youth and family program providers, education officials, the general public and other outlets for applied use. Further, findings from these studies aid in the development of community-based prevention and intervention strategies targeting vulnerable young adult alcohol use. In addition, since this project is a postdoctoral Fellowship award, it provides the PI (Fellow) significant professional development opportunities under the mentorship of a reputable senior scholar at the Univeraity of Arizona.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Excessive alcohol use and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a leading public health concern.  Sexual minority youth (SMY; lesbian/gay, bisexual, and queer/questioning [LGBQ+]) are at elevated risk for alcohol use due to their unique experiences as sexual minorities (e.g., discrimination, victimization).  Findings from this study extended this knowledge by testing the prevalence and contribution factors of sexual-orientation-related disparities in alcohol use. Due to the acquisition of another funding source, the award was terminated after one year; however, the work done during the first year of the award was foundational for projects that were later completed, including:  A comprehensive review article on the mental health lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth that highlight health prevention and promotion strategies from the individual to the population level. An examination of how unique patterns of sexual orientation development were related to risk and timing of risk for alcohol use and poor mental health across the transition to adulthood. Findings identified developmentally-situated prevention and service recommendations and supported two previously conflicting theoretical models of sexual identity development. Identifying distinct profiles of family, peer, and school support and how they relate to alcohol use and mental health among sexual minority youth. Results emphasize the importance of fostering support for sexual minority youth across contexts (i.e., school, family, friends) to improve their mental health and deter substance use. A study that identified patterns of alcohol use behavior and sexual orientation differences in the initiation, accelerations, and persistence of alcohol use across the transition to adulthood.  Findings suggest that sexual minority women espouse riskier drinking profiles during the transition to adulthood and are less likely to discontinue heavy alcohol use during the twenties and early thirties relative to their heterosexual female peers. An investigation of whether mischievous responses in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adulthood compromised the integrity of the data and studies testing sexual-orientation-related health disparities among youth.  The results repudiate commentary regarding the presence of mischievous responding among sexual minority youth and subsequently validate previous findings and future use of these data. The preliminary data analysis for projects that test the invariance of a 3-item alcohol use measure across age (13 to 31), gender, race/ethnicity, college attendance, and sexual orientation. Findings demonstrate the importance of testing the validity and reliability of alcohol use measures across groups who display differences in alcohol use and during the transition to adulthood.   Together, findings provide important knowledge about (1) sexual-orientation-related alcohol use disparities, (2) how these disparities emerge and change across the transition to adulthood, (3) factors that contribute to these alcohol-related disparities, and (4) methodological approaches to studying alcohol use across key groups and time.
