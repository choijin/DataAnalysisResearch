<AbstractNarration>This project enhances research collaboration at Vassar College through the implementation of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.  The IAM supports access to and security of distributed scientific research efforts and other applications with broader impacts. Vassar researchers are actively engaged in collaborative intra- and extramural multidisciplinary research, and these projects regularly collect and exchange data with research collaborators and teams at other institutions in Virtual Organizations (VOs).  Vassar College researchers were previously challenged to create and manage the identities, groups and permissions crucial to these VOs, and the largely manual nature of the processes required to create and administer a research project was becoming an impediment to the actual research itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IAM 1) provides an automated system that provides centralized management of science research VOs in support of distributed science research; 2) enhances inter-institutional research collaboration allowing researchers to use their campus login to access resources at partner institutions; 3) positions researchers to leverage external resources for greater science research collaboration such as Internet2 and other Research and Education (R&amp;E) Networks and 4) enables wider use of existing directory services by an array of science research tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This grant project sought to redesign the Identity and Access Management (IAM) tools and services at Vassar College to better support research and collaboration among Vassar faculty and the broader national and global research communities they engage with.  The project transformed a largely homegrown and manual IAM approach to one that is mostly automated, fully featured and cloud-based. The new IAM solution provides centralized user registry and authentication services for the college and has enabled Vassar?s participation in federated services such as the InCommon federation and utilization of eduroam. The expansion of these services has reduced the administrative overhead required for visiting researchers to collaborate with Vassar faculty by adding functionality such as Sponsored Accounts, a process by which any community member can request a Vassar account for visiting researchers and professional colleagues for up to one year, and enabling visiting eduroam members to utilize WiFI at Vassar automatically. Vassar has benefited from these efforts in multiple ways including:  Defining the process and policies supporting the creation, use and decommissioning of Vassar accounts. Streamlining and automating much of the account activation and deactivation process. Reducing the time to onboard new employees once they have completed the HR onboarding process. Positioning Vassar to increasingly utilize federated authentication to research systems and data. Allowing for the use of Sponsored Accounts, by which researchers can sponsor access for visiting colleagues to collaborate with Vassar resources and data. Supporting the use of Chosen/Preferred Names, a keenly felt need by our international and LGTBQ community members.  Additionally, the Internet2 and the InCommon Security Certificate service have benefitted Computer Science researcher Dr. Nancy Ide?s Language Applications Grid (LAPPS) project, a collaborative project involving Vassar (NSF award no. 1147944), Brandeis, Carnegie Mellon, and the Linguistic Data Consortium at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Ides? team is next looking to leverage the InCommon federation authentication in an expansion of the LAPPS project to include European institutions, an approach that would have been much more difficult before these IAM efforts. Unfortunately, the programmatic negotiations for this effort have not completed as of the writing of this report, but it is likely this will be the first research focused multi-institutional Virtual Organization using these resources at Vassar.
