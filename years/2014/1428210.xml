<AbstractNarration>An award though the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant to Bates College provides funding to acquire a scanning confocal microscope with white light laser to expand teaching and research opportunities in fluorescence and interference-reflection microscopy. The confocal microscope will enhance and broaden microscopy applications available through the College's Imaging Center. The confocal will permit four research projects to collect novel data on a variety of important scientific questions across multiple disciplines, and be used on a semi-regular basis by five other faculty from Bates College and Bowdoin College in their research. In the classroom, confocal microscopy will become an immediate and integral tool in courses and be used in demonstrations in introductory physics and biology courses, affecting the education of more than 300 students per year. The microscope will also enhance Bates College's partnership with Southern Maine Community College by training and supporting the research of their faculty and students in workshop and research settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of novel research projects across multiple natural science fields, including developmental biology and toxicology, neuroscience and cell biology, physics, and chemistry, will be enabled by the confocal microscope. In particular: the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of two key structures in the zebrafish, the otic vesicle and the swim bladder, will be determined; the characterization of neurons involved in rhythmic motor behaviors will provide a comprehensive understanding of modulatory mechanisms of central pattern generator function across mollusks and other animals; the molecular photophysics of fluorophores used in localization-based nanoscopy will be examined to identify bright fluorophores with on/off switching properties that are optimal for live-cell imaging; and the optical scattering spectra of individual plasmonic gold nanorods and self-assembled nanorod clusters will be studied to determine the extent to which plasmonic effects are the source of experimentally measured nonlinear optical behavior.  All proposed projects will engage undergraduate students in the lab, teach them about hypothesis-based research, and train them in critical inquiry across STEM fields. This microscope will be transformative to the research and teaching infrastructure at Bates College and in the State of Maine (an EPSCoR state).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Williams: Using the zebrafish model, we hypothesized that one protein, Nfe2, was partially responsible for the organization of the inner ear during normal development and that it was also responsible for regulating this process under conditions of chemical exposure. A fish that expressed a fluorescent protein in its ear allowed us to track cellular movements from the beginning of ear development. We found that Nfe2 is responsible for regulating normal ear development and it mitigates the effect of chemicals that cause oxidative stress and damage during development.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kleckner: Pond snails were used as the model organism to better understand how neurons communicate with one another because of the ease with which their neurons can be monitored and the small number of those cells that belong to the network controlling oral behaviors such as feeding. We hypothesized that several snail peptides act to create a suite of feeding-related and non-feeding related behaviors and that these neurons communicate back and forth with another set of neurons, the buccal A cluster (BAC), from which some of the peptides are released. We found that peptides do, indeed, modify oral behavior in a manner that is predicted by the type of peptide. Pond snail gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) causes the feeding pattern to change to a substrate cleaning pattern, a reproductive event in pond snails. Using the Leica SP8, we were able to localize the peptides to certain groups of neurons predicted to release them to account for the behavioral changes.</p> <p>The confocal microscope was also used for two-color imaging of BAC neurons and network neurons in order to probe the communication between these groups.

Results show MEA and BME both show increased fraction of dye in the triplet state and longer triplet state lifetime with increased excitation rate when GLOX is not used in the buffer solution. In the presence of GLOX, increasing MEA concentration resulted in smaller fraction of dye in the triplet state while BME resulted in higher fractions. In buffer prepared with GLOX only, increasing excitation rate resulted in increased triplet fraction and decreased triplet time. Measurements of the molecular brightness of ATTO488 as a function of excitation intensity, thiol concentration, and the presence of GLOX show that at a given excitation intensity, brightness tends to decrease with increasing thiol concentration. However, the addition of GLOX to the buffer solution eliminated this effect and resulted in comparable emission rates that increase linearly with excitation intensity for both thiols. The presence of GLOX serves to reduce the fraction dye molecules in dark states and stabilize photon emission rates under buffer conditions commonly used in super-resolution imaging applications.</p> <p>C&ocirc;t&eacute;:&nbsp;This project is designed to explicate the role of plasmons in the nonlinear optical properties of noble metal nano- and microstructures.</p> <p>Single crystal gold microplates were synthesized directly on microscope cover slips through wet chemical techniques.
