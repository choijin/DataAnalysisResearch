<AbstractNarration>One of the key challenges in trustworthy computing is establishing trust in the hardware layer, which is the execution platform of all software applications. Modern multiprocessor system-on-chips employ many specialized components, and scalable network-on-chips (NoC) are often deployed to efficiently connect these components. In the light of these trends, this project investigates secure and reliable computation, when the underlying NoC is compromised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores a range of threats posed by a compromised NoC in current and future multiprocessor systems. The layered security mechanisms in the multiprocessor firmware that can allow secure and reliable computation by tolerating a compromised NoC are investigated. The project enables trustworthy computing on next generation cost-effective hardware platforms driven by seamless integration of third party hardware components. Through educational activities, this project will disseminate vital skill sets to future work force to engage in trustworthy computer design.</AbstractNarration>

Year 3:      Intellectual Merit:     1) Combating Voltage Noise in the NoC Power Supply Through Flow-Control and Routing Algorithms published at DATE 2016. Understanding impacts from voltage noise is crtical for thwarting trojans that impact a given system through timing errors.     2) Exploring the threats from a third party power management units (PMU) was presented at DAC 2016.     Broader Impacts:     1) The PI and Co-I gave seminars at TUM Muchich and sought collaborative opportunities spawning from the major findings from this project.      2) The PIs and their students also gave presentation in recent conferences (e.g., 2016 DAC), and interacted with the audience in those venues.       3) The Co-I attended SATC workshop.     Year 4:      Intellectual Merit:     1) Power Efficient Network-on-Chip Architecture for Near Threshold Computing published at ICCAD 2016.      2) Tackling Voltage Noise in the NoC Power Supply Through Flow-Control and Routing Algorithms published at TVLSI 2017.     3) Security Measures Against a Rogue Network-on-Chip published at Journal of Hardware and Systems Security 2017.      Broader Impacts:     1) Students from our group presented their work at DATE 2017 and ICCAD 2016 for dissemination to a wider community.     2) The Co-I attended DATE 2016 to interect with other members of the academia.     3) New projects were designed in the existing courses where students were encouraged to pursue new directions (e.g., NoC reliability related research projects in graduate courses).      4) The Co-I mentored undergraduate women at USU through the women's leadership initiative (WLI) program.      Year 5:      Intellectual Merit:     1) Explored emerging threats in low power computing resulting in a journal paper in IEEE Topics in Emerging Computation.     2) Reliability and Uniformity Enhancement in 8T-SRAM based PUFs operating at NTC published at ISLPED 2018.           Broader Impacts:     1) Students from our group presented their work at DATE 2018 and ISLPED 2018 for dissemination to a wider community.     2) The PI and Co-I attended DAC 2019 to interact with other members of hardware security community.
