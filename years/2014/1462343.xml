<AbstractNarration>Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most widely used batteries due to their high energy density, long cycle life, and low self-discharge. With the rapid development of portable electronics, electrical vehicles, and grid systems, lithium-ion batteries will be more widely employed. However, current slurry based battery electrode manufacturing is costly, preventing wide applications of lithium-ion batteries. The organic solvent typically used in the slurry can be expensive. In addition, a time-consuming and energy-intensive drying procedure has to be employed. The evaporated solvent also needs to be recovered in order to prevent potential environmental pollution. Therefore, it is desirable to have solvent-free battery manufacturing processes. This award supports fundamental research to form the knowledge base for development of solvent-free battery manufacturing processes. Results from this research will enhance the U.S. competence in energy manufacturing industry and benefit the society by providing energy storage solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major technical challenge in developing solvent-free battery manufacturing processes is to homogeneously disperse battery materials including active materials, conductive additives, and binder materials. This research aims to provide the new knowledge needed to overcome this challenge: (1) interfacial properties of the battery materials, (2) binder distribution characteristics during battery powder mixing, and (3) molten binder wettability and spreading kinetics on other materials during binder melting. The research team will perform multi-scale simulations (molecular dynamics at nanometer scale, finite difference modeling at micrometer scale, and discrete element modeling at micrometer to millimeter scales) to predict interfacial properties, binder spatial distribution after mixing, and molten binder spreading characteristics and surface coverages. Simulation results will be verified by surface energy measurements of dry powders and scanning electron microscopic observations of binder distributions after the powder mixing and binder melting steps respectively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lithium-ion batteries are widely used due to their high energy density, long cycle life, and low self-discharge. With the rapid development of portable electronics, electrical vehicles, and grid systems, lithium-ion batteries will be more widely employed. However, current slurry based battery electrode manufacturing is costly, preventing wide applications of lithium-ion batteries. The organic solvent typically used in the slurry can be expensive. In addition, a time-consuming and energy-intensive drying procedure has to be employed. The evaporated solvent also needs to be recovered in order to prevent potential environmental pollution. Therefore, it is desirable to have solvent-free battery manufacturing processes.   A major technical challenge in developing solvent-free battery manufacturing processes is to homogeneously disperse battery materials including active materials (e.g. LiCoO2), conductive additives (e.g. C65), and binder materials. To overcome this challenge, the project has developed numerical and experimental methods to predict and control powder distribution after dry mixing. For example, numerical simulation predicts that small particles form aggregates with minimal assembly on large particles when surface energy (polar component) of large particles is low (Figure 1). To validate simulation results, surface energy (polar component) of LiCoO2 (LCO) material is increased by annealing LCO in air and C65 distribution on annealed LCO is compared with C65 distribution on as-received LCO. SEM and Electron-Dispersive X-ray quantification of carbon content on LCO surface (histograms) show that the as-received LCO particles (low polar component) contain lower amounts of C65 than the annealed LCO particles, which agrees with numerical simulation. The developed methodology is then applied to obtain homogenously mixing of battery materials for solvent-free manufacturing of Li-ion batteries. Figure 3 shows the manufacturing process and fabricated functional electrodes. Solvent-free manufactured battery electrodes are found to slightly outperform conventional electrodes (Figure 4).  The project has impact on additive manufacturing and battery electrode manufacturing. In additive manufacturing, the fundamental understanding of powder mixing behavior and binder distribution will form the knowledge base for future development of new additive manufacturing processes, where understanding of mixing behavior of a variety of powders is crucial. In the area of battery electrode manufacturing, this project introduces a new process that can improve electrode performance and reduce the manufacturing cost. Solvent removal allows fabrication of unique electrode structures, such as ultra-thick electrodes. In addition, it is found in this study that the additive manufacturing method has advantages for battery electrode fabrication. For example, using additive manufacturing, the interfacial bonding can be strengthened by selectively deposit additional binders at the electrode-current collector interfaces. The powder mixing model and simulation developed in this study should not be limited to Li-ion battery powder materials. It can be applied to general fine powder handling and processing. In addition, this study suggests a method to treat the LCO powder surface in order to affect the powder mixing behavior. It is anticipated the method applies well in the processing of other fine powders.                         Last Modified: 07/03/2018       Submitted by: Heng Pan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
