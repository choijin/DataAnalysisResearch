<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to John F. Bergdall is "Aspects of the p-Adic Langlands Program via p-Adic Families of Automorphic Forms." The host institution for the fellowship is Boston University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Rob Pollack.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The recurring theme of this project was studying the way in which naturally intrinsic information about automorphic forms, one of the most important concepts in 21st number theory, is related to its extrinsic realization on a geometric object. In fact, one crucial theme in the last 20 years of number theory has been studying how one deforms arithmetic objects, and how the deformations can simultaneously reflect apparently disparate arithmetic quantities.  The first outcome of this project was a careful assemblage of positive results on the geometry of eigenvarieties at a large class of points. Specifically, we gave a select criterion which proves that the eigenvariety is a smooth analytic space. There is a large interest in this theorem because others (Breuil, Hellman and Schraen) have also proven that our criterion is optimal.  A second outcome of our project was joint work with Pollack where we revisited questions first raised by Gouvea and later explored by Buzzard. Specifically, associated to any integer k there is a sequence depending on a prime number p which are the norms of a certain linear operator acting on a space of weight k cusp forms. By the first decade of the 21st century, Buzzard has formed a precise conjecture predicting this list for many primes p, but a proof of his conjecture has not been found.
