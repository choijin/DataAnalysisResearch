<AbstractNarration>As the scale and complexity of scientific and engineering problems grow, computer simulations become a necessary and integral part of the vast majority of research endeavors. An ability to create a computer model of a process under investigation, whether it comes from physics, economics, biology or some other field, provides not only significant cost savings for a study, but also brings insights inaccessible through experimental procedures alone. The growing complexity with which we describe phenomena of interest requires increasingly more sophisticated computer models. In particular, it is important to be able to simulate many complex processes over very long times, which is a computationally intensive and challenging task. This project is focused on developing new computational methods that allow simulating and studying time evolving phenomena from a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines over long time intervals of interest.  The mathematical and computer tools created during this project will enable researchers to study problems at a scale and complexity not possible with currently available computational tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the state-of-the-art in both the theory and practice of time discretization methods. In the course of the project a complete theoretical framework and high performance implementations of the new generation of exponential time integrators will be developed. The new methods will significantly improve computational efficiency of numerical models in many important areas of science and engineering, and will enable simulations at a scale and complexity that are not currently possible. The research will advance core numerical analysis through the development and study of new classes of exponential propagation iterative (EPI) methods such as split, hybrid, partitioned, and Krylov-based techniques. In addition, specialized efficient schemes will be designed and optimized for a wide range of problems. The theoretical work will be complemented by the creation of a mathematical software package that will provide high quality implementations of the most efficient exponential integrators to the broad scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Computational science has become an essential tool in science, technology and engineering. Researchers and engineers are increasingly relying on computer simulations in studying complex problems.  In particular, many important applications require computational modeling of dynamics of complex systems that are evolving over a wide spectrum of spatial and temporal scales, so-called stiff problems. For example, weather prediction relies heavily on numerical modeling of atmospheric and ocean flows, fusion researchers and astrophysicists use computer simulations to understand evolution of plasmas, and automotive companies employ computer simulations to design efficient internal combustion engines.   In all of these applications the relevant physical or chemical processes evolve over several magnitudes of spatial scales and require simulation of temporal evolution on the time scale that is several orders of magnitude larger than the fastest processes in the system.  Such complex dynamical problems require special mathematical techniques called numerical time integrators to enable simulating these systems on a computer.  As the complexity and scale of phenomena under consideration increases there is a constant pressing need for more efficient and accurate computational time integration methods that enable computer modeling of stiff systems.   Our research focused on development of new methods that allow significant improvements in speed and accuracy of simulations of stiff complex problems.  As a result of this project we proposed several classes of new time integration methods for stiff systems that bring significant computational savings to a wide range of applications.  We showed that the time integrators we built can outperform current state-of-the-art techniques.  Our research included both theoretical and practical components. We were able to provide rigorous mathematical proofs that our algorithms converge and yield an accurate solution to large systems of differential equations. We also demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of the new methods on several concrete applications.  In particular, we developed a method and software to solve equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) which model large scale behavior of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas on parallel computational platforms.

In addition to new computational methodologies and software the project included extensive professional training of graduate students and postdoctoral level researchers.  All junior participants in the project were provided with mentoring and support that enabled them to successfully advance to the next steps in their professional career.  The research output was also used to enhance and modernize curriculum in numerical analysis and methods for new graduate students.
