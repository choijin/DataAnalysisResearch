<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Christopher M. Beaudry of Oregon State University is developing efficient methods for the construction of molecules with complex architectures that contain nitrogen.  Since the vast majority of biologically active molecules are nitrogenous, this research will create new opportunities for the identification of biologically active molecules. Synthetic molecules are being tested for their ability to serve as pharmaceutical lead compounds, biological probes, and selective inhibitors of cellular proteins. Researchers contributing to this work represent a diverse multiracial, multicultural, multi-gender group of scientists. Professor Beaudry supervises formal weekly and monthly research meetings where scientists are trained for experimentation and dissemination of the work.  Moreover, the diverse Beaudry group actively participates in community outreach and lifelong learning with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, "Science Pub," a locally-organized discussion of science, and organization of the Pacific Northwest Undergraduate Research Symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, the project focuses on study and development of new chemical reactions of carbon-centered radicals that bear two nitrogen atoms. Such aminal radicals are used to create new carbon-carbon bonds in molecules containing heteroatoms, such as pharmaceuticals and natural products. The use of these radicals allows efficient syntheses of target molecules while avoiding acid-base chemistry of nitrogen, and as such represents a new strategy for chemical synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  Our research has created new routes to prepare valuable molecules.  Specifically, we prepared omacetaxine, a clinically used leukemia drug.  This drug suffers from a world supply bottleneck, and our synthesis will alleviate major supply issues with its preparation, leading to lower costs for patients.  Furthermore, we have created a new synthesis of aromatic molecules, some of which can be notoriously expensive.  Our discoveries will lead to new access to important starting materials and fine chemicals based on benzenes and other aromatic molecules.  We have also developed new strategies for the synthesis of target molecules. This project created new chemical reactions that can be used for the synthesis of a variety of natural products.  Specifically, we have discovered oxidative Mannich reactions, oxidative ring formations, and free radical reactions that other chemists can use for the preparation of complex molecules.  Additionally, we have created new chemical reactions. We have discovered the first oxidative furan opening-Mannich cyclization reaction, we have discovered new radical translocation reactions, and we have discovered new oxidative macrocycliation reactions. These reactions will enable new discoveries by other organic chemists.  Broader impacts:  This project has led to the educational training of more than 10 young scientists.  Four PhD students have graduated after being supported by this award, and all have secured highly competitive positions in academia or the chemical industry. Additionally, five PhD students not yet graduated have been supported by this award. Finally, two undergraduates have been trained under this award and are now in top-10 PhD programs.
