<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities program (CRIF), Virginia Wesleyan College will acquire a gas-chromatagraph and mass spectrometer analyzer (GC/MS). Gas chromatagraphy is a powerful technique employed to separate complex mixtures into individual components for further identification. This analysis will be performed in the mass spectometer where the separated components are injected for determination of their masses to aid characterization. The spectometer ionizes the components into a parent ion and smaller fragment ions and measures each of their masses. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of the molecules in a complex mixture. The instrument will be used by undergraduate research students to advance their research projects and by students in laboratory courses using modern instrumentation. It will prepare them for technical careers and advanced educational opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education especially in areas such as (a) investigating the potential of natural products (specifically sea sponge toxins) for possible use in pharmaceuticals; (b) evaluating green chemistry practices for the development of pharmaceutical feedstocks; (c) evaluating and characterizing metal ion coordination materials for use as sensors; (d) evaluating the effectiveness of environmental pollution reduction measures; and (e) investigating plant evolution through the examination of the plant sterol pathway.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit    This project?s primary goal was to acquire a gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GCMS) to support faculty research and undergraduate research training in the natural sciences at Virginia Wesleyan College (VWC).  Faculty research has involved 7 undergraduate students resulting in 9 research project presentations.  Research in natural products focused on extracting and identifying bioactive components from marine specimens. The ultimate goal is to identify a bioactive natural product from a specimen that has potential as an effective and/or selective pharmaceutical.  Current work stems from antibacterial activity identified in organic extracts from the red marine algae, Agardhiella tenera, yellow ball sponge Cinachyra alloclada, and red beard sponge Microciona prolifera.  The extracts containing the bioactive substance(s) are purified and analyzed by GCMS to identify the components in the extract mixtures. Thus far, novel compounds have been identified in the red marine algae extracts, which may contain a new lead compound to develop into a pharmaceutical antibiotic.  One faculty member and three student researchers produced 5 research presentations:  251st American Chemical Society National Meeting, San Diego, CA   Britton Hipple and Joyce Easter. Extraction of antibacterial substance from Cinachyra alloclada. Undergraduate Program. March 2016.   VWC Undergraduate Research Symposium: (faculty mentor: Dr.J Easter)  Britton Hipple, "Extraction of antibacterial substance from Cinachyra alloclada." April 2016.  Lilly Moon, "Extraction of Microbial compounds from Red Beard Sponge Microcina prolifera from Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay." April 2016, May 2015.  Tanya Puccio, "Isolation of antimicrobial compounds from the marine red algae Agarhiella tenera." May 2015.  Research in green chemistry practices focused on supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), a relatively new and more environmentally friendly technique than traditional methods (steam distillation or solvent extraction). The effect of pressure and temperature on the efficiency of SFE in the isolation of essential oils was investigated.  Using GCMS, the components of the essential oils isolated from dill and celery seeds (and hops)by SFE were compared to those extracted by traditional methods.  Two faculty members, two undergraduate, and one high school student* produced 2 research presentations:.    Brock School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Research Symposium, VWC Port Day:  Brian Wise, Renna Sareini* (faculty mentor Dr.K. Kittredge), "Analysis of the Essential Oils of Hop Varieties using Supercritical Fluid Extraction with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry: Effects of Temperature and Pressure." May 2017.  Ton&eacute; Boykins (faculty mentor Dr.J. Easter), "Efficiency of supercritical fluid extraction of essential oils from celery and dill seed at varying temperatures and pressures." December 2016.  SFE is now being employed in our organic chemistry labs, paired with GCMS analysis of products, further increasing the impact of the project.  Research in thin films analyzed hydrolysis products for the release of a dye from polymeric thin films, to simulate potential applications in drug delivery. One faculty member and two undergraduate researchers, produced 2 research presentations:  VWC Undergraduate Research Symposium for Natural Sciences and Mathematics: (faculty mentor Dr.K. Kittredge)  Keane Dye, "Analysis of the Kinetics and Products of the Hydrolysis Reaction of Methylene Blue under Physiological and Alkaline Conditions." April 2016.  Alison Washington, "Kinetics of release of the dye methylene blue in thermally cured poly(allylamine)/poly(acrylic acid hydrochloride) thin films, Part II." May 2015.  Research training for undergraduates (course: CHEM 480) introduces students to analytical techniques and instrumentation (GCMS and isotope dilution mass spectrometry made possible by this grant), and provides instruction and guidance to students as they learn to design, propose, conduct and report on a research project.   Fourteen students enrolled in CHEM 480 participated in both training and a laboratory investigations using GCMS.  Seven students selected GCMS as the instrumental technique for their projects (research mentor: Dr. M Howard), resulting in 6 student project presentations.  All students orally presented results in class, followed by a poster presentation at the college-wide VWC Undergraduate Research Symposium.  Student research topics varied based on student interest: Year one (2015) two students used GCMS to look at weed killer residue and nicotine in chewing tobacco; year two (2016) two students used GCMS to investigate flavanals in chocolate and drug release from thin films (related to faculty research); year three (2017) three students used GCMS to measure diethyl phthalates in lipstick, nicotine in vape e-liquids and aromatic components of hops.     Broader impacts   The GCMS has ehnhanced the research opportunities for students in all areas of the natural sciences as shown by recent projects involving carbon dioxide from biodegredation in salt versus fresh water and petrochemical breakdown in vermicompost.     The GCMS has also impacted the participation of historically underrepresented groups in research training in the natural sciences, specifically women and minorities.  Virginia Wesleyan College is a small liberal arts college which has a very diverse student body.  Of the 25 students to get hands-on research training using the GCMS, there were 18 female (72%), and 9 minority (36%) students, which is significantly higher than most research programs in the sciences.
