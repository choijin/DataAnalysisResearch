<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will investigate how morphological and developmental diversity accumulated in a unique and charismatic lineage of crabs belonging to the economically important "swimming crab" family Portunidae. Diversification of these crabs included significant ecological divergence that involved abandoning a swimming lifestyle for sedentary, symbiotic relationships with reef-associated organisms. Research will include comparative analyses of size,  shape and growth data. The primary goal of this work will be to infer whether significant developmental differences between these crabs were generated before, during or after significant changes in adult forms and whether these divergences correlate to the emergence of symbiotic associations in the group. Results of this work will contribute to an active area of research concerned with how external (e.g. ecological) and internal (e.g. developmental) factors influence morphological diversification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide the co-PI with opportunities to foster collaborations both nationally and internationally. It will also facilitate the training of undergraduate students on research methods in molecular systematics. Fieldwork activities will be shared with the public through the science blog "Adventures in Spineless Science!". Specimens, tissue samples and photographs collected for this work will be curated and archived at the Florida Museum of Natural History; making them available for other researchers. Results will be professionally communicated at scientific meetings and through publication in open-access journals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated the morphological diversity of a lineage of  crabs belonging to the economically important "swimming crab" family  Portunidae. Diversification of these crabs included significant  ecological divergence that involved abandoning a swimming lifestyle for  sedentary, symbiotic relationships with reef-associated organisms (soft  coral, algae, echinoderms, etc.). Research included phylogenetic  comparative analyses of size, shape and growth. The primary goal of this  work was to infer whether significant differences in growth patterns  between these crabs were generated before, during or after significant  changes in adult forms and whether these divergences correlate with the  emergence of symbiotic associations in the group.

This project resulted in the development  of significant molecular and morphological data for investigating this  topic. The project provided the Co-PI with opportunities to foster  collaborations both nationally and internationally. Fieldwork activities  for this project resulted in 350 lots of newly collected crab specimens  being deposited at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH). This  also included curation of live images from over 300 specimens and  genetic tissue samples from over 250 specimens. These specimens, tissue  samples, and photographs are made freely available for future research  through FLMNH. This project also included the digitization of over 1000  crab specimens from the FLMNH and Smithsonian National Museum of Natural  History (USNM). These photographs were captured such that they are  suitable for geometric morphometric work and will be made freely  available through the respective institution&rsquo;s online databases or the  iDigBio portal (https://www.idigbio.org/portal/). This project  facilitated the training of a female undergraduate student on research  methods in molecular systematics that led to her successful completion  of an undergraduate honors thesis. Finally, preliminary results of this  work were communicated to over 450 members of the public. Through five  outreach events at the USNM and the FLMNH over 400 members of the  general public and 30 high school students were provided clear examples  and hands on activities demonstrating how collections based research is  conducted, why museums are critical for such research, and why everyone  should care about developing a deeper understanding about biodiversity.
