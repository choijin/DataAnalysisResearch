<AbstractNarration>The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Steven Rokita of Johns Hopkins University for research aimed at increasing our understanding of the way in which our cells react to toxins in the environment. In particular, the investigators are looking at how cells repair damage those toxins might inflict. One way the damage occurs is through a process known as DNA alkylation, in which small chemical groups are added to the molecules that make up genes. Food preservatives, natural flavorings and even drugs can induce DNA alkylation. The current project is designed to assess the biochemical consequences of toxins that interact reversibly with DNA. The reversibility of the deleterious interactions between these molecules and DNA creates the possibility that the effects of the toxins are amplified and may overwhelm the repair capacity of cells. To study the process in detail and identify the most dramatic effects of the reversibility, a series of model compounds is being prepared and tested for each step of the DNA repair mechanism. This work is having a broader impact on scientist's ability to evaluate the toxicology of substances prior to their market release. It is having a further impact on the training of the next generation of scientists, both undergraduate and graduate students, by encouraging them to recognize and pursue problems that transcend the traditional barriers between organic chemistry and biochemistry and are important for the human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the structural determinants required for efficient diffusion of covalent cross-linking within duplex DNA are being identified. This is being accomplished through the synthesis and evaluation of quinone methide intermediates that express a range of reaction kinetics and DNA affinities. The principles gleaned from this first activity will be used for challenging enzymes responsible for DNA repair with reversible and dynamic cross-links. The entities formed during each step of cross-link repair will be mapped by diagnostic fragmentation and separation using electrophoresis and chromatography. Initial attention will be directed to isolated DNA and then progress to nucleosomes and finally embrace the complexity of crude cell extracts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Intellectual merit.  Reagents designed to couple with their biological targets typically react irreversibly allowing only one chance for success.  Efforts in this award by the NSF were focused on an alternative design of reagents that act reversibly.  For these, consumption and regeneration may occur multiple times to support a self-correcting mechanism if a reagent initially reacts with unintended targets.  The reversibly reactive appendage of choice was inherently very promiscuous and could be fully controlled by attaching a target-specific ligand that would direct activity to the desired location.  A number of variants were tested and all succeeded at delivering the reactive appendage to specific regions of DNA.  Investigations using nucleosomes as a model for chromatin indicated that reaction will preferentially occur in the linker regions connecting individual nucleosomes.     Broader impact.  Three graduate students were trained in advanced methodologies for future research and teaching at the interface of chemistry and biology.  Additionally, four undergraduate students were introduced to independent research.  Three of these students have since entered graduate school and the fourth is currently applying to graduate school to start in Fall 2019.  The PI of this project also helped to establish the first chapter of The National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers on the Johns Hopkins University and he remains the faculty advisor of this group.  Finally, the reagents and protocols developed during this period have been made available to the scientific community and have already been applied in a variety of different projects in other laboratories.
