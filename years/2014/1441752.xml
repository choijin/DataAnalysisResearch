<AbstractNarration>This project expands, implements and conducts research on a previously developed framework for providing indigenous students with the workforce skills and knowledge needed for future Earth system science careers. The framework proven effective for Inupiat students during the NSF/ITEST-funded Arctic Climate Modeling Program (ESI-0525277) will be scaled up to develop culturally responsive STEM instruction for 1500 Yup'ik and Native Hawaiian middle school students and their 60 teachers. The multifaceted scale-up project includes: a broader research setting, more school districts, diverse indigenous cultures, additional STEM workforce practices, and a broader expert pool. The goal of the scale-up is to answer the research question, "Under what circumstances are the PREPARES framework for offering culturally responsive STEM instruction effective in increasing indigenous student disposition toward participating in future Earth system science careers?" Student objectives include assessing three indicators of student disposition toward STEM careers: (a) STEM academic achievement, (b) interest in STEM careers, and (c) STEM workforce skill readiness. Teacher objectives related to program sustainability include increasing educator STEM content knowledge and pedagogical strategies aligned with STEM workforce practices. Research by randomized controlled trial will determine framework transferability and identify circumstances and steps needed to expand its adoption to a broader array of U.S. schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a professional development program for non-Native teachers of indigenous students. The project offers training that helps teachers provide culturally responsive science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) instruction in areas, such as Alaska and Hawaii, that support strong indigenous populations, but where the vast majority of teachers are non-Native.  The research component will gather data and information that will advance the understanding of a framework for broadening indigenous participation in STEM study and careers. The activity targets middle school students because research indicates that middle school is a time when engagement in STEM studies begins to decline.  Encouraging indigenous students to view completing high school as a step toward STEM careers is important because Native students compose a high percentage of the dropout population in Alaska and Hawaii. Culturally responsive STEM training is needed because many STEM teachers enter their preparation programs with little or no inter-cultural experience and with beliefs and assumptions that undermine the goal of providing an equal education for all students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Preparing Responsive Educators Using Place-based Authentic Research in Earth Systems (PREPARES)  Indigenous students in Alaska and Hawaii score below average on science and mathematics achievement tests. PREPARES evaluated an approach to bridge the cultural and experiential differences between indigenous students and non-indigenous teachers and to make instruction meaningful to students by using place-based, culturally responsive, and community-relevant instruction. The goal was for middle school students to become more knowledgeable about the effects of climate change and about strategies for adapting to these effects, to develop skills that can be applied in future science and mathematics classes, and to form more positive dispositions toward pursuing future science courses and STEM-related careers.  The project conducted teacher professional development, published supplemental instructional materials to facilitate the transfer of teacher training into classroom instruction, and designed and implemented online interaction tools that enabled teachers and students in isolated settings to communicate with one another. Scientists, community leaders, business partners, teachers, school administrators, students, and parents were vital sounding boards and contributors throughout the project.  Four units of instruction specific to Alaska and four specific to Hawaii were developed. Each unit was related to a climate change problem or issue identified by the community. Teachers were prepared to use the materials and the three-prong instructional approach in face-to-face meetings and through online instruction. Fidelity of curriculum implementation was monitored through regular teacher reports, individual interactions between teachers and PREPARES personnel, and timeliness of teachers? submitting unit test results.  Instructional tools included hand-on activities and lessons, readings specific to the content, videos of local STEM professionals working on area climate issues, online interactions among Alaskan and Hawaiian students, and classroom discussions prompted by PREPARES critical thinking exercises. Students were evaluated at the end of each unit to assess their understanding of geophysical content, their ability to use science process skills, and their knowledge of related STEM careers. Evaluation tools included content tests, student surveys, student interviews, and teacher interviews.  A Randomized Control study with treatment and control group comparison was used to determine the impact of the PREPARES program.
