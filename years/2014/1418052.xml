<AbstractNarration>The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) identify an ambitious progression for learning energy, beginning in elementary school. To help the nation's teachers address this challenge, this project will develop and investigate the opportunities and limitations of Focus on Energy, a professional development (PD) system for elementary teachers (grades 3-5).  The PD will contain: resources that will help teachers to interpret, evaluate and cultivate students' ideas about energy; classroom activities to help them to identify, track and represent energy forms and flows; and supports to help them in engaging students in these activities.  Teachers will receive the science and pedagogical content knowledge they need to teach about energy in a crosscutting way across all their science curricula; students will be intellectually engaged in the practice of developing, testing, and revising a model of energy they can use to describe phenomena both in school and in their everyday lives; and formative assessment will guide the moment-by-moment advancement of students' ideas about energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and test a scalable model of PD that will enhance the ability of in-service early elementary teachers to help students learn energy concepts by coordinating formative assessment, face-to-face and web-based PD activities.  Researchers will develop and iteratively refine tools to assess both teacher and student energy reasoning strategies. The goals of the project include (1) teachers' increased facility with, and disciplined application of, representations and energy reasoning to make sense of everyday phenomena in terms of energy; (2) teachers' increased ability to interpret student representations and ideas about energy to make instructional decisions; and (3) students' improved use of representations and energy reasoning to develop and refine models that describe energy forms and flows associated with everyday phenomena.  The web-based product will contain:  a set of formative assessments to help teachers to interpret student ideas about energy based on the Facets model; a series of classroom tested activities to introduce the Energy Tracking Lens (method to explore energy concept using multiple representations); and videos of classroom exemplars as well as scientists thinking out loud while using the Energy Tracking Lens. The project will refine the existing PD and build a system that supports online implementation by constructing a facilitator's guide so that the online community can run with one facilitator.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Energy is a concept that spans all scientific disciplines. Therefore, a rigorous and flexible model for energy is essential for addressing a wide array of scientific, technological and social challenges. Because energy is so foundational, students should begin energy learning as early as possible and construct models and use representations that can build toward more sophisticated understandings over time. Further, since energy is an inherently abstract concept, it is important for students to "elaborate on their own energy ideas or findings and present them to others" (NRC, 2011). Such an early and responsive approach to energy teaching depends upon strategically designed curriculum and well-prepared teachers.</p> <p>The Focus on Energy curriculum (https://focusonenergy.terc.edu) addresses the new science standards and is supported by teacher professional learning, online resources, and assessments. The curriculum uses an innovative approach to engage elementary students in learning about energy. Students go beyond simply identifying specific forms, transfers, and transformations; they learn to track energy flow through increasingly complex contexts ranging from ball collisions to solar panels. Students engage in a coherent sequence of activities, practice strategies for scientific discourse, and use a set of representational tools to reason about energy flow. These key features provide a framework and language that enable students to iteratively develop, elaborate and refine their scientific model for energy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Three short (4-5 session) curriculum units and an optional engineering design challenge include firsthand, guided explorations of energy in everyday phenomena.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;The Motion and Elastic Energy unit introduces foundational energy ideas and representational tools. A short video collage of energy in everyday life anchors the unit. Students explore rolling and colliding balls on a track. They investigate springboard/pompom and propeller/elastic band systems and become familiar with Energy Tracking Lens questions and representations. These tools help them describe everyday phenomena in terms of energy.</p> <p>&nbsp;The Thermal Energy extends the Energy Tracking Lens framework and representations to investigate thermal phenomena. They collect temperature data and reason about increases and decreases of thermal energy and energy transfer between objects and to the environment.</p> <p>&nbsp;In the Electrical Energy Unit, students explore energy transfer to a propeller using a hand-crank generator, a solar panel, and a capacitor. By the end of the unit, students have developed and are able to use a model of energy to reason about energy flow in contexts they encounter in everyday life, from whistling tea kettles and windmills to birds on the wing.</p> <p>The Focus on Energy Project team members were successful in soliciting, listening to, and engaging with teacher ideas. The result was a truly collaborative effort with far reaching impact and significance.</p> <p>The project directly impacted several cohorts of participating teachers who:</p> <ul> <li>are better prepared to engage their students in the study of energy as envisioned in the Next Generation Science Standards;</li> <li>are empowered to teach science as a process of inquiry which builds upon the experiences and intellectual resources of their students;</li> <li>can provide their students with representational strategies to track the flow of energy in multidisciplinary contexts;</li> <li>have demonstrated a readiness to take on leadership roles as science educators; (One teacher in particular is now teaching a science methods course for a local university.)</li> <li>have online access to curricular resources which support ambitious energy learning at the elementary level.</li> </ul> <p>These impacts and findings extend beyond the participating teachers to their students and their colleagues.

Moreover, since energy reasoning is fundamentally a matter of quantitative accounting, it was far from clear that children in fourth or fifth grade, with a limited mathematical toolkit, could engage in it successfully. Our results provide strong evidence that, with appropriate guidance and support and adequate teacher preparation, elementary students of diverse backgrounds can and do engage effectively in those practices and make striking gains in understanding and using key foundational energy ideas.
