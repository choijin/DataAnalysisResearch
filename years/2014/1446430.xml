<AbstractNarration>This project by Cabrillo College is working to develop an effective approach in undergraduate engineering education for students at this two-year Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI).  This research focuses on developing strategies that enhance interest and motivation of students and improve persistence and graduation rates in undergraduate STEM programs at Hispanic-Serving Institutions. This project will evaluate the impact that an engineering service-learning abroad project has on Latino and low-income students' academic commitment and persistence in completing engineering degrees. Engineering service-learning abroad activities are effective motivators and career development experiences for students.  Such experiences instill an appreciation for the world-changing potential that engineering offers.  However, often the high cost of participation in service-learning abroad makes these experiences effectively out-of-reach for many engineering students attending two-year colleges. This project will expand the existing engineering service-learning abroad program at Cabrillo and make it possible for low income students to participate. It is expected that engineering service-learning abroad will have a positive influence on their commitment to engineering careers and persistence to degree completion. This study will accumulate data to test this hypothesis. A positive result will provide useful information regarding strategies that might be used to increase the number of low-income and Latino students who persist in engineering majors and complete degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cabrillo College Engineering Abroad Program conducts engineering service-learning abroad activities. The out-of-county component to this program takes place in Latin America.  The existing program will be expanded in the course of this study. Projects focus on areas of dire need and the recent engineering abroad project was a rainwater catchment system to provide potable water to a small village. Initial work at Cabrillo indicates the potential of this engineering service learning abroad program to enhance the interest and motivation of students and improve their persistence.  Initial work shows Latino student participants are integral to the project team because of their unique understanding of Hispanic culture and their skill as translators. Many Latino students have not traveled outside the United States. However their unique background results in their serving as leaders of the group which is the reverse of their experience in traditional classrooms. These experiences were found to have a dramatic impact on Latino student feelings of self-efficacy and empowerment. This project will more thoroughly investigate and document these results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will yield evaluation data regarding the extent to which these activities have improved the skills of the participants. Established service-learning assessment methods will be used to measure: civic engagement, industry-relevant skills, global/cultural skills, personal growth, academic and career growth, and engineering skills. Other quantitative measurements will compare the academic performance and degree progress of students participating in the engineering abroad experience to corresponding outcomes achieved by students in a comparison group.  Qualitative analyses will be employed to explore how the experience abroad may have contributed to changes in students' confidence, plans for the future, perception of themselves as leaders, and commitment to the field of engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Complete details of the outcomes are included in the final report within Attachments D, E, F, G, and H.     Summary:     Self-Assessment  Results of the assessment revealed that the Engineering Abroad program had a significant impact on students? confidence, skills, and perceptions of engineering as a profession (see Figure 1).  Overall and within subgroups, participants had the greatest gains in development of Global-Cultural Skills and Engineering Skills.  Females and non-URM (white and Asian) students had the largest increases across all constructs, while URM and male participants rated themselves the highest on the Pre I survey, leaving less room for growth.  In other words, males and URM participants reported higher levels of confidence and skills at the start of the Engineering Abroad experience compared to females and non-URM participants.  By the end of the program, males still rated themselves as slightly higher than females, while non-URM participants? Post II assessment results were comparable to those of URM participants.       [Reference to Figure 1 as attached image.]  Results of the post-PSM logistic regression revealed that the Engineering Abroad Program (EAP) had a statistically significant impact on student retention and transfer.  The resulting odds ratios after appropriate statistical controls showed that EAP participants were three times more likely to re-enroll in classes one year after the program and six to seven times more likely than the matched comparison group to complete an Associate degree in engineering, become transfer ready (completion of transfer-level math, transfer-level English, 60+ transferrable units, and 2.0 GPA) and/or transfer to a four-year college.     Retention  The post-regression adjusted means in Figure 2 show that 71% of Engineering Abroad Program (EAP) participants enrolled in at least three consecutive semesters after the start of the program compared to only 44% of the comparison students (p &lt; 0.01), a difference of 27 percentage points.  Participation in the Engineering Abroad Program was the most significant predictor of fall-to-fall retention in the regression model.         [Reference to Figure 2 as attached image.]     Transfer/Transfer Ready  Figure 3 shows Engineering Abroad participants are significantly more likely to transfer to a four-year college and/or become transfer ready than comparison students (90% vs. 57%, respectively, p &lt; 0.01).  Due to timing issues and delays in transfer data obtained by the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), the above analysis includes students who transferred to a four-year college as well as transfer ready students.  Students are flagged as transfer ready after completing transfer-level math, transfer-level English, 60+ transferrable units, and have a 2.0 GPA or higher.       [Reference to Figure 3 as attached image.]     Focus Group Findings:  The engineering abroad program has clearly had a very positive impact on students. The program has significant value not only for what students derive from the year of activities (which includes the two week experience) but for what students gain from the community and environment it promotes on campus. The STEM Center and the type of faculty members that lead Cabrillo?s STEM programs also certainly contribute to the inviting, supportive, and exiting learning environment.

At the onset of the program Vuelta Grande had an existing system that stored roughly 500 gallons of water. After four years EA has been able to increase their storage capacity by over 20 times.
