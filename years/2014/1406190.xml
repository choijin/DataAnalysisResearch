<AbstractNarration>The topics in this proposal fall within the area of number theory. This is a fundamental area in mathematics interested in understanding the integers. There is deep information about the integers encoded in certain analytic objects called L-functions. And there have been many fruitful interactions between L-functions and computational methods. Such interactions started with the Riemann zeta function which, famously, Riemann computed numerically. The role of computation in analytic number theory has continued to grow since then. The proposer will investigate certain L-functions from a computational viewpoint. This includes investigating their computational complexity, the derivation of new fast algorithms, with an application to learning about integer factorization, and the use of computation as an experimental tool in the study of L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will study several independent topics in analytic and computational number theory. The main topic is to investigate connections between subconvexity estimates of the Riemann zeta function, on the one hand, and its computational complexity on the other. Part of the novelty here is that these two aspects are weakly related in general. However, they connect strongly for the Riemann zeta function in the critical strip, and also for Dirichlet character sums to a power-full modulus, perhaps even for more number-theoretic objects. One goal of the project is to translate recent progress between the analytic and computational viewpoints. Another topic concerns the full moment conjectures of ``families'' of L-functions with symplectic or orthogonal symmetry. The proposer aims to derive uniform asymptotics for the full moment conjectures for such families, extending previous joint work with Michael Rubinstein in the unitary case. A third topic is to develop the recent algorithm for detecting squarefree numbers that was derived in joint work with Andrew Booker and Jon Keating, especially in relation to lower bounds for the growth rate of character sums over the primes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    I studied several independent topics in analytic and computational number theory. First, I investigated connections between subconvexity estimates of the Riemann zeta function, on the one hand, and its computational complexity on the other. Part of the novelty here was that these two aspects are weakly related in general, but they connect strongly for the Riemann zeta function in the critical strip (and also for Dirichlet character sums to a powerfull modulus). My motivation came from similarities in the structure of the fastest algorithms for computing zeta versus methods to bound it. And my goal was to translate progress between the analytic and computational viewpoints. For example, can an improved bound for &zeta;(1/2 + it) lead to a faster algorithm for computing it, and vice versa? As an outcome, I have three papers published or accepted so far directly on this topic, namely             Ghaith A. Hiary. An alternative to Riemann-Siegel type formulas. Math. Comp., 85(298):1017&ndash; 1032, 2016.    Ghaith A. Hiary. An explicit van der Corput estimate for &zeta;(1/2 + it). Indag. Math. (N.S.), 27(2):524&ndash;533, 2016.    Ghaith A. Hiary. Asymptotics and formulas for cubic exponential sums, Proc. Steklov Inst. Math. (2017) 299, pp 78-95.          In addition, I extended my investigation of the parallels between algorithms and subconvexity bounds to the setting of Dirichlet L-functions to a powerfull modulus, which the subject of the paper        Ghaith A. Hiary. An explicit hybrid estimate for L(1/2 + it, &chi;). Acta Arith., 176(3):211&ndash;239, 2016.        Specifically, I derived an explicit hybrid estimate for L(1/2 + it, &chi;), where &chi; is a Dirichlet character modulo q. The estimate applies when t is bounded away from zero, and is most effective when q is powerfull, yielding an explicit Weyl bound in this case. The proof of this explicit estimate paralleled the algorithm I had previously derived in for computing L(s,&chi;), where &chi; is a character modulo q and q is powerfull, in q^{1/3+o(1)} time.     The second topic I investigated was to learn partial information about the factorization of a given integer n using Dirichlet L-functions. The main outcome of this investigation was the paper       Andrew R. Booker, Ghaith A. Hiary, and Jon P. Keating. Detecting squarefree numbers. Duke Math. J., 164(2):235&ndash;275, 2015.       Joint with A. R. Booker and J. P. Keating, we presented an algorithm, based on the explicit formula for L-functions and conditional on Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, for proving that a given integer is squarefree with little or no knowledge of its factorization. We analyzed the algorithm both theoretically and practically, and used it to prove that some RSA challenge numbers were not squarefull. Moreover, we presented heuristic evidence based on random matrix theory and other probabilistic calculations that our algorithm runs in deterministic subexponential time O(exp((log n)2/3+o(1))).  Our method is able to give partial results that one does not obtain from a failed attempt at factoring, and initiates a novel approach to factoring problems.     In addition, I derived and implemented a deterministic algorithm for factoring n using n1/3+o(1) bit operations in the paper       Ghaith A. Hiary. A deterministic algorithm for integer factorization. Math. Comp., 85(300):2065&ndash;2069, 2016.        This algorithm tests the divisibility of n by all the integers in a short interval at once, rather than integer by integer as in trial division. This algorithm can be practical for instances of the "factoring with high bits known" problem.     The third topic that I tackled was the use of computation as an experimental tool in analytic number theory and the development of new algorithms for L-functions. The main outcomes here were the papers       Ghaith A. Hiary. A fast amortized algorithm for computing quadratic Dirichlet L-functions. Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, 2017.    Jonathan W. Bober and Ghaith A. Hiary. New computations of the Riemann zeta func- tion on the critical line. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2016.1233083. Experimental Mathematics, 0(0):1&ndash;13, 2016.                 I derived an algorithm to compute Dirichlet L-functions for many quadratic characters.

The fourth topic in my previous proposal was to generalize, to other families of L-functions, the uniform asymptotics for the full moment conjecture of zeta (unitary case) that I obtained in my previous joint work with Michael Rubinstein.
