<AbstractNarration>This project funds travel support for academic participation in a workshop organized by the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Subcommittee's Large Scale Networking (LSN) Coordinating Group, and co-sponsored by NSF and DoE, on issues associated with the national deployment of an inter-carrier Software Defined Networking (SDN) service.  The workshop will be held at NSF on December 17th and 18th, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the workshop is to explore the steps to an operational prototype SDN network and to identify the required longer term research. Specific goals also include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Identifying current capabilities and resources that contribute to development and operation of an SDN prototype network that interoperates seamlessly with the current public Internet&lt;br/&gt;2. Identifying research, resource, and collaboration needs in creating such a system&lt;br/&gt;3. Identifying gaps in operational software tools necessary for running a production, multidomain SDN network&lt;br/&gt;4. Identifying opportunities for SDN virtualized networks to interact with 'clouds' of computation and storage&lt;br/&gt;5. Providing a workshop report to NSF and the other NITRD agencies on needed research and development, resources and collaboration for the prototype system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SDN is a key emerging technology and is being used to support a number of national priority programs.    Developing a sound basis for inter-carrier SDN will enable the widespread deployment of applications using SDN.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To serve the needs of the NSF's computer networking community of interest, the  funds in this grant provided needed travel funds for several software defined neworking workshops.  Network operators and network researchers in the Federal agencies and R&amp;E community have been experimenting extensively with SDN, through DOE-funded network research projects, through grants from NSF (e.g. GENI, CC-NIE, CC-IIE, and CC-DNI) and through multitude of testbeds.  Despite the number of use-cases and demonstrations showcased, as SDN is targeted towards production deployments targeting to replace current WAN networks, there are significant gaps to address. In addition, the hardware and software ecosystem is not mature, leaving gaps for operators to address on their own.      These travel funds supported students, staff, and faculty at U.S. universities in order to attend these workshops to help address operational needs, including Programmable Networks, "Intent-Based" Services based on SDN, and Multi-Domain SDN Based Services; fundamental research challenges, including Multi-scale clouds, Rethinking and refactoring the functions of applications / infrastructure, Multi-domain infrastructure, and How to support heterogeneous physical infrastructure in a cloud; and infrastructure requirements, including continued development of open-cloud environments; and infrastructure for collecting, sharing, and using torrents of data.   Today?s cyber-infrastructures, implemented via hardware with predetermined control systems, are now beginning to morph into fluid, planetary-scale software systems. This revolution offers the potential for enormous impact on our society, and is creating a wide range of fundamental research challenges.
