<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project's broader/commercial impact of the proposed innovation is in the creation of a platform that can personalize the online learning experience using freely available online educational resources. The rising cost of education and professional development along with an increasing need for the same, create a need for affordable but high quality educational resources. The proposed project will add value to the online educational resources that are freely available and allow users to accomplish their educational goals at low or no cost. School and college students will be able to accomplish test preparation and the study of STEM subjects via resources that are best fit for their grade, ability and learning style. Professionals will be able to access courses that help them enhance their existing skills and learn new ones. As users' goals, interests, interactions and learning styles are revealed; the software will be able to provide high quality recommendations and enhanced personalization. Barriers that currently exist for learners based on income and geography can be eliminated by this disruptive technology. A freemium/ premium subscription model will keep the company viable despite providing free resources to the majority of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to enhance the value of currently available free online education resources to make it a better fit for learners' interests, goals, and learning styles.  High quality online educational content is being generated by an increasing number of agencies and a lot of this content is freely available throughout the web. However, what is lacking is the customization of this ever-growing content to meet an individual user's specific learning needs. There is a strong need in the market to leverage the world's online educational content and build a web-based product with the ability to aggregate educational content from a wide variety of sources and provide it to the user with a high degree of personalization. Incorporating user goals, interests, past behaviors of learning, and user interactions into the users profile are important for providing the user with highly specific recommendations and creating a personalized experience. The use of machine learning and big data analytics, as well as other state of the art techniques will be key components in building such a product.</AbstractNarration>

There is a strong need in the market to leverage the worldÆs online educational content and build a vendor agnostic cloud-based Personalized Learning Network. The aim of our Phase I project was to create a prototype of such a system.  During Phase I all technical and commercial goals were met as seen at the website https://www.upgrademeinc.com. Key components developed during Phase I include  Aggregated more than 800,000 freely available online resources. Applied advanced analytics to categorize this online content into thousands of sub-categories.  Built the ability to create question banks on any topic, publish it into the system and show appropriate related online resources, adding immensely to the value of the online content. Added an ability for a user to time-annotate videos on the site with the ability to go back to the specific time on that video. These annotations could be kept private as notes or can be shared publicly with all users. The system keeps a complete history of questions answered by a user and results for a particular topic. The system adapts the questions to a userÆs learning behavior, and shows appropriate online videos, questions, and question sets to augment the learning experience for a user. We were able to demonstrate the complete cycle of monetization by introducing online credit card processing and trying out the purchase of the question bank or other services, such as essay reviews.
