<AbstractNarration>Surface topography is a fundamental property for the industrial products, and the number of applications keeps increasing, making the need for adequate control of surfaces and understanding of those topography properties. Surface topography characterization techniques are the backbone of broad research areas and industrial applications such as roughness and texture measurements that are dominantly studied by using atomic force microscopes, scanning electron microscopes or touch-triggered stylus profilers. Currently, there is no way to measure or quantify the edge surface topography other than visually, and the edge surface topography properties and characteristics have not been well-documented. There is a knowledge gap in the fundamental understanding of the edge surface topography and on methodologies for its measurement and characterization. This fundamental research program will utilize optical knife edge diffraction characteristics that can enhance signal-to-noise ratio of sensing sensitivity. The successful implementation of this research will potentially lead to a fundamental shift in measurement methodologies that can be used for a variety of edge surface sensing, monitoring, and inspection for atomic force microscopy probes, diamond cutting tools, grinding wheels, spindles, and milling tools. Research findings will be disseminated through publications, technical presentations, and educational activities, including at the university-level and through outreach efforts spearheaded by the investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the fundamental hypothesis by creating a novel measurement and characterization paradigm in order to find fundamental issues in the relationship between the edge surface topography properties with edge diffraction characteristics. The investigators will generate the edge surface topography patterns with various roughness, sharpness, shape, and materials on edges by using 3D printing, precision grinding, diamond scribing, silicon wet etching, and laser scribing processes. Furthermore, the project will study whether multiple edge sensors can be combined to improve edge detection sensitivity, and how those topologies can be instrumented for validation using experimental techniques. The theoretical and experimental activities in this research will be used to discover fundamental sensing limits of edge surface topography metrology techniques. As a result, a deterministic will be built to enable the quantification of the edge surface topography properties and to establish fundamental design principles in edge surface topography for precision sensing applications.</AbstractNarration>

This drives the need for adequate surface control and understanding of those topography properties. Currently, there is no way to measure or quantify the edges surface topography other than visually, and the edge surface topography properties and characteristics have not been well-documented. There is a knowledge gap in the fundamental understanding of the edge surface topography and on methodologies for its measurement and characterization. Additionally, the effect of optical diffraction at the edges can be exploited as a potential mechanism for metrology. The goal of this project is to understand how edges and optical diffraction can be exploited to create so-called meso-scale sensors.</p> <p>Meso-scale sensors lie somewhere between measuring features on a small scale with high accuracy and measuring gross features which are less accurate but are performed over a wide range. In this regime, there a typically few options for technologies at this scale. In some instances, large scale sensors are feasible to use in meso-scale applications but typically their packaging constraints, mass, and cost all detract from their use. Optical knife-edges can potentially be used to bridge this technology gap, both from a fundamental perspective but also from packaging, mass, and cost perspectives as well.&nbsp;</p> <p>As part of our analytical approach, we established a Gaussian propagation model of the knife-edge based displacement sensor. Using edge-diffraction theory, we modeled the diffraction pattern as a function of the practical parameters. These included the aperture width, input beam characteristics (waist, wavelength), and distance to the detector plane. In addition to the optical aspects, we also modeled the electrical properties of the detector, integrating the irradiance incident on a simulated detector to account for three things: pixilation of the detected pattern, pixel size, and separation distance between the pixels. Pixel size and pixel separation can both contribute to non-linearities in measurements because information can be lost either by inadequate spatial sampling or by missing the light between the pixels. Additionally, our model was able to simulate large count pixel sensors, simulating CCDs, as well as quadrant photodiodes. Because CCDs typically have &lt;100 Hz measurement bandwidth, we also sought measurement configurations that would allow for high bandwidth measurements that enable stage dynamics to be measured. The quadrant photodiode was modeled using a range of electrical properties to model the effect of detector noise.&nbsp;</p> <p>As part of the experimental validation, we sought to confirm the measurement sensitivity as a function of the knife-edge parameters, which ultimately was successful. Also, considering we used a straightness measurement as our platform, we focused on establishing a methodology that would allow us to probe the accuracy of the measurement, irrespective of the stage used in the measurement.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Research Findings</strong></p> <p>There is a significant tradeoff between knife-edge aperture size, standoff distance and measurement nonlinearity. As one might expect, a smaller aperture causes stronger diffraction. This creates a high sensitivity measurement when the aperture is close to the source and detector. However, if the separation distance between the knife-edge and detector needs a fair amount of distance, this reduces the sensitivity. In the context of a straightness measurement, where the laser source and detector are typically fixed in space, the distance between the knife-edge and detector plain can vary considerably (um scale to 100&rsquo;s of mm). The higher sensitivity, counterintuitively, also leads to lower measurement non-linearity. This is because the non-linearity is assessed, in our case, at a given positional location. But with the global sensitivity of the measurement changing, this can be difficult to calculate, especially in real time. In the context of our work, we found that choosing a knife-edge size that results in nominally the same measurement sensitivity for the desired measurement range typically results in &lt;3% non-linearity and better than 1% non-linearity for advanced fitting methods.</p> <p>Beam size had a strong contribution to the measurement performance, particularly sensitivity and non-linearity. We found that smaller beam sizes contributed to both a higher sensitivity <em>and</em> lower non-linearity. Typically, one would expect that higher sensitivity would lead to higher non-linearity. The reasoning behind this effect is quite intriguing. With a smaller beam waste, the intensity is more greatly concentrated in a smaller area (higher irradiance). The smaller beam diameter also increases the diffraction at the knife-edge. With a larger beam diameter, the wavefront is flatter, meaning the diffraction is not as strong. Also, with a larger beam diameter, the irradiance over a given area can spatially fluctuate as the laser operates. While we use a differential detection method that suppresses some of this noise, it still is apparent and increases the baseline background noise. In both cases, however, the impact on non-linearity was less than the influence of the knife-edge size.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Ellis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605145667_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605145667_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Stage Coordinate System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605145667_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Stage Coordinate System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Three linear degrees of freedom of linear stage motion.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chen Wang, PhD</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Ellis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Stage Coordinate System</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605208440_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605208440_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Quadrant Photodiode"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605208440_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Quadrant Photodiode"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The relative position change makes the optical power distribution on the detector change, thus leading to changes in output voltage.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chen Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Ellis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Quadrant Photodiode</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605276455_Image3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605276455_Image3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Straightness Measurement"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605276455_Image3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Straightness Measurement"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The configuration of the 2D straightness measurement system using a 2D knife-edge.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chen Wang, PhD</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Ellis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Straightness Measurement</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605405221_Image4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605405221_Image4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Intensity Distribution"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1463458/1463458_10390608_1515605405221_Image4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Intensity Distribution"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The intensity distribution of the beam at different z positions.
