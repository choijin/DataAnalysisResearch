<AbstractNarration>A three-day workshop will be held at the University of Colorado-Boulder in Spring 2014 involving 25 early-career Earth scientists with a focus on the potentials for utilizing the next generation of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) analysis techniques to answer research questions across the transdisciplinary boundaries of Critical Zone (CZ) science: hydrology, ecology, geomorphology, and geology. LiDAR technology is capable of resolving vegetation, terrain, and snowpack data at extremely high resolutions using ground-based (terrestrial) and aircraft-mounted laser ranging equipment. The growth of LiDAR data collection has outpaced the potential for CZ scientists to learn about new analysis techniques needed for research applications, which has left the CZ community 'data-rich' but 'information-poor' regarding LiDAR data. The workshop is therefore an important opportunity for early-career scientists to meet and learn about transformative LiDAR analysis tools and better utilize the LiDAR datasets already collected by the National Science Foundation's Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network and similar CZ field sites from around the world. The workshop has three clear objectives: 1. Inform early-career CZ scientists on cutting-edge LiDAR analysis techniques, 2. Identify opportunities to apply LiDAR analysis techniques across the disciplinary boundaries of CZ science, and 3. Develop a five-year vision for advancing CZ science with new LiDAR data products that is articulated in a discussion paper. For one day of the workshop the instructors will rotate between three topical groups: 1. Watershed hydrology, 2. Forest ecology and management, and 3. Geomorphic landforms and lithology. The second half of the workshop will be spent synthesizing these ideas into a vision for advancing CZ science using transdisciplinary LiDAR analysis techniques to be published in a top-level peer-reviewed Earth science journal. The workshop offers a unique opportunity to develop collaborations among multidisciplinary early-career CZ scientists working with LiDAR data from around the world and engage the wider CZ community using course materials and journal publications.</AbstractNarration>
