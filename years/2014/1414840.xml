<AbstractNarration>This project aims to understand how changes in community interactions above- and below-ground alter ecosystem function. As an example, Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) are plant mutualists that help maintain plant function, especially under environmental stress. Little is known about broad-scale diversity patterns of mycorrhizal fungi, which hinders our ability to predict how communities will respond to climatic change. Using an observational and experimental approach this project will explore how climatic change and species interactions alter mycorrhizal community structure and ecosystem function at several sites worldwide. This work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jin-Sheng He at Peking University, a world authority in climate change and ecosystem ecology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand how above- and below-ground communities will respond to climatic warming, this study will use a series of observational plots as well as a manipulative warming (+2.5 degrees ambient temperature) Ã— dominant plant species removal (to restructure plant communities) experiment along elevational gradients. This study will attempt to answer two main questions: (1) What biotic and abiotic factors structure arbuscular mycorrhizal communities along elevational gradients, and (2) how will these communities respond to warming and changes in plant communities. By combining different sites worldwide, this project will be able to understand common patterns in current and future plant/mycorrhizal distributions worldwide. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

Synopsis of Project: Communities of plants and soil organisms are changing in response to climatic change and these changes will likely alter the ecosystem functions on which humans rely on. This project aimed to understand how changes in community interactions between aboveground and belowground organisms alter ecosystem function.

To understand how above- and belowground communities respond to ongoing climatic warming, I established a series of observational plots as well as a manipulative warming (+2.5&deg; ambient temperature) &times; dominant plant species removal (to restructure plant communities) experiment along an elevational gradient to answer two questions: (1) What biotic and abiotic factors structure soil fungal communities along elevational gradients and (2) How will these communities respond to warming and changes in plant communities.     Brief Results: Although the warming x dominant removal experiment is a multi-year, long-term experiment with very little results to this point, within the observational sites, I have found that 1) plant community composition shifts significantly from low to high elevation, 2) overall plant community diversity decreases 50% from low (3200m) to high elevation (4100m), and 3) dominant fungal types (AMF/DSE), shift from low to high elevation, with AMF being more abundant at low elevation sites and DSE being more abundant at high elevation sites.

Because this experiment is replicated across sites globally, we will be able to compare warming effects on carbon dynamics in a variety of environmental contexts.     Broader impacts: This project allowed four undergraduates at the University of Tennessee to gain valuable research experience. These students were able to analyze fungal colonization from roots that were collected in China. These students have since been included in published abstracts, have themselves presented research f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
