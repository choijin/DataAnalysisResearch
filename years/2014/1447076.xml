<AbstractNarration>The Chemical, Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism program supports work by Professor Gerald Meyer at Johns Hopkins University to carry out fundamental studies on the mechanisms of photo-initiated bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions at molecular-semiconductor interfaces relevant to solar fuels generation.  Proposed studies will specifically focus on quantification of the electron transfer behavior of molecules at semiconductor interfaces and correlation of this behavior with charge transfer kinetics relevant to the formation of metal-ligand and carbon-carbon bonds.  The proposed studies are fundamental in nature, but are directly relevant to the development of efficient photocatalytic materials.  The molecules and materials proposed will enable one to address long-standing fundamental interfacial science questions relevant to solar energy conversion in molecular detail that was not possible even twenty years ago.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through participation in this fundamental research, students at the undergraduate and graduate level will receive intensive training in characterization of the kinetics and thermodynamics of molecular-semiconductor interfaces.  This proposal will train students in interdisciplinary areas with particular focus on molecular coordination chemistry, catalysis, photochemistry, and photoelectrochemistry.  Results from these studies are envisioned to one day enable the rational molecular-level design of integrated materials capable of harvesting sunlight, vectorial charge separation, and multi-electron transfer catalysis to form useful fuels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the last quarter-century the energy expenditure rate has been directly correlated with rapid population growth, while ice-core data links global temperature and CO2 gas concentrations.  The ~ 400 ppm CO2 levels of today exceed any value attained over the past half million years. Therefore, even if an unlimited source of fossil fuels existed, there would be serious environmental concerns associated with its continued use. The sun alone can provide all present and foreseeable energy requirements.  However the cost would be prohibitive with today?s photovoltaic technologies.  Thus there exists a real need for inexpensive photovoltaics.   This Project focused upon materials that have been optimized at the molecular level for applications in solar energy conversion.   The question of whether molecules can be used for practical applications in solar energy conversion remains an unresolved issue.  Top scientists in the field disagree.  Some feel that molecules are inherently too fragile to survive under ambient sunlight conditions, while others look at the success of natural photosynthesis and argue that it can be done.  This Project asserts that molecules can one day be utilized for such practical applications and that they will offer advantages that inorganic materials like silicon cannot.  The caveat is that the details of the molecules and the materials must be understood in much more detail than is currently available.  In this Project, researchers specifically addressed the photo-stability of a specific class of molecules based on transition metal compounds that absorb light across the visible region.  It was found that unwanted photochemical reactions that were known to occur in fluid solution were absent over the temperature range investigated when the molecules were incorporated into oxide materials.  The discovery of an increased stability was not anticipated and is encouraging for future applications.  Another source of instability arises from the manner in which the molecules are linked to the materials.  In one unwanted extreme, the linkage could simply break when placed in the sun.  Results from this Project revealed a new method for linking molecules to oxide materials that have some significant advantages over existing approaches.  The transition metal compounds that are most optimal for solar energy conversion are based on ruthenium, which is an expensive and rare metal.  In order to one day achieve inexpensive photovoltaics alternative molecules must be identified.  In this Project, transition metal compounds based on cobalt were identified as a plausible alternative.  Cobalt is about 20,000 times more abundant than is ruthenium in the earth?s crust and is hence far less expensive.  While the cobalt compounds identified in this Project efficiently harvest solar energy and initiate the first electron transfer reaction necessary for the generation of electrical power, they still require further optimization before they can be tested in operational solar cells.  Indeed an important aspect of this Project was to develop models from which the electron transfer properties of molecules linked to materials can be accurately modelled and predicted.  In summary, this Project is highly relevant to a specific area of solar energy conversion that utilizes molecules linked to materials.  The results did not fully address the question of whether molecules can be used for practical applications in solar energy conversion.  Nevertheless, they provided new insights into molecular reactions in materials under solar illumination that were surprisingly more stable than were the same molecules in fluid solutions.  New strategies for linking molecules to materials were discovered as well as the utilization of transition metal compounds based on cobalt.  Hence this Project revealed many new details of solar light harvesting with molecules linked to surfaces.          Last Modified: 08/02/2016       Submitted by: Gerald J Meyer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
