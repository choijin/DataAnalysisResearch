<AbstractNarration>This research addresses questions about racial and ethnic prejudice in criminal trials. Reviews of convictions and sentencing in actual cases, and findings from trial simulation experiments, provide evidence of discrimination against minorities.  National polls and media stories reveal that prejudice remains prevalent in America.  But research has provided little insight into how prejudice operates in the courtroom and has not identified critical factors that increase or decrease discrimination.  Through a series of experiments involving trial simulations, the project seeks better theoretical understanding of how and when a defendant's race/ethnicity influences jury decisions.  It also aims to identify interventions that lessen courtroom bias, thereby providing policy and practice suggestions to the legal community.  These are important undertakings in a diverse society that seeks equal justice for all.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight trial simulation experiments will be conducted in which Black, Hispanic, and White jury-eligible citizens serve as mock-jurors.  They will provide verdict preferences and other impressions after reviewing a trial in which the defendant is a member of either their racial/ethnic group (an "ingroup" defendant) or one of the other groups (an "outgroup" defendant).  In some experiments, mock-jurors will also deliberate.  Social-psychological theory guides the research and offers a framework for integrating diverse findings from sociology, criminal justice, criminology, and psychology.  Based on social-psychological theory, a sense of threat -- to social identity, cultural worldview, or security -- should increase discrimination in the form of greater perceived guilt and convictions of outgroup defendants.  Prejudice is understood to exist at an unconscious or implicit level, even among many who consciously reject prejudice.  To assess the impact of these factors, some experiments examine whether discrimination increases when participant-jurors experience these threats through information encountered prior to the trial.  Additional experiments focus on ways to reduce discrimination, including judges' instructions to guard against prejudice and the opportunity to deliberate. Results will inform decision making in the criminal justice system.</AbstractNarration>
