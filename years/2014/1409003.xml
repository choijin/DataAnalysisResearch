<AbstractNarration>This project is based on two theses: (1) autonomous robotic manipulation requires a large repertoire of actions; and (2) autonomous manipulation does not decouple into separate arm and hand functions. The project's goal is to establish the principles and techniques to endow a robot with a large repertoire of manipulative actions, many of them involving an intimate coordination of arm and hand.  The approach is to develop these principles and techniques using physics-based models as well as machine learning of empirical models.  The project is developing and testing these principles and techniques by attacking several challenge tasks. The work is organized to address three primary challenges: (1) identifying actions; (2) modeling actions; and (3) orchestrating actions.  For the first challenge, identifying actions, the project is adapting previous physics-based manipulation research, along with ordinary robotic engineering of behaviors inspired by humans and existing robotic systems.  For the second challenge, modeling actions, the project is augmenting physics-based models work with empirical stochastic modeling drawn from previous applications of machine learning.  For the third challenge, orchestrating actions, the project is adapting previous work on sensor-based planning and control. The project's expected broader impacts includes more capable robots, which will simplify deployment, enable new applications and improve existing applications, which ultimately serves to improve productivity, services, and national economic competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project goal was to establish the principles and techniques to endow a robot with a large repertoire of manipulative actions.  This includes identifying several actions, modeling the effect of these actions, and developing the planning techniques to sequence these actions to produce the desired goals.  Many manipulative actions include an element of planar sliding, such as when you push a couch across the floor, or when you let an object slide or pivot between your fingertips.  The project produced several new results on planar sliding.  One of the papers led by PhD student Jiaji Zhou demonstrated a faster way for robots to learn such actions, and won the best paper prize at the biggest robotics conference.  Another paper led by PhD student Eric Huang solved a problem that had remained unsolved for over 30 years:  to identify all possible motions of a planar slider being pushed. A paper by PhD student Chris Dellin on lazy evaluation for speeding up motion planning won the best paper award at a top planning conference and solved another open problem of developing a provably edge-optimal forward-search algorithm [A* is vertex-optimal].  Additional work examined the extent to which a system with a sufficiently rich repertoire of actions can shroud its intentions from an observer.  The impact of this work is quite broad.  Some of the results have already been taken up in course curricula.  Some results will ultimately find their way into applications.  The project also supported a prominent survey of robotic manipulation, which can support entry into the field by new students or by established researchers wishing to move into the field.  The project also provided professional training and support for several students, including underrepresented minorities.
