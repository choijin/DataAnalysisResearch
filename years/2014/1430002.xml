<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a research cruise to perform geologic studies in the area under and surrounding the former Larsen B ice shelf, on the Antarctic Peninsula. The ice shelf's disintegration in 2002 coupled with the unique marine geology of the area make it possible to understand the conditions leading to ice shelf collapse. Bellwethers of climate change that reflect both oceanographic and atmospheric conditions, ice shelves also hold back glacial flow in key areas of the polar regions. Their collapse results in glacial surging and could cause rapid rise in global sea levels. This project characterizes the Larsen ice shelf's history and conditions leading to its collapse by determining: 1) the size of the Larsen B during warmer climates and higher sea levels back to the Eemian interglacial, 125,000 years ago; 2) the configuration of the Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet during the LGM and its subsequent retreat; 3) the causes of the Larsen B's stability through the Holocene, during which other shelves have come and gone; 4) the controls on the dynamics of ice shelf margins, especially the roles of surface melting and oceanic processes, and 5) the changes in sediment flux, both biogenic and lithogenic, after large ice shelf breakup. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include graduate and undergraduate education through research projects and workshops; outreach to the general public through a television documentary and websites, and international collaboration with scientists from Belgium, Spain, Argentina, Canada, Germany and the UK. The work also has important societal relevance. Improving our understanding of how ice shelves behave in a warming world will improve models of sea level rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supported under NSF's International Polar Year (IPY) research emphasis area on "Understanding Environmental Change in Polar Regions".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This project was the first program funded by the new Antarctic Integrated System Science program. As such it represented a unique opportunity to investigate the interactions amongst various earth systems as they related to the collapse and history of the Larsen Ice Shelf (Figure 1). Beginning in 1998 the Larsen Ice Shelf began a series of break up events culminating in the catastrophic collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002. These events were clearly driven by climate warming observed across the region and documented from historical records. What drove this project was the observation that the collapse events were unprecedented in the longer term history of the larger of the ice shelf systems.     Since ice shelves regulate access of marine biological processes across the coastal ocean and shelf and because they are by themselves integral components of the earth's frozen sphere (the cryosphere) these events changed in fundamental ways the ecosystems and glacial balance of the region. The event also opened up regions of the seafloor to direct observation and sampling which otherwise would have only been available via very expensive and resource intensive investigations. For these reasons two research cruises were sent to the area in order to completely document and test scientific ideas related to the biology, glacial, and ocean history of the region.     Our results were combined with on-going studies from collaborating national programs in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Korea. Our more significant set of results includes observations of the following:     1) The loss of glacial ice from the Antarctic Peninsula following the ice shelf collapse was so large that it caused the earth's crust to rebound at rates of a few cm per year. This means that the earth here responds more rapidly than geologists thought, to changes in the volume (mass) of glacial ice.      2) The instability of the ice shelf and its collapse was not related to changes in the glacial position on the sea floor or instability of what is termed the "grounding line". Rather, the ice shelf collapse was more clearly a response to surface climate change (warming). This conclusion adds complexity to how earth scientists view the overall stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet as a whole. This helps the scientific community gauge how rapidly the Ice Sheet might contribute to a rise in sea level in the near and far future.     3) Sediment and biotic records have allowed us to constrain past changes in ice shelf cover in areas near to the Larsen Ice Shelf that confirm a global mechanism for glacial expansion and retreat during the so called "Little Ice Age"-- a period assigned historically to between AD 1500-1850.     4) Our combination of seafloor images allow for the reconstruction of the entire ice sheet (Figure 2) during the last global glaciation--an event that drove sea levels lower around the globe with the expansion of large ice sheets in North America and Europe. Around the Antarctic Peninsula this event was associated with the growth of large ice domes or centers of growth out on the submerged continental shelf. This means that glacial expansion around the Antarctic involved not only advance of ice systems from the current coastline or mountains but also independent growth and accumulation of ice in large areas now submerged offshore and lacking any ice cover. This will change how we view the contribution of Antarctic ice to changes in sea level during the termination of the Last Glacial Maximum and how these systems may have responded to water, air temperature, and sea level rise.
