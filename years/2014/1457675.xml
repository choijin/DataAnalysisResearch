<AbstractNarration>Ice storms are powerful winter weather events common to temperate and boreal forest regions worldwide.  These storms are capable of catastrophic short-term ecological and socio-economic impacts on forest ecosystems due to branch breakage and toppling of trees under heavy ice loads.  Their legacy can also persist over the longer-term through changes in forest productivity and species composition; the virulence of forest pests and pathogens; and increased risk of fire due to greater fire fuel loads.  Despite their influential role in shaping forest ecosystems, knowledge of ice storms and their impacts remains limited.  The temporally and spatially unpredictable nature of ice storms has largely confined past investigations to case studies following major storms.  The severity of ice storms in the northeastern United States, Eastern Canada and elsewhere has heightened the need for greater clarity on the role of these storms in shaping future forests.  Scientists at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in NH will conduct a multi-faceted program of research that includes a novel ice storm manipulation experiment, long-term field data, and climate and ecosystem modeling.  This research will provide the scientific community, land managers and the concerned public greater insight on the impacts of these powerful, and extreme winter weather events on the ecosystem dynamics of northern hardwood forests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated program of research is built on a foundation of previous work at Hubbard Brook and the region, including a pilot ice storm experiment conducted in 2012; a significant body of research on the forest ecosystem response to the severe "Ice Storm of 1998"; and a new set of historical climate reconstructions which allow for the quantification of the meteorological conditions that lead to ice storms. Specifically, the investigators will: (i) develop high-resolution global climate model simulations to evaluate the severity, frequency and extent of ice storms under future changing climate; (ii) evaluate short-term (2-3 year) ecosystem response to four different intensities and two frequencies of experimental ice events; (iii) evaluate longer-term (17+ years) response of forest vegetation to the 1998 storm; (iv) use results from the experiment and the long term observations to refine an established forest ecosystem biogeochemical model to simulate ice-storm disturbance; and (v) use the results from the high-resolution climate simulations to drive the improved biogeochemical model to project future ice storm impacts on ecosystem fluxes and pools of carbon and nitrogen in a northern hardwood forest.  This research will be integrated with broader impacts involving: (i) the use of sensor technology to engage STEM students with disabilities in the study; (ii) a dialog on the impacts of ice storms with local stakeholders; (iii) the production of a video on the making of an ice storm and relevance to extreme events and climate change; and (iv) undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral training.</AbstractNarration>

In the study we: (1) developed high-resolution global climate model simulations to evaluate future severity, frequency and extent of ice storms; (2) evaluated the short-term (2-3 year) forest ecosystem response to four different intensities and two frequencies of experimental ice events; (3) evaluated longer-term (17+ years) responses of forest vegetation to the 1998 ice storm that impacted the Northeast; and (4) used results from the field experiment and climate simulations to improve the forest ecosystem model, PnET-BGC, to simulate future ice storm impacts on ecosystem fluxes and pools of carbon and nitrogen in a northern hardwood forest.</p> <p>Ten 20 x 30m experimental plots were established at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH (Figure 1) in May of 2015. Eight of the ten plots were experimentally treated with ?&Prime;, ?&Prime; and ?&Prime; of ice between the dates of January 18 and February 11, 2016; and then iced the two ?repeat? plots with ?&Prime; of ice on January 14, 2017 (see Photos 1, 2 and 3). Measurements of forest nutrient cycling before (2015) and after (2016-2019) the ice storm treatments, focusing on hydrologic and carbon and nitrogen processes. These and other post-treatment measurements ended after the 2019 growing season or calendar year, with the exception of a few measurements, which we plan to continue in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>We quantified canopy damage from ice storms. Canopy openness, light transmission, and complexity increased significantly relative to pre-disturbance baselines and undisturbed controls (see Photo 4). Canopy changes largely occurred with ice accretion levels greater than 12.7 mm (0.5 in). Two consecutive years ice storm disturbance had marginal, rather than compounding, effects on forest canopy structure. Our findings improve understanding the effects of ice storms on the structural reorganization of the forest canopy.</p> <p>Increases in fine and coarse woody debris were transferred from the forest canopy to the soil under the different icing conditions (see Photo 5). In this forest, little damage occurred below 6.4 mm (0.25 in) radial ice accretion, moderate damage occurred with up to 12.7 mm (0.5 in) of accretion, and significant branch breakage and canopy damage occurred with 19.1 mm (0.75 in) of ice.&nbsp; The icing in consecutive years demonstrated an interactive effect of ice storm frequency and severity as some branches damaged in the first year of icing appeared to remain in the canopy and then fall to the ground in the second year of icing. These results have implications for National Weather Service ice storm warning levels, and provide information on ice-load related forest debris that will be useful to municipalities creating response plans for current and future ice storms.</p> <p>We anticipated an increase in the export of nutrients in soil water, but have not observed any significant change in soil solution concentrations in response to the experimental treatments. We did observe large changes in atmospheric mercury inputs and gaseous loss following the icing treatment.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>Over the course of this project, broader impacts activities have included: (1) media outreach; (2) direct stakeholder engagement; (3) a ?Smart Forests and Universal Design for Learning? program at the University of Southern Maine; and (4) mentoring undergraduate and graduate students and post doctorate researchers.</p> <p>A stakeholder symposium was convened on March 6, 2020 at a science center in Concord, New Hampshire. The goal of the symposium was to share results and engage in dialogue about ice storms, their effects, and our research with professionals from a variety of stakeholder groups, including: state policymakers, emergency responders, weather forecasters and researchers, foresters, arborists, woodlot owners, electric utility professionals, science educators, and local media. The two-hour event featured a series of coordinated presentations followed by an extended discussion with the 48 participants at the event. Results from a post-event survey, returned by 25 participants, indicate that the event increased stakeholder knowledge and awareness of current ecological research, that stakeholders perceived the ice storm research as relevant to them, and that the symposium format and presentations were effective and of high quality.
