<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deformation properties of polymer glasses are critical for applications but are poorly understood at a fundamental level.  Polymer glass deformation is almost always non-linear and is complicated by the non-equilibrium nature of the initial state of the material.  Changes in molecular mobility during the deformation of a polymer glass are intimately connected with the nonlinearity of the mechanical response; to a first approximation, the flow of a polymer glass is made possible by the increased mobility of polymer segments.  Researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison will use an optical technique to directly measure segmental mobility during the deformation of poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene glasses.  The role of temperature in deformation-induced mobility will be investigated.  In addition, using reversing strain deformations, the competition between deformation and aging in adjusting the position of the polymer glass on the potential energy landscape will be investigated. The validity of purely mechanical estimates of segmental mobility during deformation will be evaluated. The overall objectives of the proposed research are to enhance the fundamental understanding of polymer glass deformation and to test current theoretical approaches and computer simulations.  A better understanding of polymer glass deformation will also influence research on the deformation of other glassy materials including metallic glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer glasses play an important role in society due to their low density, their useful mechanical properties, and the low energy input required for molding.  They are encountered in everyday life as safety glasses, bulletproof glass, automobile headlamp covers, and as major structural components in modern aircraft (e.g., the Boeing 787).  In all these applications, the polymer glass must be stiff but also should not break in response to large forces.  This project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison seeks a fundamental understanding of this behavior and will likely lead to an improved ability to predict the response of polymer glasses to various forces.  Better predictions are expected to lead to new applications for these materials particularly where lightweight materials are important (e.g., transportation). In addition, the funding of this proposal will advance the training of graduate students and high school students, through the integration of materials research and education activities. Each summer a polymer materials curriculum, developed for educational outreach, will be presented as a thirty-hour course for 15 high school juniors, most of whom will be from groups that have been underrepresented in engineering and science.  The goal of this outreach program is to develop interest in science/engineering and to develop skills required for success in college.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The stiffness and toughness of polymer glasses are important for many applications but these properties are difficult to predict.  In comparison to metals and other hard materials, polymer glasses are solids that have outstanding transparency and can be molded into nearly arbitrary shapes with low energy input. Polymer glasses are lightweight materials, which results in fuel savings in transportation applications.  As a result of these features, polymer glasses are a major market in the U.S., accounting for more than $20 billion/year in sales.  At present, the response of a polymer glass to mechanical deformation cannot be accurately predicted. Thus it is difficult to know how a polymer glass or a polymer glass composite might respond to stress and temperature changes many years after manufacture. The immediate goal of this project was a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling deformation, with the long-term goal of developing models with better predictive power.  It is expected that this approach will ultimately allow new applications of polymer glasses.  The major results of this grant are summarized as follows: 1) The role of temperature on segmental dynamics during polymer glass deformation is now understood.  At all temperatures, deformation acts to speed dynamics but the effect is stronger at high temperature.  The acceleration of segmental dynamics during deformation is a key element contributing to the toughness of polymer glasses. These experiments were made possible by an optical probe method. The optical probe method was validated by experiments on polymer glasses in which the mechanical perturbation was very small.  2) Various methods of determining the segmental dynamics during polymer glass deformation were compared.  The optical probe method provided a better approach than purely mechanical methods.  3) Deformations in which the polymer glass was first extended and then allowed to contract were used to test a theoretical model based upon the potential energy landscape, with the result that the model reasonably accounted for the experimental results except in the very early stages of deformation, well below the yield point.  Personnel supported by this grant worked with the University of Wisconsin-Madison?s PEOPLE program to prepare high school students from under-represented groups for college. Each summer, a three-week course was provided for a total of 45 high school students.   Those supported by this grant refined the materials chemistry curriculum and acted as instructors for the course.        Last Modified: 08/14/2017       Submitted by: Mark D Ediger]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
