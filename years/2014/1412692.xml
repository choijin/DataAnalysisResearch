<AbstractNarration>DNA in cells is continuously being damaged by diverse sources including UV from sun, industrial pollutant, cigarette smoke, and burnt food. These DNA lesions, if left unrepaired, can block important cellular functions and create errors in the genetic code, which may lead to cell death or diseases. This project will tackle two key questions in the field of DNA repair: How do repair enzymes detect a small number of DNA lesions in a huge "genomic ocean" of normal DNA?  Why are some lesions repaired very efficiently, whereas others are not repaired at all?  Using innovative, multi-disciplinary approaches, the research will transform the current static view of the lesion detection process into a 3-D molecular trajectory "movie" in unprecedented detail, thus providing important insights that might eventually lead to development of better ways to prevent the occurrence of DNA damaged-induced cellular defects.  Equally important benefits will come from Integration of the research into creative education and outreach programs to promote cross-disciplinary training in Chemistry and Physics for graduate and undergraduate students and to build educational modules, incorporating crosscutting concepts of the new Next Generation Science Standards, to be used by K-12 teachers and their students in the Chicago Public Schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The XPC complex recognizes diverse, environmentally induced DNA lesions from the genomic DNA, and thus is a key to the initiation of the eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair pathway. The recognition efficiency of the lesions can vary widely depending on the lesion, and certain lesions can evade detection by XPC and thus become resistant to nucleotide excision repair. Previous studies from this research group have suggested a novel "kinetic gating" mechanism in which XPC's ability to discriminate between lesions and normal sites may lie in the kinetics of forming an "open" conformation with the damaged (or normal) nucleotides flipped out. The goal of this project is to rigorously investigate this model by a unique combination of complementary technologies including X-ray crystallography, time-resolved temperature-jump fluorescence spectroscopy and chemical crosslinking. Specific aims are (1) to characterize and compare the dynamics of XPC-induced DNA opening in damaged and normal DNA, (2) to determine the dynamics and structures of lesion recognition using mutant XPC that lack key DNA-binding structural elements, and (3) to elucidate and compare the structure and kinetics of XPC's binding to repair-resistant and -proficient lesions. The results will provide new insights into the dynamics of lesion recognition.  Moreover, the unique approaches developed in this study will also be relevant to other gene regulatory and maintenance systems, and may help uncover a new paradigm of protein functions controlled by transient interactions,  which have escaped previous detection by other methods.</AbstractNarration>

The XPC-Rad23 complex (hereafter XPC) recognizes diverse lesions from the genomic DNA and initiates eukaryotic NER.

How XPC recognizes DNA lesions from undamaged DNA and how certain lesions evade XPC is a major mystery in the field, deterred by a lack of detailed structural and dynamical information on the process of DNA binding and lesion recognition.</p> <p class="Default">In this project, we have aimed at filling the missing gaps through the integration of multiple complementary approaches including X-ray crystallography, laser temperature-jump (T-jump) fluorescence spectroscopy and chemical crosslinking. We have used the yeast XPC ortholog, Rad4, as our model system, as it best enabled us to carry out the detailed structural and mechanistic studies. Our previous study had revealed that Rad4/XPC recognized DNA damage by flipping out two nucleotide pairs in a model DNA damage, forming so-called 'open' conformation (<a title="Min, 2007 #273" href="file:///C:/Users/minju/Box%20Sync/Grant/NSF_2013/report/NSF_Annual%20Report_2018.docx#_ENREF_4">Min and Pavletich 2007</a>). Unexpectedly, the same open conformation was seen also when Rad4 was covalently tethered to normal DNA (<a title="Chen, 2015 #2404" href="file:///C:/Users/minju/Box%20Sync/Grant/NSF_2013/report/NSF_Annual%20Report_2018.docx#_ENREF_2">Chen, Velmurugu et al. 2015</a>). The results pointed to a novel ?<em>kinetic gating?</em> mechanism in which Rad4/XPC's ability to discriminate between lesions and normal sites may lie in the kinetics of forming the open conformation. With this funding, we have made several seminal discoveries on how the kinetic gating mechanism may be brought about, as summarized below. &nbsp;</p> <p class="DataField11pt-Single">First, after discovering that it takes many milliseconds for Rad4 to 'open' mismatched DNA used as a model DNA lesion, we questioned how such 'opening' of a lesion would be possible for the protein when it scans along the DNA in search for DNA lesions. Using single-molecule microscopy, we subsequently uncovered that Rad4 scans the DNA nonspecifically via 1-D diffusion, spending ~1-600 microseconds per base-pair (<a title="Kong, 2016 #3005" href="file:///C:/Users/minju/Box%20Sync/Grant/NSF_2013/report/NSF_Annual%20Report_2018.docx#_ENREF_3">Kong, Liu et al. 2016</a>).

Using T-jump, we found that Rad4/XPC may untwist the DNA in hundreds of microseconds timescale when it nonspecifically interacts with DNA (<a title="Velmurugu, 2016 #2554" href="file:///C:/Users/minju/Box%20Sync/Grant/NSF_2013/report/NSF_Annual%20Report_2018.docx#_ENREF_6">Velmurugu, Chen et al. 2016</a>).

This study revealed that the DNA specifically recognized by Rad4 has pre-distorted and dynamically intercoverting structures in solution even in the absence of Rad4. This indicated that Rad4 may rely on the pre-distorted DNA conformations for its specific binding.</p> <p class="DataField11pt-Single">Despite these successes, the field was still lacking a structure for a Rad4 bound to a bona fide lesion substrate that is recognizable in its natural DNA sequence, which we need to move all the other studies forward. To fill this gap, we have determined the crystal structures of Rad4 bound to a major sunlight-induced DNA damage called 6-4 photoproduct. The new structure showed how the 6-4PP is completely flipped out of the DNA double helix by Rad4. 6-4PP is the second most abundant lesions caused by UV. We then used MD simulations to show how the Rad4 initiates the displacement of 6-4PP by causing DNA untwisting, bending and base flipping.
