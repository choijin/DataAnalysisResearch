<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers.  The project at Fayetteville State University (FSU) seeks to adapt a Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) and establish a Hi-Tech Studio classroom as an active and collaborative learning environment to enhance the quality of undergraduate STEM education and to stimulate students' learning in STEM fields.  The goals of the project are to: (1) implement SCALE-UP and Flipped Education in a technology-rich, highly collaborative, hands-on, interactive learning environment; (2) reduce students' failure rate and increase student interest in STEM courses; and(3) build a community of STEM educators at FSU to replicate Hi-Tech Studio Classrooms in other STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCALE-UP will be implemented in the Hi-Tech Studio Classroom at FSU where about 90% of class time is spent in student-led and hands-on activities. Through a partnership with Norh Carolina State University and the Vernier Company, faculty will be trained in implementing this learning approach during the three-year project.  Numerous research studies have shown that if students are more engaged in the learning process, their problem-solving ability and understanding of material are improved.  Through this project, technology and hands-on activities in the classroom will engage students and enhance their learning in STEM fields. Additionally, the inquiry-led approach will increase their problem-solving and critical thinking skills.  One of the project outcomes is that students will obtain a sense of discovery that motivates them to remain in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FSU is an HBCU with a student body that is 66% African American. Females make up 70% of the student population.  By summer 2017, more than 1000 students (50 class sections) will be impacted by the project. Even more students will benefit from the project by further implementation of the Hi-Tech Studio classroom in other STEM and non-STEM courses on campus in the near future.  In addition, one Postdoctoral Teaching Associate and at least 50 Learning Assistants will be mentored.  The project will be evaluated both formatively and summatively to assess the effectiveness of the implementation at FSU.  Evaluation results and lessons learned will be disseminated through published papers, presentations, and seminars through linkages to other STEM institutions, including area K-12 schools.  Potentially, the results of the evaluation and dissemination activities will further contribute to the current body of literature on the SCALE-UP/Flipped Classroom pedagogy, particularly at minority-serving institutions, in addition to producing highly engaged undergraduate STEM students in chemistry and physics classes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>To address the high failure (DFIW) rates in General Chemistry I and II courses (CHEM 141/CHEM 161), the Department of Chemistry and Physics implemented the Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) into trial sections from Fall 2015 to Spring 2018, funded by the National Science Foundation HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project (TIP) grant entitled ?Hi-Tech Studio Classroom at Fayetteville State University? (Award No:&nbsp;HRD-1436613). The SCALE-UP method is a hybrid online/flipped-learning technique, in which students are initially exposed to the content through instructional videos which are viewed at home, while they apply the concepts in the Hi-Tech Studio Classroom through groupwork assignments. The students are assigned to groups of three members based on exam scores, pairing higher performing students with lower performing ones. Normally, two learning assistants, who are undergraduate students that have completed the course with a minimum grade of B, are assigned to the course to assist the instructor in guiding groups to correct understanding on the in-class worksheets, keeping the groups on task to ensure that the groups are working at a diligent pace, assist in grading assigned notes from the instructional videos, and provide outside tutoring and review for students in the class. One of the most significant accomplishments of the grant is the establishment of a high-tech student-centered active learning environment, or Studio Classroom, on campus in the Fall 2015 semester. The successful implementation of our first Studio Classroom led to the establishment of a second Hi-Tech Studio Classroom in the same building (STB 343) by the NSF HBCU UP Implementation Project: Strengthening Student Success in STEM (S^4) (Award No:&nbsp;HRD-1719472). With the capacity of 36 (STB 343) and 45 (STB 435) students, the two Studio Classrooms are currently housing several flipped, semi-flipped, and conventional STEM (e.g., biology, chemistry, computer science, and math) and non-STEM (e.g., social work, psychology etc.) courses. With the completion of the comprehensive renovation in Lyons Science building, two additional Hi-Tech Studio Classrooms will be available on campus. With the generous support from the NSF and successful implementation of the first Hi-Tech Studio Classroom, the active learning environment culture is being accepted by many people on campus, including the upper administrators. Since Spring 2015, 58 students have been employed as undergraduate learning assistants (LAs). The primary results show that the SCALE-UP sections have achieved lower DFIW rates (25-35%) than for the traditional lecture courses (55-65%) for CHEM 141 and CHEM 161. Additionally, the students in the SCALE-UP section have demonstrated better comprehension of the content, as measured by higher percentage of correct responses on the American Chemical Society (ACS) standardized exams than the traditional lecture courses, often by 5-10%. Furthermore, student attendance has increased to 85-95% in SCALE up sections.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/05/2018<br>      Modified by: Cevdet&nbsp;Akbay</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
