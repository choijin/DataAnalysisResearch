<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project: If successful, this research will have immediate social, economic, and scientific impact. This project will expand the field of prosthetics and create new research direction in prosthetics. It will result in a better understanding of prosthetic suspension and volume limb loss. This research will create a much needed intelligent method for suspension of prosthetic limbs, and therefore improve the daily lives and enable broader range of activity for amputees. The research will directly result in a commercial product that will be disseminated locally in Hawai?i and eventually throughout the nation. Hawai?i has a thriving network of biotechnology industry, and this project will expand the network. The project will support a graduate student and inevitably benefit the Native Hawaiian community throughout the state of Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project sets a completely new direction in the area of prosthetics and will advance the knowledge and understanding of human-device interaction. Currently available vacuum systems have problems including loss of seal, maintenance of mechanical or electrical pump, reduced range of motion across joint, and potentially detrimental force application to residual limb tissue if vacuum is not applied correctly. The hypothesis is that an intelligent electromagnetic suspension system can be made that improves the connection between the amputee and the prosthetic and reduces limb volume loss. The research objective is to prove the concept of electromagnetic suspension for prosthetic limbs. To accomplish this, a suspension system with electromagnets embedded in the socket will be developed and incorporated into existing prosthetic limb socket. A feedback loop will be implemented to control the attractive force between the electromagnets and magnetic material embedded in the liner. A microprocessor will be used to control the electromagnets according to pressure sensor output from within the socket. The prototype will undergo functional and mechanical testing; the results of which will show the feasibility of the idea for magnetic attachment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The suspension system for attaching the prosthetic limb to the body is critically important in prosthesis. However, none of the current methods fully satisfy the needs of the user in prosthetic control and control of limb volume changes. There is a need for a new prosthetic design that will prevent, not just accommodate, the volume changes. A new, smart suspension system with the capability to adjust and control the pressure at different points in the prosthetic will provide more comfortable fit, more control over the prosthesis, and better means of curbing limb volume loss. The concept feasibility was proven in Phase 1.  This project will continue to advance prosthetic technology and create new research directions in prosthetics.  Ultimately, the result will be improved quality of life and activity for amputees.   The objective of this project was to prove the concept of a smart electromagnet residual limb management and prosthetic suspension system.  To accomplish this, a suspension system with electromagnets embedded in the socket was developed and incorporated into existing prosthetic limb sockets, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.  A feedback loop was implemented to control the attractive force between the electromagnets and magnetic material embedded in the liner.  A microprocessor was used to control the electromagnets according to pressure sensor output from within the socket.  The prototype underwent functional and mechanical testing; the results of which prove the feasibility of the idea for magnetic attachment.    The experimental setup of the tesion testing of the system is shown in Fig. 3.  The second test was done to measure the response of the system to an increasing pressure and normal force on the pressure sensors.  An inflatable bladder was placed in the liner and filled with air.  The pressure in the inflatable was gradually increased to 80 KPa (11.6 psi).  The force measured by the pressure sensors and pulse width modulated voltage supplied to the electromagnets are shown in Fig. 4.  Most of the force sensors and electromagnets behaved as expected.  The force started low and, therefore, the voltage started high to maintain the connection between the liner and socket.  As the pressure in the bladder increased the measured force increased and the voltage decreased.  Sensor 8 and corresponding Magnet 8 did not behave this way.  The force measured by Sensor 8 started low and increased as the pressure increased.  Sensor 8 was near the top of the socket.  It is thought that the clamping system was pressing against Sensor 8 before the test began and as the pressure increased, the clamp was pushed off of the sensor.  The results demonstrate the value of such system.  The forces acting on the limb can be monitored and adjusted at strategic points with minimal cost.  This demonstrates the idea of a smart suspension system.         Last Modified: 03/17/2016       Submitted by: Kaione R Newton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
