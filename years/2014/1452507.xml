<AbstractNarration>IIA 14-52507&lt;br/&gt;Winnacker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) is an international partnership aimed at promoting basic research on the complex mechanisms of living organisms.  The current members are the original G-7 members plus Switzerland, Norway, the European Union, South Korea, Australia, India and New Zealand.  Japan and the United States are the principal financial contributors.  The U.S. continues to be the primary beneficiary of the program with a disproportionate amount of both Fellows and grantees coming to the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HFSP, headquartered in Strasbourg, France, provides support through peer-reviewed postdoctoral, early career, and cross-disciplinary fellowships and collaborative research grants.  Postdoctoral fellowships are available for research in foreign laboratories and career development awards are offered for repatriating HFSP fellows.</AbstractNarration>

Academic research institutions in the US are by far the biggest beneficiary of HFSP funding thus providing for a positive return on the US investment in this program.   HFSPÆs funding programs play a unique role in fostering transformative frontier research in international scientific collaborations and they complement the national research missions of each country by funding "science without borders" that is entirely investigator driven. HFSP research grants support international teams of scientists collaborating in a joint project. The fellowship and Career Development Award are geared towards supporting postdoctoral researchers for working abroad and to support their next career step.  The HFSP grant program promotes innovative approaches to basic biological research ranging from molecular studies to systems neuroscience and including many of the areas of interest to NSF.
