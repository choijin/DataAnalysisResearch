<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project improves miniaturization, signal quality and battery life of consumer mobile wireless devices by commercialization of innovative single crystal resonators and acoustic wave filter solutions. Beyond consumer systems, the acoustic resonator technology has applications in industrial, medical, networking and military systems. The global market for bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter components is expected to grow to over $3B by 2016 compared to just $0.8B market in 2011. Such rapid market growth, driven by signal convergence and proliferation of new allocated communications spectrum, creates the opportunity for new market entrants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses a critical component need in today's radio frequency (RF) frontends for technologies such as Mobile Wireless and The Internet of Things.  Arguably, the acoustic wave filter has evolved as the enabler of the RF frontend; it suffers, however, from lossy performance. Current filters can dissipate, as heat, up to half of the RF transmit power thus forcing significant overdesign of the RF power amp.  This increases the complexity of thermal management, and it reduces battery life.  Thus the inefficiency of current filter technologies increase the cost and size of wireless devices.  To address this critical need, the  company proposes a more efficient, lower loss acoustic filter technology.  The research effort includes design, simulation, materials synthesis and fabricated single crystal resonators and bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters using an experimental fabrication process flow and novel circuit layout.  The fabricated resonators will be characterized for acoustic velocity, acoustic coupling and circuit quality factor.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During Phase I Akoustis identified key advantages of our single crystal resonator technology by conducting a comprehensive technical study of group III-Nitride single crystal vs. polycrystalline bulk-mode resonator technology. This study leveraged existing commercial production processes developed for the RF and Power Electronic industries.  In summary, we have made progress in 5 key areas:  Area 1 &ndash; Modeling: Several key milestones were realized creating a foundation for the the tasks proposed in our Phase II effort.  Finite element simulations were performed in COMSOL Multiphysics software to provide insight in material and design experiments and provide theoretical basis for the work. The result was a model demonstrating up to a 50% improvement in device figure of merit (FOM = k2 * Q) utilizing single crystal piezoelectric materials compared to polycrystalline (Figure1).  Second, simulations to predict performance as a function of Aluminum alloy composition were performed to calibrate the measured device level results to the single crystal AlGaN on Si materials used in resonator fabrication.  Finally, initial simulations of the resonator stack were used to demonstrate the desired resonator performance expected from the current resonator fabrication process flow. These models show promising results in-line with targeted performance metrics.  Area 2 - Epitaxial materials: Specifications, Growth, &amp; Characterization: We defined our starting material specifications to focus on product development for specified communication bands, specifically Bands 7 &amp; 41 [2.49 &ndash; 2.69 GHz] and Band 43 [3.60 &ndash; 3.80 GHz]. Structures from multiple sources were evaluated in our wafer fabrication process. In addition, we have performed growths aimed at engineering the epitaxial layer strain, and therefore the piezoelectric properties as a function of growth conditions. The acoustic wave velocity was measured in these single crystal epitaxy structures to validate our hypothesis regarding the improvement of acoustic properties on these films over the incumbent technology. We measured a wide range of acoustic properties based on material vendor (all at or above expected values), this demonstrates the flexibility in design space for epitaxial layers for these applications.  Area 3 - Challenges with packaging approaches, Lessons learned, and pivot to refinement of resonator fundamentals: Our wafer level packaging partners encountered multiple manufacturing and processing delays, adversely impacting our development schedule. Delays were caused by problems with product tolerancing and product reliability.  Our alternative approach leverages die-level integration, reducing the number of mask layers in the device fabrication facility and shrinking the overall product footprint. Akoustis will continue to use the die-level packaging approach as primary path for resonator development and integration, but will maintain an external interposer development path with key vendors to mature this technology. The team shifted focus to the resonator fundamentals and the establishment of a simplified process flow with the goal of decreasing fabrication cycle time to increase our cycles of learning. This process has been successfully demonstrated and is capable of being integrated with either packaging approach in the future (Figure2).  Area 4 &ndash; Improvement in test and measurement system calibration and test methodologies: Resonator metrics (Q &amp; k2eff) are extracted from measured data and are sensitive to the accuracy of RF impedances at the "intrinsic" device plane. Calibration methods were employed to ensure accuracy at the probe plane and de-embedding of parasitic elements was done to ensure accuracy at the intrinsic device plane.  The coupling coefficient (k2eff) is sensitive to the precise values of series and parallel resonance frequencies, therefore we refined our calculation method to align with industry best practices by using ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
