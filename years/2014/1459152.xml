<AbstractNarration>The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) covers 2 million km2 of seafloor, made up of 100 million km3 lavas that erupted rapidly ~120 Ma. This event represented a major heat and mass transfer from the Earth's deep interior to the surface. The cause of this magmatic event and the associated deformation of the plate on which this large load was emplaced are unclear. Recent work by these scientists has identified seismic structure in the mantle beneath the OJP that can only be explained by rock composition that would correspond to recycled oceanic crust. If true, this would suggest that subducted oceanic plates do not complete assimilate in the deep Earth. At least portions can survive the high temperatures and pressures and be caught up in global mantle circulation. Validating the presence of a mechanically strong mantle root beneath the OJP with quantitative estimates of its physical and chemical characteristics is expected to further understanding of the evolution of the oceanic lithosphere and the formation and survival of continental cratonic keels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of scientists from Japan, UK, and US are deploying ocean-bottom seismometers, electromagnetometers, and land based seismic stations on and around the Ontong Java between 2014-2016. This project supports US scientists and students to participate in onshore seismic data collection and analysis of the full amphibious dataset. All the seismic data for the combined projects will be shared among all the team and analyzed in collaboration.  The US scientists will conduct advanced seismic analysis using 3-D full-wave tomography, and characterizations of anisotropy and attenuation. The new results would achieve 1° resolution, much improved over the current ~5° resolution that has led to contrasting interpretations of the distribution of low velocity within the OJP root. Teaching modules will be created and  made available at Carleton College's On the Cutting Edge Geoscience site. Aspects of the data, analysis techniquest, and interpretation will be incorporated in undergraduate and graduate courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Ontong Java Plateau is one the largest volcanic eruptions still preserved today.  Formed 120 millions years ago, it has an diminished uplift and subsidence history assuming it originated from a very large mantle plume.  To determine how the Plateau formed we conducted a seismic tomography experiment using ambient noise data from vertical and horizontal components across a majority of the western Pacific Ocean along with recordings of earthquake data, again using the vertical and horizontal components.  Results of the seismic tomography model show fast seismic wave speeds at near the central portion of the plateau that are faster than expected for normal mantle processes.  The fast wave speeds are likely the result of large percent melting of a pyroxentife source developed as a plume entrained a subducted plate creating a melting residual composed primarilly of garnet and jadeite (clinopyroxene).  The tomography was completed using an iterative approach that utilized Strain Green's Tensors computed from a 3D seismic wave speed model.  Simulations for ambient noise and earthquakes are computed at each iteration and used to updated the seismic wave speed model based on a comparion between data and the expected response from the simulation.   Measurements of the crustal thickness were completed by modelling the waveforms of regional Pn arrivals, which diffract along the boundary between the crust and the underlying mantle.  This modeling effort confirms the plateau's thickness and typical Pn wave speed within the uppermost mantle.  Further investigaitons were conducting of the attenuation structure beneath the plateau using multiply reflected core phases, e.g. ScSScS, using simuations.  These simulations demonstrate a previously hypothesized structure of minimal attenuation is not necessary and might be adversivly affected by complex structure at either the surface or the core-mantle boundary.
