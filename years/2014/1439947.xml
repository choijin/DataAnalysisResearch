<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support a conference focused on Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) planned for June 17-19, 2014, at Carnegie Mellon University, under the sponsorship of the Microanalysis Society (MAS).  EBSD is an important technique that utilizes the diffraction of high-energy electrons to determine the orientations of crystals in natural and synthetic materials. This approach has major applications in both material science and geology related to understanding everything from crystallization processes to microstructures that record material histories and affect material properties (such as strength and conductivity).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous three meetings of this type were held in the U.S. and occurred in May 2008 and May 2010 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and in June 2012 at Carnegie Mellon.  All were extremely successful, where participation grew from ~100 to ~165. The most recent workshop brought together 40 students, over 100 professionals, and 7-12 vendors to exchange information and experiences involving the EBSD technique. We will repeat the format with some modifications for EBSD 2014. The first day is an all-day tutorial aimed at beginners (students and others) who wish to get up to speed with this technique. In the afternoon, there will be more advanced tutorials for more experienced users. Throughout the session, attendees will have the opportunity to see live EBSD demonstrations by all four major EBSD vendors on CMU instruments. The next two days will consist of invited and contributed talks spanning various material science and geosciences topics: materials processing, nuclear materials for energy, high temperature/tectonics, strain, 3D reconstructions and high performance ceramics. These talks and a planned poster session will allow significant participant interaction. Students will particularly benefit from these interactions while also having the opportunity to present their research via oral or poster presentations.  Student attendance is hoped to be increased to ~45. Since 2008, NSF has supported 99 student scholarships for attendance to this conference series.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation provided $12,000 to support the travel costs for students to attend a topical conference held at Carnegie Mellon University from June 19-21 of 2014.  This conference, entitled "EBSD 2014," is sponsored by the Microanalysis Society and gathers students and researchers from around the world to discuss the latest developments in the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique.  EBSD is common method in materials science, metallurgy and geology to study the crystal structure of ceramics, rocks, metals and semiconductors.  This approach utilizes advanced electron microscopes and automated pattern acquisition and analysis using powerful software programs.  There are continuous developments in this field, both by academic/industrial researchers as well as commercial entities that sell EBSD equipment.     This conference features a one-day tutorial on the EBSD approach with guest presentations by a number of international experts.  The following two days are composed of technical symposia where invited presenters, from academia, government research labs and industrial sectors across many disciplines (geology, metallurgy, materials science) highlight new research insights using EBSD.  Attendees also contribute oral presentations as well as poster presentations.  There were a total of 173 attendees to this conference, 41 of which were students.  22 students requested and received travel support using NSF-provided funds.     The conference was very successful, with an excellent technical program.  The tutorial sessions were well attended, and featured opportunities for hands-on EBSD equipment training using the many electron microscopes made available by the Carnegie Mellon University department of Materials Science in coordination with many commercial vendors.  Students presented both oral talks and posters during the technical symposia.     Intellectual merit: EBSD is research method that finds wide utilization in academia, government research, and industry.  Equipment developments and their applications for EBSD are in constant development, making it difficult to keep up with innovations in one field, let alone in the multiple fields that utilize this approach. EBSD 2014 is the fourth in a series of biennial meetings that allow researchers the unique opportunity to share their knowledge, expertise and experience across multiple disciplines and research backgrounds. The exchange of cutting-edge knowledge from materials science, metallurgy and geology offers an excellent opportunity for new users, particularly students training and conducting research, to learn directly from experts.     Broader Impacts: Vendors general provide most training for EBSD users, but often sessions are expensive and rather limited (and usually happen before the user knows the right questions to ask). The one-day tutorial that opens this topical conference not only provides basic training that will be particularly useful to students, but also access to a number of expert users from a variety of fields. In addition, the conference facilitates hands-on training using a number of advanced electron microscopes available at Carnegie Mellon University, thus enhancing students' introduction to EBSD.  Finally, the technical symposia offers an opportunity for students to present their own EBSD-based research work and interact with the leading experts in the field of EBSD.
