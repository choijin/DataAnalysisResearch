<AbstractNarration>The surge in demand for Internet access using smart hand held devices has resulted in the emergence of a multitude of apps and devices, which have diverse requirements and capabilities.  However, underlying policies for scheduling cellular resources are optimized for average or worst case performance, and do not allow end-users to indicate the relative value of resources on the packet level.  Simultaneously, it has become clear that while there are insufficient bandwidth resources for unlimited cellular data plans, the prevailing scheme of degrading access after a certain limit is exceeded is both unpopular and inefficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to bridge the disconnects between user preferences and allocated resources by the use of dynamic market mechanisms that allow for packet-level value determination over time. The objective is to study both primary markets in which service providers sell network access to end-users, as well as secondary markets in which end-users share resources via hot spots and device-to-device networking. While doing so, the project identifies the impact of such packet-scale transactions on the incentives and efficiency of the market at a long time-scale, packet-aggregate level.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project takes an important step towards the systematic design of dynamic mechanisms for resource sharing in wireless communication networks, which would innately account for user preferences and valuations.  The PIs will develop an analytical framework for designing dynamic market-based mechanisms that would implicitly allow the determination of the value of allocating and trading resources among various agents.  The research is organized into three inter-dependent areas:  1) Value Identification and Resource Scheduling in Single-Sided Markets; 2) Utilizing End-User Resources through Two-sided Markets; 3) Policy and Provisioning Decisions.  The dynamic market mechanisms that are developed will be tested via experiments conducted on a smart phone test bed in order to better understand real-world implications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All three PIs are heavily involved in the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, and the proposed work will further strengthen the students? exposure to network control, game theory and optimization.   The project will disseminate results to the public through seminars and summer camps focusing on electrical engineering concepts appropriate for high school level students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Current cellular data scheduling algorithms are designed to meet an average or worst-case quality of service target over connected devices. However, a single cell in a cellular network incorporates diverse traffic characteristics and application requirements; and each device node of the network is equipped with multiple radios with varying resources and capabilities. Simultaneously, service providers need to be able to dynamically provision spectrum for supporting traffic, and be assured of appropriate returns to investment.  In this project, our goal was to develop a systematic analytical framework for designing dynamic market-based mechanisms that implicitly allow the determination of the value of allocating and trading resources to the constituent agents.     The research took a holistic approach in which, on the one hand we used game theoretical methods to construct mechanisms for spectrum sharing at a per-packet and packet-aggregate level, and on the other hand conducted experiments using both off-the-shelf and custom hardware to validate the algorithms developed.  The major results included a novel methodology using mean field game theory to analyze systems with many self-interested interacting agents (such as smart phone users) that need to share common spectrum resources in a both customer-provider as well as peer-to-peer setting, an understanding of how markets for spectrum with both licensed and unlicensed bands operate, as well as systems that implement ultra-low latency scheduling and reinforcement learning-based configuration that show dramatic improvements in user experience for resource intensive activities such as video streaming.     The project also had an important educational component aimed at both students at the different participating universities, as well as the broader society.  Activities included curriculum development related to courses on game theory, optimization and smartphone programming, and K12 outreach via summer camps.  Multiple female and minority students were involved in all aspects of the project ranging from working on course projects to studies leading to graduate degrees.  Hence, integration of under-represented groups into the scientific community was a major focus of the project.           Last Modified: 12/28/2018       Submitted by: Thanh Nguyen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
