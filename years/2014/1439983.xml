<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 1439983&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to partially cover travel and organizing expenses related to the workshop entitled "Workshop on Emerging Directions in Biological Fluid Dynamics" that will be held in Arlington, Virginia, on September 15 and 16, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this workshop is to bring together engineers and scientists, who do not have such a chance in other professional meetings, to define core areas of interest in biological fluid dynamics that are of critical technological and societal importance. The meeting will be attended by both prominent and young scientists in fluid dynamics from around the Nation, who will be discussing future directions of research and research challenges in these research areas. The meeting will focus on addressing challenges that need to be overcome in order to advance the field for the next five to ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 100 attendees are expected to attend, including engineers and mathematicians involved in all aspects of theoretical, computational, and experimental biological fluid dynamics and scientists from adjacent fields including comparative and integrative biology, oceanography, marine science, medicine, molecular and cellular physics, and epidemiology. The American Institute of Physics Publishing (AIP) will publish proceedings from the conference in an open-access format.</AbstractNarration>
