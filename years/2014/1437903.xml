<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed study is to develop multiphase turbulence models based on the kinetic theory for granular flows and utilizing high fidelity simulations. Areas of application of these flows include engines, industrial furnaces, fluidized beds for fossil and renewable energy conversion, and chemical plants (chemical reactors, cracking units, etc.), all of which are important for the competitiveness of the U.S. industry.  The collaborating PIs propose to offer a full implementation of their models and code into commercial (Ansys Fluent) and public (OpenFOAM) platforms, as well as to make their comprehensive database of detailed simulation results available to the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently available models for multiphase turbulence are often based on phenomenological approaches requiring fine-tuning with experimental data. These models have limited predictive capability, preventing their adoption in industry or their generalization for research purposes. This proposal, however, aims at developing and validating a consistent Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model that is grounded on first principles, and, thus, generalizable. The exact RANS equations, as obtained from Kinetic Theory for granular flow, will be integrated to obtain a set of coupled macroscale hydrodynamic equations, which can then be averaged exactly. The terms that need to be approximated in order to close the system of equations will then be obtained with high fidelity Euler-Lagrange mesoscale simulations, already shown to predict accurately turbulent particle-laden flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Fluid Dynamics Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by CIF 21 Software Reuse Venture Fund Program of the CISE/ACI Division.</AbstractNarration>

This database consisted of three flows: (1) cluster-induced turbulence (CIT), a canonical, ubiquitous, yet mostly unexplored particle-laden flow where the production of fluid-phase turbulent kinetic energy results entirely from momentum coupling with finite-size inertial particles undergoing clustering, (2) sheared CIT, i.e., CIT in the presence of a constant mean velocity gradient, which leads to the deformation of particle clusters and to an extra source of turbulent kinetic energy, (3) particle-laden turbulent channel flow, a configuration where a mixture of particles and gas flows between two parallel walls.  The computational study of the three flow configurations has led to the following discoveries: - a new drag correction for two-way coupled Euler-Lagrange simulations that recovers the correct drag law under grid refinement, - an investigation of the transition between mean-shear and drag-coupling production in channels and homogeneously sheared flows, - several advances in Eulerian simulation techniques for far-from-equilibrium particle dynamics, - a study of the convergence properties of particle-laden flow computational techniques, and - a RANS model for strongly coupled particle-laden flows.  The computational developments have been implemented in OpenFOAM, a popular open source CFD package, and released to the public as part of the OpenQBMM project. Additionally, the quadrature-based moment methods developed in this project are implemented in the National Energy Technology Laboratory?s MFiX, an open-source multiphase CFD code.  Key components of the novel numerical methods developed in this project are disseminated in an updated Multiphase Flow course taught by the PI, and recently offered in a GIAN course at IIT Kanpur.
