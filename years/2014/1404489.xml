<AbstractNarration>This award supports fundamental research to advance capabilities of the Near Field Electro-Writing process towards three-dimensional hierarchical structures with sub-micron resolution through innovation in spatial control of the jet. The working principal of this electro-writing process is based on near-field electrospinning process, in which a continuous polymer fiber is electrostatically jetted from solution or melt to a collector in close proximity. Unique to this new process, a piezo-actuated auxiliary electrode will be added near the spinneret to focus and precisely manipulate the jet; conductivity of polymer inks will be monitored; and instability analysis and fiber diameter modeling will be conducted to unlock the fundamentals of this new process. The three PIs will combine their expertise in device engineering, machine dynamics, materials chemistry and processing, mechanics, and instability analysis to analyze the fundamental process mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new process could create complex hierarchical structures with unprecedented accuracy that will benefit many applications in biomedical, micro-electronics, and energy fields. The knowledge obtained from the modeling work will add to the understanding of the physics of sub-micron fiber generation/evolution, its interaction with receiving base and its manipulation and control through external electric fields. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained through research and education activities to become the next generation work force implementing the new tools and capabilities in industry. Electrospinning techniques will be introduced to undergraduate courses as a platform to support student-driven innovations for course projects, which can be spun off to undergraduate research. Results will be disseminated to the community through publications and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, is an exciting manufacturing technology that allows for on-demand production of prototypes and complex parts with no tooling costs. However, this technology is typically limited to minimum feature sizes in the order of 100s of microns. Many applications, such as micro-electronics, surface micro-texturing, and cell scaffolds, require parts with much higher resolution. To overcome the resolution limitation, a novel manufacturing technique to 3D print textures and structures with micron to submicron resolution was developed in this project. The technology, called Near Field e-Writing (NFEW), uses electric fields to continuously produce nanofibers or microbeads that can be stacked to produce three-dimensional structures.</p> <p>In order to achieve micron resolutions three control strategies were implemented: (1) electric field controllers to manipulate fiber deposition, (2) control of stage motion at the turning corners, and (3) jet-tracking in real-time. The use of electric field controllers allows for non-contact high-accuracy manipulation of the fibers during deposition, taking advantage of charged nature of the fibers. By varying the strength of the electric field over time it is possible to produce step features and to minimize the fluctuations in jet position. One of the key points where additional control is needed is at the corners where the stage changes velocity and direction. The use of dwell times at the corners allows one to obtain sharp and repeatable corners. The dwell time causes the stage to wait at the corner and guarantees that the jet can cover its trajectory before changing direction. The final control method is a machine vision mechanism to track the jet bending and jet diameter. This allows the user to monitor the process in real-time.</p> <p>It was necessary to explore how different NFEW process, material, and environmental variables affect the printed structures. Three main process parameters were found to be important: applied electric field, ink flow-rate, and stage speed. The critical ink parameters are viscosity and evaporation rate. The main environmental variable is relative humidity. By controlling these parameters, it is possible to obtain a different morphology (beads, fibers, ribbons) that can be used as building blocks for 3D structures.</p> <p>During the project a self-focusing mechanism was discovered: the jet is attracted to previously deposited beads when the inks are deposited in semi-liquid state. This self-focusing mechanism greatly simplifies the stacking of beads and fibers making multilayer structures much easier to build. This self-focusing mechanism is believed to be caused by the high electrical conductivity of the liquid ink, which allows charge removal, and subsequent polarization of the ink in the electric field due to its dielectric nature.</p> <p>The last focus area of this project was the development of inks and the exploration of substrates that are compatible with the technique. To this end both structural and functional inks were developed. Among functional inks were carbon fiber precursors and conductive polymers. Conductive and semi-conductive substrates such as metals and silicon, respectively, are readily compatible with the NFEW. However, non-conductive substrates such as paraffin and plastics are difficult to print on. It was shown that AC potentials can be used to achieve continuous deposition.</p> <p>Through the successful development of NFEW, a new manufacturing process that has high resolutions and is compatible with a wide range of polymeric inks and diverse substrates was developed. This new technology can be leveraged to change how products are prototyped and manufactured at the micro-scale. Graduate students and undergraduate students were trained to enhance their knowledge and creativity. They were also given the opportunity to collaborate across different disciplines. Results were disseminated through publications, website and lab tours given to local grade school students and visitors from national laboratories and companies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Jian&nbsp;Cao</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404489/1404489_10294415_1533606049941_Fig1-ExperimentalSetup--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404489/1404489_10294415_1533606049941_Fig1-ExperimentalSetup--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404489/1404489_10294415_1533606049941_Fig1-ExperimentalSetup--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic of the 3D Near Field e-Writing Machine</div> <div class="imageCredit">Northwestern University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jian&nbsp;Cao</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 1.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404489/1404489_10294415_1533606512376_Fig2-SampleBuildsv2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404489/1404489_10294415_1533606512376_Fig2-SampleBuildsv2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 2."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404489/1404489_10294415_1533606512376_Fig2-SampleBuildsv2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 2."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Samples made by the 3D Near Field e-Writing process (a) Carbon fiber mats after carbonization.
