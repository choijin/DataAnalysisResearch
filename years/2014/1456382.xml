<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to answer the presidential call to "create digital tutors that are as effective as personal tutors." More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative, and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less comprehensible and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA) practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing teacher decision-making. While the influx of mobile computing devices has enormous potential to help facilitate change in education, the potential is heavily dependent on the availability of proven, research-backed software and services. This project will help close achievement gaps by providing students with adaptive, personalized instruction and also providing teachers with valuable FA techniques, data, and suggestions. More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create significant commercial value within the educational market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create digital learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems to deliver adaptively selected instructional video segments and highly interactive problems, and do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural - as if the learning was occurring in the presence of an actual tutor. The ability of the system to adapt to the needs of an individual student is based upon a real-time assessment of student understanding and leverages cutting edge research from the fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. The proposed research will seek to demonstrate, in a randomized crossover trial, the effectiveness of the adaptive, online system over a control treatment. The researched solutions will also employ novel FA implementations such as collaborative review and white-boarding (via wireless communication), record and playback of teacher work, use of student sentiment, groupings of peers for collaborative work, and models of student understanding that incorporate teacher input (teacher plus software in the FA loop).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This NSF-funded research project supported the design and development of software and digital content for use by mathematics teachers and their students in grades 3-8. It led to the development and delivery of the web-based platform "Woot Math" (www.wootmath.com) that has been widely adopted by teachers in all fifty states and was used by hundreds of thousands of students in the last school year. The platform has allowed significant advances in our fundamental understanding about how kids learn mathematics and about how digital media and software tools might better facilitate that learning. Numerous scholarly publications and presentations by the research team and our collaborators have helped to disseminate the findings to the field and to advance fundamental knowledge in this rapidly expanding domain. Two NSF-funded randomized controlled trials have contributed gold-standard evidence that the software and content developed under this grant improve student outcomes. The first of these trials enrolled over 350 students in grades 3 through 8 and tested whether the software based adaptivity and formative assessment capabilities improved student?s mathematical learning. It found that these features resulted in meaningful learning gains for students. The second trial enrolled over 500 students in grades 4 and 5 and tested whether the use of Woot Math by classroom teachers improved student outcomes when compared against a business-as-usual control condition. This trial found that the rate of learning doubled when Woot Math was used relative to the control condition. The ability of the platform to adapt to the needs of individual students was based on real-time assessments of student understanding and leveraged and advanced research from the fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data. The developed platform has advanced the state-of-the-art for adaptive, personalized learning with digital media. A variety of student and teacher survey results show that both groups believe Woot Math is an effective tool in helping kids learn mathematics and that it is highly engaging and easy to use in the context of a math classroom.
