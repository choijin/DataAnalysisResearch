<AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research is in support of the Gordon Research Conference/Gordon Research Symposium titled "2014 GRC/GRS Biointerface Science: Engineered Biomolecular Interfaces" to be held on June 14-20, 2014 in Il Ciocco, Italy. This award is cofunded by the Nano- Biosensor program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (ENG/CBET). The objectives of this Conference are: 1) organizing a strong scientific program on Biomolecular Engineered Interfaces; 2) bringing together a diverse group of speakers comprised of both established leaders and young researchers with a focus on underrepresented minority scientists and women; 3) promoting cross-disciplinary fertilization of new ideas in Biointerface Sciences; and 4) creating a sense of community by promoting interaction among scientists of junior faculty members, students, postdocs with prominent senior investigators in the field. This Conference will address physical science and engineering of surfaces that interfaces with biology, and would provide new opportunities that will advance fundamental understanding in building a model for synthetic cells "bottom-up," and rewiring of intercellular interactions. Devising novel and active material interfaces that control and manipulate cellular behavior would be the other outcome. The Conference would include presentations on engineering of biotic/abiotic interfaces, avenues to control the cell machinery with possibilities for biomaterial synthesis, and novel approaches to interface with biology with potential for sensing and manipulation of cellular behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) are playing an important role in enhancing the development of researchers in early stages of their careers. The format of these conferences is designed to foster an environment of in-depth scientific discussions and to develop long term collaborations among participants. The associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) would provide a venue for drawing in young scientists and researchers including graduate students, post-docs, and will bring them together in a highly-stimulating and non-intimidating environment to discuss their current research and build informal networks with their peers that may lead to a lifetime of collaborations and scientific achievements. These seminars are organized by young investigators with the support of leading scientists from the associated GRC. The majority, if not all, of the GRS participants are expected to participate in this Symposium immediately following the GRC. The PI will make a concerted effort for the participation of women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities, and other individuals who have been traditionally underrepresented in STEM areas.</AbstractNarration>
