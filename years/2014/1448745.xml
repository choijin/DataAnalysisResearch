<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop electricity-generating wastewater treatment systems with an initial focus on food &amp; beverage processors. The target return on investment is an average 3-year payback period on the cost of equipment and installation. Successful completion of this Phase I project will potentially pave the way towards deployment of on-site  wastewater treatment infrastructure at food and beverage processing facilities. If successfully commercialized, this technology could lead to significant improvements in the energy efficiency of wastewater treatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this Phase I research project are to optimize the performance and durability of components used in microbial fuel cell systems. In particular, our focus is on designing low-cost anode and cathode materials that can be manufactured in large quantities. Microbial fuel cells work by growing non-genetically modified Anode Respiring Bacteria (ARB) within bioreactors. The ARB consume wastewater pollutants including sugars, starches, and proteins. As the ARB consume these pollutants, they harvest the electrons (or chemical energy) of these compounds and transfer this energy onto conductive electrodes suspended inside each module. The technology development challenges that must be overcome to enable commercialization of this technology involve proving the long-term stability of the anode and cathode materials, selecting a suitable, low-cost cathode catalyst with compatible binder, and developing practical operation and maintenance procedures to limit the accumulation of excess biofilm and salts inside the system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) are an emerging class of wastewater treatment technology showing promise for cost-efficient treatment in industrial and municipal applications. Apart from the potential benefits in treatment speed, quality, and small footprint, the most intriguing potential value proposition comes in the form of direct electricity recovery without needing methane gas as an intermediate energy carrier for combustion. To bring MFCs into the marketplace to effectively compete with traditional wastewater treatment methods, improved materials and operating procedures need to be developed and tested at scale.  The scope of this Phase I SBIR was to address known efficacy barriers with the current set of anode and cathode materials favored among MFC developers, and to test our specific innovations at a bench scale. This work has laid the foundation for Phase II development to focus primarily on building out manufacturing infrastructure to produce our anodes and cathodes in commercial quantities, and to develop product assembly methods to pave the way for customer adoption.  Our project consisted of six main task categories. Below are bullet point summaries describing the main conclusions resulting from some of these tasks.     We found that graphite felt anodes outperformed carbon fiber loop anodes commonly encountered in literature, and that they cost less in parts/labor to produce Various current collector attachment configurations were explored, and threading titanium wire directly through the graphite felt provided the best low-contact resistance Perforating the graphite felt improved anode performance by opening up more anode area to the bulk liquid, and reduced clogging issues A water/solids ratio of 1:1 and a PTFE/C ratio of 3:1 is good for making gas diffusion layer (GDL) dough that can be repeatedly calendered and folded.  A GDL needs about 50mg/cm2 of solids (PTFE + carbon) to make a 0.5mm-thick sheet A water/solids ratio of 7:1 is good for making electrocatalytic layer (ECL) dough that is easy to spread across a dry GDL surface. The total solids loading (PTFE + carbon + catalyst) of the ECL on the GDL is 3.8mg/cm2 Baking the cathodes above 240&ordm;C causes too much brittleness and does not improve electrocatalytic activity, though it does increase the hydrophobicity of the GDL. The ideal oven profile was 20 minutes at 200&ordm;C, then 90 minutes at 240&ordm;C                  Last Modified: 08/05/2015       Submitted by: Mark Sholin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
