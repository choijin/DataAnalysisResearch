<AbstractNarration>This I-Corps team aims to explore the commercial potential of low-cost energy efficient coating processes via the customer discovery process and value creation activities.  The techniques developed by the team can find applications across a whole host of industries including solar cells, flat glass, eyeglasses, microelectronics, and specialized/fiber optics industries.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team has developed the Microreactor-Assisted Nanomaterials Deposition (MAND) processes that combine the merits of microreaction technology with solution-phase nanomaterial synthesis, purification, functionalization, and deposition. The MAND architecture is a flexible and versatile nanomanufacturing platform for nanomaterials synthesis and deployment. It can be implemented in various ways for the manufacturing of functional nanostructures.  MAND techniques have been shown to be effective at producing sophisticated, functionally gradient nanostructures with better material utilization and lower energy requirements with the potential for less worker exposure and lower operating and capital costs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major objectives of this project are to demonstrate Microreactor Assisted Nanomaterial Deposition (MAND) for customer discovery and value creation and to build a minimum viable product based on results of customer discovery and value creation. We performed customer discoveries via interviewing more than 100 potential customers to better understand the value propositions of the MAND process in industries, academies, research laboratories, and end users. We built a prototype of MAND for the demonstration of minimal viable products based on results of customer discoveries and value propositions to validate potential customers&rsquo; needs. Throughout the customer discovery process, we identified a number of potential products that the MAND process could add values in the manufacturing process. Based on the interviews of many smartphone users, more effective and cheaper antireflective and antismudge coating on smartphone displays can be a promising market. Many potential customers also suggested that eyeglass market can also benefit from our coating materials and concept. We integrated the MAND process with an inkjet printer to manufacture antireflective and antismudge coating on glass and plastic substrates. A transparent conductive coating has many applications in electronic and glass industries and we learned from our interviews that the industries are pursuing more cost-effective manufacturing techniques. To fulfill the requirements of a transparent conductive material coating market, we developed an innovative MAND process to produce highly conductive silver film and silver feature at room temperature, which could significantly reduce the manufacturing costs. To achieve higher resolution silver features at the submicron scale, we integrated the MAND process with an aerosol jet process. In conclusion, this I-CORPS team has successfully validated and discovered a number of commercial opportunities for MAND. &nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/18/2016<br>      Modified by: Chih-Hung&nbsp;Chang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1439485/1439485_10297669_1453147231988_Microreactor-AssistedNanomaterialsDeposition--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1439485/1439485_10297669_1453147231988_Microreactor-AssistedNanomaterialsDeposition--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MAND"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1439485/1439485_10297669_1453147231988_Microreactor-AssistedNanomaterialsDeposition--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MAND"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Microreactor-Assisted Nanomaterials Deposition</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chang-Ho Choi and Chih-hung Chang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chih-Hung&nbsp;Chang</div> <div class="imageTitle">MAND</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
