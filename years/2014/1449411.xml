<AbstractNarration>The notion of the cloud is really the integration of applications delivered as a service over existing cyberinfrastructure. A key component of most cloud ecosystems, a hypervisor, is a unique entity that manages virtual machines with cloud systems. This project develops protocols and algorithms to provide security services in the form of enhanced intrusion detection and prevent services (IDPS) capable of detecting multistage intrusion attacks within cloud resources. The project focuses on one particular type of cloud ecosystem, that of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), because of its unique dominance within the cloud community. Another unique contribution of this project is the development of an hypervisor-based intrusion detection and prevention architecture that can be implemented in most cloud ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaborative effort with an undergraduate majority-minority university leading the project efforts, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB); North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCAT), HBCUs; Louisiana State University; and IBM's Center for Advanced Studies (CAS) as an industry partner. This effort will ensure the curriculum of undergraduate-oriented majority minority institution is greatly enhanced by developing models for the introduction of curriculum topics in cloud computing and cloud computing security, as well as enhancing faculty exposure at HBCUs to big data and cloud computing resources and research/educational opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project's  major achievements were the development of a novel security detection mechanism leveraging plan recognition to enhancement of detection, prevention mechanisms for MAS in cloud computing environments particularly focused on the domain of infrastructure-oriented cloud systems, which are defined as IaaS environments. The project also explored multiple cloud infrastructure systems to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each.  In particular, the following fundamental issues were addressed by this project:  -Developing an enhanced distributed intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) enhanced with plan recognition that can increase the certainty of knowledge about the security state of the critical assets managed by the hypervisor in the cloud (i.e. virtual machines and resources).   -Enabling IDPS to evolve with changes to the cloud computing system, as well as, the kinds of attacks seen in the system particularly communication blind-spots and inter-virtual machine attacks.   -The project outcomes expected included the development of a new open-source tool to combat multi-stage intrusions attacks within IDPSs, which did not exist now; As well as enhanced the curriculum of undergraduate-oriented majority minority institution by developing models for the introduction of curriculum topics in cloud computing and cloud computing security; enhanced faculty exposure at HBCUs to big data and cloud computing resources and research/educational opportunities.
