<AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Extreme Ultraviolet Engineering Research Center (EUV ERC), a partnership between Colorado State University (CSU), the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU Boulder), the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and 20 corporate affiliates, will provide summer research internships to 30 undergraduate students from colleges and universities across the United States through a 3-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) [Division of Engineering Education EEC-1461231]. Students who are accepted into the program will participate at one of the 3 campuses in a 10-week program that involves conducting research in a cutting-edge engineering project, attending scientific seminars and industry tours, and presenting their results. The Center recognizes the importance of students in academic research to be able to interact and appreciate the industrial culture. As a result, a goal of this grant is to leverage these partnerships to enable alumni REU interns to be placed into industry internships. The Center also has active partnerships with minority serving institutions and is committed to providing opportunities for students from underrepresented minority groups. The Center will broaden participation by joining efforts with, Professor Willie Rockwood of Morehouse College, a Historically Black College/Univ. (HBCU), who has a &gt;10 year history of working with the Center and is co-PI of this grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light in the EUV region of the spectrum (wavelengths approximately 5 - 50 nm) is the key enabling technology of critical importance to the semiconductor industry and national economy. The EUV ERC will provide summer research internships that involve EUV science and technology topics such as laser systems, nanoscience (quantum dots), electronic (printed board) circuit design, photonic techniques (ellipsometry, phase shifting interferometry and both ambient condition and low-temperature vacuum spectroscopy), optics design (Brewster's Angle plate beam splitter), lithography (essential to next generation computer processor manufacturing), chemistry and material science (photo resists), and high voltage systems. Titles of possible projects include: Nanoscale resolution mass-microscope by EUV laser ablation mass spectrometry; Photoelectron dynamics using high harmonic EUV light; and, the Design and construction of a new vacuum chamber test bed for characterizing magnetic materials at the nano-scale with ultrafast time resolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center has an active partnership with Industries in the development of EUV-technologies that derive from research conducted at the Center. The Center recognizes the importance of students in academic research to be able to interact and appreciate the industrial culture. As a result, a goal of this grant is to leverage these partnerships to enable alumni REU interns to be placed into industry internships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Engineering Research Center (ERC), which graduated from NSF funding in 2014, used the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Grant to enable students to participate in world-class research experiences that will prepare them for entry into graduate studies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines and into the industry workforce in the field of EUV science and engineering.    The Center is dedicated to conducting research and training engineers and scientists in the area of lasers and photonics, focusing in particular in the generation and application of extreme ultraviolet light.  This laser-generated shorter wavelength light is opening new revolutionary opportunities in science in areas including nanotechnology, materials, chemistry and biology.  Moreover, it will have an enormous economic impact by enabling the mass production of the next generations of computer processors and memory.  Industry started to use extreme ultraviolet light in the mass production of the most advanced integrated circuits in 2018.  The EUV ERC REU program provided students with a unique opportunity designed to understand EUV science and technology and to become involved in EUV-related research projects with state-of-the-art equipment that are technically and scientifically challenging, and highly interdisciplinary.  The Center faculty and research labs are producing cutting-edge research and have partnerships with industries that are leaders in the development and commercialization of products that will be at the forefront of the next generation of technology, including critical tools for the fabrication of all future cell phones and computers.  During Summer 2018, ten undergraduate students participated in the 10-week program at two campus locations: Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins and the University of California at Berkeley (UCB).  All of the interns participated in independent, supervised research in the engineering or science of EUV-related projects.  Each intern was assigned two mentors, who were responsible for making sure that the REU intern understood the goals of the project and performed the tasks required to achieve the goal. At the end of the summer, the interns presented their research project results at an EUV ERC-wide symposium, which all REU interns, faculty, and mentors attended in person or via videoconference.  Students were encouraged to work independently on their research and engineering projects and to operate safely in the laboratory environment.  As a result, REU interns were provided a range of opportunities for informal training and educational development in EUV science and technology, laser systems, nanoscience (quantum dots, growing nanowire arrays), prototype machining (CNC), electronic (printed board) circuit design, programming and computer automated design (SolidWorks, Matlab, Labview), data collection and experimental design, experimental trouble-shooting, new scientific equipment (spectrophotometers, cryogenics, vacuum systems, evaporation chamber, profilometer), photonic techniques (ellipsometry, phase shifting interferometry and both ambient condition and low-temperature vacuum spectroscopy), designing optics (Brewster's Angle plate beam splitter), lithography, chemistry and material science (photo resists), and high voltage systems.  In March 2014, the Center was awarded a REU Site Grant for Engineering Applications of EUV Laser Light, ending in September 2018. Participation in the REU program improves the confidence of students; the interns learn skills that, while intended to help them in STEM careers, will also help them in whatever career they choose.  As part of a team, they were exposed to methods and ideas that other people had and they learned different ways of approaching a problem.  Through teamwork, they learned communication skills; they actively and effectively listened to their team members to understand everyone's ideas and concerns.  They effectively articulated their ideas or concerns to others, and provided genuine constructive feedback to team members.  Interns learned critical thinking, evaluation, and conflict resolutions skills.  Finally, the data collected by the Center since 2003 demonstrates that undergraduate students who participate in hands-on research are compelled to pursue advanced degrees and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.
