<AbstractNarration>This workshop brings together leading international researchers from Japan, United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom to discuss the stable and secure supply of energy as we head towards a low carbon society that is essential for sustainable development. The objective of the workshop is to discuss our collective research approaches and then develop collaborative efforts to formulate cooperative distributed energy management systems. The workshop will be held at the Hilton Waikiki Beach Hotel in Honolulu, HI on January 11-12, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pressing need around the world to change paradigms of how we both generate and use energy as we move to a more sustainable society considering solutions that require engineering, computational, environmental, policy, economic, and social science research and education. This proposal along with the support of the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Agency brings together a group of international researchers and educators in energy and sustainability to discuss these issues. The workshop will study a cooperative distributed energy management system that makes optimal control of energy generation and demand response.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is unique as it will bring in distinguished US researchers to participate with Japanese researchers invited by JST along with researchers from Germany and the United Kingdom to discuss and form collaborations on cooperative distributive energy management systems. Topics of discussion include: renewable energy generation including solar and wind along with distributed generation and integration of renewable energy sources; communications, control, and computational aspects of the smart grid; storage options; demand response including load controls, demand side management, price controls, and consumer participation; and smart grid and smart community demonstration projects.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring in researchers from different countries to give different perspectives on developing a cooperative distributed energy management system. This will lead to multinational collaborative research and education efforts. This can lead to novel approaches to tackle energy and sustainability problems and also innovation and commercialization opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 2014 Joint JST-NSF-DFG Workshop on Distributed Energy Management Systems:  Honolulu, HI: Jan. 11-12, 2014.     This workshop brought together leading international researchers from Japan, United States,  and Germany to discuss the stable and secure supply of energy as we head  towards a low carbon society that is essential for sustainable development.  The deployment and integration of more renewable energy sources to the electric power grid, optimal control of energy generation, and demand response algorithms are all critical to this development.  The workshop discussed cooperative distributed energy management systems from a variety of different perspectives.  The researchers were brought together  as their research expertise spanned a broad array of disciplines from system science, control theory, information technology, communications, energy and social science. The workshop had researchers giving presentations and discussing different aspects of  energy management systems.  There was also a panel session focused on smart grid and energy education.  In addition there were also poster sessions where researchers discussed specific energy research.  A main goal of the workshop was to introduce the different researchers to each other, provide a venue for discussion of  distributed energy management systems, and discuss future collaborative opportunities.  There was a total of 120 participants including 48 participants from Japan and eight participants from Germany.  28 participants came from the US mainland.  Hawaii participants included faculty, students, and participants from Hawaii industry and state government.          Last Modified: 04/17/2015       Submitted by: Anthony Kuh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
