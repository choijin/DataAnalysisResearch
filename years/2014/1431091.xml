<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Prof. Seth Koven, Ph.D. student Hilary Buxton will conduct a historical study of the development and application of some of the many sciences and industries of war rehabilitation including trauma psychology, orthopedics, prosthetics, and  nutrition. The co-PI will focus on the way the way understandings of race have shaped these sciences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will result in a trained professional researcher and in a dissertation which will include first-person accounts of the experience of racially diverse veterans who experienced rehabilitative treatment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award from the National Science Foundation funded dissertation research on the relationship between race and trauma care during and after World War I, a seminal period not only for British colonial history but also in the international development of modern rehabilitation services, health care, and welfare systems.   The comparative scope of the research brings together soldiersÆ experiences with state policies and programs, exemplifying the ways in which race and rehabilitation shaped constructions of self, citizenship, and the body.  It examined two groups of non-white veterans from the British Empire, Indian and West Indian servicemen, to probe how race shaped the character and goals of the bodily and psychological treatments that the British wartime and post-war state offered to its white and non-white veterans.   Research in censorship and military archives, personal letters, war diaries, medical and scientific journals and institutional records shows that healing colonial servicemen from the Caribbean and South Asia was a deeply paradoxical endeavor: authorities aspired to restore this manpower reserve to health and emphasize the EmpireÆs benevolence, yet were equally devoted to enforcing traditional ideas of colonial difference and rank.   Sites of imperial care-giving, from hospitals at the front to psychiatric institutions and rehabilitation centers in the colonies, were highlighted in propaganda efforts to check the rising tide of global anti-colonial demonstrations.  Yet the very apparatuses of healing often produced and accentuated race-based inequality. Whether in the form of ethnic-specific rations, the provision of environmentally impractical prosthetics, or the explaining-away of trauma through racialized stigmas, colonial soldiers navigated a health system whose technologies, diagnostics, and treatments denied them the same level of care as their white counterparts.    At the same time, the encounter with non-white soldiers shaped the trauma industry and rehabilitative technologies by destabilizing contemporary racial ideologies. For example, when heretofore hyper-masculinized soldiers of the Indian Army suffered what were regarded as "feminized" disorders such as shell shock, British and colonial authorities were forced to modify their understanding of the raced gender of colonial subjects.  Psychologists who treated Indian soldiers often simply denied that they could suffer "war neuroses," or blamed mental illness on ethnic and hereditary defects.   By examining contrasts in an imperial system of welfare, this study has important implications for the study of inequalities in global health systems today.  This work illustrates the need for medical regimes to remain conscious of the ways in which they are informed by cultural bias.  Attention to discrepancies in diagnostics and care is especially important for victims of psychological trauma, particularly army veterans.   Preliminary results of this research were presented at three conferences in Europe: the International Network for the History of HospitalsÆ annual meeting, Dubrovnik, Croatia (April 10-11, 2015), the Colloquium for the History of the Body at the Institute for Historical Research, London, UK (May 16, 2015), and at the Rethinking Modern British Studies Conference at the University of Birmingham, UK (July 1-3, 2015).  A paper drawn from the awardÆs archival research was also presented at a meeting of the Centre for Modern British Studies at the University of Birmingham (June 25, 2015).  Further results will contribute to the completion of the dissertation, and a number of papers drawn from this research are in the process of being submitted for publication.
