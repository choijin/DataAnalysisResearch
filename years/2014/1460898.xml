<AbstractNarration>This project funded by the Division of Chemistry supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Professors Christopher T. Culbertson and Stefan H. Bossmann at Kansas State University (KSU). Each summer ten students from primarily undergraduate institutions and community colleges are brought to the KSU campus for ten weeks to work on a research project. The majority of research projects supported at this site are in areas of chemistry with broader impacts on national biosecurity. The object of the program is to expose the participants to scientific research and prepare them for graduate studies in Chemistry. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students in this program participate in a number of professional development activities that prepare them for graduate school. The program culminates in both poster and oral presentations at the end of the summer.  The broader impacts of this project are to increase the number and diversity of students pursuing Ph.D. studies. A goal is to recruit three students from community colleges, four students from underrepresented groups, and five women students each year of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the scientific research projects that students will work on include single cell analysis on microfluidic devices, the development of a dependable, sensitive, and cost-effective detection system for airborne pathogens and toxins, and the development of a theoretical understanding of the chemical and physical properties of gold and silver nanoparticles and clusters. Others will synthesize small inorganic clusters using conventional and microwave-assisted synthesis, while others fabricate, functionalize, and evaluate nanoscale biosensing devices.</AbstractNarration>

Students were individually mentored by faculty members during their research experience.  In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students in this program participated in a number of professional development and extracurricular cohort building activities.   The professional development activities included ethics and networking skills workshops, a series of Philosophy of science lectures, a glassblowing demonstration, lunch with Peter Dorhout (past-president of the American Chemical Society, library and search engine training, and the development of a 90 second research pitch.

Additional activities were coordinated among the summer programs to provide a variety of activities to foster social interactions (e.g. ice cream socials, bowling nights, group field trips, pizza lunches, picnics on the prairie, etc.) and other learning activities over the course of the summer.  The site recruited nationwide, with a particular focus on recruitment of students in the Midwest.          Last Modified: 08/23/2019       Submitted by: Stefan H Bossmann]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
