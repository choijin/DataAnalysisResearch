<AbstractNarration>Title:  Silicon Carbide Devices for Optomechanics and Photonics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this collaborative project is to understand and engineer a new platform for manipulating light and processing information on chip, by using silicon carbide (SiC) micro-structures.  In particular, high quality micro-resonators are essential for functions such as filtering, wave mixing, and signal generation.  SiC is a semiconductor that offers superior optical, mechanical, and thermal properties compared to conventional materials. In this project, the PIs aim to develop SiC micro-photonic components that offer novel functionalities inaccessible by current approaches. Fundamental research findings and device innovations will be disseminated to the research communities through published papers and will be also incorporated into the courses offered by the PIs at both institutions. The proposed research will also train graduate and undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary areas of photonics, MEMS/NEMS, materials science, and quantum optics.  Through the outreach programs, this project will also help promote the interests and participations of K-12 students, and broaden the participations from underrepresented groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the proposed research is to explore and develop an entirely new device platform for micro-/nano-photonics, particularly for nano-optomechanics and integrated nonlinear photonics, by employing high-quality SiC devices. Optical micro-/nano-resonators are fundamental building blocks for many important areas in optical science and technology, ranging from nonlinear optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, optomechanics, to biomedical sensing.  The device performance depends critically on the properties of the underlying materials from which the devices are built. The proposed research is based on the superior linear optical, nonlinear optical, mechanical, and thermal properties in SiC materials. Through innovative device designs and advanced nanofabrication technology, the PIs plan to establish SiC as a viable platform for nano-optomechanics and nonlinear photonics. The PIs have highly complementary expertise in SiC material processing and device physics and engineering. The two  groups will form an integrative team to carry out explorative research on developing a family of multifunctional SiC micro-/nano-photonic devices with performance either surpassing  state-of-the-art or inaccessible with conventional approaches. Preliminary results have already demonstrated the feasibility of achieving these goals.</AbstractNarration>

With the three-year collaborative efforts, we have achieved the following goals:  1) Research outcomes:  We have achieved high-quality of SiC microresonators, with optical Q up to 1.3x105, the highest reported to date for SiC photonic devices. We have achieved high-quality of SiC photonic crystal nanoresonators, with optical Q up to 7.7x104, the highest value reported to date for SiC photonic crystal nanoresonators. We have observed strong optical Kerr nonlinear effect in SiC microresonators, with a Kerr nonlinearity measured to be n2=(5.9&plusmn;0.7)x10-15 cm2/W. We have realized strong optomechanical coupling in SiC optomechanical resonators, and observed high-frequency and high-quality optomehcanical resonances in these devices, with a mechanical frequency up to 1.69GHz and a mechanical Q around 5500 in atmosphere, corresponding to a f&middot;Q product of 9.47x1012 Hz.   2) Publication outcomes:  We have published three journal papers, submitted one paper currently under review, and gave two conference presentations and three invited conference talks.  3) Education and outreach outcomes:  The project has results in training three PhD students, including one female student, in broad interdisciplinary areas of nanophotonics, nonlinear photonics, micro/nanomechanics, and material science. One of them, who was financially supported by the project, graduated in 2016. The research outcomes have been disseminated to the research communities through published papers and conference presentations. The research outcomes have been incorporated into the course offered by the PI at the University of Rochester, Nanophotonic and Nanomechanical Devices, which has attracted broad interest across multiple disciplines of Optics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Material Science, and Technical Entrepreneurship and Management. The research project has provided lab demonstrations and lab tours to promote the interest and participation of K-12 students, and to broaden the participation from underrepresented groups, through the outreach programs at the University of Rochester.   With the three-year efforts, we have achieved both research and education goals of the proposed project:  We have proved that SiC micro/nanophotonic devices are excellent platforms for nonlinear photonics and nano-optomechanics. We have promoted broad interest of research community in SiC photonics. We have educated and trained new&ndash;generation scientists and engineers with strong expertise in nanophotonics, SiC photonics, SiC device nanofabrication, nonlinear photonics, and micro/nanomechanics. We have promoted the broad interest of K-12 students and of underrepresented groups.            Last Modified: 11/16/2017       Submitted by: Qiang Lin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
