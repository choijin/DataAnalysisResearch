<AbstractNarration>This project, at North Carolina State University, will explore ways to augment intelligent tutoring systems by using methods that use historical data from student work on assigned exercises, to enhance the tutoring system's ability to decide what to teach and how to teach it.  This research will utilize both hint generation and worked examples.  The PI team will begin by augmenting three existing learning environments, adding data-driven techniques for the automatic generation of next-step hints and for the automatic selection of learning activities.  Subsequent studies will increase understanding of the benefits provided by hint mechanisms by comparing the effectiveness of sub-goal hints with that of next-step hints.  This will then lead to empirical evaluations of the learning impact of such data-driven student support.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project team hypothesizes that existing logic and probability tutors will produce significant learning gains when enhanced by data-driven hint generation coupled with data-driven pedagogical strategy induction.  The project will compare logic, probability, and programming learning with and without data-driven hints and data-driven pedagogies, measuring quantitative and qualitative impact on student success. The research team will use a variety of measures of learning, such as time to learn, number of errors made, number of hints requested, and engagement, as well as qualitative measures such as student surveys that gauge self-efficacy and motivation. Student performance data will be analyzed using correlation, analysis of variance, regression and significance testing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project was to create intelligent learning technologies directly from data  to offer a low cost way to adapt learning environments to individual students, while informing research on human learning.  Providing individualized instruction using data has the potential to make individualized learning support accessible for a broad audience, including students that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.  This project builds upon our prior work using Educational Data Mining (EDM) to leverage prior data to provide contextualized hints and to direct student learning. Our experiments are designed to integrate the PIs? separate data-driven techniques for hint generation and pedagogical strategy induction and to apply those techniques to develop tutoring systems for domains such as introductory programming which have proven to be challenging for traditional Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs).  The intellectual merit of this project at North Carolina State University is that we developed,  implemented, iteratively refined, and empirically validated various educational data mining (EDM) methods on student learning.We seeked to developed data-driven, interpretable, and domain- independent models that optimize student learning. The research had three major thrusts: (1) Develop computational methods to derive hints from data; (2) Develop pedagogical models that leverage data to provide individualized guidance based on students? current knowledge level, general aptitude, emotional state and other salient features; &amp; (3) Conduct empirical evaluations of the learning effectiveness of data-driven student support.   Our research yielded a number of insights on the use of data-driven hints and pedagogical strategies on student learning performance and time on task.   This has included results on hints (Eagle et al, 2015, 2016;  Mostafavi et al, 2015), combining feature selection for model-based reinforcement learning (Shen et al, 2016), and the impact of various reinforcement learning methods on the effectiveness of induced pedagogical policies (Shen et al, 2018, 2017, 2016; Zhou et al 2016).  Overall, we have also shown that decision granularity and decision agency can significantly affect students? learning and time on task (Zhou et al, 2015,. 2016, and 2017).  We have also shown that it is possible to reliably generate data-driven hints for open-ended programming assignments (Price et al, 2016).     The broader impacts of this work are to enable the fast and effective construction of intelligent tutoring systems where data is available from previously constructed interactive learning environments in STEM. It has shown its great potential to make individualized learning support accessible for a broad audience, from children to adults. Individualization of instruction and may particularly impact those students that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. The technology to individualize instruction have been shared across the NSF-funded STARS Alliance and will continue to be integrated in the project team?s courses, educational software, and, when possible, software used in outreach with K-12 schools and public libraries.
