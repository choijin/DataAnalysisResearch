<AbstractNarration>Lyme disease afflicts hundreds of thousands of Americans each year.  There is no vaccine and both diagnostic methods and treatments remain problematic; avoidance of exposure to disease-bearing ticks is the primary means of protecting the public. This project will identify what regulates the abundance of ticks and the proportion of ticks that carry the disease agent, providing detailed knowledge about when and where people are most at risk of exposure to Lyme disease.  Researchers will continue long-term collection of data on acorns, ticks, mice, other hosts, and climate in one of the most heavily affected portions of the United States.  Results will facilitate reduced burden of disease though avoidance and management of high risk places and times. The project will contribute to K-12 classroom teaching, undergraduate education, and extensive public education through strong collaborations the researchers have developed over the course of this sixteen-year study. Public health benefits ensure widespread coverage of the research by public media. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers, through their participation in the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lyme-disease risk can be predicted from past acorn production, yet the discovery of new patterns and mechanisms complicates these predictions. The investigators will continue research on 6 oak-forest plots to collect long-term data on acorn production; the population dynamics of mice, chipmunks, squirrels, and larval, nymphal, and adult blacklegged ticks; infection prevalence of ticks with Lyme disease bacteria; and  tick responses to specific climatic variables. Five additional years of data encompassing a more extensive range of host abundances, tick burdens, resources, and climatic conditions will generate the empirical base for constructing robust models of all tick life stages, questing and attached, to address biotic and abiotic drivers of tick population dynamics. Models will also be extended to distinguish the effects of climatic variables from those of host abundances and host resources on Lyme disease risk. The importance of contingencies in acorn-mouse-tick interactions will be explored. Although most years of high mouse abundance are followed by high nymph abundance, a recent mouse peak was not followed by a nymph peak. More robust and predictive models of the mast-mouse-tick system require the exploration of specific contingencies, which are likely to be episodic. Long-term trends in acorn production will be analyzed to decompose temporal variation in the magnitude and timing of masting events by individual species into patterns due to  individual variation in seed production versus changes in overall abundance and population size structure. Analyses of the seasonal timing of host-seeking by larvae and nymphs will be integrated with estimates of host population size to explain variation in nymphal infection prevalence and to improve predictions for this critical variable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project seeks to understand the causes of variable risk of human exposure to Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections.  Lyme disease is caused by a bacterium that is transmitted to people by the bite of an infected tick.  In the eastern and central United States the tick vector is the blacklegged tick.  Ticks hatch uninfected; some acquire the bacterial pathogen during their initial blood meal, and these become the ticks that pose a danger to human health.  Newly hatched, larval blacklegged ticks are much more likely to survive and acquire bacterial infection when they feed on white-footed mice and eastern chipmunks than when they feed on any other mammal or bird host.  The investigators therefore hypothesized that the greater the abundance of these rodents in natural habitats, the more larval ticks would feed on these hosts, the more infected nymph-stage ticks would occur the following year (larvae take about one year to transition into the nymph stage, which is most dangerous to human health).  We further predicted that the abundance of forest rodents would correlate with the abundance of acorns produced by the dominant oak trees.  Tree seeds, especially acorns, are an important food source for rodents particularly during fall and winter.     By monitoring the abundance of tree seeds, rodents, ticks, and tick-borne pathogens, we were able to test these hypotheses using statistical analyses of a long-term data set.  We found strong support for the hypothesis that acorn production in the fall predicts the abundance of mice and chipmunks the following summer.  We found strong support for the hypothesis that the abundance of rodents in the summer predicts the abundance of infected nymph-stage ticks the following spring/summer.  We found only weak support for the hypothesis that the abundance of white-tailed deer predicts the abundance of infected ticks.  Using data from a local weather station on the grounds of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, we found that most weather variables had no power to predict the abundance of ticks.  But, warm, dry springs were associated with lower abundance of nymph stage ticks in the same year.  Winter cold and summer heat did not predict tick abundance.     By understanding the factors that affect the abundance of infected ticks in the environment, ecological studies can provide advanced warning regarding the times and locations where risk of exposure to Lyme disease is high.  Because diagnosis and treatment for Lyme disease remain inefficient, and prevention of exposure is critical, these studies provide the scientific basis for the protection of public health.  Moreover, knowledge of the ecological context of human infectious disease increases our understanding of underlying principles connecting the health of the environment to the health of human communities.
