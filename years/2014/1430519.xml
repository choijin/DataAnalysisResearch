<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) research groups in Nebraska and Kansas will form a collaborative consortium to study and develop ways to control fundamental processes of electron motion in atoms, molecules, and nanostructures that occur at ultrafast  (femto (10-15) to atto (10-18) second) time scales.  The project will bring together experimental and theoretical physicists, chemists and electrical engineers from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln (UNL), the Kansas State University (KSU), and the University of Kansas (KU) as well as the facilities for AMO research at the James R. Macdonald Laboratory (JRML) at KSU, Extreme Light Laboratory at UNL, Physics and Chemistry departments at KU, and the computing resources at the partner institutions to explore novel states of matter.  The project team plans to engage in synergistic activities to expand and diversify the STEM workforce by engaging students, teachers, and researchers at broad ranging educational levels. Research and educational collaborations among the consortium partners as well as at national and international levels and the preparation of a diverse, globally engaged STEM workforce training are expected to be sustained beyond the award period. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;The projects will use femto to atto second pulses of light to trigger different types of reactions in matter and use pump-probe measurements, high harmonic generation, and ultrafast electron diffraction methods to study and image atomic and molecular motions. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies will be carried out to understand the molecular ionization processes caused by the interaction of strong laser fields and molecules.  Participating researchers will build an electron spectrometer with angular resolution, improve the accuracy of extracting the molecular structure parameters, and establish an improved ionization theory for polyatomic molecules. Another aspect of the project will focus on experimental and theoretical studies to investigate the interaction of nanostructures to ultrashort pulses of extreme ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Applications such as ultrafast optical free electron beam switches will also be explored. The project will leverage the infrastructure and education, diversity, and outreach programs established by Kansas and Nebraska Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) to engage and inspire students at all levels. During the three years of this Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 project, the program expects to provide 19 person-years of postdoctoral training and support 48 graduate students, 18 undergraduates and 18 faculty members from two-and four-year colleges, 18 high school students, and 30 high school teachers in research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report Collaborative Research: Imaging and Controlling Ultrafast Dynamics of Atoms, Molecules and Nanostructures NSF EPSCoR RII Track-2 Nebraska OIA-1430519 Kansas OIA-1430493 1 August 2014 &ndash; 31 July 2018     Intellectual Merit  This collaborative research project comprises two major Research Thrusts.  Research Thrust 1 has focused on imaging and controlling ultrafast dynamics of atoms and molecules using ultrashort pulses of electrons and light, ranging from the infrared to the hard X-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Significant experimental and theoretical advances have been made in developing and analyzing two-color, high-order harmonic generation (HHG) schemes for enhancing HHG rates; on improving theoretical descriptions of strong field ionization processes for both atoms and polar molecules; on developing tabletop sources of X-rays; on experimental studies of molecular breakup processes initiated by inner-shell ionization processes; on developing novel ultrafast electron pulse sources for electron diffraction experiments; and on advancing theoretical analyses of light-induced electron diffraction processes.  Research Thrust 2 has focused on understanding how to control the ultrafast dielectronic response and dynamics of electrons in nanostructures using pulses of light.  It includes nanostructure design, coherent electron beams, and optoelectronics.    Significant advances have been made on the development of methods to grow nano-wires; on optical control of electron emission from nano-tips, nano-sized GaAs wedges, and chiral nano-structured surfaces; on measurement of spin polarizations of emitted photoelectrons; on discovery of a new photoemission phenomenon (sub-additivity); on inter-layer electron transport in two-dimensional materials; on nonlinear excitation of photochromic molecules on arrays of nanorods; on theoretical modelling, both quantum and classical, of photoemission spectra from various nanostructures; and on novel applications of our research findings.     Broader Impacts  In both research thrusts, a significant outcome enabled by this grant is the establishment of new collaborations between physicists, chemists, and engineers in both Kansas and Nebraska. These new collaborations have enabled the research teams to study novel problems requiring interdisciplinary expertise.  These new interdisciplinary collaborations are likely to continue.  The Nebraska-Kansas consortium also succeeded in building upon existing expertise and programs to create a cohesive and effective Research-Based Education and Workforce Development portfolio.
