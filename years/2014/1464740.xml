<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor James Davis and his students of the Department of Chemistry at the University of South Alabama will explore the synthesis, characterization, and properties of a new type of ionic liquids (liquid salts).  The liquid salts to be investigated are expected to be highly resistant to heat and to retain their liquid character, without evaporation, decomposition, or flammability, for long periods of time.  Salts of this type can, in principle, be used as substitutes for more traditional liquids in applications ranging from heat transfer fluids and high-performance lubricants to biomass processing and the synthesis of important electronic materials such as semiconductors.  The project brings together elements of chemical synthesis as well as material science and engineering, and offers engaged students a broad opportunity for gaining experience from a spectrum of activities.  Since the institution at which the research will take place serves a high proportion of individuals from groups underrepresented in the sciences and engineering, the present project will provide important opportunities to engage in the professional training of individuals from these communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ionic liquids (ILs) are materials of considerable fundamental interest and growing practical utility.  Because of their non-volatility, ionic liquids can be used in applications requiring high temperatures, such as in heat transfer, lubrication, or high-temperature materials synthesis.  Although typical ILs have relatively high degrees of thermal stability, they are still incapable of being used for long durations at temperatures above 200 degrees Celsius.  In the present project, ILs will be prepared using the tetraphenylphosphonium cation and derivatives thereof.  Preliminary work has revealed that the former cation is stable to temperatures in excess of 300 degrees Celsius for days without decomposition or evaporation.  Building on these findings, the mechanism by which thermal decomposition eventually does occur will be studied, and that knowledge will be harnessed to create salts of still higher thermal stability.  In addition to creating new molten salts of high thermal stability, the use of these liquids in facilitating the rapid pyrolysis of biomass (for production of bio-oil) and in the thermal synthesis of electronically important materials such as ZnS and CdSe will be investigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ionic liquids (ILs) are an emerging class of novel materials of potential utility in a stunning array of societally high-impact applications that range from energy generation to healthcare to space exploration.  The high utility of these materials arises from a unique combination of properties they possess, perhaps the most important of which is their lack of vapor pressure ? that is, these are liquids that don?t evaporate.  Since their emergence at the forefront of chemical research around 2000, there have also been many assertions that they have high degrees of thermal stability as well, making their prospective utility in many applications even greater.  Problematically, by 2013 it had become apparent that assertions of high thermal stability were not well-founded; that ILs are not, as a rule, any more thermally stable than ordinary liquids.  Hence, beginning that same year we set out to determine whether or not it is possible to design and make ILs that are of genuinely high thermal stability; to determine if it is possible to use basic chemical design principles, and insights into the relationships between specific types of chemical bonds and their thermal stabilities, to create new materials that will fundamentally outclass those known to date.  First funded by NSF shortly thereafter, and using long-neglected industrial research findings from the early 1960s as a starting point, we proceeded to explore the synthesis of new ionic liquids with molecular structures which deviate considerably from those which were then being used as the basis of ILs.  In particular, we built new ILs around ions that are centered on phosphorous and sulfur rather than nitrogen (the more commonplace core atom in ionic liquid ions), and which contained other structural elements that were ?aromatic? in character rather than more typical ?aliphatic? building blocks.  The improvements achieved in thermal stability by doing so were dramatic.  While typical ionic liquids were found to undergo decomposition at ever-increasing speeds as temperatures began to exceed around 200oC (392oF), leaving many of them completely decomposed after a few hours to perhaps a week, many of the new ILs prepared in our program proved to be stable at temperatures of 350oC (662oF) and even higher, nearing the temperature of the surface of Mercury, the closest planet to our Sun.  Moreover, many of the new ILs proved to be stable at these temperatures for months; for example, in one experiment, a particular IL was kept at 300oC for six months (at which point the experiment was terminated) with no indication of decomposition.  Over the course of the grant period, we focused on continuing to explore the types of molecular features which can be incorporated into ILs without compromising thermal stability.  Nevertheless, these studies, while important from the standpoint of fundamentally understanding the relationship between the thermal stability of a molecule and its molecular structure, were not purely intellectual exercises.  At the forefront of the project were always considerations of how modifications might improve the properties of the ILs from standpoints other than their thermal stability.  One key consideration of this sort was the impact of these modifications on the melting point of the material.  Why? As work progressed, we discovered that the modifications to ion structures which lent them high thermal stabilities also tended to increase their melting points.  In fact, many of the new ILs were solids at room-temperature, and often had to reach 100oC or more before melting.  In other words, while we gained advantages at high-temperatures, we lost them at lower temperatures.  Indeed, ideally, ILs should have as broad a ?liquidus range? as possible ? liquidus range being the temperature difference between where a material melts, upwards to the temperature at which the material evaporates or decomposes.  Determined not to be defeated by the complication of gaining thermal stability at the cost of higher melting points, we began to expand the scope of molecular structural features we evaluated in order to find ?just-right? combinations that would allow us to retain high thermal stabilities but also achieve lower melting points.  Significantly, we found several modifications which, when incorporated into our basic IL-ion designs, allowed us to achieve both.  Still, there were others which, curiously, resulted in lower melting points but also led to decomposition at lower temperatures.  A search for an answer to the ?why? of the latter became, along with other considerations, a central basis for a follow-on NSF project.  In sum, during the duration of this project, we designed and prepared the most thermally stable ionic liquids known.  Several of these materials rival, or exceed, in thermal stability the most thermally stable, non-metallic/non-ceramic materials in existence.  Alone this constitutes a notable intellectual/scientific advance.  However, these outcomes are also of considerable practical value, and are already serving as the basis for, among other things, the development of improved systems for solar energy storage.
