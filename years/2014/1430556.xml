<AbstractNarration>Systems Biology is a new area of science that studies living systems comprised of many interacting parts. These could be molecules within a cell, cells within an organism, or individual organisms within an ecosystem. It differs from classical biology, which has largely focused on understanding the behavior of the fundamental units of living systems, whereas systems biology is concerned with properties of the entire system. It is necessarily an interdisciplinary subject, using approaches from biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer science is central to systems biology. Because biological systems are so complex, traditional methods of analysis and modeling are inadequate or too inefficient to be practical. There are striking similarities between some of the major problems of software analysis and systems biology. Researchers in both areas must deal with systems that cannot be understood by intuitive, informal methods. This has led to the development of software aids for describing and testing systems. The experience gained by computer scientists working on software analysis could be very useful when applied to systems biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Logic and Systems Biology is affiliated with the 2014 Logic in Computer Science (LICS) Conference in Vienna, Austria and is scheduled for July 13. It will consist of one day of invited lectures and a session for discussion of open problems and future research. The talks will cover a variety of connections between computer science and biology, with emphasis on the uses of formal logic in modeling biomolecular interaction systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems biology presents challenges and opportunities for computer science. Although the number of computer scientists who work on systems biology is growing, they still represent a small fraction of the population. The lectures are intended to be accessible to computer scientists who have some knowledge about the use of formal methods for analyzing software and hardware, but who may not have much experience with biology. The speakers will also be invited to submit more technical versions of their talks to a refereed proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT&lt;br/&gt;The lectures will explore connections between biology, computer science, and mathematics, with the goal of encouraging collaborations between researchers in the different groups, leading to new applications of logic and raising interesting theoretical questions.  Students and postdoctoral fellows will be especially encouraged to participate in the workshop.  Since the talks will be partly expository, this will be an opportunity for them to broaden their perspective, with future benefits to their research and teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2014 Workshop on Logic and Systems Biology was affiliated with the Vienna Summer of Logic, which was the largest meeting of logicians ever held.  The organizers of the meeting felt that systems biology is a new area where there are potential interactions with logic.  It is inherently an interdisciplinary field, involving biologists, computer scientists, and logicians.  As models of biological systems grow in complexity, researchers are experiencing some of the same problems that beset software designers and computer engineers. The topics of this workshop reflect the interdisciplinarybapproach needed to solve these problems.  The purpose of the workshop was to encourage collaborations among these groups of researchers. The organizers of the workshop solicited speakers from these disciplines, and provided financial support for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows participating in the workshop.  The program covered a variety of approaches toward modeling and analyzing the behavior of biochemical systems in living cells. Most of the talks described work in progress.  Some of the lecturers are biologists who use computer models to develop and test their hypotheses, and others are computer scientists and logicians who are applying formal methods from mathematical logic to build and analyze models of biological systems.  The following is a list of the speakers and the titles of their lectures:  9:15-10:15 J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Feret (INRIA &amp; ENS Paris): An algebraic approach for inferring and using symmetries in rule-based models  10:45-11:30 Anne Siegel (IRISA): Using answer set programming to integrate large-scale heterogeneous information about the response of a biological system  11:35-12:20 C&eacute;dric Lhoussaine (LIFL): Attractor equivalence: An observational semantics for reaction networks  12:25-13:00 Jo&euml;lle Despeyroux, Amy Felty and Elisabetta de Maria: A logical framework for systems biology  14:30-15:15 Ozan Kahramanogullari (CoSBi): A theory of model equivalence based on stochastic simulation fluxes  15:15-16:00 Thomas Henzinger (IST): Model checking the evolution of gene regulatory networks  16:30-17:30 Adelinde Uhrmacher (Rostock): The role of domain specific languages in simulation studies:  Analyzing the impact of membrane dynamics on the Wnt signaling pathway   Between the lectures, there were lively discussions among the participants.  The overall impression among the attendees was that the research presented by the lecturers and discussed in the informal sessions was very promising and could lead to important advances in the field.
