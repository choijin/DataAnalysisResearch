<AbstractNarration>An international REU site, Modern Optics in the City of Light, will bring eight undergraduates to Paris each summer to conduct research, collaboratively, with faculty at the University of Michigan's Center for Ultrafast Optical Sciences (CUOS) and several Parisian research institutions; Ecole Polytechnique, Ecole Nationale de Techniques Avancées (ENSTA), the Institut d'Optique Graduate School, Université Paris-Sud 11, and Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan. The students will be put into research teams that include the student, a faculty member at UM and a faculty member in one of the Parisian institutions. The students will spend one week in Ann Arbor, followed by nine weeks in Paris. Each student will keep weekly on-line research diaries to aid in communication with each full group. A CUOS faculty member or research scientist will accompany the students to Paris and stay for one week to ensure that the students get a good start. The students will be housed in a local hotel in Ann Arbor and at the Cité Universitaire in Paris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research that will be conducted will include both on-going collaborative projects between CUOS and the French institutions and new collaborative projects. The research in all projects will all involve the use of ultrafast lasers to discover very current, state-of-the art phenomena in a wide range of fields including; relativistic optics, plasma physics, materials spectroscopy, nano-machining, patterned biological cell templating, high power fiber lasers, plasma x-ray sources, dynamics of nano-magnetic materials, terahertz imaging, biomedical imaging with shaped pulses, fatigue life studies of materials, as well as other topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project outcomes Intellectual Merit: Students gain a deep understanding of what research is like at a World class laboratory. Students learn what research is like outside of the United States in a European Union nation, France. Broader Impacts: Students are immersed in a diverse group to navigate a foreign culture. Students from schools where research is not the primary focus are given a chance to conduct research at the highest levels with World class researchers Briefly summarize the outcomes of your award  Thirty six students have had an opportunity to work in a world class research laboratory in France for 2 months during the past four years.  The vast majority (92%) of the students are either in graduate school or plan to attend graduate school soon. 50% of the participants were women, 28% of the students were underrepresented minorities, and 86% of the students attend undergraduate schools where research is not a primary focus of their programs.  Each year students travel to Ann Arbor for the first week of the program to attend an optics boot camp, get safety training, attend a Responsible Conduct of Research and Scholarship Program, participate in an acculturation program and spend time with each other before traveling to France. They travel to France Friday evening with a faculty member from UM and spend the weekend in Paris dealing with jet lag and learning how to navigate the Paris Metro and find great food. The faculty member takes them to the labs of their research mentors on the next Monday and Tuesday.  The students maintain electronic blogs during their 2 months of research in Paris and are visited the last week of the program by the PI of the grant.  Students give presentations and exit interviews to the PI and discussions with the French administrators are held to prepare for next year's program.  The PI also talks to the French research mentors if they are still in town.       Last Modified: 06/23/2019       Submitted by: Steven M Yalisove]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
