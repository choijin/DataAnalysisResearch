<AbstractNarration>PI: Costanzo, Francesco&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1438126&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed work is to study the hydrodynamic interactions between deformable microparticles, and specifically between a micro-bubble and a cell.  The idea is to create a micro-bubble using a laser next to the cell, and then use acoustic methods to obtain information about the mechanical properties of the cell.  Such information would be used mainly for diagnostic purposes, but also for therapeutic purposes.  This idea that a cell's mechanical properties can be used as a biomarker for pathogenic processes is currently being used to diagnose malaria, and there is some evidence that mechanical biomarkers may be used to diagnose cancer. The proposed work could lead directly from fluid dynamics research to applications. The proposed research will lead to more effective, cheaper, and faster cell-based on-chip diagnostic and therapeutic devices. As such, this research can have a major impact on public health world-wide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cellular mechanical properties have been found to be valuable indicators for pathogenesis and pathophysiology. This has led to the identification of a new class of biomarkers: mechanical biomarkers that offer some advantages over traditional biochemical biomarkers. While a number of mechanical biomarker-based microfluidic devices have already been proposed in the literature, the full potential of mechanical biomarkers in microfluidic-based diagnostics and therapeutics has yet to be revealed. One reason is the fact that no techniques are currently available for the quantitative assessment of cell deformability in relation to the forces acting on them. Current approaches for estimating the radiation forces on objects in streaming flows are based on classical solutions for idealized geometries (typically spheres) and small deformation of elastic inclusions in the flow. The proposed research will use computational techniques based on the immersed finite element method to advance knowledge in these areas. The goal is to relate cell deformability to the hydrodynamic forces imposed on a cell or on a group of cells in a microfluidic device. The validation of the proposed computational framework will be done against experiments with cancer cells in an opto-thermally-generated and acoustically-activated surface bubbles microfluidic device. The co-PIs propose to involve undergraduate students in research and to leverage already existing initiatives at Penn State in order to reach underrepresented minority students: the Women in Engineering Program and the Multicultural Engineering Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Fluid Dynamics Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) Program of the Division of Biological Infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award contributed to the advancement of lab-on-a-chip technology.  The latter is a screening technology meant to integrate on a small chip the sample analysis that is needed in medical diagnostics.  Overall this technology is meant to facilitate medical diagnostics right at the point of service, eliminating or diminishing the need of medical practitioners to rely on analysis conducted in expensive and sometimes far-away laboratory facilities.  A key elements of lab-on-a-chip technology is to control the motion of tiny amounts of fluid samples contained in microscopic channels built on the chip.  One way to activate the motion of the fluids in the microchannels is to subject the chip to high frequency vibrations.  The field studying this type of fluid motion is called microacoustofluidics.  The research funded by this grant yielded an improved computational capability to predict the motion of fluids in microacoustofluidic devices.  The significance of this research is that the ability to computationally predict the behavior of a device accelerates the design process of new devices.  In addition it opens the door to the exploration of new diagnostic capabilities. The research funded in this grant was specifically meant to address the need to predict the the motion of microscopic objectes immersed in the fluid.  A key element of any computational capability is its validation. The latter consists in showing that the computational model does in fact yield predictions that can be matched to experimental observations.  The research funded by this grant included included both computational as well as experimental components.  An additional experimental component not directly funded by this grant was also present with a collaboration with another research group.  Experimental validation in microacoustofluidics is still in an incipient stage.  One of the most significant results of the research funded by this project has been precisely in the validation arena where our predictive capability yielded results that well approximated the experiments not only quantitatively but also quantitatively.   The research funded by this project resulted in 16 journal publications. It also contributed to the support of a graduate student who successfully completed his Ph.D. dissertation. The funded research also included a component meant to develop educational modules that would help future students in more easily train their expertise in the computational technology for microacoustofluidics.
