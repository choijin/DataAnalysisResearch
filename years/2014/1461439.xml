<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will enhance the Nation?s knowledge of the impact of providing relevant STEM instruction on recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. For those students entering the workforce directly from the college, it is important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Hawaii-West Oahu will develop math and science courses sufficient to offer middle and secondary math and science education concentration and a BS in applied math, and develop a peer-tutoring program.  The curriculum improvements will be developed with attention to inquiry- and place-based instruction, local tradition and culture, and indigenous knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The goal of the NSF funded UHWO Kikaha STEM Project is to create and to  enhance innovative instruction, curriculum design, and program development in STEM courses and concentrations, founded on the four pillars of action: inquiry, community, place, and indigenous wisdom. The Kikaha STEM Project has provided opportunities to develop  a Bachelor of Science in Natural Science, with degree concentrations in Applied Math and Life Science. The program will be expanded later with a concentration in Health Sciences, among others. Supported by this award, UHWO has successfully added upper division courseworks in science and math, increased Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island students' self-efficacy in math and sciences. The activities has also increased engagement in upper division STEM coursework, and develop academic support systems and innovative programs that foster Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island student engagement in STEM, STEM  education and career opportunities. The project has provided abundant opportunities for faculty and students to create an active and vibrant community of STEM researchers, learners and practitioners by engaging in collaborative efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and active learning strategies, while embedding place-based and Native Hawaiian indigenous knowledge elements. A highlight of the project is the  Kikaha Peer Academic Leadership (Kikaha PAL)  program, in which student peer leaders are embedded in math and science classrooms to support foundational courses. A comparison on two variables are done: first, on students' passing rate, where passing is defined to have earned a grade C- or better, second, on student success outcome, where a student is deemed successful if  the student has either graduated or re-enrolls in Fall 2018. The comparison is done between foundational courses prior the PALs program (Fall 2012-Spring 2015) and that during the Kikaha PAL program (Fall 2015 - Spring 2018). During the Kikaha PAL program, Native Hawaiian students' success outcome is increased by 17%, while overall population increase is 16%. The passing rate (earning C- or better) for Native Hawaiian students is increased by 11%, while the overall population also sees an increase of 7%.  All of these encouraging opportunities and results provide avenues in which our institution continue to improve retention, persistence, as well as reruitment in math and science courses and degree program.
