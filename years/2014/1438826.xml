<AbstractNarration>The University of Southern Maine, the University of Maine at Fort Kent, and the York County Community College are collaborating in a two-year project to pilot and evaluate the feasibility of implementing an inter-institutional virtual cyber security collaborative learning laboratory.  In a traditional classroom or laboratory, the student has the support of the faculty and or other students and the physical immediacy positively impacts the students? learning, decisions and outcomes.  Cybersecurity virtual laboratories are shared resources that minimize the cost of replicating cybersecurity educational programs and allow students from several institutions to remotely use the hardware at the lead institution.  A student working in a virtual cyber security laboratory can work as part of a group at great distances from the physical hardware and other students.  This project will develop procedures and practices to fill in the gaps between virtual and physical laboratories in reliable and cost effective ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design allows for the evaluation of the feasibility of implementing the inter-institutional laboratory in five, four-hour rounds of simulations over three semesters.  Evaluation research will utilize a mixed-method approach, with an emphasis on interviews, surveys, observations, and usage data to assess faculty and student attitudes toward and use of the virtual cybersecurity laboratory, and the extent of cooperation among the three institutions in the implementation of the laboratory. Quantitative analysis of student performance data will allow for preliminary assessment of the promise of the virtual laboratory for achieving the expected learning outcomes related to Protect and Defend cyber security scenarios.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The completed two year pilot project Virtual Cybersecurity Collaborative Learning Laboratory (VCCLL) undertaken by the University of Southern Maine, the University of Maine at Fort Kent and York County Community College has been to determine the feasibility of implemented a virtual cybersecurity learning lab across three campuses spanning over 350 miles across the State of Maine. This project has accomplished a number of important "firsts", not the least of which is the first time a high speed connection has been made from UMS to the Maine Community College system (typically operated by third parties at least to the perimeter systems).     Among the major goals of Maine Cyber Security Cluster?s Virtual Cybersecurity Collaborative Learning Laboratory (VCCLL) have been achieved during the two year period of the grant and include:     Piloting and evaluating the feasibility of an inter-institutional virtual cyber security collaborative learning laboratory fostering teamwork among undergraduate students across large distances.     Collecting and analyzing data related to faculty and student attitudes toward and use of the virtual cybersecurity laboratory, and the extent of cooperation among the three institutions to address the implementation of the laboratory.     Assembling operational, technological and pedagogical materials to provide a replicable template for other higher education institutions to develop and implement a virtual environment platform and a collaborative learning laboratory.  The outcomes of the award include:  Developed the VCCLL Cyber Corp Cookbook as a compilation and resource for other higher education institutions who are interested in following our successful approach to creating a cybersecurity collaboratory for students where they can be engaged in real-time, hands-on cybersecurity scenarios. The CC cookbook contents detail how the collaborative partners approached creating such an environment, the choices that were made, what "ingredients" work together and lessons learned. The nine units encompass the primary areas for undertaking this kind of cybersecurity experiential learning include the following; (1) Participant?s Guide, (2) Facilitator?s Guide, (3) Technology Operations, (4) Scenario Development (5) Range Management Guide, (6) Management and Administration, (7) Partnering at a Distance, (8) Communication and Teambuilding and (9) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ?s).   Fostered opportunities for inter-campus collaboration, which is in turn, has served as a model successfully demonstrating that physical proximity of participants is no longer a prerequisite for successful inter-campus collaboration between and among the UMS and the Maine Community College System (MCCS) campuses.  Provided participating faculty with opportunities to engage in innovative research and engage more fully in scholarly dialog within Cybersecurity communities of interest.  Afforded participating students opportunities to gain practical hands-on experience in research, approaches to distance communication and collaboration, and novel group-based approaches to "real world" cybersecurity threat detection and response in an authentic cyber-range. Created opportunities for IT and Cybersecurity students to conduct meaningful work on interesting, sophisticated projects directly connected to their field of study in support of the cybersecurity research effort.  Raised non-participating student awareness and interest in Cybersecurity opportunities through announcements and word-of-mouth from actual student participants.  Contributed to the refinement of curriculum for the UMS shared Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and related degree programs recognized by the NSA/DHS under its Center of Excellence in Cyber Defense Education (CAE-CDE) program.      Engaged public sector and business leaders across the State of Maine in understanding the link between academic and applied learning in developing the workforce needs in Information Technology and Cybersecurity highly sought after in both private and public sectors in Maine.
