<AbstractNarration>Arctic sea ice is undergoing significant and accelerating change, which has been observed in increasing detail over the past several decades. Stakeholders in the Arctic and beyond are impacted by the cascading effects that these changes have on resource accessibility, ecosystem health, and earth?s physical climate system. Planning mitigation and adaptation strategies requires improvements in the ability to predict the arctic climate system. Confounding predictive model development are large gaps that remain in the understanding of the role albedo feedbacks are playing in sea ice loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve the understanding the impacts of solar energy absorption and partitioning on ice mass balance by tracking Arctic Observing Network (AON) sea ice sites as they move through space and time, using the rich datasets being collected at the sites as case studies. The approach integrates AON data with measurements from prior field campaigns, atmospheric reanalysis products, and high resolution remote sensing data using a 3D resolved sea ice-ocean mixed layer coupled model. The objectives are to quantify the deposition of solar energy within a 10x10km study domain around the sites with meter-scale resolution, identify the fate of that solar energy over time (e.g. ocean storage vs. ice bottom melt vs. lateral melt), and improve the ability of our resolved scale model to represent the processes controlling solar absorption and fate. The model explicitly represents critical ice and ocean processes such as melt pond formation, brine drainage, freshwater balance, and upper ocean stratification, providing a tool for data integration that can account for all first order processes impacting radiative transfer and heat storage. Important gaps in initialization datasets will be addressed by an ensemble modeling approach. Iterative comparison of site observations with model states will inform the selection of poorly constrained initial conditions, evaluate system sensitivity, and allow testing of improved model parameterizations for processes such as pond evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Background:</p> <p>Arctic sea ice melt is one of the most dramatic examples of Earth?s changing climate. The loss of ice can amplify climate warming because unfrozen ocean absorbs far more sunlight than ice covered water, causing further warming. We worked to better understand this feedback between ice melt and increased sunlight absorption, focusing on melt ponding. When Arctic sea ice starts melting, water quickly pools atop the ice. These pools ? melt ponds ? darken the surface and cause it to absorb more sunlight, melting faster. We wanted to know: Are melt pond conditions changing? How much does melt pond formation increase the absorption of sunlight? Does that additional heat go immediately to melting more ice, accelerating feedbacks, or is it stored in the upper ocean? We set out to observe the ponds, understand them better, and quantify how they contribute to heating the Arctic and melting ice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Scientific Results</p> <p>First we needed to see the ponds. High resolution satellite imagery required is not collected by an existing program. We collaborated with the Polar Geospatial Center, U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and Army Corps of Engineers to coordinate collection of high resolution satellite imagery at 40 key stationary sites and several drifting buoy sites across the Arctic, resulting in an image library of several thousand images. The imagery is archived as it is collected and available to all federally funded researchers. A small sub-sample of the imagery is shown in Figure 1A.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To quantify surface coverage from the images we developed, validated, and published an algorithm that processes the imagery. The Open Source Sea ice Processing (OSSP) algorithm is based on a watershed segmentation (Figure 1B) and a random forest machine learning classification. OSSP enables sea ice imagery to be processed in a reliable, reproducible way, identifying changes in the state of the ice/ocean surface over time (Figure 1C). We carefully validated the method against human classification, published this validation, and released the code as a well-documented open-source code package to the community. The OSSP code includes a graphical user interface that assists users in developing new ?training? sets to detect other surface types (Figure 2). Several other teams are using the code already.</p> <p>We intended to use high resolution images to ?spot check? estimates of melt pond coverage from a different satellite, MODIS, which images the entire Arctic daily. MODIS resolution is 500m instead of &lt;1m and melt ponds cannot be seen individually in its images (Figure 3). We tested an existing method for estimating melt pond coverage based on the color of the pixels against our ?spot check? and found that it did not work well enough for our needs. Errors in melt pond estimation prevented us from understanding how they were evolving and contributing to energy absorption and ice melt. To address this problem, we developed and validated an improved machine-learning approach for deriving pond coverage from low resolution imagery using the ?spot check? images for training (Figure 4). The tools give us much better capability to monitor changes in sea ice ponds.</p> <p>We also made major upgrades to the physics captured in a computer model of melt ponding. These account for new evidence about how freshwater and snow cause ponds to form. The revised model was tested against our observations of melt pond change and is now able to successfully replicate the melt pond evolution we observed. We used the model and pond data to better understand what causes melt ponds to start forming in the spring. The date that ponds initially form varies by about a month and is a powerful predictor of ice melt. We found that melt ponding starts on cloudy, stormy days ? rather than sunny days. Since white snow is able to reflect nearly all the sunlight that hits it, sunny days are actually cooler. A stormy cloudy day enhances sensible and longwave radiative heat fluxes, initiating melt onset and pond initiation. Therefore, the intrusion of spring storms into the arctic in spring is a critical process in initiating ice loss.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Broader Impacts</p> <p>This project also included a large effort to engage our communities. We worked with the Montshire Museum to develop new programs to capture the excitement of Arctic research and educate public and K-12 audiences (Figure 5, 6). New materials were collaboratively developed, then delivered by Montshire staff in a variety of formats. Large numbers (5600+) of underserved rural K-12 students and adults throughout Upper New England were directly engaged in programming including: 148 family workshops at the museum with 646&nbsp;participants, 168 students in grades 5-8 and 22 teachers in the Earth?s Energy Balance workshops, 22 in-school activities reaching 30 teachers and 368 students in grades 3-8 and 46 teacher/adults enrolled in multi-week courses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/17/2019<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;Polashenski</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol">
