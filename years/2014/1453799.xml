<AbstractNarration>One of the fundamental questions in neuroscience concerns memory-- how it works and why it goes wrong.  Decades of research have identified that, at the cellular level, formation of new synaptic connections and remodeling of pre-existing synaptic connections are critical for memory formation. However, very little is known about how long-term memories are stored at specific synapses in the brain. To address this fundamental and unresolved problem, the investigators will take advantage of the large, identified neurons of the well-studied gill-withdrawal reflex circuitry of the sea snail Aplysia. The key components of this neural circuitry can easily be identified, isolated, and cultured to generate neural circuits in a dish that are amenable to investigation at the single-cell and subcellular level.  Integrating synapse-specific physiological measurements with state-of-the-art live-cell imaging and tools for single-cell genomics analysis, the investigators will study the role of axonal transport in generating and maintaining synapse-specific long-term memory. The results from this work will yield novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the synapse-specific nature of long-term memories. As part of this project, high school and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds will receive mentoring and be actively involved in various aspects of this study. Furthermore, a neuroscience inquiry-based lesson that involves the training of middle and high school students and middle school teachers will be developed and implemented.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project investigates the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying synapse-specific long-term memory storage. First, the project will assess whether and how gene products such as proteins and mRNAs are transported from the cell-body of neurons to specific synapses. Because the molecular motor protein kinesin mediates the transport of gene products from the cell-body, kinesin movement to synapses during memory formation and maintenance will be studied using advanced quantitative live-cell imaging microscopy. Second, mRNAs transported to specific synaptic compartments by kinesin will be identified using single-cell genomics tools. Third, whether and how the synapse communicates back to the cell-body during memory formation will be studied by characterizing the molecular motor protein dynein that moves from the synapse to the cell body. Taken together, these studies will bring novel molecular and mechanistic insights into understanding long-term memory storage and help identify specific mRNAs localized to specific synaptic compartments for storing long-term memories.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Long-term memory (LTM) is an essential attribute of humans that makes us who we are and self-aware. Decades of research have concluded that specific alterations in neuronal connections are required to form LTM. These alterations in neuronal connections (synapses) include formation of new ones and remodeling of preexisting ones. Formation of LTM also requires changes in the levels of specific ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that translate genetic code into proteins. Unlike other cells, neurons are characterized by their elaborate architecture comprising of axons and dendrites that connect with other neurons. A given neuron is able to potentially connect with 10,000 other neurons. This immense architectural complexity raises a fundamental question on how these connections are made, maintained and what mechanisms underlie specificity of forming connections. These questions were the focus of the present study. Specifically, we studied the role of transport from the cell body to synapses in making, maintaining and modifying neuronal connections.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Transport in neurons is a breathtaking process in which proteins known as molecular motors move along specific tracks made up of proteins called tubulins or actin, meticulously transporting cargos (RNAs and proteins) to synapses. Molecular motors such as kinesins mediate the long-distance transport of cargos for the synaptic rearrangements for maintaining connections and formation of LTM. Several aspects of this process such as the regulation of transport, what motors mediate transport and composition of cargos are poorly understood.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During this award from the National Science Foundation, we obtained three critical insights into the transport process. <em>First</em>, we discovered that during formation of synapses and maintaining synapses, transport of an organelle, mitochondria, that provides energy for neuronal function becomes persistently enhanced. This observation led us to examine underlying molecular mechanisms. We find that gene expression and new protein synthesis are persistently altered following synapse formation (Badal et al., Cell Reports, 2019). For characterizing transport, we developed methodologies - quantitative assessments of transport such as the velocity and flux of transport (Badal et al, Methods in Molecular Biology, under review). <em>Second</em>, we studied the roles of multiple families of kinesin molecular motors in synaptic communication. We find that while some kinesins are necessary for neuronal communication, some are not and some kinesins act as inhibitory constraints (Swarnkar et al., Nature Scientific Reports, 2018). Kinesins that function as inhibitory constraints are of special interest because some of these also function in cell division (Joseph et al., Cells, under review). We studied this group of kinesins and found that kinesin Kif3B acts as a negative modulator of synaptic structural changes (Joseph et al., Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, 2020). <em>Third</em>, we identified several RNAs transported to synapses by a specific kinesin Kif5C for synthesizing new proteins for synaptic structural changes (Swarnkar et al., Cell Reports, under review). Together these studies bring critical insights into the regulation of transport and underlying mechanisms. Discovery of the regulation of mitochondrial transport, the role of kinesins in neuronal communication and the role of kinesins in synaptic structural changes are the highlights of the study. &nbsp;Furthermore, these studies are now taking us in several new directions that we are beginning to explore - what other organelles are transported to synapses during synapse maintenance and plasticity? Whether and how transport from the synapses to the cell body is regulated? Whether different molecular motors cooperate during transport? Whether localized RNAs regulate synaptic structural changes? Together these studies are expected to bring new insights into the communication between the soma and synapses.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During the course of this research, we emphasized training of future researchers. This included training of middle school, high school and undergraduate students apart from graduate students and PhD level scientists (postdoctoral researchers). We developed a lecture series geared towards a local middle school (HL Watkins Middle School) that consists of three lectures and three demonstrations on learning and memory. These lectures were given every year in December and covered basic mechanisms of neurons and synapses, anatomy of human and animal brain, and the psychiatric and neurological disorders of the brain and drug addiction. Demonstration included viewing neurons of the sea slug <em>Aplysia</em> and mice under a microscope and identification of brain regions using a human brain model and a post-mortem human brain. These lectures and demonstrations were led by high school students, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in the lab. Watkins Middle School science teachers facilitated by setting up the classes as well as assembling interested students from the 6, 7 and 8<sup>th</sup> grades. Apart from science lectures and demonstrations, there were also career talks given by all instructors - enlightening students about what motivated each instructor to choose science, selecting particular schools for their studies and what excites them in research. Our assessments show that students learned a substantial amount of knowledge about the brain and developed an interest in basic and translational neurosciences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/07/2020<br>      Modified by: Sathyanarayanan&nbsp;Puthanveettil</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1453799/1453799_10384736_1602014468390_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1453799/1453799_10384736_1602014468390_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1453799/1453799_10384736_1602014468390_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Mitochondria in sensory neuron axon</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sathya Puthanveettil</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sathyanarayanan&nbsp;Puthanveettil</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1453799/1453799_10384736_1602014600046_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1453799/1453799_10384736_1602014600046_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1453799/1453799_10384736_1602014600046_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sensory motor neuron co-culture</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sathya Puthanveettil</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sathyanarayanan&nbsp;Puthanveettil</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 2</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
