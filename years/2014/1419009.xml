<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit.  The 25th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research will be held July 28-August 1, 2014 at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.  The conference will bring together scientists from across the world to discuss results of research using Arabidopsis as a model plant system.  Knowledge gained from research on this model informs all aspects of basic plant biology.  The meeting will feature keynote talks from leaders in the field:  three who work on Arabidopsis and one who works on a non-plant system (yeast). As always, the conference will cover a broad range of topics, ranging from physiology to molecular biology.  An emerging research area, Synthetic Biology, will be featured in one of the sessions. A new feature to highlight research from the posters will be the addition of two-minute "oral poster" talks (two per session), selected from submitted abstracts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  Meeting organizers have paid careful attention to encouraging participation of minority and early-career researchers.  A recently established Minority Affairs Committee has formulated specific objectives for encouraging networking and collaboration, both during the meeting and afterward.  The format of the meeting and the many types of events will ensure broad access and sharing of results of cutting edge plant biology research, in keeping with the spirit of free exchange that is a hallmark of the Arabidopsis community.</AbstractNarration>
