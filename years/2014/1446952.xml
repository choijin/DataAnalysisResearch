<AbstractNarration>This travel grant assists in the formation of a new community around Search-Based Software Engineering by funding travel for students to a new symposium.  Search-based software engineering (SBSE) views software engineering problems as optimization problems utilizing metaheuristic  techniques to discover near optimal solutions.  The symposium will bring together researchers (and their students) from many different areas of Software Engineering. The travel support will enable students to participate and learn from others in the field and advance their research.</AbstractNarration>
