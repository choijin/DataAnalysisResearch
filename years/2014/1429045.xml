<AbstractNarration>PI: Campagnola, Paul J.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1429045&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI: Development of Multiscale Imaging Platform for Quantitative Analysis of Collagen Organization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance&lt;br/&gt;The equipment and experimental platform will greatly extend the UW-Madison research infrastructure and open up new possibilities for studying a wide range of disease states that have associated collagen alteration, which may have translational possibilities to a variety of clinical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI developed an optical microscopy graduate course as part of the biomedical engineering curriculum. The PI and co-PIs all lecture in the undergraduate/graduate survey course "the Microscopy of Life" which covers microscopy, biomedical imaging techniques, and bioinformatics. The graduate students will be immersed in a highly interdisciplinary research environment that involves aspects of cancer biology, imaging, optical engineering, and imaging analysis engineering. Their training will also provide exposure to different possible career paths including academia and industry. Undergraduates and high school students will also be involved in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will develop a "Multiscale Imaging Platform for Quantitative Analysis of Collagen Organization" to interrogate size scales of ~100 nm through several mms of tissues. This system will incorporate Enhanced BackScattering (EBS) for characterization of nanoarchitecture by optical scattering, laser scanning Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy for collagen visualization at the submicron and micron scale, and Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) for quantifying larger aspects of tissue organization. The integration into a single platform affords significant advantages over individual correlated measurements. The instrument will also afford both scientific studies of optical and acoustic scattering and also provide the framework for future clinical diagnostic capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The applications of this instrumentation platform will be focused on investigating collagen and its role and alteration in normal and diseased processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The organization of fibrous collagen is important to a wide range of diseases, e.g. including all cancers and fibroses,  but current tools are not capable of characterizing these structures across all the relevant spatial-scales and this leaves knowledge gaps on how collagen contributes to various diseases.  Fibrous collagens are proteins that provides structure to tissue in the form of fiber scaffolds.  These scaffolds change in many diseases and biological processes including cancer, heart disease, wound-healing, and pregnancy occur across multiple spatial scales; from nanoscale cross-linking between collagen fibrils to macroscale density changes across organs.  However, it is difficult to fully understand these changes because conventional imaging modalities image at a single spatial-scale.  Typically, a single imaging method can obtain information at large volumes or in high detail, but not both at once.  Thus, characterizing collagen across multiple scales requires combining data from multiple imaging modalities.  Combining multiple modalities is a difficult task without dedicated tools and protocols, and so is rarely done.  This is a significant limitation to both basic and translation research applications, for understanding collagen processes or for developing biomarkers and interventions to target collagen in disease.  To solve this problem, we developed a quantitative multiscale imaging system for imaging collagen.  Our labs pursued three main avenues of development over the course of the grant.  The first is the development of open-source software to control Laser-Scanning Microscopy (LSM) systems to control the Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems, to acquire enhanced back scattered (EBS data), and to interface with an external ultrasound  interface.  The second is the construction of the imaging platform itself, which currently incorporates the imaging modalities of SHG, US, OCT, and EBS. These modalities are now all co-registered and ready for deployment for biomedical problems. The overall design will be freely disseminated to the public.  An important contribution of the project was the development of an open-source software package for controlling LSM instruments.  Historically labs resorted either to in-house solutions built on highly individualized code bases or to commercial solutions that run on specific systems.  There was no easy solution for new labs that wished to build their own LSM instruments. We had previously developed other hardware/software packages but these had become obsolete. Thus, we dedicated resources to developing a new open-source software package to tackle both issues.  This led to an LSM control solution based on modern hardware and openly available to speed scientific discoveries. This resulting software package, known as OpenScan, is based on the Manager framework for controlling microscopy devices. This OpenScan system is in regular use controlling the acquisition and will be published in 2019 and disseminated freely.
