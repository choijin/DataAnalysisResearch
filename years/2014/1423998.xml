<AbstractNarration>This project analyzes the determinants of local public goods spending in a developing democracy, Kenya, by examining variation in the management of the country's Constituency Development Fund (CDF) between several different parliamentary constituencies. It focuses on how local demographic features like ethnic divisions and civic participation in public life jointly shape the incentives of politicians to target particular communities for public works projects. Original survey research and interview data will examine the extent to which these social features lead politicians to privilege the interests of certain groups over others, as well as how politicians manage the fund in ways that are consistent with their political goals. In so doing, this study contributes to the growth of generalizable knowledge about the efficacy of democratic governance in the developing world, where governments struggle to deliver basic services to their citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Recent work on ethnicity and public goods has helped clarify the mechanisms by which ethnic diversity negatively impacts levels of public goods provision. However, this research too often focuses on diversity itself rather than examining the political salience of ethnic divisions. This focus tends to examine ethnicity in a vacuum, isolated from the political institutions and social contexts in which actual distributive decisions take place. By critically examining how ethnic identity interacts with these contextual features, the present study will offer a more complete picture of distributive politics in developing-world democracies. In addition, by systematically comparing constituencies with varying levels of civic participation, the study facilitates a test of theories suggesting that widespread civic engagement can induce greater public accountability from legislators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research speaks directly to matters of practical concern about the performance of new democracies in Africa. Understanding how ethnic identity and the behavior of civil society impact public goods provision is essential for ensuring representative governance and promoting equitable development. The information will be useful to policymakers eager to expand access to public goods provision to broader segments of the population. In addition, the investigators will be able to share the results of the research broadly within academic communities in Kenya, at the universities with which the researchers are obtaining research affiliations, as well as in seminars and conferences in the United States. Survey data from this project will likewise be made publicly available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant supported field research by the co-Principal Investigator, Kirk A. Harris, for his PhD dissertation, "Pathways to Accountability: Ethnicity and Allocation in Kenya?s Constituency Development Fund."  The dissertation examines how ethnicity mediates the provision of local infrastructure projects like schools, clinics, and roads in Kenya.  It asks why politicians in some ethnically diverse constituencies target co-ethnics with these projects, while others spread funding across ethnic groups.   During the grant funding period, Kirk travelled to Kenya twice to collect data for this project, from July to November 2014 and June to August 2015.  He conducted over 150 interviews in six research sites across Kenya with grassroots civil society advocates, civil servants, political figures, project beneficiaries, and other stakeholders in Kenya?s Constituency Development Fund (CDF).  The CDF is a Kenyan government initiative that funds local infrastructure projects in each of the country?s 290 parliamentary constituencies.  During this time, Kirk also designed a representative multi-stage clustered survey of 1,164 Kenyan adults in three such constituencies.  This survey was carried out by a local public opinion firm.  Several key questions from this survey were added to a nationally-representative survey of 2,002 Kenyan adults.  The qualitative data collected for this project demonstrate that the political salience of local ethnic divisions varies systematically in Kenyan politics.  The political salience of ethnicity helps determine who politicians favor when allocating public funds.  When Kenyan voters are organized into stable, ethnically-polarized political coalitions, knowledge of a voter?s ethnic identity confers reliable information about which candidate he or she will support.  As a result, incumbent politicians in these settings have incentives to target co-ethnics.  In diverse settings where party loyalties bridge ethnic divisions or fragment ethnic blocs, ethnicity fails to confer information about an individual?s political preferences, and politicians are forced to rely on non-ethnic criteria when distributing development resources.  These findings suggest that diversity alone is a poor explanation for inequitable public goods provision.  Preliminary analysis of quantitative data from the three parliamentary constituencies surveyed for this project indicates that the ability of Kenyan politicians to target members of their own ethnic group with public spending is affected by the geographic distribution of groups within their constituencies.  In places where ethnic groups are geographically segregated, co-ethnics of the local elected official report higher rates of access to local infrastructure projects than do non-co-ethnics.  However, in constituencies where members of different ethnic groups live alongside each other, an individual?s ethnic identity fails to predict the level of service that he or she receives from these projects.  These findings suggest that the nature of a good or resource affects its utility as a tool for patronage.  Unlike pure private goods, which can be targeted effectively at individuals, local infrastructure projects are targeted at the community level; who lives in that community determines who benefits from spending.  The importance of these projects for grassroots development in Africa &ndash; where politics often revolves around ethnic divisions &ndash; means that the spatial distribution of ethnic groups is an important factor in determining resource allocation and social welfare.
