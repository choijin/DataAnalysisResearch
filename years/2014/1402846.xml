<AbstractNarration>1402846&lt;br/&gt;Cote&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to develop a transformative low cost, high quality, noninvasive, cellphone-based, optical polarimetric imaging system for point-of-care applications. The specific aims are to design, model, build, and test the system and to develop android based applications for controlling cell phone camera features and perform image processing. This system will utilize a single lens on-chip white light polarized imaging to aid in the diagnosis of several diseases through the detection of variations in  the linear states of polarized light as it passes through tissue or blood sample. There are many conditions that induce changes in polarized light and the device is meant to assist medical professionals in the clinic and in low resource settings in the proper diagnosis of these conditions. The initial applications for developing this device include in vivo diagnosis of skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in vitro detection of malaria in the lab or in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major focus of this research was the design and development of an innovative portable optical microscopy and microfluidic cartridge system for diagnosing diseases.  The initial application was diagnosis of malaria in the field, outside of a hospital lab, at the point-of-care (POC).    Malaria can be described as a parasitic disease that is spread by mosquitos in tropical regions and it threatens nearly 3 billion people worldwide. The disease resulted in the death of over 400,000 people in 2015 and particularly affect children. Worldwide, the death rates associated with the disease have fallen somewhat, however, drug resistance and limited resources are still barriers to eradication of this disease in underserved populations. The gold standard for malaria diagnosis remains bright field microscopy of a stained blood smear by skilled technicians in a full service laboratory. This is prohibitive in remote areas where malaria is pervasive. Thus, an automated, affordable, method of generating uniform blood smears, acquiring microscopic images, and processing the data on a smart device in the field is needed to solve these problems.  With the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF), researchers including engineering faculty, staff, graduate and undergraduate students at Texas A&amp;M University have developed an advanced but affordable system that included both a novel microfluidic cartridge technology and a portable optical microscope to reduce the costs associated with testing for malaria and other infectious diseases. The novel microfluidic cartridges allow for the safe, easy, and reliable creation of blood smears. This is important because obtaining a uniform blood smear is hard to do for a health care provider in a small village clinic who does not work in a central lab and is not trained in this area.  The microscope was designed to include low cost lenses and mirrors along with novel low-cost microscope components combined into a small portable device that sends images to an easy-to-use reader like an iPad.  This combination of technologies provides high-quality imaging of repeatable and uniform blood smears for non-technical personal to make a diagnosis at the remote places outside a hospital lab setting where it is needed most.   The funding not only provided for the development of the advanced and affordable microscopic and microfluidic cartridge system for diagnostic use but also included both faculty and the direct training of one post-doctoral student, four Ph.D. students, and four undergraduate students.  In addition, the research was widely disseminated to both the technical community through several journal publications and conference proceedings and talks as well as to the general public through a video press release and through several lab visits and demonstrations, in particular, given to K-12 students. We have also considered commercialization and have a patent pending on the technology.  Overall, this funding has allowed us to educate students and disseminate new research to the technical community and pubic as well as perform the research to create advanced but affordable and easy-to-use systems that can diagnose infectious diseases like malaria outside of a central lab at the POC.  These systems could be used to improve access at the point-of-care and have the potential to help combat both current and future health threats in the United States and around the world.
