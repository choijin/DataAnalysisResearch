<AbstractNarration>A team of investigators proposes to investigate the response of the Laurentide and Greenland Ice Sheets to two short term cooling events (several decades to a few centuries in duration) that occurred 9.3 and 8.2 thousand years ago. Assessing the sensitivity of ice sheets to short term climate variability is at the forefront of the scientific community's and the public's interest because short term ice sheet change will drive 21st century sea level rise. Thus a central question of the proposed work is whether ice sheets react abruptly to climate forcings, or are multi-millennial-scale trends in climate required to elicit a large-scale ice sheet response?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose an intensive field-based research program capitalizing on their newly published work reconstructing ice sheet change using high-precision beryllium-10 dating to test the hypothesis that prominent moraine systems marking former ice extents in West Greenland and Baffin Island record the synchronous advance of the Greenland and Laurentide ice sheets driven by the abrupt cooling events 9.3 and 8.2 thousand years ago. Pilot data reveal that portions of the ice sheet margin that are in contact with the surrounding ocean are able to respond rapidly to a short-lived climate perturbation. To test whether these documented changes were restricted to solely the most sensitive marine-terminating ice sheet sectors, or whether ice sheets are capable of a larger scale response to centennial-scale climate change, well-constrained chronologies of ice sheet change are needed from other regions. The investigators' research objectives are to 1) establish how land-terminating regions of ice sheets, which are more representative of broader ice sheet margins, respond to abrupt climate change, 2) further evaluate the role that oceanic forcing plays in modulating ice sheet response to short-lived climate perturbations, and 3) reconstruct the early Holocene behavior of mountain glacier systems (a proxy for summertime temperature) to evaluate what climatic conditions influenced the ice sheets. The investigators will work to make results easily accessible to the public. The work is led by an early career investigator and will support two graduate and several undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this award was to determine how sensitively past Arctic ice sheets responded to abrupt climate change on the order of global warming. To do this, the PIs generated detailed histories of ice sheet and glacier changes from Greenland and Arctic Canada spanning the last period in Earth history of major ice sheet demise (~12,000 to ~7000 years ago).  The PIs and their graduate students visited remote parts of Arctic Canada and Greenland to collect geologic samples from features - still preserved on the landscapes today &ndash; that were generated when vast ice sheets retreated at the end of the last Ice Age.  With these samples, the group reconstructed the timing of past ice sheet changes. They repeated the sample collections for both small and large glaciers, and ice sheets on both the Canada and Greenland sides of Baffin Bay.  What the group found surprised them. It boils down to this: During the last episode of significant ice sheet recession in the Arctic, there were a series of halts or re-adjustments during overall glacier demise.  Armed with high precision dating methods, the PIs found that no matter what type of glacial system was investigated (small alpine glaciers, marine-influenced ice sheet outlet glaciers, or broad sectors of land-based ice sheet margins), they ALL exhibit the exact same retreat pattern.  In other words, a series of cold climate events superimposed on overall Arctic warming halted glacier recession during the last period of Arctic deglaciation.   Between 12,000 and 7000 years ago, there were 5 brief periods in time, each a century or less, that forced glaciers to stop their retreat. Because the timing of glacier change during these cold climate events is the same - from small glaciers to large ice sheets - it reveals that even large ice sheets can respond to brief episodes of climate change. Arctic ice sheets must not have a long response time to climate. This is a relatively new realization.  Today's ice sheet changes include both responses to climate but also to a variety of complicated ice dynamics processes. The data from this award reveal that when one looks beyond the year to decade scale, and at the multiple decade scale up to a century, climate dominates ice sheet response and large ice sheets are very sensitive to climate change.  The results also led the PIs to speculate that meltwater from ice sheets themselves provides a mechanism to make a cold climate snap. This means, at some level, that ice sheet wastage can trigger a negative feedback - or create a buffer - that slows additional melt.  This is due to the interaction that ice sheet meltwater has with ocean circulation.  More ice sheet meltwater, slower oceanic overturning, cooler temperatures in adjacent seas, and then glaciers experience a brief phase of slowed or halted retreat. Hence, the results provide some important insights into the complicated ice sheet - ocean circulation - atmospheric temperature system/feedback that is relevant in today's world of ice sheet demise, and for our ability to model/predict future sea level rise.
