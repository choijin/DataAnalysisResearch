<AbstractNarration>This project is co-funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program and the Condensed Matter Physics Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: Going beyond classical digital electronics to devices based on quantum switches is a goal of modern materials research. Graphene grown on trenches etched in silicon carbide have recently shown incredible electronic and magnetic properties that potentially offer a new platform for quantum-based electronics. Conductivities 100 times larger than theoretical predicted maximums are now obtainable. However, the physical origin of these amazing properties is not yet clear. This research project aims to understand the detailed structure of sub-50 nanometer graphene ribbons and to develop new ways to reproducibly grow and alter their electronic properties. The societal impact of developing these graphene ribbons for near room-temperature quantum-switching networks would have far reaching impacts. In addition to the influence on technology, the project will train undergraduate students in this new field, as well as educating high-school science teachers so that they may better advise their students on the rewards of scientific and engineering professions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: It has recently been shown that graphene grown on the sidewalls of SiC trenches has exceptional transport properties with mobilities exceeding predicted limits for 2-dimentional graphene by more than two orders of magnitude [Nature 506, 349-354 (2014)]. The high degree of order implied by these exceptional properties offers an opportunity to make significant advances in graphene electronics. However, the physical origin of the novel room-temperature ballistic transport in these ribbons is not understood. This proposal's goal is to correlate the nanostructure of the graphene sidewall ribbons with their measured band structure. The research team intends to uncover the role of strain, substrate bonding, and finite size effects on the electronic properties of these unique ribbons and their spectacular transport. The team uses a broad set of high-resolution surface sensitive probes that allow the research to go beyond transport experiments alone to directly measure their electronic structure. It employs high-resolution angle resolved photoemission to measure their electronic band structure and correlate those results with ribbon structure measured by scanning tunneling microscopy, low energy electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have worked to advance the understanding of graphene for use as a new type of electronics.  While much has been written or proposed for this novel material, basic materials development has been lacking. After 10 years of work by dozens of other groups studying the same material, the this material was measured to be insulating, predicted to be an insulator then a a metal.  All of that work was wrong because of poor materials characterization.    In our detailed materials studies, we have not only shown that we can make semiconducting graphene, we have shown the how and the why iit becomes semiconducting.  Careful, not sexy, materials growth experiments coupled with many sophisticated characterization tools were required to figure out how and why to manipulate this new material.   Our work on oxide layers, deposited on graphene, have also produced important results.  Oxide gates are the key layer needed to make transistors; including graphene transistors.  It is always assumed that hte oxide does not react with graphene.  Our preliminary work shows that when an oxide is grown on graphene, it has a significant reaction with the graphene, altering its order and its electronic properties.  This finding calls into question all previous studies of gated graphene transistors.  It means that results from those experiments were not measuring the properties of graphene but instead some modified form of graphene.  It shows that graphene, despite being called non-reactive, is in fact reactive.  This result is particularly disturbing in new two dimensional materials now being funded by the NSF as a replacement for graphene.  These new materials are even more reactive compared to graphene so that the oxide interaction can be even more detrimental.  Finally, we have worked to understand zig-zag edge graphene ribbons.  These ribbons were expected to be ballistic conductors (i.e., their resistance is independent of their length. Indeed this has been demonstrated in graphene ribbons grown on the 6H form of silicon carbide (SiC).  A series of conduction experiments on 4H SiC went on to explain how the ballistic conduction came about.  The problem is, as we have shown, that graphene does not grow on 4H SiC! How those conduction experiments be related to ballistic transport.  The answer is that it cannot.  We have shown the physical reason why 4H and 6H SiC are different.  The principle outcomes of our work has been to show that studies of two-dimensional materials is much more complicated than what the general literature appears to present. Precise structural and electronic measurements are needed to understand what transport measurements are really probing. We have globally shown that simple models for the electronic properties of narrow electronically isolated ribbons are wrong. The nuances of the graphene ribbon-substrate interaction and its structure have been ignored even though they play the key role in how these materials behave. This statement also holds to other 2D materials where materials characterization is more difficult and has subsequently been ignored.
