<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to conduct a 2-year empirical study that will: (1) identify the mentoring structures that are empirically observable in undergraduate research experiences at research universities, in terms of the strength and function of relationships within the undergraduate-postgraduate-faculty triad; (2) examine how different mentoring structures relate to the cognitive, behavioral, and affective outcomes undergraduates realize from participating in research; and (3) determine the extent to which women and underrepresented minority undergraduates experience different mentoring structures or realize outcomes differentially in comparison to majority students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Undergraduate researchers in the life sciences are often mentored by both a faculty member and a graduate student or postdoctoral researcher (postgraduate). The goal of this project was to understand how the mentoring structures undergraduates experience contribute to the outcomes they realize from participating in research. Specifically, we aimed to (1) empirically characterize the range of mentoring structures undergraduate researchers experience, (2) determine how different mentoring structures relate to their outcomes of participating in research, and (3) determine whether students from different backgrounds experience different mentoring configurations and outcomes.</p> <p>To accomplish these objectives, we collected data from ~2,000 undergraduate researchers who worked directly with a faculty mentor (i.e., dyad) or with both a postgraduate and faculty mentor (i.e., triad) at colleges and universities across the country. We conducted a series of analyses that resulted in the following discoveries:</p> <p>- In general, undergraduate researchers report gains in their abilities to think and work like scientists, confidence in their ability to do science, growth in their scientific identities, and increased interest in pursuing research related careers. Undergraduate researchers also report scholarly productivity, such as presenting their research at local and national conferences and reporting their results in peer-review journal articles. These results demonstrate that undergraduates are not simply doing menial research tasks; they are contributing to the scientific endeavor and are growing personally and professionally in the process.</p> <p>- The majority of undergraduate researchers at research universities are mentored by both postgraduates and faculty members (open triad) or by postgraduates who are in turn mentored by faculty members (closed triad). Undergraduates in closed triads report more positive outcomes than undergraduates in other triadic mentoring structures, and similar to undergraduates who are mentored directly by faculty (dyad mentoring structure). Closed triads may be uniquely beneficial learning environments, perhaps because they offer a combination of practical guidance from postgraduates and big-picture guidance from faculty. Undergraduate researchers who meet at least weekly with their faculty mentors report the most positive outcomes.</p> <p>- Female undergraduate researchers are more likely to report being in open triads than males, although the differences were small. Under-represented minority (URM) students were more likely to report being in a closed triad compared to white students, although again the differences were small. The mentoring structures that women and URM students experienced explained at least part of the differences in their research outcomes (less positive for women, more positive for URM students). Asian students were also more likely to report being in open triads and experiencing less positive research outcomes, but their mentoring structure was unrelated to this. Altogether, these results suggest that students&rsquo; research mentoring structures play a role in their ability to maximize the outcomes of their research experience, and that their mentoring structures differ in ways that relate to their gender and race/ethnicity.</p> <p>- Undergraduates who perceive themselves as having deep-level similarity (e.g., similar values, beliefs, and attitudes) to their mentors reported more positive outcomes, although the effects were modest. This result is encouraging because it suggests that undergraduates may view themselves as similar to their mentors even when they don&rsquo;t have the same gender, race, or ethnicity and that this similarity is associated with positive outcomes. This means that mentoring relationships need not be limited to those that match in terms of gender, race, or ethnicity, thereby broadening the potential for students to benefit from research experiences regardless of their background or personal characteristics.</p> <p>- Undergraduates who are both intrinsically and extrinsically motivated to participate in research report positive outcomes, but intrinsically motivated students report more positive outcomes. Undergraduates&rsquo; motives appear unrelated to the mentoring support they receive. These results raise questions about how to allocate undergraduate research experiences among students who differ in their motives, such as whether to give priority to intrinsically motivated students who are most likely to benefit.</p> <p>- Undergraduates realize positive outcomes regardless of their mentors&rsquo; motives for mentoring. However, undergraduates mentored by intrinsically motivated postgraduates report more positive outcomes, due in part to the provision of psychosocial support, such as encouragement and role modeling.
