<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating microbial capacitive desalination (MCD) technology to fill the need for energy efficient, modular, and mobile water management solutions for the emerging oil and natural gas industry using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.  Current technologies for on site treatment and reuse are very energy and cost intensive. Consequently, large quantities of contaminated water are transported and re-injected without treatment, an approach that is attracting public and regulatory attention. The MCD is important because it solves the environmental problems of produced water (wastewater) transportation, re-injection, and groundwater contamination, and it can recycle billions of gallons of water for beneficial use while harvesting energy from the chemical reactions. The project will result in a prototype MCD system with improved performance under real environmental conditions. This product has the following unique features:  it is a smaller, mobile system that generates rather than consumes energy while removing hydrocarbons, salts, and metals.  These features provide much higher efficiency and lower cost when compared to the leading competing water management practices in this market space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  It enables the integration of advanced manufacturing, automation control, and process engineering for modular system development and scale up. It also provides a testing platform for hydraulic, mechanical, and environmental characterizations under different conditions, which provides crucial information for system optimization and application. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including postdoctoral researchers and students will gain both technological and entrepreneurship experience through technology development and transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages manufacturing companies and oil and gas companies to identify commercialization pathways and test environment in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>
