<AbstractNarration>This project will take a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding the response of Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland to climate change in the past. Petermann Glacier drains a significant fraction of the northern Greenland ice sheet and terminates in a large floating ice shelf that is sensitive to ice-ocean interactions. Ice retreat over the last decade opens access to the fjord and presents an opportunity to understand sedimentation processes under the area previously covered by ice shelf and to calibrate reconstructions of past ice shelf variations. Using a variety of technologies and approaches on land, ice, and at sea, the investigators will map the bottom of the fjord in front of and under the ice shelf; reconstruct ocean conditions and their role in ice shelf variations through time; reconstruct the past extent of the glacier on land and the floating ice shelf; and reconstruct local relative sea level. Together these efforts will create a comprehensive picture of the climate conditions and response of the Petermann Glacier to these conditions over the last 10,000 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of key interest will be the timing, extent, rates of change, and variability (on land and in the sea) during the early Holocene when local relative sea level was over 100 meters higher than today (due to lagging isostatic rebound of the crust in response to deglaciation), but the inland ice sheet was still large relative to today. The investigators will address dynamic responses to multiple interacting variables over a range of response times (from tens to thousands of years) relevant to potential future impacts. Specific research questions include: 1) How sensitive is Petermann ice shelf extent to documented climate changes within the Holocene? 2) Is shelf response independent of, or linked to, variations in the grounded Petermann Glacier, ocean thermal conditions, or relative sea level (i.e., sill depth)? 3) What are the rates of change and variability of these systems in response to early Holocene warming, Neoglacial cooling, and recent warming? The project will support several young investigators and will provide them with both ship and land-based training experiences. The project includes significant international collaborations, with substantial in-kind contributions from non-U.S. sources that add value to the project. Planned outreach includes teacher participation in the field program and meaningful classroom involvement at several levels.</AbstractNarration>

The collaborative group used the geological and geophysical data collected during the summer 2015 cruise of icebreaker Oden (OD1507) to Petermann Fjord and Hall Basin to accomplish our goals. This outcomes report presents results for the University of Colorado responsibilities in developing stratigraphy and paleoceanography through the analyses of mineralogy (sediment provenance), grain size (sediment processes) and foraminiferal assemblages (paleoceanography and radiocarbon dating) in sediment cores collected during OD1507, augmented by analysis of 2 sediment cores collected in 2001 on Canadian cruise 2001LSSL. We got first-hand information on the sedimentary and foraminiferal characteristics of the sub ice tongue/ice shelf environment to aid study the glacial history in Petermann Fjord, and the role of ice shelves in the dynamic history of ice sheet retreat from the Hall Basin and Nares Strait during Early Holocene deglaciation.     Sub ice-tongue sediments have distinct sedimentological and foraminiferal characteristics. Imagery from sub ice tongue cores shows distinctly laminated sediments without &gt;2mm ice rafted debris (IRD).

Modern foraminiferal assemblages (from 0-2 cm) distinguish sub-ice tongue environments from those beyond the ice tongue. Under ice tongue faunas are tiny, low abundance, and dominated by agglutinated species. Faunal diversity and abundance increase beyond the ice tongue and are highest outside the fjord. Pro-ice tongue faunas are dominantly calcareous with species indicators of marine productivity and glacial-marine conditions and indicators of ?warm? ocean water advected toward the grounding line. These grain size and faunal characteristics are important for recognizing ice tongue/sub ice shelf sediments in other cores and from other geographical areas.     We applied the modern data to interpret sediment cores from two sites in the Petermann Fjord (one beneath the modern ice tongue and one near the fjord mouth at the historical ice tongue maximum extent) to study when the ice tongue formed and the paleoceanographic conditions associated with ice-tongue history and position of the grounding line.

The uppermost unit of laminated mud without IRD, radiocarbon dated to 0.5 cal ka BP, records growth of an extensive ice tongue and associated low marine productivity.     We apply the sub ice tongue facies information from the modern Petermann Fjord study to interpret the deglacial history from sediment cores in Hall Basin.  A thick, distinctly laminated clay unit with rare IRD and sparse foraminifera is widespread beneath bioturbated mud in Hall Basin. We hypothesize that the laminated clay unit was deposited beneath ice shelves extending from coalescent Humboldt and Petermann glaciers (Fig. 4).

We interpret 4-ice shelf disintegration/IRD events embedded in the laminated sediments of Hall Basin dating c.: 9.4-9.5; 9.0 (Fig. 3); 8.5 and 7.2 cal ka BP.  The 4 sediment cores we studied in detail allow mapping of the grounding line and ice shelf extent changes that lead by 8.5 cal ka BP IRD to collapse of the Kennedy Channel ice stream and opening of the connection between the Arctic Ocean and Baffin Bay.
