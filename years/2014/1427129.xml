<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project aims to significantly contribute to the existing knowledge base about factors that promote and hinder African American, Latina, Native American, and Asian American women in engineering at the undergraduate and early career levels; and to enhance the understanding of promising elements that lower barriers and diversify pathways to, and through, engineering education programs and beyond. Currently, women of color in engineering are severely underrepresented in the engineering workforce relative to their representation in the U.S. population, yet little is known about their educational or early career experiences or how these experiences contribute to their attrition from, or retention in, engineering. The project has three tracks:&lt;br/&gt;(I)        a synthesis of empirical research from the last 15 years on women of color in engineering education; &lt;br/&gt;(II)        analysis of 75 narratives (life stories) by or about women of color in engineering education and early careers; and &lt;br/&gt;(III) an interview study of 24 women of color undergraduates and early professionals in subfields in which they are most underrepresented: aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By producing a more systematic and comprehensive understanding about what helps and hurts young women of color in engineering education and early careers, findings from this project will practically guide educators and employers on how to diversify their STEM settings and thus cultivate a broader base of domestic talent. Current research suggests that diverse groups? unique backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences have potential to bring dramatically new approaches to discovery and innovation within STEM. Thus, the broader significance and importance of this project arises from how it will help to diversify engineering and thus strengthen the United States? position as a scientific world leader. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Engineering Beyond the Double Bind: Women of Color in Engineering Education and Careers&nbsp;</em>(<em>EBDB</em>) was a research study, led by Maria Ong, Ph.D. (TERC), with the objective of understanding the factors that have promoted, and hindered, African American, Latina, Native American, Asian American, and mixed race/ethnicity women in engineering at the undergraduate and early career levels. To this end, the project's major goals were to: (1) Create a synthesis of empirical research between 1999 and 2015 on women of color in engineering education and careers; (2) to analyze written narratives of women of color students and early professionals in subfields in which they are most underrepresented (aerospace, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering); and (3) to conduct an interview study of women of color higher education students and early professionals in engineering. In our analysis of literature synthesis data, we found that women of color were motivated to enter and persist in engineering for a myriad of reasons, most prominently their strong pre-college interest and academic preparation in STEM; their solid sense of self-efficacy; and their perceptions about engineering jobs providing financial security. However, across many studies, women?s social pain was a major theme, threatening their persistence in engineering. Social pain came as a result of being the ?only one? of their race and/or gender; being ignored or made invisible; experiencing stereotype threat or spotlighting; and discrimination or harassment by professors or peers. Several studies suggested that, to overcome social pain, women of color&nbsp;relied on several aspects of community cultural wealth, including aspirational capital, resistant capital, linguistic capital, familial capital, and navigational capital. They&nbsp;employed self-navigation strategies that included:&nbsp;modification of internal dialog and self-care; cultural adaptation; cultural self-affirmation; and giving back to one?s community. Key support entities that emerged in the literature included families, peers, and programs. We have further documented our synthesis methods and have written them, in manuscript form for publication, as a guide for future researchers interested in conducting academic literature syntheses. In our analysis of the oral and extant data, we found that women of color graduate students in engineering take on multiple leadership roles for a number of reasons, including the desire to serve as role models and mentors to younger generations of women and students of color, and to create counterspaces where they cultivate a sense of belonging in engineering. We have presented project findings in multiple venues, including at Harvard University, at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Society of Women Engineers Annual Meeting, and at the National Academies.
