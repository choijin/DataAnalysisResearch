<AbstractNarration>The University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, in collaboration with Duke University and Rutgers University, propose a project aimed at infusing Collaborative Learning (CL) into the new AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) courses. The curriculum framework for CSP was designed to be engaging to a broad and diverse group of students. However, curriculum alone is not enough to ensure student engagement: the most interesting and innovative curriculum can still be taught in a disengaged manner. The learning science literature on CL has shown that it increases class participation and student learning while also promoting diversity in a manner that supports the differentiated instruction needed to engage students who have mixed abilities. This project seeks to understand how the best practices of CL can be applied across the CSP curriculum framework and community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide deep professional development opportunities for CSP teachers through face to face training and to create a publicly available collection of CL strategies applied to the CSP context. The project will connect the CL strategies within a series of 36 lesson plans, a teacher workbook, a YouTube video channel with examples on using CL strategies, while also providing direct professional development during an intensive week-long workshop. The project will directly reach 180 teachers but the developed materials will be disseminated through the CS Community.</AbstractNarration>
