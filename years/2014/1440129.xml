<AbstractNarration>Diffraction gratings are a fundamental component at the heart of many astronomical instruments that measure the distribution of light at different wavelengths.  Such measurements carry tremendous diagnostic information about the chemical composition of astronomical objects, and the dynamics of their motion.  A more efficient kind of grating, called the Volume Phase Holographic (VPH) grating, has recently been under development, and offers great promise for practical applications.  Particularly compact and light-efficient optical designs are made possible if VPH gratings can be made on spherical surfaces.  The proposal for which this award was made is a pathfinding attempt to perfect the techniques for fabricating VPH gratings on spherical surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current spectrographs typically accomplish spectral dispersion on planar wavefronts, and this drives the optical design to large and hence expensive instruments.  The VPH technology promises high-quality diffraction gratings on concave or convex spherical surfaces, enabling alternative and more compact spectrograph designs such as those utilizing the well-known Offner relay.  The designs enabled by VPH gratings can have fewer as well as smaller components, and in some cases less exotic material while delivering higher efficiency.  With this award, a pathfinder concept spectrograph using commercial off-the-shelf optical components will be built with resolving power R~1000 over the wavelength range 380-790 nm, feeding a 2k detector.  This pilot project will pave the way for more advanced spectrograph designs in the future, exploiting the power of VPH gratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has substantial broader impacts in that it could enable dramatically reduced size and cost while maintaining high performance, for a wide variety of astronomical instrumentation.  Students will be involved in most aspects of the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

In conjunction with a small number of additional optics, these gratings enable aberration-corrected spectrograph designs with broad application in astronomy and beyond.  We developed a design for a high performance fiber fed spectrograph, fabricated the necessary gratings, and tested the design on the benchtop.  With this development completed, the design is ready to be built for astronomical use, and a project to do this is now underway.  The spectrograph design will be easy to replicate and will be available to the US and international community.  Copies of the spectrograph would allow small observatories at universities and other sites to build a state-of-the-art instrument at low cost.  As a spin-off to the astronomical applicatons, we used the same technology developed and evaluated in this grant to produce designs for a very lightweight aberration-corrected hyperspectral imaging system.  When mounted on a drone aircraft, this system can help monitor pollution, measure harmful algae blooms in the ocean, and evaluate the health of forests.    During the course of this project, an undergraduate student received training in the design, testing, and operation of test equipment for measuring grating efficiencies.
