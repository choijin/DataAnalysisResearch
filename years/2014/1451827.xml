<AbstractNarration>Throughout history, human civilization has long recognized the value and necessity of engaging in prosocial behavior both within and across groups.  Indeed, encouraging people to donate their time and resources to help others is a wise practice, as engaging in such prosocial behavior can have economic, social, and even mental health benefits for the receiver, giver, and society at large. When people engage in such prosocial behavior, it is mostly as a result of appeals. Thus, understanding fundamental processes that underlie people's responsiveness to appeals is crucial. The investigator proposes to examine how people's basic mental processes affect their responsiveness to different kinds of appeals. One thing that makes humans special relative to other species (and even sophisticated machines) is our ability to think or construe the world at varying levels of abstractness. This ability to adopt higher levels of thinking allows humans to grasp concepts that transcend beyond one specific situation, including concepts such as love and justice. Previous research indicates that it matters whether people construe their own behavior abstractly, that is, in ways that are schematic and capture the essence of what the behavior is about, or in terms of its concrete observable details such as how and in what circumstance they carry out the behavior. No research, however, has examined how people's construal level affects their responsiveness to different kinds of appeals or influence tactics in the prosocial domain. In addition, most previous research in the prosocial domain has focused exclusively on intentions rather than people's actual prosocial behavior. This proposal explores how people's ability to think or construe the world in more concrete versus more abstract terms affects the way people respond to solicitations for donations and volunteerism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research involves a series of six studies that employ a combination of laboratory and field designs (i.e., collaborations with real charities and nonprofits). The proposed research will systematically test key predictions about behavior by examining the impact of situational factors that are known to shift individuals' thinking to a lower (more concrete) or higher (more abstract) level, used in conjunction with different persuasive appeals. The investigator will identify the circumstances that maximize how much time and money people give to help others by examining the manner of making contributions (distributed vs. all-at-once; unrestricted vs. to targeted needs) as well as the temporal sequencing of the appeal, such as whether it is preceded by a smaller or much larger request.  This research will provide much needed clarity and insights in the domains of judgment and decision-making, social influence, prosocial behavior, and social-cognitive processing.  In addition, the findings have the potential to transform how charities and nonprofits target and persuade potential donors and volunteers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>When people engage in philanthropy,&nbsp;they do so in a variety of ways, including donating their money to charitable causes and volunteering their time to help others. And fortunately for society, philanthropy has been shown to enhance the lives of not only the beneficiaries who receive assistance, but the donors and volunteers who assist them. Indeed, philanthropy is quite common in the United States as well as other countries. Nevertheless, people mainly engage in philanthropy because someone's ask them to do so. This project examined how people's thought processes affect how they respond when someone asks them to engage in philanthropy. In one set of studies, my research team examined how thinking in more concrete or more abstract terms affects how people respond to different volunteer appeals. Charitable organizations often ask people to volunteer their time in an all-at-once manner (e.g., 4 hours on a single day) or distributed manner (e.g., 1 hour a day for 4 days). We found that people anticipate volunteering in an all-at-once (vs. distributed) manner will feel more effortful but also more moral. Further, we found that people who think in concrete terms are more interested in doing whatever activities are easier and thus are more inclined to agree to volunteer in the way that they believe will feel easier (distributed), but that people who think in more abstract terms are more interested in doing whatever activities are more valuable and thus are more inclined to agree to volunteer in the way that they believe will feel more moral (all-at-once). Our findings offer practical insights to nonprofits on the best practices they can use to solicit potential volunteers. Because so many individuals need assistance in the world, people can be overwhelmed with requests to help and ultimately stop agreeing to help others. Our findings show nonprofits that they can be strategic in when they ask people to volunteer and thus avoid bombarding potential volunteers with a lot of requests that they will likely turn down. In a second set of studies, my research team examined how thinking in more concrete or more abstract terms affects how people prefer to allocate their money when donating to a nonprofit. When individuals consider donating to a nonprofit, they sometimes have the option of restricting their funds. A restricted gift is one that can be used only for a particular purpose, in a particular geographic area, or within a particular time frame. However, in our research, we focused specifically on restricted gifts that limit spending to a particular purpose, which typically involves limiting spending to general categories of need, such as disaster relief, education, and hunger (e.g., see World Vision?s website; <a href="http://donate.worldvision.org/">http://donate.worldvision.org/</a>).&nbsp; Allowing donors to place restrictions on their gifts increases the amount they give to nonprofits. However, nonprofits generally prefer unrestricted gifts because they allow for more flexibility in meeting the needs of beneficiaries. This may explain why some nonprofits only solicit unrestricted gifts on their websites. However, some nonprofits offer people a choice and hope they choose unrestricted gifts. But, what factors prevent donors from choosing unrestricted gifts? Little research exists on this topic. By definition, engaging in more abstract, higher-level thinking decreases how vividly people mentally represent objects and events and we reasoned such decreased vividness would impair potential donors' empathy towards beneficiaries. Based on this, we hypothesized that donors who adopted an abstract (vs. concrete) mindset would be less likely to make unrestricted gifts for beneficiaries. Results from our experiments mostly supported our hypothesis. Our findings offer important insights into the relationship between donors' mental state and their donation behavior. In terms of the intellectual merit of the project funded by this grant, most research in psychology examines whether people will help other or not, but rarely do researchers examine what attracts people to different ways of helping as this project did.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/16/2020<br>      Modified by: Marlone&nbsp;Henderson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
