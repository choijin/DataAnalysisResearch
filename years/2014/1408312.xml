<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the conference "Celebration of Combinatorics 2014," which will be held at MIT from June 23 to June 27, 2014.  The conference is devoted to recent developments in combinatorics, especially in algebraic, enumerative, geometric, and topological combinatorics.   It is focused on connections between different areas of combinatorics and between combinatorics and other fields such as commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and topology.  The following list of topics shows the research emphasis of the conference: simplicial complexes, combinatorics and convex geometry, combinatorial representation theory, combinatorial aspects of Schubert calculus, combinatorics of total positivity and cluster algebras, the theory of hyperplane arrangements, combinatorial commutative algebra, the theory of symmetric functions. This conference will enable the many researchers working in the area of combinatorics to learn from each other.  It will promote further development of applications of combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is an area of mathematics concerning the study of discrete structures.   A typical question of enumerative combinatorics is "How to count (structures of some kind)?"  Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure and applied mathematics, computer science, physics, and other sciences.  In recent years, combinatorial techniques were successfully applied to a range of various problems from finding efficient algorithms to understanding fundamental physics of particles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was to organize a large conference in combinatorics at MIT in Cambridge, MA, which indeed took place on June 23-27, 2014.   An over-riding theme of the conference was to highlight the achievements of and make connections to the work of a highly distinguished member of the MIT faculty working in combinatorics, Richard Stanley.   The conference had between 250 and 300 participants.  It featured about 45 talks of a half hour apiece, as well as shorter presentations of open problems and suggested future research directions.  The participants included numerous graduate students and early career mathematicians, and also included a large number of members of underrepresented groups, particularly female participants.  Most talks were reporting upon research results of the speakers in combinatorics.  However, a few of the talks were more instructional, focusing on historical developments and on giving overviews of certain parts of combinatorics particularly touched by the work of RIchard Stanley.  For example, there were historical talks by Phil Hanlon and Curtis Greene at the start of the conference, as well as one on face numbers by Louis Billera and one on Cohen-Macaulay complexes by Anders Bjorner.    There was also ample opportunity for collaboration and brainstorming in between the talks throughout the week.  Thus, the scientific merit came from the exchange and dissemination of ideas while the broader impact primarily took the form of the training of graduate students and early career mathematiicans resulting from the conference lectures and more informal discussions.
