<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Pan-American Conference on Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis" that will take place at University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 9-20, 2015. The conference is the tenth installment in a series of triennial conferences started in 1994. Locations alternate between North and South Americas. The project will support participation of junior American researchers who will be exposed to their international peers and to the stimulating atmosphere of the conference. Educational program of the Conference is integrated with research activities. It includes a series of mini-courses, half of which will be taught by the US women mathematicians. The Conference will further foster international collaboration between mathematicians of the Americas. The conference and related mini-courses cover a wide array of subjects from some of the most important applications of differential equations as well as some of the latest mathematical analysis techniques for their study. The type of questions to be discussed is instrumental for many applications, ranging from mathematical and statistical physics, fluid dynamics to engineering macro and micromechanics, mathematical finance, collective dynamics in social sciences, as well as biological and climate sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the intellectual focus of the conference is to bring together a group of experts in different aspects of continuum and statistical models for gas dynamics and associated free boundary problems, as well as well as the associated dynamics, and stochastic noise effects, among others. Some of the leading world experts in applied partial differential equations, dynamical systems, financial mathematics, analysis and geometric analysis will serve as plenary speakers or mini-course lecturers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site http://mate.dm.uba.ar/~xamericas/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   REPORT ON THE X AMERICAS CONFERENCE ON DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND NONLINEAR ANALYSIS   The X Americas Conference on Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis took place at the University of Buenos Aires, February 9 to 20 2015.   From February 9 to 13 the activities consisted of the School "New trends and applications of differential equations and dynamical systems". There were 5 courses on different applications ranging from physical to social sciences. The titles and professors were:     Irene Fonseca, Carnegie Mellon University, USA: &Gamma;-Convergence and Applications to Phase Transitions     Irene Gamba, University of Texas at Austin, USA: Analytical and computational issues to collisional kinetic transport in particle interacting systems     Konstantin Mischaikow, Rutgers University, USA: Computational Topology and Dynamics.     Jorge Sotomayor, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil: Differential Equations for Principal   Curvature Structures on Hyper-surfaces of Euclidean Spaces     Juan Pablo Pinasco, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina: Modeling the dynamics of opinion formation   There were 20 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the USA that were funded by the Argentine National Agency for Science and Technology (ANPCYT), the CDC, the ICTP and the NSF. Also, many participants from Argentina and other neighbouring countries could attend by using their own funds.   We are attaching the list of the 49 participants.   Then, from February 16 to 20 the international conference took place. There were 18 plenary lectures by top researchers from almost every country in the american continent, including 5 female lecturers. These talks took place in the mornings. This is the list of plenary speakers.     Nils Ackermann, Universidad Nacional Auto?noma de Me?xico, Me?xico     Rafael Benguria, Pontificia Universidad Cato?lica, Chile     Luis Caffarelli, University of Texas at Austin, USA     Sue Ann Campbell, University of Waterloo, Canada     Jorge Cossio, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Colombia     Panagiota Daskalopoulos, Columbia University, USA     Julia?n Ferna?ndez Bonder, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina     Felipe Linares, Instituto de Matema?tica Pura e Aplicada, Brazil               James Muldowney, University of Alberta, Canada     Mo?nica Musso, Universidad de Chile, Chile     Maria Jose Pacifico, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil     Julio Rossi, Universidad de Alicante, Spain and Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina     Gigliola Staffilani, Massachussets Institute of Technology, USA     Robert Strain, University of Pennsylvania, USA     Juan Luis Vazquez, Universidad Auto?noma de Madrid, Spain     Thomas Wanner, George Mason University, USA     Jianhong Wu, York University, Canada     Yingfei Yi, University of Alberta, Canada   In the afternoons there were 6 focus sessions with invited speakers that amounted to 30 lectures. There were also 46 contributed talks as well as 19 short oral communications. On Wednesday 18 a poster session with 29 posters took place.   We are attaching the book of abstracts as well as the final program.   There were 179 participants at the conference. This one being the largest conference in the Americas Series up to now. Approximately 150 of them participated with either a course, a lecture or a poster.   We are attaching the final list of participants sorted by country.   Most of the School professor, plenary and invited speakers agreed to having their slides posted at the conference web site http://mate.dm.uba.ar/~xamericas. In this way we will be able to reach even more people that, altough interested in the conference subjects, were not able to participate.   The Organization received funds from CDC-IMU, ICTP, NSF and ANPCYT (Argentina) that were solely used to cover some travel and living expenses of young participants that attended both the School and the Conference, as well as the expenses of some of the School professors.   Living expenses ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
