<AbstractNarration>SES- 1409581&lt;br/&gt;Rory McVeigh&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Escher&lt;br/&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines why some efforts to create social change fail while others succeed. The study builds on classical theories of collective action by focusing on the interactions between activists, organizations, and community members in central Appalachia, home to a contentious mining practice called mountaintop mining. Some organizations succeed in gaining the support and participation of community members while others tend to fail.  The investigators hypothesize that the reason for this is their ability to match culturally in certain key ways. In other words, successful cultural matching is an important process enabling activists to convert the structural potential for change into residents' actual mobilization.  The co-PI will examine this process through 65 interviews with randomly and purposively selected residents and activists, examining various moral commitments, symbolic boundaries, and personal and collective memories.  The investigator will also observe interactions between these two groups over the course of three months of fieldwork. This study will contribute to scholarly understanding of why social movements sometimes fail (or never even begin) by showing a key yet overlooked component of collective action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two broader impacts. First, this project is useful for practitioners who work for social change among marginalized populations and the scholars who study them. It demonstrates that factors like grievances, organizational resources, and appropriate framing are not enough to fuel a movement; building trust with local residents is a key initial component of organizing for community change. This project highlights what effective organizations accomplish and also reveals some of the salient values and priorities of residents that are likely to be similar across the globe, particularly in rural areas with limited economic diversification. I will distribute my findings to the environmental organizations I examine and present and publish them widely. Second, this project brings to the fore an underrepresented group, bringing to light their attempts to live out their commitments amid severe structural disadvantages. Results from this study will enable community groups to better understand the people they serve.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In obvious environmental crises, to put it bluntly, why don't affected people do something about it? This project studies the fight over mountaintop removal coal mining in central Appalachia in the United States. The process devastates the physical environment and creates difficult living conditions for those nearby. Affected residents have filed tens of thousands of complaints about blasting, water contamination, and destruction of their property. Three dozen social movement organizations working to end the practice describe it as the front lines in the battle against climate change.  With this level of discontent and attention, what is puzzling is the uneven success social movement organizations have in mobilizing local residents. In some cases, organizations bring together dozens or even hundreds of residents to speak at public meetings or campaign to protect a mountain. In other cases, the very residents most affected criticize these organizations and isolate them socially.  This project develops a framework to explain why efforts to fight mountaintop mining sometimes succeed&mdash;and sometimes fail. Explanations based on the power of industry and economic dependence by themselves cannot account for this range of outcomes. Nor can explanations based on a lack of organizational resources or favorable political conditions.  At the heart of the matter is a pervasive collective-action problem: the difficulty of overcoming cultural mismatches. Cultural mismatches describe major differences in culture between two people or groups; these include mismatches in values and norms, in skills and know-how, and in meaningful information about the world. For example, activist organizations seek to create campaigns that engender local support for their cause, if not local residentsÆ actual participation in them. Yet despite their efforts, and often because of them, they fail. Members of the coal industry exploit these missteps to their advantage even as they themselves also seek to overcome cultural mismatches with local residents. Yet certain activist groups navigate around mismatches. They convince local residents of their trustworthiness, and their successes together are remarkable.  This project provides insight into how and when we can expect one outcome or the other. Six months of full-time ethnographic research reveal three organizational strategies to manage mismatch that lead to rebellion or quiescence among local residents.  Certain activist groups simply disregard mismatches. They recruit participants who share similar beliefs of how social change occurs in a process ofcultural matching. These groups attract attention and external participants, but they do little to gain the support of a local population.  As economic dependence on coal mining declines, the coal industry also seeks to maintain its power by dissolving mismatches through cultural deception.

This project makes several important contributions. Foremost, it reveals what a democracy requires to function well.
