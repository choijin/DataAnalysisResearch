<AbstractNarration>Offering a diverse product assortment brings numerous benefits to a firm, such as larger market share, increased customer satisfaction and more repeat purchases.  However, determining the right assortment variety is difficult because products within the assortment maybe complementary or substitutes.  Thus, the demand of each product depends on the availability of all other products in the assortment, complicating inventory planning and pricing decisions.  A diverse product assortment also means that the demand is dispersed among a larger number of products, which may result in increased safety stocks and other additional operational expenses.   Given these complex tradeoffs, how should a firm deal with the operational consequences of product variety and customer choice behavior?   The goal of this project is to develop models and algorithms that allow decision-makers to offer the right assortment of products, stock the right amount of inventory, charge the right prices and sell to the right customer, while taking the customer choice behavior into consideration as they make these decisions.  By studying the state-of-the-art choice models to capture customer choice behavior and by incorporating these choice models into critical operations management problems, the project offers an integrative framework to address assortment planning, inventory management, pricing and product personalization decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project covers various problems that apply to numerous industries, with focus on assortment planning, inventory management, pricing, and product personalization decisions. (a) One focus of the project is assortment decisions when inventories are not a limiting concern, which is appropriate when selling products that do not require consumption of physical inventories. The project will develop exact and approximate algorithms to find the right assortment of products to offer under various choice models. (b) Offered assortment determines the demands for the different products, indicating that assortment decisions interact with stocking decisions. The project will study models that make joint assortment offer and stocking decisions, as well as models that make assortment offer decisions under fixed inventory availability. Standard formulations of these models require a separate decision variable for each possible assortment, which can get too many. The goal is to develop compact formulations under different choice models and investigate the structural properties of the optimal assortment. (c) The project covers pricing decisions when customers choose among the offered products. The project will investigate such pricing problems under a variety of choice models and incorporate various constraints on the prices. (d) Developments in availability of real-time data on customers allow personalizing the assortment offering to each customer. The challenge is to quickly assess the choice behavior of each customer and compute the optimal assortment to offer in real time based on choice behavior and inventory availability. The project will study assortment personalization models with performance guarantees and investigate how to incorporate customer forecasts. (e) An important step in building models under customer choice is the estimation of the choice model that drives the choice behavior. The project will investigate how to estimate choice models from sales data. When data is limited, there is a tradeoff between increasing the predictive accuracy by using complex models and over-fitting complex choice models to limited data. An important goal is to derive robust criteria to balance the tradeoffs.</AbstractNarration>

We want to develop an integrative framework to address these questions, combining state of the art choice modeling techniques with important optimization models in operations management.     Intellectual Merits:   During the lifetime of the award, we have investigated a number of assortment and price optimization problems under different choice models.  We will briefly describe each problem and discuss our contributions.     In our work on non-parametric model of joint assortment and pricing,  we propose a nonparametric framework in which each customer is represented by a particular price threshold and a particular preference list over the alternatives. The customers follow a two-stage choice process; they consider the set of products with prices less than the threshold and choose the most preferred product from the set considered.

We also identify classes of pricing structures of increasing complexity, which determine the computational complexity of the estimation and decision problems. Our pricing structures are naturally expressed as business constraints, allowing a manager to trade off pricing flexibility with computational burden.     In our work on the limit of rationality in choice modeling, we note that customer preferences may not be rational,  and therefore we focus on quantifying the limit of rationality (LoR) in choice modeling applications. We define LoR as the "cost" of approximating the observed choice fractions from a collection of offer sets with those from the best fitting probability distribution over rankings. Computing LoR is intractable in the worst case.  However, we have identified classes of problems where LoR can be computed efficiently, and developed computational methods to determine LoR in the general setting.     Finally, we consider unconstrained and constrained multi-product pricing problems when customers choose according to an arbitrary generalized extreme value model and the products have the same price sensitivity parameter.  The goal is to choose the prices for the products to maximize the expected profit obtained from each customer.  In the unconstrained problem, we show that the optimal prices of the different products have a constant markup over their unit costs. We provide an explicit formula for the optimal markup in terms of the Lambert-W function. In the constrained problem, motivated by the applications with inventory considerations, the expected sales of the products are constrained to lie in a convex set.

Broader Impacts:  During the lifetime of the award, the findings of the research projects have been used to supplement the existing courses on operations management, supply chains, and revenue management.  The results of the award have been published in academic journals, and datasets resulting from this award have been made available to the broader research community.
