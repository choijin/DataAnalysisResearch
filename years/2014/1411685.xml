<AbstractNarration>Our understanding of how the universe around us changes with time is limited by our ability to measure ages of stars.  Unlike other fundamental properties, this is not something that we are able to measure directly.  We have some limited idea, at least in a statistical sense, for some stars - particularly those all formed together in "clusters".  We have also developed sophisticated computer models that predict how other observed properties change in time, which we can compare to observations of real stars.  Stars spin rapidly when they are formed, but their spin slows with time.   A lot of effort is going into developing a better understanding of how this happens.  The goal of "gyrochronology" is to be able to infer the age of a star by measuring how fast it spins, with careful consideration of its other measureable properties (not all stars with the same spin rate have the same age).  This project will attempt to resolve many of the uncertainties through a careful comparison of theoretical models describing how stars spin down, measurements of long-period rotators (tens of days) using the unprecedented database from the Kepler spacecraft, and follow-up observations from ground-based observatories.  The proposed activities will directly contribute to the training of a graduate student in observational and theoretical astrophysics, as well as advanced statistical analysis.  It will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students.  The PI will also lead efforts to use the new Planetarium at Ohio State as a laboratory for data visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CoPIs, along with a graduate student and two collaborators who are experts using the Kepler database, will conduct a careful observational and theoretical study with the goal of producing a well-calibrated rotation-age relation for field stars.  This will be based on a more careful analysis of the properties of cluster stars, measurements of longer periods using Kepler data with follow-up observations at the MDM observatory at Kitt Peak, and detailed models of angular momentum loss in stars.  It will benefit from the team's expertise in asteroseismology and statistics.  Gyrochronology is being applied to a vast array of astrophysical problems, from planetary to extragalactic, yet there are serious complications involved in establishing a single-valued function between rotation rate and age.  This team has identified all of the complications and laid out a plan that could lead to a well-constrained and widely-applicable gyrochronology law for field stars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For nearly 50 years, astronomers have known that stars rotate quickly when they are young but spin much more slowly as they age.  For example, our Sun rotates with a period of about 25 days but similar stars in young star clusters can have spin periods between 0.5 and 5 days.  This has led to the idea that a star's rotation period could be used to determine its age, a method called gyrochronology.  The mechanism for the spindown is known: magnetized stellar winds carry away the spin of the star, gradually slowing the rotation rate.    Many of the details of this process, especially how the rate of spindown depends on stellar mass or evolutionary state, are only partially understood and are the subject of this project.  This project obtained new measures of rotation rates in single and binary stars, and analyzed these with stellar evolution models that are designed to correctly account the effects of rotation.  Principal findings include:  evidence that rotation rates do not continue to decrease indefinitely, but instead stall out at old ages.  This indicates that stars may lose their magnetic fields or their stellar winds as they get old. the discovery that many apparently rapid rotators are binary stars, likely close binaries where the stars spin and orbit at the same rate because of gravitational tides. detailed evaluation of the importance of missing data in observations of stellar rotation.  Many stars, even at relatively young ages, do not possess star spots and so are "invisible" to surveys that determine rotation by detecting periodic brightness variation as the spinning stars carry spots around the star.   All of these factors mean that gyrochronology does not give precise stellar ages.  For example, knowing that the Sun rotates in 25 days means we only know that the Sun is older than about 4 billion years.  These ages might be useful in large statistical samples, but not as a way of age dating individual stars.  This project provided research opportunities, especially in analysis, statistical methods, and data visualization for undergraduate students at Ohio State university.  Many of the data products from this project were incorporated into new data-intensive astrophysics courses for 1st- and 3rd year students.
