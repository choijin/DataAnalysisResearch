<AbstractNarration>Understanding and predicting interactions between aboveground and belowground ecohydrologic processes is challenging. Roots play an important role in linking aboveground plant ecophysiological processes, such as carbon, water, and energy exchange with the atmosphere, and the belowground processes associated with soil moisture and carbon, and microbial and nutrient dynamics. Interestingly, root water movement is not always unidirectional; plants create pathways for preferential water movement through a phenomenon called "hydraulic redistribution", by which water moves downward through the roots during wet periods but upward during drier periods. This project will study such hydraulic redistribution. The study will both provide insights for dryland regions and enable broader generalizations regarding the interaction between groundwater, roots, and aboveground assemblages and their role in whole-ecosystem performance. The salient aspect of this study is the coupling between field research and modeling to enable hypotheses testing and provide an upscaling framework from site-based studies. Given projections of a warmer climate, there has been a rapid expansion in scientific interest in how ecosystems will respond to periods of prolonged stress. This research will help address this critical issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objective of the project is to systematically examine the role of hydraulic redistribution by roots as a mechanism for facilitating aboveground-belowground linkages that drive water and carbon dynamics, and the development of emergent spatial patterns of soil moisture and vegetation distribution. Field-based activities will be conducted at two sites in southern Arizona: a riparian site where precipitation inputs are augmented with belowground water sources and an upland site that lacks this secondary water pool. This research will advance the theory for understanding the interaction of aboveground and belowground ecohydrological processes using a model that mechanistically resolves the related processes. Coupled modeling and field experimentation and monitoring of root and stem sap flux, soil, carbon, whole-plant, and ecosystem-scale (via eddy covariance tower) water and carbon fluxes will mutually inform each other to provide detailed insights at a range of scales. Results from this study will be presented in kiosks on the tour route of Biosphere 2 that sees over 100,000 visitors per year that include K-12 students to retirees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the last century, many regions around the world have seen a transition in the vegetation that make up the ecosystem from one dominated by grasses to one co-dominated or dominated by woody plants. This transition has the potential to completely change the functioning of that ecosystem because several of these woody plants actively move water around through a process called hydraulic redistribution. Hydraulic redistribution occurs when roots serve as preferential pathways for water movement from wet to dry soil layers. During wet periods when the deeper soil layers are drier than surface soils, water moves through the roots downward.  Conversely, when the surface soils become drier, this gradient draws water from deeper soils through the roots out into the surface soils.  This incredible process makes developing our understanding of water and carbon dynamics in drylands extremely difficult!  In this Collaborative Research we combined field measurements and numerical modeling to take a systematic look at the role of hydraulic redistribution by roots as a mechanism for creating either a competitive (negative) or facilitative (positive) interaction between overstory and understory plants. If the overstory woody plants are sharing the water with the understory grasses, they could actually support greater abundances of grasses important for forage and habitat for local wildlife.  However, if they use this process of hydraulic redistribution to ?hide? the water from the understory, they could be negatively impacting the functioning of these native grasses.  Our work led to breakthrough understandings of the degree of hydraulic redistribution being conducted by woody plants in both upland and riparian savannas, the impacts of all of that water movement on the functioning of the understory, and the ability of the overstory trees to use the water they stored in deep soil layers to sustain their function in years of oppressive drought. More than 5 graduate students, 2 postdocs, and 25 undergraduate and high school students gained mentoring and training on cutting edge ecohydrological techniques and in describing their science to peers.
