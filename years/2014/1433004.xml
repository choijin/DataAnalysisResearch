<AbstractNarration>Tuskegee University, Auburn University and Alabama State University will collaborate to create the Tuskegee Alliance to Forge Pathways to Academic Careers (T-PAC).  This project was created in response to the NSF?s Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 14-505) for the AGEP-Transformation (AGEP-T) track.  The AGEP-T track targets strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study innovative evidence-based models and standards for STEM graduate education, postdoctoral training, and academic STEM career preparation that eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive practices for URMs.  The T-PAC project will develop, implement, study, and evaluate a model of STEM graduate education focusing on underrepresented minorities (URMs) who are U.S. citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed AGEP-T project will be unique and will have potential to contribute to foundational knowledge about how two Historically Black Universities that focus on baccalaureate degree production will collaborate with a research university to develop, implement and study a model of graduate education and comprehensive professional development for URM graduate students in STEM.  The project will also emphasize on-line instruction and professional development.   The lessons learned as this project progresses, and the ultimate results from the work, will provide information that will be beneficial to educators, administrators and policymakers, as well as the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Instituted in September 2014, the "Tuskegee Alliance to Develop, Implement and Study a Virtual Graduate Education Model for Underrepresented Minorities in STEM" is a collaborative effort across three doctoral granting institutions that include two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) [Tuskegee University, Alabama State University]; and a Predominantly White Institution [Auburn University] in the state of Alabama. Through generous funding from the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) Program, the Alliance has provided a community of 29 doctoral students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM (Black/African Americans, Latinos/as, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders) with mentored academic, social and professional support through an evidence-based model to persist in their doctoral studies. Also known as the "Tuskegee Alliance to Forge Pathways to Academic Careers (T-PAC)", the Alliance has further engaged its students in activities designed to promote interest in completing postdoctoral training and pursuing careers as faculty members in Colleges and Universities (also known as the Professoriate), as opposed to joining positions in the industry or government. The Alliance’s rationale to promote careers in the Professoriate is motivated by the drastic lack of diversity that exists in this sector.  The novelty of the T-PAC model lies in the establishment of both virtual and traditional (face 2 face) communities of historically underrepresented STEM doctoral students in their preparation process and engaging them in structured and intentional professional development activities that enhanced professional identity and fostered a sense of belonging in the STEM community. T-PAC faculty provide academic support to T-PAC doctoral students through virtual strategies that are designed to gradually develop their scientific research skills, including gaining efficacy in the writing of technical documents of all kinds. In this connection, the Alliance has produced key products in the form of two semester-long virtually offered graduate level courses designed to provide deep experiences to doctoral students in the organization of research projects, including literature searching techniques, technical writing and the development of proposals. The Alliance institutions have recognized the importance of the two courses as critical skills-building opportunities for all STEM graduate students and has committed to their sustainment beyond the end of the project. Further, the T-PAC Alliance has developed a series of YouTube videos of key topics that are covered in the two virtual courses which have been shared with other AGEP Alliances in the country to impact even a larger number of historically underrepresented STEM doctoral students. Additionally, T-PAC has offered Webinars on the development of research projects by graduate students as another virtual strategy to reach the broader community of historically underrepresented graduate students in STEM.  A commitment of the T-PAC Alliance was to prepare doctoral students who will not only be productive researchers, but also effective teachers. To gain this teaching readiness, the Alliance offered its doctoral students with nurtured experiences by teaching STEM courses at all levels as the instructors of record while being mentored by T-PAC and other faculty members. With the intent to produce well-rounded future faculty members, T-PAC also offered its students Professional Development to promote their pedagogical readiness including strategies for fostering effective classroom management, addressing needs of diverse learners, assessing learning outcomes through a combination of different techniques and integrating research into teaching.  Jointly with the academic support provided by T-PAC, doctoral students received equally important social support in their programs through Professional Development sessions on work life integration strategies, including resources to assist them in dealing with the rigors of graduate school such as the management of stress and promoting healthy minds. In addition, T-PAC provided professional support to its doctoral students through networking opportunities with peers in their disciplines such as their participation in the Annual Institute on Teaching and Mentoring, sponsored by the Southern Region Education Board (SREB), opportunities to disseminate their research at professional meetings and performing rotations in laboratories of the institutions in the Alliance (access to equipment and procedures).  Project findings suggest that through the combination of academic, social and professional support provided by T-PAC interventions, T-PAC doctoral students are better prepared, having gained skills-sets in many areas of teaching and research (e.g. pedagogy, literature searching, technical writing, proposal development) and in their ability to mitigate the personal challenges that are often experienced by graduate students and early career faculty (e.g. stress, study-work-life balance).
