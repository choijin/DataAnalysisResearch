<AbstractNarration>This research will consist of experiments, theory, and simulation on a broad range of fundamental processes in plasmas, and will emphasize problems for which precise experimental tests of theory can be obtained.  The experiments will be performed on two well-instrumented non-neutral plasma apparatuses: a laser-diagnosed ion apparatus which can "tag" ions and follow their subsequent motion; and a camera-diagnosed electron apparatus.  Theory work will focus on long-range collisions between particles, where a newly-discovered "collisional caging" effect gives enhanced particle slowing-down rates and enhanced cross-field transport.  Characterization of collisions in correlated plasmas will also continue, especially in regard to the "dynamical screening" controversy in stellar fusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program makes strong interdisciplinary connections across fields of physics, contributing to and drawing from atomic physics, statistical physics, fluid physics and plasma physics.  For example, the electron experiments and theory have provided insight into vortices in large-scale atmospheric flows, and recent results on "chaotic" particle transport relate directly to fusion plasmas in toroidal geometry.  The "rotating wall" technique for infinite-time containment was developed at UCSD, and is now used widely, especially for expensive particles such as anti-matter.  Moreover, the strong, iterative interaction between theory and experiment provides an exceptionally rich environment for training undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research program developed fundamental physics understandings of plasma fluids contained in magnetic fields, by direct comparison of theory and experiments.  The experiments utilize non-neutral plasmas consisting of a single sign of charge (either electrons or ions), confined for long times in simple cylindrical traps, with quantitative diagnostics.  The ion plasmas can be diagnosed and cooled with sophisticated laser techniques [IV Laser Table], determining local density, velocity, and temperature; moreover, individual ions can be "tagged" and followed for many seconds.  The electron plasmas are quantitatively diagnosed by a CCD camera [Flux-driven Vortex Symmetrization], and by detailed reception of wave signals.  The research focused on "long-range" interactions between charged particles in quiescent plasmas, generally without the complications of turbulence.  Short-range interactions (such as two-particle collisions) are well understood, causing particle diffusion, heat flow, and viscosity in many plasma and fluid regimes.  However, long-range interactions are dominant in some regimes, and the theory paradigm is still under development.  In our experiments, we have measured transport rates much greater than predicted for short-range collisions: particle diffusion enhanced by a factor of 10, heat flow enhanced by 100, and shear viscosity enhanced by 100,000.  Theory is now is excellent-to-fair quantitative agreement with the data, with viscosity being the least well understood.  A new theory of collisional slowing of individual particles is now being tested by experiments; here, a surprising "velocity caging" effect leads to multiple correlated two-particle collisions, producing enhanced slowing.  Laser-cooling of the magnetized ion plasmas increases the strength of long-range interactions relative to short-range interactions, modifying the inter-particle collisionality and consequent diffusion, heat flow, and viscosity.  At cryogenic temperatures, fully 3-dimensional correlated plasma equilibria in the liquid and crystal regimes are predicted and observed.  Recently, our experiments provided the first verification of the (Salpeter predicted) enhanced fusion in correlated plasmas, such as occurs deep inside the sun [Solar Photosphere] and in supernova progenitors; this was funded primarily by DOE.   However, quantitative understandings of transport and relaxation towards the correlated equilibrum are still being developed.  In some parameter regimes, the electron plasmas behave as low-viscosity 2-dimensional fluids; that is, the electrons flow across the axial magnetic field in the same patterns as water would flow in a circular tank.  Here, fluid motions are organized into vortices, arising from long-range interactions.  Our prior experiments and theory characterized the inviscid relaxation of turbulent initial conditions to unanticipated "vortex crystal" states [Vortex Crystal Formation].  We also observed and characterized the wave-resonant damping of vortex ellipticity, even in the absence of fluid viscosity.  Most recently, experiments and theory have focused on the unanticipated damping of vortex ellipticity due to a weak outward flux of particles, as illustrated in the data image [Flux-driven Vortex Symmetrization].  This research environment of combined theory and experiment is ideal for student training; and three students (from remarkably diverse backgrounds) completed their Ph.D. research during the prior grant.  The research program has proved to be unusually interdisciplinary, contributing to and borrowing from atomic physics, condensed matter physics, and fluid dynamics.  As example, the "Rotating Wall" technique for infinite-time containment of charged particles is now used in dozens of labs worldwide, with applications to fundamental constants, quantum computing, anti-matter production, and accelerator sources, as well as research on plasma transport effects.
