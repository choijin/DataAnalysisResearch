<AbstractNarration>This project is examining the influence of career life balance on communities of color by supporting the participation of women researchers and advanced graduate students from underserved populations in an international experience in Latin American and a subsequent webinar series with international speakers to discuss the accompanying challenges and potential solutions for maintaining levels of career life balance. These activities will be accompanied by online discussions and wide dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Women researchers will be attending the July 2014 conference for the Latin and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions (LACCEI) in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The graduate students will be mentored by women who have a long-standing track record for mentoring graduate students from underrepresented groups. The participants will have opportunities to meet researchers from other underrepresented communities in Latin America. This conference will have sessions that will discuss career choices, life/work balance, and the impact of family and traditions on advancement decisions. In addition, the conference will provide opportunities to develop new collaborations with women in the STEM fields from the U.S. and different Latin American countries (e.g., Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina and Panama). Following the conference, a webinar series with blogged discussions will discuss career life balance based on research and experiences from experts who were invited to participate in the Gender Summit 3 North America in November 2013 which was co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and sister scientific organizations in Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Representatives from each of these countries will participate in the webinar series and blog discussions. The blog will include both online discussions via a website, and microblogging using Twitter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The webinar series will feature topics such as balancing work and family, how family decisions affect career advancement, and subconscious "imposterism" in the company of males at work and at home. Further, it will highlight the policies and best practices that are working for women in other countries such as equal pay for faculty at UNAM in Mexico, and findings from Europe?s genSET project. The webinars will also include co-host/discussants from the LSAMP community, who will bring their perspectives as mentors of next generation of underrepresented minority STEM researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall the project will contribute to understanding family commitments, family influence, and family challenges on the career decisions of researchers of color. We will examine child-care, eldercare, cultural contexts and perceptions of underrepresented minorities abroad, and the influence of male-dominated societies on current participants.   Furthermore, the project will facilitate development of international collaborative relationships for students and faculty, an activity important to professional development and promotion.  It will develop a structure that can enhance the international mobility of a generation of future STEM research communities of color, to increase their global influence and competitiveness. The online series will engage researchers to discuss ways to increase global engagement, and corresponding issues that affect career life balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the International Science and Engineering Section, the Career Life Balance Initiative and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers Broadening Participation in Engineering Program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>The "International Engagement and Broadening Participation in STEM from a Family-Friendly Perspective for Women of Color" had several parts that included travel to an international conference, discussions on career-life balance, discussions about access to international opportunities, hindrances to international collaboration, and how issues of work-life balance can affect STEM female professors academic advancement to ranks of associate and full professor. This project was centered around the premise that data from the Institute of International Education (e.g, IIE's "Open Doors" reports) showed that students from STEM fields participated in international education opportunities through study abroad at low rates compared to students in other fields, and further, students from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds participated in extremely low numbers compared to 76% of White students. Further, as STEM female colleagues of color who are faculty were achieving tenure, many were remaining stagnant at the Associate Professor level because they had not developed the requisite global, technical reputation. In short, they had not developed international networks, they did not have colleagues at universities outside of the U.S., they had not participated in international conferences in their field, and sadly, very few had traveled internationally which hindered their progress. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span>To combat this trend, we wanted to start a movement for involving groups of STEM faculty and students of color in international engineering conferences so that they could develop comfort levels with travel, improve intercultural communication and competencies, increase their networks, develop collaborations, and share technical expertise as an international scholar.&nbsp;</span>We took a delegation of URM graduate students, mentors (URM faculty members) and staff to conferences that were sponsored by the Latin and Caribbean Consortium for Engineering Institutions (LACCEI). Participants in this project participated in the 2014 LACCEI Conference in Guayaquil, Ecuador; the 2015 LACCEI Conference in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and the 2016 LACCEI Conference in San Jose, Costa Rica. Results were disseminated at the 2015 World Engineering Education Conference (WEEF) in Italy, the 2015 Global Deans Engineering Council (GEDC) conference in Adelaide, Australia, and the 2016 WEEF Conference in Seoul, South Korea.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Participants were part of several groups within these conferences. In Guayaquil, the group visited the top engineering university in the country,&nbsp;Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral (ESPOL), where they were panelists and mentors to undergraduate engineering students from Ecuador and other countries in South America. The students also participated in meetings for the Student Platform for Engineering Education Development (SPEED) where they learned about issues connected to Humanitarian Engineering. The faculty participated in technical talks and had opportunities to develop networks among colleagues who attended the conference from a variety of countries across several continents. The students and the faculty in our group had daily meetings to discuss what they were learning, how to enhance the experience, how to develop similar experiences for others, and how to overcome barriers to international related to career-life balance and lack of experience, e.g., arrangement of childcare, fear of inability to speak the native language of the country despite having English as the language of the conference. The women faculty of color who participated in the excursion had participated various NSF ADVANCE programs for women faculty, but they had not had buidling international collaborations as a focal point. As a result of their participation in 2014, the women faculty were empowered and earned funding (unrelated to this project) set up their own excursions for their colleagues and students. One professor took two of her students to an international conference in Portugal, where those young ladies won an award for their STEM project. Another professor took a student and a colleague to the LACCEI conference in the Dominican Republic where she had set up meetings in advance with a local college to begin an international collaboration.</p> <p>The LACCEI conference in Costa Rica &nbsp;in 2016 allowed students from Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) and LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate programs who were about to start graduate school to start their journey toward international collaboration early. These students participated in the SPEED activities and had opportunities to learn more about both engineering and challenges for women in STEM through a forum that was sponsored through this project.
