<AbstractNarration>The iSTART program aims to increase the retention and graduation rates of engineering and computer science (CS) students at the University of California Irvine (UCI) as well as transfer of students from three local community colleges (Irvine Valley College, Saddleback College, and Santa Ana College).  The implementation of evidence-based strategies to address the needs of engineering and computer science students at UCI and partner community colleges will increase the number and diversity of well-prepared graduates who enter the engineering and computer science workforce.  Specifically, the iSTART program will establish a formal First Year Experience Program at UCI, improve the articulation and transfer process between community colleges and UCI, and establish specific innovation-based retention initiatives to provide a system of support and engagement for students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iSTART program will leverage existing infrastructure, activities, and partnerships, as well as integrate a coordinated set of evidence-based practices and interventions to support students' learning and engagement and transfer from community colleges.  For UCI lower-division students, a new Introduction to Engineering sequence will engage freshmen in design projects with themes around Global Grand Challenges.  Similarly, a hands-on and collaborative CS: Principles course will be developed and implemented to provide an entryway to students interested in pursuing information and computer science.  To address challenges lower-division students encounter in mathematics courses, a new Analytical Formulation of Engineering seminar that incorporates collaborative and active learning will be developed for engineering students, which is modeled after the successful revisions to mathematics courses in the computer science curriculum.  Moreover, multiple evidence-based interventions for students at the partner community colleges will be implemented through the recently established Corridor to Academic Success in Engineering and Computer Science (CASECS) program.  These include cross-enrollment opportunities, articulating courses to improve the transfer process as well as modify engineering and computer science courses at the partner community colleges to integrate hands-on and applied learning activities, recruiting and building cohorts at the partner community colleges who will have access to co-advising, peer mentoring, and supplemental tutoring, and a summer bridge program for transfer students.  Finally, the integration of a design and prototyping space for industry-driven student design projects will provide students co-curricular experiential learning opportunities to develop and support students' innovation and creativity skills.  An evaluation plan that includes formative and summative evaluation will inform improvements during the project period as well as measure the outcomes of the project through surveys and student tracking.  Knowledge gained from the evaluation will help provide a modular model for improving student retention that can be adapted at other institutions with similar needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Starting in the fall of 2014, the University of California Irvine’s School of Engineering, School of Information and Computer Sciences, and Department of Mathematics received a four-year Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) award from the National Science Foundation (Award # 1432701) to increase the number and diversity of STEM students, prepare students to participate in science for tomorrow, and improve students’ STEM learning outcomes. The project was implemented between 2014 thru 2019 receiving one no-cost extension.  The project was innovative in that in engaged community colleges in an effective and unique way towards achieving project goals.  The community colleges involved were Cypress College, Irvine Valley College, Saddleback College and Santa Ana College.    Project goals  Goal 1: Increase the number of students, especially those from underrepresented groups, receiving baccalaureate degrees in engineering and computer science.  Goal 2: Identify specific implementation strategies that lead to higher retention and graduation rates.   Goal 3: Institutionalize effective strategies to maintain increased retention and graduation. Goal 4: Disseminate effective project strategies and results to the broader community.  Highlights  Evaluation results show that this IUSE project is achieving its stated goals. Enrollment in engineering and information and computer science at UCI rose 23% from the baseline year to 2018- 19, with the percentage of underrepresented minority transfer students rising 21% and the percentage of female transfer students rising 27% over the same period. Freshman two-year and three-year retention rates increased by 7% and 17% respectively between 2013 and 2015. Four-year freshman graduation rates increased by 8% from 2012 to 2014. (Goal 1: Number of students in engineering and computer science). Respondents rated the collaborative learning and project- based learning implementation strategies as the most useful for promoting retention and graduation (Goal 2: Implementation strategies). Project leaders indicated that six of 12 IUSE activities would continue after the project ends, with more than 15 courses articulated. One of our partners, IVC now has more courses for transfer than any other community college in California. (Goal 3: Institutionalize effective strategies). Project staff have given workshop, conference and non-archived presentations in more than 50 venues over the reporting period.  Results from this work have been accepted in some of the leading journals in the field (Goal 4: Dissemination).
