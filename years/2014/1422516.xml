<AbstractNarration>Current processors employ aggressive prediction mechanisms to improve  &lt;br/&gt;performance and reduce power. To design effective optimizations, it is  &lt;br/&gt;increasingly important to understand and quantify a program's dynamic  &lt;br/&gt;behavior. However, today, most of these optimizations rely on  &lt;br/&gt;heuristics and are fairly ad-hoc. After some patterns are observed, a  &lt;br/&gt;hardware decision is made and the design space of the hardware  &lt;br/&gt;optimization is explored through simulation to determine the best  &lt;br/&gt;performing configuration. However, because the design is targeted for  &lt;br/&gt;observed and/or anticipated patterns, some dynamic behavior is not  &lt;br/&gt;captured and remains undetected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a framework for quantitatively analyzing a  &lt;br/&gt;program's behavior in terms of regularities and patterns to provide  &lt;br/&gt;insights into the design of next-generation hardware prediction  &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms. Inspired by DNA discovery tools, the research adopts  &lt;br/&gt;algorithms used in string processing, compression and bioinformatics,  &lt;br/&gt;in order to summarize applications' dynamic data reference and branch  &lt;br/&gt;outcome behaviors. The findings from the methods and tools developed  &lt;br/&gt;in this project will have a big impact on the design and efficiency of future  &lt;br/&gt;hardware components. The PI will collaborate with industry partners to further  &lt;br/&gt;increase the broader impact. The research will engage graduate and  &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students and promote the participation of  &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
