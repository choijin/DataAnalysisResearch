<AbstractNarration>This project expands access at St. Olaf College to massive, complex datasets and delivers the analytic power they require. The 2-year effort upgrades the current campus network so researchers in physics, biology, economics, computer science and mathematics can accelerate their projects and expand the range of datasets they investigate. In particular, greater network capacity advances the NSF-funded Center for Interdisciplinary Research and the CSinParallel initiative. "The Network for Big Data" also enhances formal instruction in data science across the STEM disciplines. Looking ahead, the Network for Big Data will enable St. Olaf researchers to access massive data sets generated via remote sensing methods, including Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The Network for Big Data" continues St. Olaf's tradition of taking innovative, cost-effective approaches to advanced computing. All data transfer nodes and Big Data enclave devices reside in a single virtual local area network to serve St. Olaf's science and mathematics data management zone. Once core and data center switches are consolidated in one enhanced switch, external connectivity, which includes Internet2, will increase to 10 Gbps. The fiber infrastructure connecting St. Olaf's network border to its core and to key STEM buildings is upgraded to support 10Gbps connections, with IPv6 campus-wide deployment, and continuous performance monitoring performance and outcomes of these upgrades using a perfSONAR node.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ St. Olaf College has completed the final year of our project to build a "big data" infrastructure linking our campus to the outside world. During the project, we accomplished the following.  Upgraded the St. Olaf network infrstructure to support 10g computing throughout the sciences. We planned to deploy a 10g single-mode fiber backbone to two buildings:  Regents Hall of Mathematical Sciences (RMS) and Regents Hall of Natural Sciences (RNS). We completed this upgrade and, in fact, deployed our 10g single-mode fiber backbone to researchers in two additional buildings. We are now positioned to deploy 10g networking to all buildings on campus and to any other researches upon demand. Upgraded the computing core by adding 16-port 10g line cards to Cisco 6509 at our network core. We actually added three 16-port 10g line cards and deployed three white-box 48-port 10g distribution-layer switches connected to our core and running an open-source network operating system. Upgraded our Internet/Internet2 Connection to 10g. Completely converted to IPV6. Deployed perfsonar network performance monitoring.   As well, the project allowed us to send our IT professionals to numerous professional development conferences and workships. During the course of the project our IT professionals attended at least ten different conferences and workshops. Of special note is our co-hosting of the Minnesota Cyberinfrastructure meeting in May, 2017.   The impact of our network upgrade to 10g has just begun to be felt in our science, mathematics, and computational sciences programs. Initial users of the network include faculty in students in  computer science faculty, physics, and mathematics.
