<AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) award at the University of Rochester will support twelve students per year for ten weeks of research in fields including particle, nuclear, and cosmic ray physics, optics and quantum optics, condensed matter physics, biological physics, plasma physics, astrophysics and geophysics. The faculty research groups' combination of enthusiasm and discipline motivates students and contributes to the quality of their research. Individual guidance and mentoring foster each student's skill at navigating the world of science - giving talks, writing articles - as well as his or her intellectual development as an independent researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. The program includes a mini-course in Linux/Unix. REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, participate in tours of University research facilities and social outings and may also take part in the department's summer outreach activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the REU Site in Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Rochester is to offer undergraduate students nationwide the opportunity to take part in forefront physics research in seven subfields: particle physics, quantum optics, condensed matter, biological, plasma-, astro-, geo- and environmental physics. The REU program has shown success in the participation of women, a highly underrepresented group in physics, and serves a significant number of students from non-research institutions each year.  A range of recruitment strategies for minority students is in place both at the department and at the institutional level.  Stipend support and on-site housing are available for all participants.  Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. The program may include mini-courses in Raspberry PI and Linux/Unix.  REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities, social outings, and may also take part in the Department?s summer outreach activities.  The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences. REU activities engage undergraduates in projects such as physical chemistry, cosmic ray and high-energy particle detection, and geophysics and astrophysics data analysis using web-based databases.  Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of the program is demonstrated by the strong record of publications, conference presentations, and awards among REU participants.  Many of the research projects in which students have participated are attracting growing interest from the scientific community.  The faculty?s research group?s combination of enthusiasm and discipline motivates students and contributes to the quality of their research.  Individual guidance and mentoring fosters each student?s skill at navigating the world of science - giving talks, writing articles - and as well as his or her intellectual development as an independent researcher.   Broader impacts:  The further benefit of the REU program?s ?culture of mentoring? comes in retaining undergraduates in physical sciences and instilling in them the desire and skill to mentor others.  The program clearly contributes to the goal of building the nation?s scientific workforce and leadership. Many of the REU participants cite the program as pivotal in their decision to follow a research career.  Others, through contact with high school students here for enrichment programs during the summer, are drawn to teaching, yet another means of building the future scientific workforce and improving scientific literacy in the U.S. population generally.
