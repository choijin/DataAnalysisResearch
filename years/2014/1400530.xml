<AbstractNarration>There is a well-documented and growing need in industry for certified welding, materials joining, and nondestructive testing technicians. Chattanooga State Community College in collaboration with regional industry and the ATE National Center for Welding Education and Training (Weld-Ed) are addressing this challenge by providing faculty development to equip regional community college faculty and high school welding instructors with recruitment strategies and the necessary knowledge and skills to prepare students for nationally recognized skills certifications in critical need areas. A key goal of this project is to advance the knowledge of these welding instructors through a professional development workshop and follow-up activities that address the principles of advanced materials joining and the standards for welding and welding inspection certification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the professional development workshop is being offered to instructors, the benefits of the training are far-reaching. Approximately 15 institutions (high schools, 2- and 4-year colleges, and vocational centers) provide welding instruction within the region served by the college. Students in these institutions, whose instructors participate in the workshop, are benefitting from the instructional materials developed and provided to all participants. Students who are introduced to welding inspection may choose to pursue an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) Degree in Engineering Technology with a concentration in Nondestructive Testing Technology. Through an articulation agreement with the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), individuals who earn an AAS degree in Engineering Technology may continue their education at UTC in pursuit of a baccalaureate degree in Engineering Technology Management. Career prospects are being enhanced for individuals regardless of whether they choose to earn welding or welding inspection certifications or seek to obtain college degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College offers 21 engineering technology programs that prepare technicians in advanced technology fields, including Welding Engineering Technology and Nondestructive Testing. The Nondestructive Testing program at the college has been accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET that is recognized as the worldwide leader in assuring quality and stimulating innovation in applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology education. The college is the first and only institution within the United States to earn this distinction. This project is leveraging expertise at the college by adapting Weld-Ed curriculum resources to provide faculty development that is updating and expanding welding, materials joining, and nondestructive education in the region and increasing the number of nationally certified technicians available to industry. Participants are also being equipped with strategies and resources for student recruitment for the targeted courses and programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OVERVIEW OF PROJECT</span></strong></p> <p>There is an ongoing need for highly trained and qualified welders and welding inspectors throughout the United States. &nbsp;Chattanooga State Community College in Chattanooga, Tennessee, offers Associate of Applied Science degrees with concentrations in Welding Engineering Technology and Non-Destructive Testing Technology. &nbsp;The key inspiration for this grant was the opportunity for us to share our expertise in those areas with instructors at secondary and post-secondary institutions through a week-long professional development workshop.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS</span></strong></p> <p>A total of twenty instructors from various high schools and community colleges from Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Ohio participated in our initial workshop during the summer of 2015 and/or our follow-up workshops during the summer of 2016. &nbsp;While many of the participants were welding instructors, this workshop also attracted the interest of instructors in mechatronics, computer-aided design, mathematics, and even English.</p> <p>Workshop participants were provided with teaching strategies and instructional materials to supplement and enhance their existing welding courses. &nbsp;These materials empower instructors to teach the college-level WELD 1060 class (Welding Principles) to their students as a dual credit course. &nbsp;Workshop participants were also introduced to the field of non-destructive testing, which involves the use of various methods to test the quality of a material or object (in many cases a weld) without affecting the future usefulness of the item. &nbsp;The instructors were given the opportunity to participate in hands-on welding and non-destructive testing lab experiments. &nbsp;Finally, visual inspection tool kits were provided to all participants. &nbsp;These tool kits include a variety of welding gages, micrometers, calipers, and other instruments to accurately measure welds and to inspect them for defects that may result in future failure of the weld. &nbsp;Recruitment tools, such as videos and marketing materials, were provided to equip participants with strategies to promote awareness of educational and career opportunities available to students in the welding and weld inspection arenas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Workshop participants were encouraged to apply the material from the professional development workshop in their own classrooms during the 2015/2016 school year. &nbsp;A one-day follow-up workshop was held in the summer of 2016. &nbsp;Many of the original workshop participants returned at this time to share their successes and challenges with their fellow instructors. &nbsp;These participants were also provided with liquid penetrant test kits to further enhance their ability to perform non-destructive testing at their school.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPACT OF GRANT</span></strong></p> <p>Chattanooga State professors traveled to several high schools to demonstrate various methods of non-destructive testing, particularly visual testing (VT), liquid penetrant testing (PT), and magnetic particle testing (MT). &nbsp;Students were also invited to the labs at Chattanooga State to utilize our extensive welding and non-destructive testing equipment. &nbsp;Approximately 240 individuals were impacted by these training sessions during the 2015/2016 school year. &nbsp;More than 40 additional students participated in hands-on labs during the fall of 2016. &nbsp;Over 100 students completed written and practical welding tests and/or an introduction to non-destructive testing exam. &nbsp;Chattanooga State will continue to provide these training sessions to instructors and students in the future. &nbsp;</p> <p>The visual inspection tool kits aid welding students in the self-evaluation of their welds, a key step in improving the quality of their welds. &nbsp;Instructors and students who are not involved in welding can also benefit from the use of the visual inspection tool kits. &nbsp;The ability to properly read a micrometer or caliper is a skill that is useful in a variety of fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The majority of instructors who participated in this workshop, as well as their students, were unfamiliar with non-destructive testing methods or employment opportunities in this field. &nbsp;In addition to the visual inspection tool kits and liquid penetrant test kits, workshop participants were provided with detailed laboratories and classroom activities for multiple non-destructive test methods. &nbsp;These materials may be used by instructors on an on-going basis to demonstrate non-destructive testing to their students.</p> <p>Finally, materials from this workshop have been incorporated into Weld-Ed's Module 7, Non-Destructive Testing. &nbsp;Weld-Ed presented its introductory training session during the summer of 2016 at Chattanooga State. &nbsp;The development of this module will ensure the sustainability of information developed through Chattanooga State's NSF ATE grant.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/17/2017<br>      Modified by:
