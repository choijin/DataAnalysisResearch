<AbstractNarration>NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and require a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science and engineering.  The fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the future.  This fellowship to Victoria Garcia supports research on how cooperative behavior affects aging in birds and how wild populations experience aging.  The fellowship provides training in advanced quantitative methods, population genetics, and evolutionary biology.  The host institutions are Old Dominion University, Cornell University, and Archbold Biological Station in Central Florida.  The sponsoring scientists are Dr. Eric Walters, Dr. John Fitzpatrick, Dr. Walter Koenig, and Dr. Reed Bowman.  The plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science includes teaching and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students at ODU, where almost half the students are from backgrounds underrepresented in science.  Additionally, the Fellow is developing an outreach activity module related to her research that will be available to local high schools, many of which have predominantly underrepresented student populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senescence, a decline in physiological functioning with age, can lead to reduced survival and reproduction.  The existence of senescence has now been documented in wild populations, but few studies have delved into the causes, consequences, and evolutionary theory of senescence, as this study does.  Sociality is thought to be a major driver in determining patterns of aging because it is associated with factors that directly affect senescence such as age at onset of reproduction, mortality rates, density, and habitat saturation.  This research uses long-term data to examine previously untested aspects of aging including how sociality affects both actuarial (survival) and reproductive senescence in 3 species of cooperative breeders (Red-cockaded Woodpeckers [Picoides borealis], Acorn Woodpeckers [Melanerpes formicivorus], and Florida Scrub-Jays [Aphelocoma coerulescens]).</AbstractNarration>

The nature and extent of aging in wild populations are still open questions, even though we know from recent research that most (but not all) species experience age-related declines, known as senescence. One type of sociality in animals is cooperative breeding, a breeding system in which individuals care for offspring that are not their own. The individuals who care for offspring that are not their own may produce their own offspring, in which case they are known as co-breeders, or they may refrain from breeding, in which case they are known as helpers. Many individuals are both helpers and breeders within their lifetimes. Co-breeders and helpers may be related or unrelated to the offspring they are caring for. Each of the three species we examined are cooperative breeders. Acorn Woodpeckers are polygynandrous (polygyny and polyandry) so that co-breeding males in aa group mate with more than one female and co-breeding females mate with more than one male. Often, co-breeders of the same sex are related to each other. For example, the males may all be brothers. In addition to the breeders, groups may have 0-10 non-breeding helpers. Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and Florida Scrub-Jays are monogamous so that each group contains one breeding male and one breeding female. Additionally, each group may contain 0-5 or 0-6, respectively, non-breeding helpers. Red-cockaded Woodpecker helpers are usually male offspring from a previous year, whereas Florida Scrub-Jay helpers may be of either sex, and are often offspring from previous years.</p> <p>Our results indicate that age-related declines in reproduction (reproductive senescence) occurred each of these three species. For the most part, reproduction increased early in life as birds gained status and experience, then began a slow decline after about age five. However, the age at which the decline in reproduction started was slightly different in each species. The pattern of a decline in reproduction at older ages held up when tested in various ways.</p> <p>We found that helpers allowed breeders to produce more offspring at younger ages, but this was then associated with faster aging later in life. This result suggests that aging may be affected by a trade-off between early and late life history. That is, producing more offspring early in life may have led to faster aging late in life. We then found that the quality of a bird&rsquo;s territory, which affects the group&rsquo;s access to resources, did not affect how birds aged in any of these species. We also found that males and females did not differ in how they aged, except that there was some evidence that suggested that Red-cockaded Woodpecker females may have aged faster than males. We found that inbred birds produced fewer offspring early in life, and that was associated with decreased aging. This result also suggests that factors that affected aging did so by affecting early reproduction, leading to a trade-off with reproduction in late life.</p> <p>During the study period, I co-authored a manuscript with a female undergraduate researcher that I had mentored.
