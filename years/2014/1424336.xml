<AbstractNarration>Despite significant superficial differences important to human social organization, human faces or bodies are fundamentally structured in the same way, and their structures reflect a unique, biologically based, blueprint. Similarly, human languages are superficially vastly dissimilar in ways important to social organization, but it is not known if and to what extent their structures reflect a unique blueprint, nor is it known - if there is one - whether it is unique to language or reflects cognitively more general capacities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present project explores these questions of universality in the central domain of reference, as a first step towards settling the question of the linguistic specificity of the relevant cognitive principles involved. Investigating reference means asking how entities in the world are picked out by linguistic expressions. More precisely, this project concentrates on the referential import of anaphors, which are expressions such as English "himself" seemingly present in all languages, and whose referential function must rely on another expression or a discourse prominent entity. The project aims to develop precise tools and tests to document in depth, analyze and explain the empirical patterns displayed by anaphors, which are of interest to linguistic theory, typology and beyond. This investigation will initially be carried out in a set of typologically diverse languages. The gathered data, whose organization will be informed by the analytical tools used and the conclusions reached, will enrich the open access crowd-sourced SSWL (Syntactic Structures of the World's Languages) database, and should provide a sound basis not only for further development of linguistic theories, but also for philosophical, psycholinguistic, neuropsychological and computational approaches of reference, and even - given the sensitivity of anaphors to explicit or implicit points of view of discourse participants - for literary analysis and translation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary     Despite significant superficial differences important to human social organization, human faces or bodies are fundamentally structured in the same way, and their structures reflect a unique, biologically based, blueprint. Similarly, human languages are superficially vastly dissimilar in ways important to social organization. It is not known that to some extent, their structures reflect a unique blueprint, but it is not known to what extent, nor is it known whether this blueprint is unique to language or reflects cognitively more general capacities or a combination of both.    The present project explored these questions of universality in the central domain of reference, as a first step towards settling the question of the linguistic specificity of the relevant cognitive principles involved. Investigating reference means asking how entities are picked out by linguistic expressions. More precisely, this project concentrated on the referential import of anaphors, which are expressions such as English himselfseemingly present in all languages, and whose referential function must rely on another expression or a discourse prominent entity (the antecedent).     The project developed precise tools and tests to document in depth, analyze and explain the empirical patterns displayed by anaphors, which are of interest to linguistic theory, typology and beyond. Specifically, independent criteria (such as inanimacy) were determined to empirically distinguish between two superficially distinct behaviors of anaphors: some instances of anaphors seem to be only subject to structural constraints of locality with respect to their antecedent, while other instances of anaphors seem to be only subject to discourse constraints related to perspective. This empirical investigation ultimately led to a unification of the analysis of both anaphoric behaviors, which simplifies the theory of anaphora and sheds new light on the role of perspective-taking in grammar.     This investigation was carried out in a set of typologically diverse languages based on large-scale, systematically controlled questionnaires. The point of departure of the project was the PIs? research on French, and the exploration was then extended to English, Icelandic, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, Modern Greek, Modern Hebrew, Turkish and Uyghur.     Intellectual Merit   The study of (co)reference is one of the central problems of human cognition. The behavior of anaphors is one of its most central aspects, particularly because of its dependence on grammatical properties. The results of the project show that factors crucial to understanding this behavior (in particular, the apparent distinction between two types of behaviors) had been overlooked. Correctly delimiting the boundaries between two types of anaphoric behaviors made it possible to empirically ground the study of anaphors and elaborate theories of their properties. This led to a refinement of the theory of the structural constraints on anaphors and to a clarification of the role of perspective in grammar.   Broader Impacts   Anaphora, because of its language specific aspects, is one of the domains actively investigated in the study of human cognition. The results of this research should provide a sound basis not only for further development of syntactic and semantic theories, but also for psycholinguistic studies (first or second language acquisition of anaphors; anaphora processing), neuropsychological studies (neural basis of anaphoric coding, study of deficits), as well as computational approaches (linguistic parsing, automatic language recognition). Given the sensitivity of anaphors to explicit or implicit points of view of discourse participants, this research should even be useful for literary analysis and translation. This study will also lead, through the design and use of a precise questionnaire, to substantial enrichment of the open access crowd-sourced SSWL database (Syntactic Structures of the World?s Languages) available to all researchers, linguists or not, in the domain of anaphora.  Finally, this research provided specialized training and mentoring of young researchers given that it was conducted in close collaboration with students and its results were used in graduate and undergraduate courses, workshops and seminars at the partner institutions and elsewhere.
