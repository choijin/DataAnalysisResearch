<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of the proposed research is to obtain records of platinum, iridium, and osmium concentrations and osmium isotope ratios in the GISP2 Greenland ice core in order to investigate the hypothesis that there was a meteorite or comet impact at the onset of the Younger Dryas abrupt climate event 12,900 years ago. These analyses will be combined with high-resolution measurements of climate proxies obtained on the same samples. Osmium isotopes have the potential not only to conclusively confirm or refute the presence of an extraterrestrial impact, but also to provide information about the size and type of the impactor, should one be confirmed. High-resolution analyses of the atmospheric circulation proxies sodium, calcium, and iron represent a leap in ice core analysis resolution from one sample per three years to over 100 samples per year. The proposed research activities would contribute towards an understanding of what happened at the Younger Dryas, which will be of broad interest to geologists, geochemists, climatologists, archeologists, astronomers, and the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following recent reports of a large anomaly in platinum concentration in the GISP2 ice core, four investigators propose a series of collaborative analyses at Dartmouth College and the University of Maine on GISP2 ice core samples of Younger Dryas age to: (1) evaluate the platinum spike at the Younger Dryas onset for potential contamination and contributions from volcanic and terrestrial sources, (2) measure osmium concentration and isotope composition to evaluate whether an impact occurred at the Younger Dryas onset and assess the nature of any impactor, and (3) assess the environmental change across this critical climate transition by measuring iron, sodium and calcium at storm-scale resolution using a new laser ablation mass-spectrometry system. The proposed research will provide students with opportunities for engaged learning in order to increase their interest and knowledge of how geochemical investigations provide insights to climate change affecting the Arctic. In particular, this study will constitute a major portion of a Ph.D. thesis and an undergraduate Senior Thesis. It will expose graduate and undergraduate students to cutting-edge geochemical and mass spectrometric techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Younger Dryas (YD) is the term used for the approximately 1200 year-long return to near-glacial conditions that: (1) followed the Bolling-Allerod warm and moist period on the heels of the retreat of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets; and (2) preceded the start of modern climate approximately 10,000 years ago &ndash; the Holocene.  The YD has been a period of considerable interest by climate researchers because it both starts and ends within several years and is characterized by substantive changes in temperature, precipitation and atmospheric circulation &ndash; the classic definition of an abrupt climate change event.  Our previous research demonstrated that the termination of the Younger Dryas into the milder modern climate occurred in less than two years and was equivalent to a doubling in the length of the summer season throughout potentially much of the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.  We conducted this research using our recently developed ice core laser sampling in the University of Maine?s W.M. Keck Laser Ice Facility.      The cause(s) for the onset of the Younger Drays have remained an enigma for decades with theories ranging from the introduction of meltwater into the North Atlantic Ocean system to the impact of a major meteorite impact.
