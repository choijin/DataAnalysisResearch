<AbstractNarration>NON TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;A one-day Focus-on-Sustainability program of activities created by the Materials Research Society (MRS) and supported by the Division of Materials Research for the 2014 MRS Fall Meeting &amp; Exhibit in Boston, MA, is designed to raise the awareness of the nexus between materials, materials research, and sustainable practice. The program will create opportunities for a diverse group of stakeholders to interact in a variety of ways to build a community of practice-galvanizing action towards, and bolstering participation in, research and education focusing on sustainability and the key role that materials play.  The planned events include a session of invited talks by corporate social responsibility officers to be embedded in an existing Materials as Tools for Sustainability symposium, a poster competition for the MRS University Chapters (Sustainability@MySchool), a keynote presentation by a materials/sustainability-innovator in the Technology Innovation Forum, a preview of the new STEM course "Impact of Materials on Society," a Corporate Sustainability Roundtable, a preview of Strange Matter Green Earth museum exhibition under development by the MRS, a dynamic floor session on interacting with the public, and networking events to start and end the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;The Materials Research Society (MRS) Focus-on-Sustainability events, supported by the Division of Materials Research, will kick off the 2014 MRS Fall Meeting &amp; Exhibit on Sunday, November 30th and run through Monday, December 1. A central strategy for the program is the participation of corporate social responsibility leaders. It is important to connect this corporate group with the materials research community, in order to foster new synergies that drive research supporting sustainable materials usage, considerations of materials life-cycles, materials reuse and repurposing, green processing, and energy conservation and generation. Successful corporations practice systems-level thinking, and materials researchers can benefit from incorporating this point-of-view in the development of their research portfolios, especially as it pertains to sustainability. The planned events include a session of invited talks by corporate social responsibility officers to be embedded in an existing Materials as Tools for Sustainability symposium, a poster competition for the MRS University Chapters (Sustainability@My School), a keynote presentation by a materials/sustainability-innovator in the Technology Innovation Forum, a preview of the new STEM course "Impact of Materials on Society," a Corporate Sustainability Roundtable, a preview of Strange Matter Green Earth museum exhibition under development by the MRS, a dynamic floor session on interacting with the public, and networking events to start and end the program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At the 2016 Materials Research Society (MRS) Spring Meeting &amp; Exhibit in Phoenix, AZ, with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF), MRS successfully convened a "charrette" style Strange Matter Green Earth Subcommittee Meeting.  Exhibit design professionals from Ontario Science Centre (OSC) presided over the 1-1/2 hour working session.  OSC is the design partner in the production of the traveling science exhibition initiative Strange Matter Green Earth (SMGE), an MRS STEM educational exhibition project designed to Focus on Sustainability and materials science. Utilizing a hands-on, interactive presentation format, OSC presenters promoted dialogue and created an engaging environment that elicited positive feedback from the attendees.  The group networked and provided unique perspectives and ideas upon how materials sustainability concepts could engage the public on sustainability and the ways in which materials are being engineered to help people meet their needs in a sustainable manner.  In attendance were 17 leaders from corporate industry, governmental funding agencies, educational institutions, research labs and public science centers and representing a global community with representation from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.  Subsequent to the meeting, dialogue continued between SMGE Subcommittee leaders and several of the corporate representatives regarding the potential and benefits of coprorate sponsorshp for SMGE.
