<AbstractNarration>Title: CPS: Breakthrough: Compositional Modeling of Cyberphysical Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is devoted to the discovery of new mathematical modeling techniques for Cyber-Physical Systems.  In particular, the research involves devising novel conceptual methods for assembling systems from subsystems, and for reasoning about the behavior of systems in terms of the behavior of their subsystems, which may be computational or physical.  The results enable scientists and engineers to develop more realistic models of the systems they are designing, and to obtain greater insights into their eventual behavior, without having to build costly prototypes.  The intellectual merits are the new notions of system behavior being developed that unify the computational and the physical, and the mathematical operators and laws governing the relationships between systems and subsystems.  The project's broader significance and importance lie in the increased pace of innovation within Cyber-Physical System design that the new modeling techniques make possible, and the curricular enhancements that the novel conceptual frameworks under development support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific research program of this project involves the development of a novel modeling paradigm, Generalized Synchronization Trees (GSTs), into a rich framework for both describing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and studying their behavior under interconnection.  GSTs are inspired by Milner's use of Synchronization Trees (STs) to model interconnected computing processes, but GSTs generalize the mathematical structure of their forebears in such a way as to encompass systems with discrete ("Cyber") as well as continuous ("Physical") dynamics.  As Milner did with STs, the PIs are developing an algebraic theory of composition for GSTs.  Such theories have a particular advantage over non-algebraic ones: because the composition of two (or more) objects results in an object of the same type, composition operators can be nested to build large structures out of smaller ones. Thus, the theory of GSTs is inherently compositional. The development of the theory involves five distinct but complementary endeavors.  Standard models for cyber-physical systems are being encoded as GSTs in a semantically robust way; meaningful notions of composition and congruence for CPSs are being described and studied algebraically; the interplay between behavioral equivalence and the preservation of system properties is being investigated; a notion of real-time (or clock time) is under consideration for GSTs; and GSTs are being assessed as modeling tools for practical design scenarios.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed and studied new foundational theories for modeling systems consisting of computational and physical components (so-called cyber-physical systems).  Such systems are already having a profound impact on society, as software takes over the control of medical, automotive and aerospace systems; this trend will only accelerate as fully autonomous vehicles and advanced medical technologies emerge and revolutionize our transportation, medical, logistics and military sectors.  In order to accelerate the development and deployment of such systems, increasing emphasis is being placed on design-time modeling and analysis, in which mathematical models of systems are developed, simulated and verified in order to detect problematic aspects of system specifications and designs as early as possible, before the expenditure of the level of resources required for physical prototypes.  Previous mathematical theories for modeling such systems, however, suffered from a large defect:  they did not support so-called compositional modeling, in which system models are assembled from models of smaller subsystems.  This project addressed this problem by developing a novel mathematical approach to modeling such systems that admits the principled development of a wide variety of composition operators.  The framework relies on the well-studied field of process algebra, a branch of computer science devoted to notions of modeling and composition for distributed computer systems.  This project showed how the models developed in the process-algebraic setting can be adapted for use in physical-world, and combined computer / physical world, settings as well, in a way that naturally supports composition operations on cyber-physical systems.  The intellectual merit of the project resides in its fundamental re-imagining of the best methods for modeling systems featuring interactions between computers and the real world.  The broader impacts derive from the likelihood the work will have in informing new curricula, and modeling tools, for designing cyber-physical systems.  The specific contributions of the project may be summarized as follows.  A new theory of system behavior, Generalized Synchronization Trees (GSTs), was developed, and notions of semantic equivalence based on bisimulation were proposed and studied to define when two different GSTs are actually indistinguishable.  A variety of composition operators were then defined over GSTs, and their algebraic properties investigated.  Temporal-logic characterizations of the equivalence relations were also given; these permit equivalent systems to be seen as satisfying the same properties, in a precise sense.  Translations into GSTs of existing modeling formalisms, including hybrid automata, differential equations, and state machines were also defined, so that one could then apply composition operations at the GST level to show precisely how models in these different formalisms could nevertheless be rigorously integrated into a single coherent system model.
