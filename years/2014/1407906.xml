<AbstractNarration>In this project, a new nanoscale three-dimensional (3-D) integrated circuit technology that can potentially revolutionize the microelectronics industry with far-reaching socio-economic impact is being investigated. The current two-dimensional (2-D) Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology is the main workhorse for building integrated circuits for computers, mobile devices, medical and space applications, industrial applications, and other embedded devices. While this CMOS technology, that was invented in the last century and ever since remained a key driver of global socio-economic progress, is soon expected to reach fundamental physical limits and will not be able to provide the improvements we are accustomed to. This project provides a new direction for continuous miniaturization of integrated circuits enabling continuous scaling with orders of magnitude efficiency benefits including reduced cost, as well as, a reduction of the amount of power consumption required to sustain applications at high performance. These improvements are game changing and are expected to fuel innovation in many new application domains. Another key aspect is the educational and outreach component, benefiting students and the broader technical community. This includes entrepreneurship mentoring, supporting undergraduate students for training in advanced cross-disciplinary nanotechnology concepts, international collaborations, and broad research dissemination through online technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While continuous scaling of the CMOS integrated circuit architecture has been the major driver for the integrated circuits industry, scaling to sub-20nm technologies is proving to be very difficult due to fundamental physical limits. As the benefits are slowing, migrating to true 3-D eludes CMOS: its core requirements of customization and manufacturing are not inherently compatible with fine-grain 3-D integration. This project proposes a comprehensive 3-D integrated circuit fabric technology in which core fabric aspects are developed in unison to achieve 3-D compatibility. Fabric nanostructures with vertical nanowires and architected solutions for connectivity and 3-D heat management, in conjunction with a cross-layer approach across device, circuit and manufacturability, are essential to this approach. Preliminary evaluations for this 3-D nanofabric, including a designed 4-bit microprocessor, show more than 60x improvement in density with greater than 16.5x improvement in performance/watt and a potential for two orders of magnitude for very large-scale designs. Analytical projections promise further improvements over scaled CMOS. The research will focus on detailed design of core fabric aspects at nanoscale including material choices and design rules, comprehensive evaluation using a bottom-up methodology including material considerations, and nanocircuit/architecture-level designs and simulations. Experimental research will focus on validation of core fabric aspects. E-beam lithography will be used along with standard semiconductor manufacturing processes for experimental cleanroom demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research project has led to the development of several fine-grain vertically integrated 3D technology approaches including SkyBridge and initial new direction for Vertical-3D-CMOS. These approaches are fundamentally different from monolithic 3D approach where several 2D layers are stacked layer-by layer. Instead of stacking, these approaches use templates of vertical nanowires and form circuits by connecting them. Significant progress was made during the course of this project including aspects such as design, circuit schemes, system-level CAD tool flow, large-scale benchmarking, initial thermal management, experimental prototyping and validation. This pioneering 3D direction can have huge socioeconomic impact, if realized. It can support new microprocessor architectures which are more complex in terms of design and interconnect. It could also potentially support new kind of unconventional architectures to support Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms. Furthermore, it can support broad-ranging interdisciplinary research underpinned by CMOS technology. Some of the key project outcomes pertaining are listed below. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SkyBridge 3D Fabric</span>: SkyBridge 3D is the first among many fine-grained 3D integrated circuit technology that was proposed during this project. It employs dynamic circuit style to conform to its underlying physical framework. Core components were developed as shown in Fig. 1. Using process, device and circuit level simulations, all the components were characterized and validated. A comprehensive bottom-up methodology was developed for fabric evaluation using simulations at material, device, circuit and system levels. Several designs were extensively benchmarked including carry Look-ahead adders, array multipliers and WISP-4 microprocessor following our methodology. Fig. 2 shows the device-to-system design flow in SkyBridge. These characterizations have indicated significant benefits in power and performance against conventional 2D designs. 3D connectivity implications were quantified for very large-scale designs including a 10 million logic gate design. Several new directions for vertical 3D integration were initiated during this project, prominent among them is Vertical-3D-CMOS (V3DC) fabric. It employs a fabric assembly scheme based on pre-doped vertical nanowire bundles. To form the pull-up and pull-down networks, active devices are placed and connected on nanowires either in series or in parallel to build CMOS circuits. The fabric component SkyBridge-Interlayer-Connection (SB-ILC) enables connecting the p-type pull-up and n-type pull-down networks together. Additional fabric structures were developed to allow both vertical and horizontal connectivity. V3DC has many of the fabric structures similar with dynamic SkyBridge fabric albeit differently integrated/utilized. The initial fabric evaluation shows promising results. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experimental Validation</span>: Experimental prototyping was done to validate key process steps that are helpful to demonstrate manufacturability of SkyBridge. Key process steps are formation of vertical nanowires, interlayer dielectric planarization in 3D, selective material deposition in 3D. Isolated vertical nanowires and nanowire arrays were formed. A range of nanowires with different heights and widths were fabricated. Selective material deposition, which is a key step in forming components, was enabled by a novel photoresist planarization technique. As a result, precisely controlled selective material depositions of various kinds of metals and oxides in the nanowire template was achieved. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show key fabrication results.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dissemination of Research:</span> This project contributed significantly to the research of 3D integrated circuits, CAD tool flow, fabrication techniques for 3D and thermal-aware IC design. Research results were disseminated to general audience through student forums, international conference presentations and seminars. Overall, the project led to 22 publications in various peer-reviewed international conferences and journals. PI presented this work in technical discussion session at MIT. Several key research outcomes were incorporated in PI?s graduate course where students received hands-on experience on nanoscale fine-grained 3D architecture design and evaluation through course project. A graduate student presented this work as an invited talk at CHM annual gathering. PI was featured in an article Research Outreach, where the 3D IC technology was introduced to a wider audience and the large-scale societal implications of this project were discussed. Formal relationships were created with Tokyo Electron and Synopsys who are interested in this direction and negotiated agreements with UMass Innovation Institute (UMII). PhD students participated and presented their research in department PhD student forums, which was open to all members of the university. They also received hands-on trainings and gained experiences on nanoscale computing research, state-of-art experimental prototyping equipment and CAD tools.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/24/2019<br>      Modified by: Csaba Andras&nbsp;Moritz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407906/1407906_10307911_1569355684515_SkyBridge_core_comp--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407906/1407906_10307911_1569355684515_SkyBridge_core_comp--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SkyBridge Core Components"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407906/1407906_10307911_1569355684515_SkyBridge_core_comp--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SkyBridge Core Components"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A) Arrays of regular single crystal vertical Si nanowires, B) vertical Gate-All-Around Junctionless nanowire transistor, C) nanowire linking Bridges, D) Coaxial routing structures</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nanoscale Computing Fabrics Lab</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Csaba Andras&nbsp;Moritz</div> <div class="imageTitle">SkyBridge Core Components</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407906/1407906_10307911_1569355795346_SkyBridge_circuit_eval--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407906/1407906_10307911_1569355795346_SkyBridge_circuit_eval--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Skybridge Circuit Evaluation methodology"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407906/1407906_10307911_1569355795346_SkyBridge_circuit_eval--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Skybridge Circuit Evaluation methodology"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The bottom-up approach uses TCAD Process and Device simulated device characteristics in HSPICE simulations.
