<AbstractNarration>The stability of DNA allows an organism to live and reproduce, but changes in the genome provide a means for the evolution of a species in response to a changing environment. Plant breeding has always relied on changes in DNA for generating the genetic variation needed to develop new varieties. Some of these changes in the genome occur in a controlled manner during normal seed development, but this can also occur following DNA damage after exposure to excessive light, ozone and UV. Biotechnological manipulation of the plant genome has allowed us to induce controlled genomic changes in plants, providing a huge potential for molecularly designed plant breeding. Research by the more than 80 laboratories in this field continues to rapidly expand the understanding of how plants deal with environmental and endogenous threats to their growth, development, and genomic stability, to advance the long-standing goals of gene targeting and site-directed mutagenesis of plants, and to develop technologies for the acceleration of plant breeding. Individuals with previous training and experience in repair and recombination, who have moved into plant models, have created a dynamic and productive new discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to help support travel for 10 young scientists to attend a conference on Plant Genome Stability and Change is scheduled for July 17-20, 2014 at the Asilomar Conference Center, in Pacific Grove, California. The meeting plans to bring together an international group of senior and junior investigators, postdocs and graduate students working in or interested in the area of DNA repair and epigenetics and expose them to cutting-edge science via talks and posters.  The meeting venue is also expected to promote lively and wide-ranging discussions that include all attendees, after talks and in more informal settings.  The organizers plan to encourage, to the fullest extent possible, participation by women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided support for 10 young investigators (graduate student and postdoctoral scholars) to attend the meeting "Plant Genomic Stability and Change, 2014".  The awards were designed to encourage participation by women and minorities, and to facilitate participation by awardees that might not otherwise have had the resources to attend (undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral investigators, and investigators at the Assistant Professor or equivalent rank).  The enrollment of these 10 additional participants helped to support the meeting as a whole, both intellectually and financially.              This international meeting, which takes place every 2 years, provides the sole venue for the intensive discussion of topics related to DNA repair in plants.  These include:  a) How plants protect their DNA from the mutagenic effects of environmentally-induced damage (due to UV light, chemical toxins, or oxygen radicals induced by environmental stress).  b) How plant chromosomes recombine during repair, during meiosis (to generate new varieties of crops) and during the genetic engineering process.  c) How plants adjust the cell cycle and their pattern of development in order to promote growth in spite of the persistence of DNA damage.  d) How plant chromosome segregate, and how this process can be altered to accelerate plant breeding.  e) Methodologies for both general mutagenesis and precision engineering of the plant genome.              Although NSFÆs support was limited to researchers from the US or working in US labs, attendance at the meeting was international; 36 out of 94 participants were from the US, while the others were from Europe, Japan, China, and Israel.  While the majority of participants were from academia, 17% of attendees were from industry, reflecting the high degree of interest in the practical applications stemming from this field. This meeting was attended by investigators representing every major laboratory, world-wide, that works in this area.  Thus NSFÆs award provided an opportunity for young US investigators to interact with scientists from around the world that share their interest in genomic maintenance and modification in plants.
