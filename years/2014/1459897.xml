<AbstractNarration>This research project develops and analyzes a new model of how unemployment can affect lifelong earnings.  The project plans to test a new explanation for the following widely observed facts.  First, for most workers, wages grow over time, whether that is measured as total time in the workforce or time in the current job.  Second, workers who have been unemployed at some point in their work careers often find that their later earnings from employment lag behind the earnings of other workers.  The PI has developed an economic model where firms vary in productivity and the on-the-job training provided to workers.  Workers at productive firms are more likely to avoid unemployment and also gain more skills, which increases their future wages.  The research team will test the model using an innovative data set.  The project advances science in macroeconomics and labor economics.  Because the research may lead to new understanding about the long-run costs of unemployment to American workers, it will contribute to better policies for promoting national prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work explores the interaction between human capital accumulation and labor market frictions as first order determinants of wage dynamics.  While these are frequently viewed as competing explanations of labor market outcomes, the core idea here is that they work together and the two forces can combine to cause persistence in the response of wages to shocks.  Through the presence of firm heterogeneity, frictions can impact the rate of human capital accumulation, with different firms providing different levels of training.  As such, frictions do not only introduce dispersion in the return to current skills but are also themselves determinants of dispersion in future skill outcomes.  The estimation methodology is based on simulation-based methods and will use micro panel data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Merit and outcomes:  A worker’s wages fluctuate over her career. They tend to increase as she becomes more experienced and more tenured. They tend to reward higher education more so than less. They reward some fields of study more than others. They tend to reward men more than women. They are also in general fairly poorly understood by simple measures such as these. That is, attempts to relate wage variation across workers to observable characteristics usually leave a larger fraction of wage variation unexplained than explained. Yet, studies on labor market micro panel data that document workers’ labor market histories as sequences of employment relationships with potentially different employers demonstrate that some workers persistently receive higher wages than their observable characteristics would predict. Some workers persistently receive less. Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) make such a point and they further find that firms contribute significantly to wage variation as well. That is, part of a worker’s wage dynamics is a result of her mobility between firms.  This project explores flexible estimation of the joint determinants of wage and mobility outcomes in the labor market outcomes using methods that are also popular in the recent advances in machine learning. In particular, the project develops a model and estimation strategy to identify the latent types of workers and firms and how these types interact in matches between workers and firms in the determination of wage and employment outcomes. The framework directly incorporates observable characteristics of both workers and firms in the identification of the worker and firm types. The framework also allows these types to manifest themselves differently in wages and mobility over time and in time varying characteristics such as tenure and experience. The project estimates the model on 28 years’ worth of worker histories for the entire Danish population where each worker’s labor market history is recorded from the period, 1985-2013.  The estimation results reveal significant sorting between worker and firm wage types. Firms are revealed to contribute relatively little to current wage outcomes. Furthermore, the mobility patterns between firms are not strong predictors of the observed sorting in the estimated model. The project determines that mobility patterns vary considerably over the lifetime of workers. In particular, wages seem to direct mobility considerably stronger early in workers’ careers. Later in their careers, workers seem to move more for non-wage characteristics. The results are suggestive that a hidden Markov model where types can evolve dynamically can be a particularly successful avenue to understand wage dynamics.  The project consequently extends the model estimation of worker and firm determinants of wage and mobility outcomes to study the hypothesis that both worker and firm types can evolve dynamically over time. In particular, the framework allows that the type of the firm that the worker is currently with not only is a part determinant of the worker’s current wages and mobility outcomes, but in addition they partly determine how the worker’s current type evolves into a possibly different type in the future. Hence, instead of having fixed types manifest themselves differently as a function of the limited observable time varying characteristics available to the econometrician, the framework allows that the worker’s fundamental type can simply change. The framework is an application of hidden Markov model estimation.  The project has successfully built an estimation of a hidden Markov model extension along with numerical implementation of the estimator. Furthermore, the project demonstrates that the estimator is successful in identifying latent dynamically evolving worker and firm types in simulated data.  The identification of the hidden Markov model informs the structural model of project which is a model of human capital evolution in frictional labor markets. In this setup different firms may provide workers with different investments in the human capital embodied in the worker, or in the match. In this model, if the production function is complementary in the productivity types of workers and firms, more productive firms will invest more in their workers, which not only increases the worker’s wages in the current match, but also in future matches, which is a particular interpretation of how it may be that different types of firms can affect the type evolution of workers, where training can lift the worker from a lower wage type to a higher wage type.  For this model, the project has built a numerical model solution and has calibrated the model to American labor market data where it demonstrates that significant sorting between worker and firm types results in equilibrium despite little variation in mobility patterns across workers to affect such sorting. Rather the sorting is a result of high productivity firms making their workers more productive. It also demonstrates that variation in labor market histories across workers due to labor market frictions can thus have significant impacts on worker lifetime earnings.
