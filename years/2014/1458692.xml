<AbstractNarration>The E2S5 (Environment, Engineering, Sustainability Science Student Success Scholarships) Project is aimed at encouraging high academic achievement, promoting experiential learning and internship opportunities that will supplement students' scientific foundation at Greenfield Community College.  The program will also encourage student outreach and community service and will prepare recipients for careers or continued studies in STEM-related fields.  E2S5 is designed to support students in four STEM disciplines at the college and incorporate experiential learning and internships as student learning outcomes.  Four disciplines will be targeted in this project: Engineering, Environmental Science, Farm and Food Systems, and Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency.  The program emphasizes recruitment of qualified students to these disciplines, and will build on other college initiatives designed to support STEM students and increase retention.  E2S5 is also designed to facilitate next steps for students to enter the workplace or to continue to baccalaureate granting institutions. Towards this end, the project will build on existing opportunities for experiential site-based learning and internships to deepen science discipline understanding and will provide pathways to jobs or transfer.  Internships will provide students with the best possible experiential learning.  They will provide local businesses and agencies with student energy and expertise, and will help prepare students to become responsive to the need for more American scientists and engineers in the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The college will use S-STEM grant funds to provide a total of 102 scholarships over a five-year period.  Scholarship criteria are well defined and inclusive to reach broadly into the diverse student body that populates these programs.  Funding plans will be structured to include as many qualified students as possible.   An extensive student support system, including advising and coaching, tutoring and academic support, experiential learning, internship opportunities, career and transfer counseling, and community building special events will be built and scholarship recipients will be expected to participate.  Goals of the project include well-defined and significant improvement in persistence rates.  By the end of the grant period, the PI expects that 95% of the students will either find discipline-related employment or transfer into a related discipline at a baccalaureate granting institution. In terms of the broader impacts, the program will emphasize the priorities of integrating teaching and experiential research and learning, promoting diversity, and encouraging scientific understanding that benefits society. Dissemination of results to the outside community will primarily be accomplished through presentations at discipline specific conferences and at conferences that focus on student learning.  Internally, dissemination will be through presentations to faculty as professional development workshops that focus on learning communities, engaging students in science, problem-based learning, and peer-led team leadership. Findings will help broaden the higher education enterprise's understanding of the attributes and practices of programs that are successful in promoting academic opportunity and quality for students with financial need.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Greenfield Community College is a small, liberal arts two-year college in Franklin County, Massachusetts, serving primarily rural students. Average student enrollment from 2015-2020 was 1,884, with 69 percent attending part time and 37 percent receiving Pell grant support. STEM departments offer 14 degree pathways with an emphasis on transfer, particularly to the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5</sup> Project set out to improve educational opportunities and support high academic achievement for first- and second-year students in four selected majors: Engineering, Environmental Science, Farm and Food Systems, and Renewable Energy. Project design emphasized access for low-income students, integration of experiential education across the curriculum, expanded use of existing and new student supports, and incorporation of new models into institutional best practices.</p> <p>Over five years, a total of $526,292 in scholarships was awarded to 67 low-income students of diverse backgrounds (Table 1). Recipients achieved high levels of positive outcomes: 83 percent graduated with two-year STEM degrees, transferred to four-year STEM programs, or began STEM careers. Responsive changes to the scholarship program produced higher positive outcome rates. Forty-nine students received $2,500 per semester with a cap of $10,000. Working students reported that even with this award they could not reduce work hours to focus on academics. Course performance suffered, and some students left the E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5</sup> program because their GPA dropped below 3.0, even after GPA eligibility requirements were reduced to 2.5 in the second year. In the fourth year, scholarships were increased up to $5,000 per semester with a cap of $20,000.&nbsp; Of the 16 students who received the higher award, 94 percent (15) achieved positive outcomes, compared to 80 percent (39 of 49) of students receiving the original amount (Table 2A).</p> <p>Activities of the E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5</sup> Project have improved the quality of STEM learning in the original four majors, created spin-off majors, and increased access to experiential learning opportunities for all students. The project has raised the visibility of STEM careers and educational pathways within the college and in the larger community, and sustained enrollments in E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5</sup> and spin-off majors during a period when college liberal arts enrollment declined by 35 percent, and total student enrollment by 14 percent (Table 3).</p> <p>Leveraging the <a href="https://www.mass.edu/strategic/stemstarter.asp">STEM Starter Academy (SSA)</a> program--an initiative of the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education--the E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5</sup> Project innovated with cohort-based programming that enhanced retention and completion. These innovations were shared throughout the Massachusetts Community College system, enhancing the project's impact on STEM education and public awareness. The E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5</sup> project has improved the learning pipeline that prepares qualified scientists and engineers well beyond GCC's service region.</p> <p>STEM learning at community college must parallel the curriculum in four-year programs in order for graduates to transfer smoothly, persist in STEM, and enter STEM professions.&nbsp; However, two-year degrees often emphasize completion of General Education course requirements, leaving insufficient space for sequential STEM courses. GCC faculty worked closely with their four-year counterparts to substantially revise E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5</sup> majors to align with <a href="https://www.mass.edu/masstransfer/a2b/home.asp">Mass Transfer </a>STEM pathways, including creation of a new <a href="https://www.gcc.mass.edu/academics/programs/science-of-earth-environment/">A.S. degree</a>. This work facilitated development of additional A.S. STEM degrees. These well-aligned programs will provide long-term benefit to students by accelerating their completion and ensuring they are prepared as third-year STEM students when they transfer.</p> <p>To achieve educational parity with their four-year peers, community college students need access to undergraduate research experiences, job-based learning and opportunities to explore STEM career paths. At GCC, internships on campus and in businesses throughout the community enable students to build STEM skills, confidence, and credentials while also contributing value to the regional economy. Internship participation is central to each E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5 </sup>major. The project provided modest funding for the Internship Coordinator position. More importantly, it leveraged other grants and private funds to expand staffing and ensure students could be paid for internship work. Participation in internships is robust. From Fall 2015 through Fall 2019, 218 students completed internships: 160 (73%) were in one of the four E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5 </sup>majors; 182 (83%) came from across all STEM majors; and the remaining 36 (17%) were non-STEM majors (Table 4).&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to bridging financial barriers to student access and achievement, social and academic challenges must be overcome in order to recruit, retain and advance qualified STEM learners. The E<sup>2</sup>S<sup>5</sup> project worked closely with cohorts of STEM scholars to discover barriers to student engagement with existing supports, address gaps, and deploy effective strategies. The resulting model-- built on well-established mentoring practices and cohort-based groups that emphasized student leadership--created a mutual aid approach that proved particularly valuable during the unexpected transition to remote learning in March 2020 due to COVID-19. The model has now been replicated in other areas of the college, both by staff and students. New supports have been integrated with existing ones, building new best practices into the structure and culture of the college.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Teresa&nbsp;Jones</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599082176_Table1-ScholarshipsTable-Sheet1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599082176_Table1-ScholarshipsTable-Sheet1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 1- Scholarships"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599082176_Table1-ScholarshipsTable-Sheet1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 1- Scholarships"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An overview of the scholarships demographics of the E2S5 Project</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greenfield Community College</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deidre&nbsp;Murphy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Table 1- Scholarships</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599131499__Table2Aand2B_-Sheet1(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599131499__Table2Aand2B_-Sheet1(2)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 2A and 2B- Outcomes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599131499__Table2Aand2B_-Sheet1(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 2A and 2B- Outcomes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Outcomes of the E2S5 Project</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greenfield Community College</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deidre&nbsp;Murphy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Table 2A and 2B- Outcomes</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599216092_Table3Aand3B-EnrollmentDataTable--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599216092_Table3Aand3B-EnrollmentDataTable--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 3A and 3B- Student Enrollment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599216092_Table3Aand3B-EnrollmentDataTable--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 3A and 3B- Student Enrollment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student enrollment in E2S5 majors at GCC, 2015-2020</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greenfield Community College</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deidre&nbsp;Murphy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Table 3A and 3B- Student Enrollment</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599279201_Table4-GCCFacilitatedInternships__-Sheet1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599279201_Table4-GCCFacilitatedInternships__-Sheet1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 4-  GCC Facilitated Internships"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458692/1458692_10375953_1606599279201_Table4-GCCFacilitatedInternships__-Sheet1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 4-  GCC Facilitated Internships"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Gcc Facilitated Internships, 2015-2019</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greenfield Community College</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deidre&nbsp;Murphy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Table 4-  GCC Facilitated Internships</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
