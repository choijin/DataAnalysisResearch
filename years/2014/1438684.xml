<AbstractNarration>The "Expanding Capacity to Train Cyber Security Professionals" project at Tacoma community College (TCC), is a direct response to the President's call to action for changes in policies, technologies, education, and laws to protect cyberspace, and the pronounced shortage of cybersecurity professionals.  The goal of this project will be to increase the capacity of TCC's Networking and Cyber Security associate degree program to prepare students for the workforce to address the unprecedented need for cybersecurity professionals. The project will target separating/retiring military personnel and veterans, particularly those with prior networking knowledge and/or active security clearances. A critical element of this project will also involve working with industry partners for direct placement of students and graduates in internships and/or employment in cyber security and related fields. This project will build upon TCC's proven success in program development and significant experience planning and implementing NSF projects, along with its recognition as one of the most military-friendly schools in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this project will be to (1) Double the capacity of TCC's existing Networking &amp; Cyber Security Associate in Applied Sciences Degree; (2) Expand curriculum to address industry needs and the ever-changing cyber ecosystem, and to position the college to apply for Center of Academic Excellence for Information Assurance/Cyber Defense for Two-Year Education (CAE-2Y) designation in 2016-2017; (3) Develop and modify accelerated Cyber Security training pathway(s) within the existing degree program for individuals with prior networking experience and industry-recognized credentials and transition into the cybersecurity workforce with little or no replication of prior learning; and (4) Place 70% of program completers/graduates in employment, internships, and/or transfer to a baccalaureate degree in cybersecurity or related field.  The expanded curriculum will include a virtual lab environment (using NDG NETLAB+ and VMware vSphere) for greater hands-on experience equipping students with valuable VMware technical skills resulting in more highly trained cybersecurity professionals with increased opportunities for specialization.</AbstractNarration>
