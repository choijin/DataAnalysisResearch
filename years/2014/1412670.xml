<AbstractNarration>John B. Wiley at the University of New Orleans is supported by an award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate an unusual motif in chemical structures on the scale of nanometers (billionths of a meter). The ability to organize small scale objects (nanoobjects) into ordered arrays is important to the development of new technologies.  In this project, new peapod-like structures are assembled from small spheres and very thin sheets. The materials are then studied in terms of methods of assembly, variations in composition, and physical properties.  Such materials are of interest in that they could lead to important technological advances in a variety of areas including magnetics, electronics, photocatalysis, and drug delivery. Undergraduate and graduate students are involved in all aspects of the research component of this program, providing them with valuable training in the synthesis and characterization of new nanostructures as well as the presentation and publication of scientific data. There are also undergraduate students from France who come to work in the research group's laboratory, promoting chemistry at the international level. Finally, to help promote science in the New Orleans area, local high school students are involved in this research program each summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to form nanopeapod structures by the capture of nanoparticles in scrolled nanosheets offers a new approach to the assembly of 1-D nanostructures.  This project focuses on those aspects of nanoparticle assembly and nanosheet scrolling specifically important to the formation of extended peapod nanostructures.  The program involves a combination of synthesis/assembly, characterization, and mechanistic studies.  The goals of this effort are to 1) better understand and control the assembly of nanopeapod structures, 2) utilize peapod assembly in directing the formation of intricate composites, 3) extend these efforts to other host materials known to form scrolls, and 4) examine the prospect of reversibility in these assembly processes.  Understanding of the assembly process is being pursued through, for example, investigations of its size and shape selectivity.  Other advances are being developed through property tuning (magnetic, optical and/or electronic) in mixed nanoparticle assemblies.  While the earliest investigations of the group were based on hexaniobate nanosheets, new scroll components are being sought, including isostructural tantalates, layered perovskites, transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene.  Reversibility in scrolling of these structures is being examined as part of a 'capture-release' concept in nanoassembly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Further advances in science will be assisted by the development of nanochemistry involving the assembly of various nanocomponents.  Nanoscale components, where nano is on the length scale akin to slicing a human hair lengthwise into about 10,000 equal segments, are important to the development of faster, lighter, less expensive devices.  Our NSF supported research has focused on producing new nanocomposites from the directed assembly of a combination of nanoparticles and nanosheets.  Here, the particles are captured by the nanosheets as they roll up to produce peapod-like structures (see Figures 1 and 2).   In this program we have studied the methods for making these peapod structures, the mechanism of the formation of the structures, and the properties of the resulting composites.  In terms of intellectual merit, we have produced a series of peapod structures including those with gold, silver, iron oxide, cerium oxide, titanium oxide and platinum nanoparticles and either niobium oxide or vanadium oxide nanosheets (see platinum-niobium oxide nanopeapod example in Figure 2).  While most of the peapods were formed by the capture of nanoparticles during the scrolling process, other peapods have been produced by growth of nanoparticles or insertion of the preformed nanoparticles into preformed scrolls.  Studies of some peapods have included examination of optical and magnetic properties.  In the characterization of the platinum-niobium oxide peapods, we also examined photocatalytic properties; platinum-niobium oxide peapods produce hydrogen gas from water when exposed to visible light. Hydrogen production is of interest due to its use as a clean fuel source, one that does not produce carbon dioxide on combustion.  Other studies in this project have involved the investigation of the mechanism for peapod formation from particles and sheets.  Here we were able to use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to exam a series of samples showing the progression of 1) particle assembly on oxide sheets, 2) nanosheet scrolling with capture of the particles, and 3) nanopeapod release. Figure 3 shows SEM studies involving the assembly of cerium oxide nanoparticles to form peapods and Figure 4 shows the proposed mechanism of peapod formation via the nanoparticle assembly on a nanosheet surface, the capture of the particles on nanopeapod formation, and release of the nanopeapods.  In other studies, we examined the unraveling of the scrolled nanosheets.  This is of interest in that once the nanopeapods are formed, modifications of the nanoparticles ("peas") can be carried out before releasing the modified particles.  (An example of modification could include tethering sets of nanoparticles to make nanorods.)  A series of reagents were studied and the best identified for unscrolling the nanoscroll component.  In terms of broader impact, the greatest contribution of this program is seen in the training of students in science.  A postdoctoral associate, graduate students, and undergraduate students have all received extensive experience in the synthesis and characterization of new nanoscale materials.  This included 1 postdoctoral associate, 4 Ph.D. students, 1 master's student, and 14 undergraduates.   Another significant contribution comes from the materials developed in this study.  Here the greatest impact is seen in the area of catalysis.  We have shown that Pt-niobium oxide peapods are effective in the production of the clean fuel source, hydrogen; this gas is produced photocatalytically in visible light by splitting water.  Additional efforts with collaborators have identified nanopeapod chemical catalysts that help promote coupling reactions between two molecules; this work is important for advancing fine chemicals, like those needed in the development of new pharmaceuticals.
