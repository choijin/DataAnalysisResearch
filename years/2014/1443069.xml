<AbstractNarration>The need for collaborative data analysis increases significantly when confronted with the challenges of big data. Although workflow tools offer a formal way to define, automate, and repeat multi-step computational procedures, designing complex data process workflow requires collaboration from multiple people with complementary expertise.  Existing tools are not suitable to support collaborative design of comprehensive workflows.  To address such a challenge, this project aims to design and develop a software infrastructure with the capability of supporting collaborative data-oriented workflow composition and management, adding a key component to existing NSF cyberinfrastructure that will support big data collaboration through the Internet.  Reproducibility and scalability are two major targets.  The project extends an existing open-source workflow tool, VisTrails, by adding system-level facilities to support human interaction and cooperation that are essential for an effective and efficient scientific collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce five outcomes:&lt;br/&gt;1) A collaborative provenance data model equipped with a graph-level provenance querying formalism;&lt;br/&gt;2) A type-theoretic approach for addressing format transformations;&lt;br/&gt;3) Hypergraph theory-based algorithms for provenance management and mining;&lt;br/&gt;4) A software tool supporting (a)synchronous collaborative scientific workflow design, composition, reproduction, and visualization; and &lt;br/&gt;5) Principles, methodologies, experiences, and lessons that support the development of a generically applicable collaborative scientific workflow composition tool.&lt;br/&gt;The resulting tools will explore the potential for using scientific workflows to accelerate scientific discoveries that require a collaborative effort on big data analytics.  The design of the tools is targeted toward use cases in the civil engineering discipline, but has the potential to broadly impact other areas of science and engineering.  Partnership with VisTrails enables usage and evaluation of the techniques in the VisTrails end user community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Facing the big data challenge, the need for collaborative data analysis increases significantly. Although scientific workflows have become a popular cyberinfrastructure paradigm for accelerating data-driven scientific discovery,  existing scientific workflow management systems lack the infrastructure-level support to collaborative data analysis. To address this need, we have developed the notion of collaborative scientific workflows, which supports two fundamental features:   1) the collaborative composition of scientific workflows at design time;  and   2) the collaborative execution of scientific workflows at run time.   This project focused on the research and development of the first feature, and have produced the following three major outcomes. First, based on a popular scientific workflow system, VisTrails, we have developed the Confucius system. Confucius supports the collaborative composition of scientific workflows at design time. Using a client/server model, multiple scientists may join in a shared session to design scientific workflows collaboratively. Any change (adding/removal/editing of components) made by one partifipating scientist will be immediately reflected on all collaborators' screens.

Moreover, we have defined the notion of  synchronization areas that only allow one author to modify at a time. Locking algorithms have been developed for the long-thinking-short-modification behavior of authors for the efficient modification of synchronization areas.  Second, we have developed  a collaborative workflow composition provenance querying and mining subsystem to allow scientists: 1) to validate a workflow by tracking how a workflow has become as it is from multiple collaborators; 2) to acknowledge credits by recording who has done what at what time; 3) to capture and retrieve collaboration knowledge;  and 4) to form the basis for merging workflow changes from distributed multiple authors.
