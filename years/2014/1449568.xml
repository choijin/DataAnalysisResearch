<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This award to CUNY City College supports research, done under the Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program, on vapor-liquid and gas-liquid systems, as well as granular and colloidal materials. The partnership with the University of Chicago leverages strengths of each institution, coupling theoretical and experimental tools in a useful way.  In addition to producing research, this partnership has been successful at moving minority students into the STEM work force.  Funds in this award will be used to continue graduate student stipends, and to continue undergraduate and REU student support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics associated with heterogeneous materials, which are controlled by multiple forces, is poorly understood. The difficulty is that interactions involve a range of length scales, from single molecules in condensation processes to colloidal patterns in granular materials. This lack of understanding hinders the development of many applications, such as inkjet printers and coating systems. The work funded here couples experimental, theoretical and simulation tools to help understand the controlling forces at a fundamental level.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding supported the continuation of projects supported under the project "PREM: City College-Chicago MRSEC Partnership: Dynamics of Heterogeneous and Particulate Materials".  The focus areas were to maintain support for doctoral students engaged in the project and to continue projects crucial to the visibility of the program.    The funding was used primarily for support of doctoral students.  The funds supported a significant fraction of the stipends for five students, including three women students and one under-represented minority student, on projects which included computational simulation of the dynamics of colloidal dispersions, experimental tool development and analysis of jamming of solid particles, simulation of cohesive particles toward evaluation of yield stress behavior, self-propelled colloidal particles, and drop coalescence phenomena.   Two of these students completed their thesis work during this period of bridge funding, with one going on to an industrial research position and one to post-doctoral research.    In addition to support of the work of these students, travel funds were supplied which allowed both the PI and students to take part in meetings, for example the Society of Rheology meeting,  where the work was shared, feedback was gained, and collaborative interactions were developed.    Support also was used to develop manuscripts that described the work, for publication in technical journals.   Two publications have come from the work to date with several others to follow upon completion of the thesis work of the remaining students.
