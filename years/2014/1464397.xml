<AbstractNarration>As all our data moves to the cloud many new security and privacy concerns arise and traditional cryptographic primitives prove insufficient in such scenarios. A key focus of this research is to advance the state of the art on cryptographic techniques that address these new challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent results on obfuscation, have drastically changed what cryptographers thought as feasible. Applications of obfuscation include very exotic and extremely powerful cryptographic primitives such as, functional encryption for general circuits, secure multiparty computation with optimal communication, deniable encryption and so on. Unfortunately, known realizations of obfuscation, and therefore its applications, rely either on an exponential number of assumptions (basically, one per every pair of circuits), or a polynomial set of assumptions but with an exponential loss in security reduction. The PI plans to develop techniques for circumventing the use of obfuscation in some of its most important applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at:  www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sanjamg</AbstractNarration>

Recent results on program obfuscation have drastically changed what cryptographers saw as feasible on this front. This concept of program obfuscation aims to make computer programs unintelligible while preserving their functionality. Here, the unintelligibility requirement means that the obfuscated program should hide the secrets embedded inside the original program, and the preservation of functionality requirement means that the obfuscated program should be fully executable and have the same input-output behavior as the original program.  Obfuscation has many new applications in cryptography. However, unfortunately, known realizations of obfuscation, and therefore its applications, rely on strong computational intractability assumptions. This project achieved success on three fronts: (1) understanding and improving upon the assumptions needed for realizing program obfuscation methods, (2) realizing several of the important applications of obfuscation directly based on weaker assumption, and (3) improving the efficiency of the known obfuscation methods and several of their applications. Taken together, these efforts take us closer to realizing these technologies in the real world.    In addition to the direct societal benefits that this research will provide, the project also supported the education of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley.
