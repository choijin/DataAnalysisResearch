<AbstractNarration>CBET 1450112&lt;br/&gt;Martin Lopez de Bartodano&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a technical conference entitled Japan-US Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics, which will be held May 10-16, 2015 in West Lafayette, Indiana.  The seminar has been held every four years since 1979 with the location alternating between Japan and the US.  The seminar will bring together leading researchers to discuss their research in multiphase fluid dynamics.  The seminar will consist of a series of plenary and keynote lectures and technical sessions. Participation by junior researchers, postdoctoral students, and graduate students will be encouraged and supported.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Multiphase systems consisting of gas and liquid phases or immiscible liquids pose special challenges to scientists and engineers who analyze them and design equipment to process them.  Theory and simulation worked out for single phase fluids do not apply to multiphase fluid systems owing to the presence of moving, deformable interfaces between fluid phases in multiphase systems.  Nevertheless, multiphase flows are important in many technological, biological, and environmental applications, including processes in the energy, chemical, and nuclear, petroleum and aerospace industries.  The seminar will provide a forum for researchers to discuss theory, simulation, and experimental results that pertain specifically to two-phase systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Japan-U.S. Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics was held at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, May 10-15, 2015. The Seminar has been held approximately every four years, since the first seminar in Kansai, Japan &ndash; 1979,alternating between Japan and the U.S.   The objective of the Japan-U.S. Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics is to bring together senior and junior researchers from these two countries to have in-depth discussions on multiphase flow research.  The timing of the Seminar was very important, because we are finally approaching the development of truly mechanistic two-phase flow models that are comparable to those available for single phase flow.  This is made possible by the development of fine local measurement methods, detailed dynamic modeling of interfacial structures and interfacial transfers and the advancement of CFD.  The US participants were:     USA Organizers: Prof. Mamoru Ishhi, Associate Prof. Martin Bertodano, Purdue University.      USA Program Committee:  Gretar Trygvasson (Notre Dame)  Masahiro Kawaji (City College of New York)  Qiao Wu (Oregon State University)  Xiadong Sun (Ohio State University)     US Delegates, representing a mix of senior and junior researchers other than the seminar organizers already mentioned were:  Arden Bement (Emeritus Professor and Former NSF Director, Purdue University) Suresh Garimella (Distinguished Professor and VP for Research, Purdue University) Victor Ransom (Emeritus Professor, Purdue University) Michael Corradini (Distinguished Professor, University of Wisconsin) Seungjin Kim (Professor, Penn State  University) Yassin Hassan (Professor, Nuclear Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University)  Karen Vierow (Associate Professor, Nuclear Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University) Emilio Baglietto (Associate Professor, MIT) Annalisa Manera (Associate Professor, University of Michigan)    10.  Silvina Cancellos (Assistant Professor, University of Puerto Rico)  11.  Yang Liu (Assistant Professor, Virginia Tech)  12.  Philippe Bardet (Assistant Professor, George Washington University)  13.

The technical sessions covered the following topics:  the dynamic changes to the interfacial structure or flow regime,  local three-dimensional phenomena near the interface detailed CFD of two-phase flow,  dynamic system behaviors and local instabilities, detailed local instrumentation and experiments.   In addition, on Wednesday there was a one day Embedded Workshop on Fukushima, sponsored by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that included eight Presentations and a Panel Discussion. Key people from Japan and the US nuclear reactor licensing agencies attended so the Seminar participants were able to become acquainted with important technical issues of the Fukushima accident.  Forty two papers were distributed to the participants in a Seminar DVD that is available upon request. The Fukushima Workshop presentations were published separately in the printed Repo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
