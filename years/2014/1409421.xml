<AbstractNarration>The scientists have several research goals. The first goal is ?Understanding the causes of the very high speeds and directions of some stars in the outer reaches of our Galaxy?. The second goal is ?Discovering the patters of motions of groups of stars in disk of our Galaxy?. Their final goal is ?Searching for more of the remarkable hypervelocity stars, which are probably ejected from groups of stars, when pairs of stars collide?. These hypervelocity stars are being thrown out of the galaxy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US scientists will observe 8 million Galactic stars from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey, a US-China collaboration. The scientists will give the public lectures, to communicate about the similarities and differences between life in Asia and the US, including insights gained from creating a successful collaboration. Visiting scholars will give presentations for US students on Asian history, culture, language, and lifestyle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hypervelocity stars probe of a wide range of Galactic sciences, on both small and large scales. The number density, velocity, and stellar type distributions of HVSs can reveal the environment around the massive black hole at the center of our Galaxy. Counting the number of hypervelocity stars gives clues to the growth of the central black hole. By measuring the trajectory of these hypervelocity stars, they measured the shape of dark matter halo potential of the Galaxy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported a scientific collaboration (LAMOST-PLUS) between US and Chinese astronomers who analyzing millions of spectra of Milky Way stars that continue to be observed with the Chinese Guoshoujing Telescope (formerly LAMOST).  The entire cost of running the spectroscopic survey, reducing the spectroscopic data, and curating the results was covered by our Chinese collaborators.  The project supported only the US portion of the scientific collaboration to analyze the data.  Travel to the US for Chinese visiting scholars, and to China for US astronomers and students, was supported, along with travel to international conferences and costs of publishing the results.  This project was responsible for the publication of fifteen refereed journal articles, with a combination of US and Chinese authors.  Some of the papers introduced new analysis techniques for determining the physical properties of the stars from their spectra.  In particular, the distances to each of the observed stars was estimated using a Bayesian statistical technique.  This catalog was made widely available so that the research community could use the distances in future studies of our galaxy.   Many of the papers characterized the stars in the stellar halo and disk components of the Milky Way galaxy.  The disk is the part of our galaxy that contains the spiral arms, and the stellar halo is a roughly spherical distribution of stars that surrounds the disk.  The stars in the halo are built up from many small galaxies falling in and being ripped apart by the Milky Way's gravity, spilling their stars into our galaxy.  Several papers characterized the number of components in the halo that were contributed by dwarf galaxies, or analyzed individual components.  The disk of the Milky Way contains stars (like the Sun) that were born from gas that had already been incorporated in the Milky Way.  Several papers characterized the metallicity or kinematic properties of the stars in the disk.  The most important result was the discovery of ripples in the Milky Way disk, which was hailed as one of the top 100 science stories of 2015 by Discover Magazine.  It is possible that these ripples are related to the dwarf galaxies that fall in and spread their stars through the outer parts of our galaxy.  Just as the Milky Way's gravity acts to pull smaller galaxies apart to make the stellar halo, the gravity of the smaller galaxies as they fall in can cause the ripples in the overall structure of the disk.  This interaction between the smaller galaxies and the disk could even cause the spiral structure of our galaxy.  This project was also important in training the next generation of STEM professionals and in educating the public.  One postdoc was trained.  Three Chinese visiting scholars worked with US astronomers for an extended period.  Two graduate students, eight undergraduates, and a high school student conducted individual research projects.  One of the US graduate students was supported through his PhD.  A Chinese graduate student who was a previous visiting scholar with the PI received her PhD in China, with significant collaboration from US astronomers.  The PI, the postdoc, and the students hosted a large number of outreach events including public lectures, weekly public observing at Rensselaer's Hirsch Observatory, and hands-on outreach events.  In addition to the scientific and educational results of this project, support for an international collaboration between US and Chinese astronomers promotes international understanding.  Astronomy is a great platform on which international cooperation can be built, because it involves interchange between educated professionals in each country, but is not sensitive because it does not have immediate commercial or national security implications.  More than a dozen people from each country interacted with each other, and collaborations were established that will last beyond the conclusion of this grant.
