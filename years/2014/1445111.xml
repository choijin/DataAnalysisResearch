<AbstractNarration>PI:  Boppart, Stephen&lt;br/&gt;Instituation: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1445111&lt;br/&gt;EAGER: Smart Phone Platform for Personal High-Resolution 3D Optical Imaging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful outcome of this research project will have a far-reaching and broad impact on many segments of our society. Most significantly, the technology and innovation in this project will enable novel mobile health applications and capabilities that will enable more sophisticated personalized health monitoring for the general public as well as for those in rural or developing regions of our world. This technology, for a number of very common diseases in the ear and skin, will serve as a means for early detection of disease. In addition, after treatment has been prescribed, it will serve for monitoring of the regression or progression of the disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and develop a smart phone platform that enables personal high-resolution 3D optical imaging. In addition to the traditional CCD cameras currently found in every smart phone and used for photography, this platform will implement a low-cost, compact, and portable optical imaging system based on optical coherence tomography (OCT). This self-contained handheld device with a unique set of optical elements will utilize the smart phone light source and camera, as well as its on-board processing and wireless communication hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This group will develop a novel high-resolution 3D optical imaging platform designed for integration into the next-generation of personal smart phones. This platform which is based on low-coherence interferometry is regularly utilized in OCT, and therefore will have widespread applications not only along the medical and biological development paths established by OCT, but also a larger number of other applications because of the compact, portable, low-cost, and virtually ubiquitous nature of the technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we developed a novel high-resolution 3D optical imaging platform designed for integration into the next-generation of personal smart phones. This platform is based on low-coherence interferometry that is regularly utilized in optical coherence tomography (OCT), and therefore has widespread applications not only in the biological sciences established by OCT, but also a larger number of other applications such as materials inspection, quality control in manufacturing, personalized physiological imaging or monitoring, or simply sensing and imaging the world around us in unique, previously un-seen, ways.  Because of the compact, portable, low-cost, and in the future, the potentially ubiquitous nature of the technology, users are likely to find new and imaginative applications as well.  The Intellectual Merit of this project and its outcomes are based on the unique technological innovation and implementation.  Unlike standard OCT technology, this proposed platform does not utilize any moving hardware, can potentially be constructed at costs that are two orders of magnitude less expensive (from $75,000 to $750 list prices) than current OCT systems, and represents an approximate 10-fold reduction in form factor (from 1 m to 10 cm) compared to current OCT systems.  The Broader Impact of this technology and project are significant.  The platform enables depth-resolved axial scanning into samples and specimens for micron-scale precision measurements of layers, boundaries, and sample characterization. By using real-time algorithms with an optical speckle tracking system similar to what is commonly used for position sensing in optical mice for computers, free-hand scanning and image assembly is possible, enabling the acquisition of 2D or 3D images, volumes, or data sets, all without the use of mechanical scanning hardware.  The successful completion of this project has resulted in a hand-held, self-contained, and portable OCT system that can be integrated with smart phones, following the same developmental path as in ultrasound imaging, which progressed from cart-based systems to laptop-based systems and eventually to self-contained hand-held systems.  The outcome of this project is a compact, portable, low-cost, handheld imaging platform that can be constructed for integration into the next-generation smart phone to provide a personal high-resolution 3D optical imaging system for a wide range of novel microscopic imaging applications.
