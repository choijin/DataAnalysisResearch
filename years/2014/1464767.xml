<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for participation of graduate students and young researchers in the Shanks Workshop on Mathematical Aspects of Fluid Dynamics, held at Vanderbilt University, on Saturday February 28, and Sunday, March 1, 2015. The field of fluid dynamics has a long history going back to the works of Bernoulli and Euler. Despite its long history, fluid dynamics continues to be an active and exciting field of research, with many of its fundamental problems still wide open. For instance, the lack of a scientifically satisfactory understanding of turbulent phenomena, and questions regarding the long-time existence of the fundamental equations believed to govern the dynamics, are two well-known examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together some leading researchers in the area of mathematical fluid dynamics, with emphasis on the application of partial differential equations to the study of the problem of fluid motion. The main goal of this workshop is to facilitate discussion and collaboration in a focused setting. In particular, the workshop will provide an ideal opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to interact with experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~disconmm/Shanks-2015/index.php</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The "Shanks Workshop on Mathematical Aspects of Fluid Dynamics" was a two-day  workshop which took place at Vanderbilt University from February 28th to  March 1st, 2015. The workshop had eight speakers representing institutions from  the US, Germany, and Japan. More precisely, the speakers were: Changyou Wang (Purdue University) Irena Lasiecka (University of Memphis) Jan Pr&uuml;ss (Martin-Luther-Universit&auml;t Halle-Wittenberg, Germany) John Hunter (UC Davis) Roberto Triggani (University of Memphis) Ronghua Pan (Georgia Institute of Technology) Xiaobing H. Feng (University of Tennessee at Knoxville) Yoshihiro Shibata (Waseda University, Japan).  Fourteen graduate students and four post-docs from universities other than  Vanderbilt attended the workshop, of which twelve graduaent students and four post-doc requested and were awarded financial support. Vanderbilt students  and faculty also participated.  A poster session was held with contribution  by eleven of the participants from outside universities.  The workshop had a reception at  Vanderbilt's Cohen Hall.  Funding was provided by the Shanks Endowment and the  NSF Award 1464767, here being reported. 70% of Award 1464767 was  used to support graduate students, and 18% of it was used to support post-docs. Funds were complemented by the organizers' NSF Awards 1305705 (Disconzi)  and 1265579 (Simonett), and the Vanderbilt Shanks Endowment. The  workshop  brought together some leading researches in the area of  mathematical fluid dynamics, with emphasis on the application of Partial  Differential Equations to the study of the problem of fluid motion.  The main goal of this workshop was to facilitate discussion and collaboration in  a focused setting, an opportunity that does not present itself in more common,  large attendance conferences on similar topics.  It emphasized different  approaches to problems of common research interests. In particular,  free-boundary and moving-boundary problems were extensively discussed  from a variety of points of view, including, but not restricted to, maximal  regularity, micro-local analysis, energy methods, long-time analysis, and  numerical methods. The talks were all of outstanding quality, and there was intensive participation  by the audience, including many of the graduate students. The topics presented  consisted of very recent and up-to-date results, and therewere many shared  research interests among the participants. The workshop logistics and paper work handling proceeded as planned.  As of now, all necessary reimbursements and payments have been processed.  The attendees were almost unanimous in expressing their high degree of  satisfaction with all aspects of the workshop, including the choice and quality of  mathematical topics discussed, the workshop organization, and the amount  of financial support provided. More details of the workshop can be found on its webpage: http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~disconmm/Shanks-2015          Last Modified: 05/15/2015       Submitted by: Marcelo M Disconzi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
