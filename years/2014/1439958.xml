<AbstractNarration>1439958&lt;br/&gt;Egbert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support for the 22nd International Workshop on Electromagnetic (EM) Induction in the Earth to be held in Weimar, Germany August 24-30, 2014. Funds will be used primarily to support participants (early career faculty, students and postdocs) from the USA, with any residual funds used to support attendees from underdeveloped countries.  The EM workshop will allow for focused presentations and discussion on the methodological advances, including instrumentation, data processing, inversion, and interpretation practice for electromagnetic Earth imaging.  EM measurements provide a unique view of the Earth because of the sensitivity of electrical conductivity to temperature, fluids, ore minerals, and lithologic variations. This sensitivity makes EM methods useful in a wide range of investigations, addressing both applied and basic science questions, from the very near surface to the deep mantle. EM methods are increasingly used for off-shore petroleum exploration and find application to, waste site assessment, aquifer mapping and vulnerability studies, exploration for construction materials, building and utility investigation, and unexploded ordinance (UXO) detection and discrimination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

Retirements over the past decade or so have led to a decline in the number of US students working in this geophysical specialty, just as the importance of EM methods in both basic geological research, and applications in resource industries has increased.  We advertised the availability of funding for young US scientists widely, and gave preference to eligible US participants for support.  As a result, we were able to provide substantial support to all qualifying US applicants. Participation of students in this meeting (significantly enhanced by this grant) is a critical component in developing a new generation of first-rate researchers and applied practitioners.   With an aggressive strategy of advertising availability of funds for US students we have significantly increased participation of US students.   This is likely to pay important dividends down the road with regard to human resources in this important but esoteric geophysical specialty.
