<AbstractNarration>Gang-Yu Liu at the University of California-Davis is supported in an award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program that aims at developing advanced chemistry methodologies for three-dimensional (3D) printing with nanometer precision.  3D printers enable production of objects by custom-design.  Cutting-edge 3D fabrication technology has reached high spatial accuracy, down to 0.3 micrometers.  This project aims at further miniaturizing the technology down to genuine nanometer scale, &lt;100 nm, in all three dimensions (1/800-1/100,000 of human hair). This will be achieved by a very small light source using near-field scanning optical microscopy technology that directs a chemical reaction, such as polymerization on a surface, layer-by-layer, following the scanning trajectory of the probe, and as such producing 3D nanostructures by design.  The work extends current 3D capability into the nanometer region.  The materials produced by 3D nanoprinting provide new opportunities in various fields including optical and electronic devices, catalysis, and biosensor and biodevices where the local environment of active ingredients dictate the subsequent processes and device performance.  Liu and her team plan to continue their outreach effort in working with high school students via UC Davis programs such as the ACS Project SEED program and Young Scholars Program, and with the general public via the Davis Science Center, Nanoexplore program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project takes advantage of the Liu's molecular resolution nanofabrication and imaging technology in 2D, high intensity apertureless near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), and surface chemistry.  Using NSOM to activate a photosensitizer and produce radicals locally, photoinduced thiol-ene click chemistry will be utilized layer-by-layer, following the designed geometry to yield the designed 3D structures.  Unlike currently used 3D printers that enable microlithography, this research takes advantage of NSOM's spatial precision and extends 3D fabrication to the nanometer region.  The goal is to achieve the highest spatial precision and resolution in 3D nanolithography.  Student training includes: (a) precision mechanic movement and feature tracking; (b) high resolution imaging and structure characterization using scanning probe microscopy technology including AFM and apertureless NSOM, (c) advanced skills in computer programing and 3D printing; (d)  surface chemistry at nanoenvironment including absorption, pattern transfer, and desorption, and (e) photopolymerization chemistry with high spatial resolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Three Dimensional Nanolithography via Combined Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscopy and Photopolymerization  3nd Annual Report Covering 07/2016 &ndash; 06//2017  NSF CHE-14137087  PI: Gang-yu Liu  Department of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, CA 95616  3D printers and 3D printing technology are well known to the public and represent one of the fastest growing technologies in additive manufacturing.  However, further miniaturization of 3D printing to nanometer precision represents a significant challenge.  This is due to the requirement of high spatial precision, i.e. nanometers, and difficulties in controlling material delivery at that scale.  This NSF support work addresses these challenges by development of new methodologies and local chemistry.  Technical Merits:  This NSF support work developed advanced technology and methodologies to enable 3D nanoprinting.  The approach is based on the high spatial precision displayed in scanning probe microscopy (SPM).  Today?s scanning probe-based instrumentation, using piezo-based technology, has already enabled precision movement (sub-nanometer), feature tracking (nanometer level drift correction), execution of complex pattern design, and high-resolution imaging. In addition. the team introduced various material delivery methods such as nanofluidic probes into SPM to enable delivery of ultra-small amounts of material.  Various 3D structures were produced from dots, cones, bamboo-shaped cones, stacking cakes, and stacking grids.  The method accommodates a wide range of materials from star polymer, poly-electrolytes, and photopolymerizable precursors.  Broader Impact: This NSF supported research has brought the graduate and undergraduate students involved to the forefront of nanotechnology and nanochemistry.  Training includes: (a) scanning probe microscopy technology including AFM and apertureless near-field optical microscopy; (b) surface chemistry including absorption, pattern transfer, and desorption, (c) photopolymerization chemistry with high spatial resolution, and (d) advanced skills in 3D nanoprinting.  3D nanoprinting holds generic interest for researchers worldwide. With further support, the team plans to complete further development of the advanced software to make it more user friendly.  As such, researchers in the U.S.A. could enjoy the software free of cost, as it is initiated and supported by this NSF grant. The PI?s group currently consists of 1 postdoctoral level researcher, 8 graduate students (4 female), and 2 undergraduate students.  The students are constantly challenged and strongly encouraged to do the very best in their research and education, to be prepared to maintain the leading position of U.S.A. in chemistry research and in R&amp;D in their future career endeavors.  In this grant year alone, the PI graduated 1 PhD student, and one postdoc.  Both have moved on to very successful careers in industry. The PI and team have engaged various outreach activities to introduce 3D nanoprinting to the wider public. Implementation of concepts from frontier fields of science at the undergraduate level to a local community college has provided critically important exposure of new generations of researchers, leaders, and citizens to future technology. 3D nanoprinting has also been introduced to high school students via UC Davis? out reach programs such as the ACS Project SEED program and Young Scholars Program, and to the general public via the Davis Science Center, Nanoexplore program.
