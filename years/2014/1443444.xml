<AbstractNarration>Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation is a key component in setting the global thermohaline (overturning) circulation. Recent studies infer a reduction of the AABW component from reduced volume of AABW entering global deep ocean basins around the Antarctic continent. It is important to obtain better estimates of AABW production rate in its source areas, and to investigate whether the global overturning circulation is slowing down. &lt;br/&gt;The project will continue fieldwork with CTD/LADCP surveys including 2 yearly repeat sections, mooring recoveries and deployments.  Seasonal-interannual variability of CDW intrusion, dense shelf water accumulation and export as well as overflow from the Prydz Bay shelf will also be observed.   &lt;br/&gt;The Prydz Bay- Amery Ice Shelf region has been suggested as a key AABW production site. USAP access to this remote region of the Antarctic continent is challenging. The project will involve fieldwork to be carried out with Danish and Chinese collaboration aboard the Chinese research vessel, Xue Long. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high-resolution regional ocean-sea ice coupled model will be developed to allow time and space continuous three-dimensional ocean state estimation. Both in-situ and remote sensing observations along with the modeling simulation results will be used to investigate&lt;br/&gt;(i) the local atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interaction and shelf processes that produce dense shelf water and &lt;br/&gt;(ii) the dynamic processes that control the shelf water export.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Collaborated with the scientists from the First Institute of Oceanography in China, we conducted two years of hydrographic sampling on board of Chinese icebreaker M/V Xuelong. Despite some un-foreseeing events, such as extremely heavy sea ice and Xuelong?s iceberg accident in 2019, we were able to collect 89 (65 in 2015 and 24 in 2017) temperature/salinity/depth profiles (CTD data) in the Prydz Bay region. We also deployed, recovered/redeployed a Lamont mooring that measures temperature, salinity, and current in the Prydz Channel during this project. The project made the project-related oceanic data publicly available at NOAA National Centers for Environment Information (NCEI), which includes 154 quality-controlled CTD data collected in the region from 2012 to 2015 and 3-year mooring current meter data. If we can recover the Lamont mooring in the field season 2020, we will have six years of time series at the Prydz Channel, which will be extremely valuable for studying the mechanisms governing the shelf water export in the East Antarctic. These data not only contribute to our studies in the region but also add new information to the international oceanic data centers, which benefit to broader scientific investigations in this polar region.</p> <p>Scientific outcomes from the project include the possible mechanisms that lead to the seasonal to interannual variations of shelf water density in the Prydz Bay region. Anomalous surface wind patterns likely lead to changes in the ocean circulation on the continent shelf, consequently influence the volume of ice shelf water outflow and the resident time of glacier meltwater on the shelf region. These changes would result in the interannual variability of the shelf water density, consequently influencing the shelf water export at the Prydz Bay. The intensified westerly also allows mesoscale eddies to break the Antarctic Slope Front, transferring the heat on to the shelf region. The mooring data revealed the tidal characteristics in the area for the first time. The north-south oriented principal axes of tidal ellipses suggest that tidal processes likely contribute to transferring heat into the cavity of the Amery Ice Shelf, resulting in the basal melt. These&nbsp;<em>in situ&nbsp;</em>observations also supported the development of a regional ocean-sea ice coupled model at North Carolina State University (NCSU). The scientists from NCSU have completed the model construction and produced six years of high-resolution model output from 2010 to 2015. These model outputs have been used to investigate the role of ocean mixing in changing the density of shelf water in this region. During the project period, PI also worked on sea ice variability and freshwater budget in the Amundsen Sea, tropical-polar teleconnection, and cloud?s impact on Antarctic sea ice in austral winter.
