<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Explanation of the project's broader significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the processes that shape the Earth's surface and their associated landforms has been dominated by field-based research, yet the scales of time and space over which landscape processes operate often are very large and pose difficult challenges.  Experimental facilities and physical analogues can compress time and shrink scale to examine more closely the dynamics of these systems.  This award supports the 46th annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium, entitled "Laboratory Experiments in Geomorphology."  The symposium will bring together a strong and diverse group of leading experts and emerging scientists actively engaged in experimental geomorphic research.  Eight themes have been selected based on important phenomena, and the contributors have been asked to highlight the unique capabilities of their facilities and how their experimental research may transform the study of Earth-surface processes. The broader implications of the symposium include the promotion and enhancement of the education of future science professionals, the fostering of diversity within the discipline, and the discussion of topics having relevance to society, such as landslides and river restoration.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 46th annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium will provide a concentrated opportunity for the exhange of ideas among researchers actively engaged in experimental geomorphic research.  Eight themes have been selected based on significance to advancing the knowledge of Earth-surface processes and how experimental research in these areas may transform the discipline of geomorphology.  The intellectual merit of this symposium is three-fold.  First, the symposium provides a prominent forum for scientists to present, exchange, and disseminate methods, techniques, and results on geomorphic research to the global community.  Second, because of its size and focus, the symposium offers an unrivalled opportunity to engage actively in discussion with a broad range of scientists linked not necessarily by a research focus, but by a methodological approach, which in this case is laboratory experimentation.  Third, all papers presented orally at the symposium will be published in the internationally-recognized journal Geomorphology, which ensures the effective transfer of knowledge to the broader science community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal secured funds to support the 46th Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS), entitled "Laboratory Experiments in Geomorphology," which was held from September 18-20, 2015 at the University at Buffalo.  The symposium brought together leading experts and emerging scientists actively engaged in experimental geomorphic research.  The total number of participants for the symposium was 73, which included 34% women and 66% men, 38% students and 62% professionals, and 26% international and 74% domestic attendees.  The international participants represented seven countries (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Taiwan).  The funds secured by NSF were used to partially support expenses related to venue and logistics, registration services, travel and accommodation for invitees, publication costs, meals, and student travel.  Given the focus of the symposium, the co-organizers arranged a pre-meeting fieldtrip comprised of a tour and hands-on demonstration of the experimental facilities at the University at Buffalo.  The oral portion of the symposium included a brief welcome by the Dean of the College of Arts for the University at Buffalo, two 45-minute keynote presentations (Gerard Govers and Chris Paola), and sixteen (16) 30-minute presentations by invitees (Joseph Atkinson, Lucy E. Clarke, Joanna C. Curran, David J. Furbish, Alison Graettinger, Fabien Graveleau, Neal R. Iverson, Richard M. Iverson, Maarten G. Kleinhans, Michael P. Lamb, Brandon McElroy, Heidi Nepf, Luke Pangle, Jeff Peakall, Keld R. Rasmussen, and Elowyn M. Yager).  In addition, thirty-three (33) posters were presented by select participants.  The BGS historically has had much intellectual merit for its existence and it has had many broader implications to the scientific community.  These attributes have contributed substantially to the critical acclaim, international brand, and continued success and relevance of the symposium series.  The intellectual merit of the symposium included the following: (1) the symposium provided a prominent forum for scientists to present, exchange, and disseminate methods, techniques, and results on geomorphic research to the global community; (2) the symposium offered an unrivalled opportunity to engage actively in discussion with a broad range of scientists linked not necessarily by a research focus but by a methodologic approach, which in this case is laboratory experimentation; and (3) select papers presented orally were published in the internationally-recognized journal Geomorphology, which ensures the effective transfer of technology to the global community.  The broader implications of the symposium included the following: (1) the symposium promoted and enhanced graduate student education and participation; (2) the organizers fostered and promoted diversity within the discipline by carefully selecting the list of invitees; and (3) the symposium addressed topics of great importance and relevance to society.  The primary product from the symposium was the publication of select papers (13 in total) written in support of the symposium and published as a special issue of the journal Geomorphology (Volume 244, Pages 1-204, 2015).  These papers were edited by Sean J. Bennett, Peter Ashmore and Cheryl McKenna Neuman.  Publications arising from the Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium have had a tremendous impact on the discipline.  Approximately 25% of the top 40 most-cited papers ever published in the journal Geomorphology were prepared for, and presented at, the BGS.  This is further evidence of the enormous impact the BGS has had on the discipline and the potential for significant technology transfer.
