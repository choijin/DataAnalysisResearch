<AbstractNarration>Having passion and perseverance for long-term goals or the drive to achieve is potentially important to individuals trying to achieve the challenging, long-term goal of attaining an engineering  degree, which requires not only talent but also focused and sustained application over a long period. This project is investigating the role of active learning in building passion and perseverance through a longitudinal observational research design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of their natural progression through the curricula, students have widely varying experiences along the active-learning continuum, from low quantity and quality, to high. This highly diverse engineering-learning ecology presents a unique opportunity to study the association between active learning and the growth of passion and perseverance. This project is developing a smartphone application (app) for participants to measure the quantity and quality of active learning they experience. These data, along with extensive measures of other psychological traits and student achievement, are elements of a model that will clarify the relationship between active learning, passion and perseverance growth, and student achievement. Results from this study potentially will improve the retention and graduation rates of all STEM students.</AbstractNarration>

Grit is theorized to develop as a result of (1) a growth mindset, (2) optimism, and (3) deliberate practice.  Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence is malleable, rather than being a fixed quantity.  Its suspected role in enabling grit growth comes from studies that demonstrated a growth mindset encouraged children to see adversities as opportunities to grow, rather than evidence of low abilities.  That optimism is important to building grit comes from a study of novice teachers placed in under-resourced public schools:  The most successful teachers were those who are the most optimistic.  In this project the focus is on active learning -- evidence-based instructional practices that mimic deliberate practice.  Prior studies demonstrated conclusively that deliberate practice mediated between grit and achievement in the context of Spelling Bee contestants, and we believe it will apply in the engineering-learning context as well.  Deliberate practice has well defined characteristics.  First, it involves activities designed to improve specific aspects of performance.  Second, the activities include the provision of continuous feedback to the participant.  Third, it can be repeated often.  Finally, it is very mentally demanding, which could result in the activities being not inherently pleasant.  These characteristics are closely aligned with those of active learning.
