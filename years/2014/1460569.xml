<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) of Michigan State University (MSU), Hickory Corners, MI, will support the training of 10 students over 11 weeks during the summers of 2015- 2017.  The program focuses on the ecological and evolutionary processes that drive responses in plant, animal and microbial systems to global change. Students will work with resident KBS faculty that have affiliated positions in departments of Zoology (Integrative Biology), Plant Biology, Plant Soil and Microbial Sciences, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Animal Science at MSU.  Students will collaborate with their mentor to design a project that takes advantage of the diverse habitats around KBS and long term experiments set up to test hypotheses about how climate change may impact agricultural systems. Students will participate in weekly professional development seminars that address scientific best practices, preparation for graduate training, preparation for scientific employment and training in data management and analysis. Recruitment will target students from under-represented groups or attending institutions with limited research opportunities. The on-line application process is designed to identify highly motivated students and relies on multiple factors, including writing skills and life experiences.  Program coordinators will identify appropriate candidates and will forward these to mentors who will conduct interviews with applicants whose skills and experience best match their research. The program will be assessed by using the common assessment tool used by REU programs (URSSA SALG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The students will live in residence at KBS, and will interact daily with resident faculty, graduate students and postdocs, who conduct research on a broad range of ecological and evolutionary topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

REUs also worked with their mentors and KBS staff to write blog posts about their experience as a KBS REU that were posted on the REU program and main KBS websites.  Our recruiting efforts focused on attracting a diverse, qualified,and  motivated pool of applicants that would include students from under-represented groups in STEM.  Students attending institutions with limited research opportunities (community colleges and other institutions without PhD programs in ecology/evolutionary biology related fields) and first-generation students were a priority for selection.  Close to 100% of students recruited to the program fell into at least one of the above categories: women and students that self-identified as from a group(s) underrepresented in STEM fields accounted for more than 50% of the participants recruited to the program.   More than half of the students that participated in the program presented their research at regional, national, and international conferences.  Funding from MSU supported graduate students to attend a national meeting with their REU to present a poster or talk. Mentors and the KBS Academic Program coordinator worked with REUs and mentors to get funding to support travel to these meetings. This included four students who were ESA (Ecological Society of America) SEEDS fellows and two who attended an international conference in Qutar (supported by NSF) on undergraduate research related to climate change. To date, five REUs from this cohort have published peer-reviewed papers with their mentors and several others are in preparation.  A survey of the 2015 and 2016 cohorts revealed that all of the REUs had continued in their STEM degrees and 50% of those that had graduated were pursuing a PhD.
