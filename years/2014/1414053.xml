<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a variable displacement adjustable linkage pump to commercial application to fill the need for a hydraulic pump with high efficiency at low volumetric displacement.   The project will result in a functional prototype of a multi-cylinder variable displacement linkage pump. This adjustable linkage pump has the following novel features: 1) it uses low friction pin joints, 2) it can reach true zero displacement, 3) the piston reaches the same top dead center position regardless of the displacement, and 4) it can pump corrosive fluids.  These features improve efficiency and allow the pump to be used in a wide range of applications and environments, when compared to market leading variable displacement hydraulic pumps.  This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: constructing a dynamic model of the pump, constructing a framework for multi-domain multi-objective optimization of machines with mechanisms and applying the method to optimize the pump for water pumping applications, and designing and testing a multi-cylinder prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project engages CAT Pumps, a leader in fixed displacement linkage pump manufacturing, to aid in the design for manufacturing and prototyping process. They will give guidance on customer requirements in this technology translation effort from research discovery towards commercial reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The variable displacement linkage pump is a disruptive technology for fluid power and fluid conveyance markets by providing a broadly applicable highly efficient variable displacement pump.  The energy savings from the use of the highly efficient pump directly result in a reduction in fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, the pump can easily operate with water, which enables the fluid power industry to transition to environmentally friendly water hydraulics, eliminating damaging oil leaks and spills.  In addition, there is a projected $15-30M in revenue over the next four years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the fluid power and fluid conveyance markets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, a functional prototype of a variable displacement linkage pump was modeled, optimized, designed, and demonstrated in a high pressure water pumping application.  This novel pump architecture is highly efficient across a wide range of operating conditions and can pump a variety of fluids.  The pump mechanism uses an adjustable six-bar linkage to change the piston displacement, allowing continuous piston stroke variability down to zero.  A dynamic model of the pump was constructed that captures the kinematics and kinetics of the linkage, fluid dynamics in the piston-cylinder interface, dynamics of the check valves, and flow dynamics through the manifolds.  This model was used to predict the volumetric and mechanical efficiency, as well as the flow and pressure ripple of the pump.  A multi-domain multi-objective optimization of the pump was performed for the application of high-pressure water pumping for pressure washer applications.  The detailed design of an inline three-cylinder linkage pump was completed.  Innovations of the mechanical design included: 1) double shear joints to reduce out-of-plane deflection, 2) a multi-piece split crankshaft for easy manufacturing and assembly, 3) a split connecting rod for easy bearing installation, and 4) positive elastomer seals with ceramic piston for water compatibility.  A prototype pump was fabricated and assembled.  Efficiency maps and pressure ripple data were experimentally generated on a test stand, demonstrating good model agreement.  In collaboration with our industry partner, a pressure-compensation automatic displacement control system was modeled, designed, and manufactured.  The displacement control system demonstrated good tracking of a flow rate square wave function, with a response time of 0.13 sec.  In addition to the technical tasks, the team performed extensive market research to identify market opportunities for future commercialization, infusing an entrepreneurial mindset into an academic project.  The variable displacement linkage pump has the opportunity to be paradigm shifting in the hydraulics and fluid transfer markets due to the high efficiency across a wide range of operating conditions and ability to pump a variety of fluids.
