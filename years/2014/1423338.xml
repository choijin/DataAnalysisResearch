<AbstractNarration>While low-income and minority communities suffer disproportionately from poor environmental conditions, members of these communities tend to be under-represented in participatory scientific projects and informal science learning opportunities. There are many benefits to community-driven STEM projects, both for individuals' experiential learning and for the betterment of communities. Expanding participation also contributes to a more complete understanding of complex environmental problems, including STEM content and skills. This project engages members of racially and economically diverse communities in identifying and carrying out environmental projects that are meaningful to their lives, and adapts technology known as NatureNet to assist them. NatureNet, which encompasses a cell phone app, a multi-user, touch-based tabletop display and a web-based community, was developed with prior NSF support. Core participants involved in programs of the Anacostia Watershed Society in Washington, D.C., and Maryland, and the Reedy Creek Nature Preserve in Charlotte, NC, will work with naturalists, educators, and technology specialists to ask scientific questions and form hypotheses related to urban waterway restoration and preservation of native species. They will then collect and analyze data using NatureNet, requesting changes to the technology to customize it as needed for their projects. Casual visitors to the nature centers will be able to interact with the environmental projects via the tabletop, and those who live farther away will be able to participate more peripherally via the online community. This study is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project, led by researchers from the University of Maryland, College Park,  with collaborators from the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and the University of Colorado, Boulder, will provide answers to two questions: 1) How do community-driven informal environmental learning projects impact participants, including their motivation to actively participate in science issues via technology and their disposition toward nature preserves and scientific inquiry, and 2) What are the key factors (e.g., demographic composition of participants, geographical location) that influence the development of community-driven environmental projects? Researchers will gather extensive qualitative and quantitative data to understand how community projects are selected and carried out, how participants approach technology use and adaptation, and how informal learning and engagement on STEM-related issues can be fostered over a period of several months and through iterative project cycles. Data will be collected through motivation questionnaires; focus groups; interviews; tabletop, mobile, and website interaction logs; field notes from participatory design and reflection sessions; and project journals kept by nature preserve staff. Through extensive research, iterative design, and evaluation efforts, researchers will develop an innovative model for community-driven environmental projects that will deepen informal science education by demonstrating how members of diverse communities connect environmental knowledge and scientific inquiry skills to the practices, values, and goals of their communities, and how technology can be used to facilitate such connections.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      This project engages members of economically and racially diverse communities in identifying and carrying out environmental projects that are meaningful to their own lives and their local communities, using and adapting a novel social-technical platform called NatureNet (NN) to assist them. The NN platform encompasses mobile apps for iOS and Android phones and a website (nature-net.org). Compared to traditional approach to conducting citizen science projects through technology, NatureNet is unique because it crowdsources its own design based on requests from the citizen scientists themselves. By seeking to empower a traditionally underrepresented group in citizen science, this project is able to incorporate the communities' voices into the design and development of NatureNet. This approach taken by NatureNet is grounded in the Community-Driven Environmental Projects (C-DEP) model. Unlike many citizen science projects, where the citizen’s role is limited to data collection and/or analysis to address a researcher-developed question, C-DEPs are initiated by community members with the aim of driving concrete changes in a community. CDEPs often incorporate elements fro citizen science and civic activism. Being localized, CDEPs aim to identify and respond to factors that may be missed in projects with larger study scopes, and they are particularly useful for gathering knowledge to support actions. The data obtained by this study includes hundreds of design ideas produced by participants using NatureNet, hundreds of Github issues from the research team, dozens of design presentations of NatureNet from Spring 2016 to Fall 2018, interviews, focus groups, and journals. Regarding informal science education, this project advanced our knowledge in three ways. First, it studied how community-driven informal environmental learning projects influence participants, including their motivation to actively participate in science issues via technology and their disposition toward nature preserves and scientific inquiry. Second, it investigated several key factors that influence the development of community-driven environmental projects, including the demographic composition of participants, geographical location, and NatureNet usage.Third, it identified barriers to participating and/or leading citizen science projects in communities at local nature centers and offered recommendations for techniques and technology design features that can encourage community engagement in environmentally sustainable projects.
