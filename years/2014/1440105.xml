<AbstractNarration>This award provides three years of support and related administrative expenses for engaging U.S. radio scientists, including the U.S. National Committee (USNC), in the International Union of Radio Science (URSI).  This includes affecting and guiding URSI scientific programs, helping to develop U.S. candidates for URSI leadership through involvement with commissions, and meeting the nation's responsibility to support URSI by paying dues.  URSI is a non-governmental, non-profit scientific union devoted to scientific and technological developments across radio science disciplines.  It has 46 member countries, and is one of the scientific unions that adhere to the International Council for Science.  URSI covers numerous areas of interest within the radio science discipline, including radio astronomy, materials science, physics, remote sensing, geosciences, and space sciences.  It stimulates and coordinates studies in the fields of radio, telecommunications, and electronic sciences, fostering international communications and collaborations through its ten commissions.  The USNC organizes a yearly conference in the U.S., and oversees the U.S. participation in international URSI activities.  URSI activities support the development and training of students and postdocs in numerous radio science activities, in both science and engineering, and help to develop the future leaders in the field.  They promote better U.S. understanding of international perspectives, policy and culture, linking the U.S. radio science community and U.S. research to a wider international context.  These activities are essential for effective U.S. international programs and policy-making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report USNC-URSI:  Engaging U.S. Radio Scientists in the International Union of Radio Science (URSI) NSF Award # 1440105  November 2018  The International Union of Radio Science (URSI) is a non-governmental, non-profit international scientific union that serves as a valuable resource to the world's scientific and policy community.  URSI's main objective is to stimulate and coordinate studies in the fields of radio, telecommunications, and electronic sciences.  It fosters international communications and collaborations through meetings and publications, and studies of common interest.  In addition, URSI develops physical standards and promotes common nomenclature and measurements.  URSI's ten commissions establish and carry out the scientific priorities of the union.  The National Academy of Science (NAS) is the U.S. adhering body to URSI.  The United States National Committee for URSI (USNC-URSI) is the standing committee at NAS that represents the United States in the union.  USNC-URSI's structure is set to promote seamless interactions between the national and international URSI Commissions, as well as between the USNC and the union.      INTELLECTUAL MERIT  The NAS has fulfilled the nation's financial responsibilities to URSI through the payment of dues.  This award supported all three years (2016, 2017, and 2018) of URSI dues enabling the United States to remain as an active member of the union and for U.S. researchers to remain engaged scientifically.  Currently (2017-2020), two Americans are playing a leadership role in URSI: Prof. Piergiorgio Uslenghi is one of the four Vice-Presidents of URSI, and Dr. W. Ross Stone serves as Assistant Secretary of General Publications for URSI.  Also, the following U.S. experts are chairing URSI commissions from 2017-2020:  Zaghloul, A. - Commission C; Chandrasekar, V. - Commission F, Doherty, P. - Commission G; and Bradley, R. - Commission J.      The second goal of the award focused on engaging with U.S. radio scientists to impact and guide URSI scientific programs of interest and importance to the United States.  In order to tackle this goal, the USNC-URSI held the National Radio Science Meeting in 2016, 2017, and 2018 in Boulder, CO.  As part of these meetings, the committee has awarded an average of 110 travel fellowships to undergraduate and graduate students in the United States where they have exposed them to URSI and its commissions.  Also, the U.S. commissions have met and the USNC-URSI assisted in organizing the North American Radio Science meeting and the IEEE/USNC-URSI Radio Science meetings.  This has led to active participation at the national and international level of U.S. scientists in URSI-related radio science research projects, collaborative activities, or working groups.  Furthermore, URSI and the USNC-URSI awarded travel fellowships to U.S. early careers to support their participation in the URSI Congress (GASS).        BROADER IMPACT  The broader impact on this award links the U.S. radio science community and U.S. research to a wider international context, community, and networks.  Additional benefits include increased opportunities for international collaboration and better U.S. understanding of international perspectives, policy, and culture.  All of these are essential for effective U.S. international programs and policy-making.  Finally, the USNC-URSI promoted strong and diverse participation in important URSI scientific meetings and programs.        The third goal of this project focused on involving U.S. radio scientists in leadership positions in USNC-URSI and its ten commissions.  As a result, the USNC-URSI has organized travel fellowships, student paper competitions, and mentoring luncheons.  The attendance to the mentoring luncheon is now mandatory for every early career receiving a USNC-URSI travel grant.  As a result, early career scientists understand better URSI's commission structure and the research each commission supports.  Students are encouraged to participate in USNC-URSI commissions and attend their business meetings.  The USNC-URSI has developed an early career membership category to promote their involvement.  As a result, the number of early career scientists involved in each U.S. commission has increased; in addition, more Americans are now chairing URSI commissions.
