<AbstractNarration>The purposes of this study are to promote and understand how undergraduate students learn foundational biology ideas in introductory biology courses. It will implement and study an innovative approach, which has students learn biological explanations by modeling phenomena as biologists do. The approach directs students to think about structures, behaviors and functions in nature, and to write these out and discuss them. This study will explore in detail student reasoning while they do this and how they learn. The project has potential not only to advance the field's ability to measure student competencies that are valued in recent science education standards documents (e.g., NGSS), but also to advance the field's understanding of how student "modeling ability" develops in a particular discipline. In this way, it can provide an important foundation for other research on the learning of modeling practices in science. Moreover, because the innovations take place in an introduction to biology course and introduction to biology is required for a large number of college majors, the project can be transformative for a large number of students across the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will be conducted in a pre-designed undergraduate biology course across four universities, two public and two private, serving diverse populations. The aims are: (1) propose systems thinking skills needed by biology students, by (a) getting feedback from academics, and reviewing; (2) to examine more closely student thinking during their activities by (a) recording group discussions, (b) conducting clinical interviews with a subset of students, and (c) collecting student drawings in response to different prompts than they have used previously that help the instructors better understand what students are thinking; (3) conduct open-ended comparisons between other assessments and their assessments of student models; (4) compare outcomes when students are provided different visual representations as feedback (split-plot design); and (5) make comparisons between different demographic groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to encourage students to think more like scientists and less like science students, we have built curricula and instructional approaches that engage students in building, evaluating, and refining conceptual models of scientific processes, systems, and phenomena.  Modeling is a foundational practice in STEM and a core competency in most science education frameworks. Our previous research focused on analyzing constructed models as representations of students? thinking about biological systems.  In this work, we sought to unpack the behaviors, mechanisms, and cognitive practices that underlie students? abilities to use, construct, and reason with those models.  In particular, we were interested in the potential of Systems Thinking to serve as a unifying framework to cohere the suite of skills and competencies necessary for model-based learning.  Outcome 1: Research methods and findings related to Systems Thinking (ST). Constructs such as ST and other cross-cutting concepts are represented in vast bodies of literature that cross multiple disciplines. This makes traditional approaches to literature reviews impractical as ways to explore and extract meaning from primary sources. We adapted bibliographic and data science methods to describe co-citation networks as an approach for identifying key literature and peer-recognized ideas with the greatest potential to inform understanding.  In applying this approach to the ST literature we were able to (a) identify significant research communities that have contributed to our understanding of ST, (b) analyze and summarize the specific contributions of these communities to the definition and evolution of ST, (c) inform development of a tentative ST framework for undergraduate biology education, and (d) reveal patterns in cross-discipline communication in ST literature.  Importantly, we discovered that science education was relatively isolated and showed a greater propensity to cite within-community in comparison to other fields that have published extensively on ST.  Outcome 2: Research findings about model-based learning. We conducted in situ classroom studies (n&gt;200 students) along with a long-term (&gt;1 year) clinical interview study that together, contribute to existing theory about model-based learning. Significant outcomes include: (a) a framework for analyzing students? approaches to modeling based on deep and surface approaches to learning, (b) findings that expand our understanding about the influences of prompt contextual features in shaping students? reasoning about biological phenomena, such as evolution and central dogma, (c) a framework for interpreting students? perceptions about the attributes of scientific models, and (d) findings that suggest students? prior achievement does not adequately predict model-based performance. Specifically, we have observed that students characterized as ?middle-achievers? by conventional academic metrics showed greater retention of concepts and model-based skills in comparison to their higher- and lower-performing peers.  Broader Impacts: This project has produced numerous opportunities for synergisms with existing efforts to conduct education research, transform science courses, and provide professional development at multiple scales.
