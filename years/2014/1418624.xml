<AbstractNarration>The Navier-Stokes-Darcy model is crucial to accurately describe many important real world problems, such as the flow problems in vuggy/fractured porous media, groundwater systems in karst aquifers, interaction between surface and subsurface flows, and industrial filtrations. The efficiency of the numerical methods to solve this model is very important for the large-scale applications. But most of the related published works focus on a simpler model, which is not accurate for many applications since it does not consider several crucial realistic factors. This project is to study a more realistic Navier-Stokes-Darcy model and design an efficient numerical method to solve it in parallel. The completion of this project will provide large advances in the study of the coupled fluid flow and porous media flow. The basic idea and framework of this project have potential to be applied to other interesting multi-physics coupling problems. This project provides undergraduate and graduate students many valuable training opportunities in the development of new methods and packages, mathematical analysis, and engineering applications. The methods under development will be applied to simulate the flow in vuggy/fractured porous media. The investigators plan to disseminate the methods and software packages to more engineers and scientists by presenting the work in professional conferences and colloquia and organizing special sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to carry out a systematic research on the development, analysis, and application of a non-iterative multi-physics domain decomposition method for the Navier-Stokes-Darcy model with the Beavers-Joseph (BJ) interface condition and defective boundary conditions. The proposed non-iterative multi-physics domain decomposition method enables us to efficiently and simultaneously deal with the significant difficulties arising from the interaction among the aforementioned crucial realistic factors. The key ideas include a non-iterative algorithm with a direct prediction on the interface, a multi-physics decomposition with Robin conditions arising from the three physical interface conditions which include the BJ condition, and the Lagrange multiplier method to deal with the defective boundary condition. The major difficulty is the inherent interaction of the nonlinear advection, BJ condition, parameters in the Robin-Robin decomposition, and the saddle point problem arising from the Lagrange multiplier method.</AbstractNarration>

We also analyzed the convergence of the proposed non-iterative MPDDM, which provide a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed method.     Among the important applications mentioned above, we applied the model and numerical method of this project to the application of flow in fractured porous media and around a multi-stage fractured horizontal wellbore.  We also illustrate the effect of different parameters on the flow performance and production rate of the multi-stage fractured horizontal wellbore.     In order to make the results of this project more applicable for different types of real world applications which have different specific additional needs, we also developed several new mathematical models and numerical methods for considering dual porosity, two-phase flow, mass conservation, and uncertainty in the target model of this project.     The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Missouri University of Science and Technology is in the process of building a research emphasis in applied and computational mathematics. Missouri Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematical Sciences is also being built and expanded at Missouri University of Science and Technology.  Funding for this project promoted these initiatives and enhanced the relatively small amount of computational mathematics research in the state of Missouri. Specifically, the PI used project funding to recruit, support, and help training a Ph.D. student.  The funding enabled the graduate student to make great progress in research, which is reported in three papers.     With the supplement support of this project, an outstanding senior high school student, who was also enrolled as a non-degree student at Missouri University of Science and Technology, received a systematic training from the PI for the finite difference methods of ordinary differential equations, based on the elementary differential equation course he took with the PI. The student also took a coding course and then developed his own code package of several finite difference methods for solving the system of ordinary differential equations arising from the proposed method of this project. All of these significantly enhanced the student?s intuition, foundation, and view for scientific computing.     Furthermore, the unique training and working experience with petroleum engineers helped the involved students well understand the dynamic interaction between what they learn in computational mathematics and what they need for realistic engineering problems, hence greatly benefit these future applied mathematicians and engineers, whose work will be tightly associated with realistic applications.
