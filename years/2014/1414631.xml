<AbstractNarration>With the increasing impacts of global climate change, coral reefs are among the most sensitive ecosystems on the planet. Providing endless goods and services, coral reefs are an integral part of marine ecosystems. Most studies focus on predicting how climate will affect corals in the future. This project will look to the past for insight on how corals handled historic changes in climate by taking coral cores in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Hironobu Kan at Kyushu University. Dr. Kan will provide necessary equipment for analyses as well as access to the field where cores will be extracted. These 4-m sections of the Holocene reef framework will give a multi-millennial record of reef development in the Western Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project will be the window from 4-2 thousand years before present, when a hiatus in reef accretion occurred in others areas of the Pacific. Using a simple, open-barrel, hand-operated coring method, 4-meter cores will be extracted from unconsolidated reefs and further divided into 5 cm intervals. These intervals will be analyzed by species and taphonomic condition to determine the ecological changes on the reef through time. Using a combination of paleoecological and geochemical techniques, a reconstruction of Holocene sea temperature, salinity, coral accretion, and changes in species dominance on the reefs of the Ryukyu Islands during the Holocene will be created. These data will be compared to data collected from cores extracted off Pacific Panama and Kiritimati Island of the Line Islands. This comparison will provide a much clearer understanding of coral growth across the Pacific during the Holocene. Furthermore, this detailed coral-based geochemical reconstruction from the Ryukyu Islands will give insights into how climatic and oceanographic conditions varied through time at this location and how corals have reacted to those changes. These reactions may help estimate how corals will respond to the current global climate changes. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  There have been several late Holocene millennial scale hiatuses in coral growth in areas across the entire Pacific; from Panam&aacute; and Costa Rica to Australia and Japan during the late Holocene. These hiatuses have been shown to last from several hundred to several thousand years in duration. The Japanese hiatus was found at Kodakarajima, in the northern Ryukyu Islands. The study site for this project was Kumejima in the Okinawa Islands (Central Ryukyus). Kumejima is located in the subtropical western Pacific, a great comparison to our other study sites in tropical, Pacific Panam&aacute;. With my host researcher Dr. Hironobu Kan, at Kyushu University, a push-core method was used. Three cores were extracted with each extraction ranging from 156&ndash;239 cm. Each core was cut in half lengthwise, on a band saw. One of those halves is archived at Dr. Kan's lab and the other is separated into 5-cm sections. Each 5-cm section is then sorted by species and taphonomic condition (condition of the external and internal skeleton). Radiocarbon-dating is being used to measure rates of reef accretion as well as detection of any hiatus in reef growth.   Currently, each cores' bottom section has been radiocarbon-dated to determine the oldest age of the core. The coresÆ ages range from 3.1-3.4 Kypb (thousand years before present). These dates occur during one of the hiatuses observed at Kodakarajima, suggesting that there was either no hiatus at Kumejima or it was shorter than those observed elsewhere. Using these same radiocarbon-dates, accretion rates were calculated for the cores collected from Kumejima to be 0.60 m/1000 years. This rate of accretion is slow compared to other sites in the Pacific. This slow bulk accretion points to either the existence of a hiatus or overall slow reef growth at this site.   The cores collected from Kumejima are still being analyzed at the fellow's home institution, the Florida Institute of Technology. Upon conclusion of this study, we will have a much clearer picture of how coral growth has changed in Kumejima over the last 3,400 years. This study will be part of a comparison to reef growth in Pacific Panam&aacute; during the late Holocene.
