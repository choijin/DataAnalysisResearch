<AbstractNarration>In this project, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow aims to develop a process-based understanding of the physical and biological dynamics that control primary and export production in the ocean. The focus of the research is on the physical and biological dynamics in submesoscale fronts and eddies and, in particular, on the effects of realistic high-frequency winds on these dynamics. Improved understanding of these dynamics will contribute to a better understanding of the global carbon cycle. This project builds a truly intellectual and cross-disciplinary collaboration between the fellow and sponsoring scientists, John Taylor, University of Cambridge, and Marina Levy, University Pierre et Marie Curie. This award was supported with funding from the Office of International and Integrative Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year, oceanic microbes convert about fifty Pg of inorganic carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide) into organic carbon, accounting for about half of all primary production on the planet. This organic carbon then forms the trophic base of the entire marine ecosystem. Moreover, perhaps a quarter of the organic carbon created is exported to the deep ocean, where it may remain sequestered from the atmosphere for centuries. However, these biogeochemical dynamics are substantially modified by the heterogeneous physics of the upper ocean, which is characterized by a virtual spider web of fronts and eddies and regularly modified by persistent and variable atmospheric forcing. In global ocean and earth system models, these dynamics occur at scales smaller than a grid cell, therefore it is essential to understand and parameterize these dynamics. In pursuit of this effort, the fellow will use numerical models at multiple levels of complexity to explore three key questions: 1) How do realistic high-frequency winds affect primary and export production in ocean fronts and eddies? 2) What physical, biological and chemical mechanisms control the dynamics in these environments and how sensitive are the results to different parameters? 3) How do fronts and eddies modify biological community composition? This research will help lay the groundwork for improved parameterizations of upper ocean physics and biogeochemistry. Understanding and parameterizing these dynamics will enable more accurate global modeling of the earth system - past, present and future.</AbstractNarration>

Community computational model development  The work supported the improvement of community numerical modeling resources. A bug was identified, reported, and fixed in the Regional Ocean Modeling System (www.myroms.org).

Broader Impacts:   The supported research activities have direct societal benefits via the scientific results, which inform efforts to improve the representation of marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle in Earth system models on regional and global scales, which inform policy decisions. In addition, the research activities have indirect societal benefits via the career development of a post-doctoral research scientist and expanding international scientific cooperation and collaboration. 1.   Broader impacts of the research   Marine phytoplankton form the trophic base of marine ecosystems, and variability in marine phytoplankton is linked to variability in higher trophic levels (e.g. fish), which has implications for marine management and food security. In addition, sinking organic detritus represents a significant flux of carbon from the surface ocean to the interior and therefore modifies upper-ocean and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This research yields new insights into how marine phytoplankton depend on upper-ocean physics at time and space scales that are unresolved by global ocean and Earth system models. For example, the work demonstrates that high-frequency wind variability (with timescales &lt;1 day), which is often filtered out in the ocean component of global Earth system models, can enhance phytoplankton in the upper-ocean. Moreover, the work emphasizes that small scale oceanic variability (on spatial scales &lt; 100 km), which is also filtered out in the ocean component of global Earth system models, can act synergistically with the high-frequency winds to enhance phytoplankton in the upper ocean. These results inform the interpretation of global model results and inform efforts to improve the representation of phytoplankton in global models. 2.
