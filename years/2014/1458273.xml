<AbstractNarration>Oklahoma State University Collection of Vertebrates (OSU COV) comprises collections of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, and frozen tissues and is administered through the OSU Department of Integrative Biology.  These represent invaluable specimens and associated data that are used in research, instruction, and outreach within the OSU/Northern Oklahoma community and throughout the larger community of scholars. This project focuses on improvements to COV-Fishes and COV-Amphibians and Reptiles through replacement of substandard storage containers, installation of high-density, compactible shelving, and completion of digitization and georeferencing for these collections, thus allowing for enhanced use of these collections for research, university instruction, and public education/outreach.  These improvements will facilitate use of these collections by OSU faculty and students, researchers from other institutions, and also will enable collaborative efforts with K-12 groups and regional Tribal Colleges that have been hindered by poor conditions of the collection.  This award ensures protection of irreplaceable specimens, increase efficiency of use of space, and provide access to associated data via the Internet to researchers within and beyond the OSU community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The COV-Fishes contains specimens from around the globe with concentrations in the Central Plains of North America and Nepal.  This collection also includes a more than 20-year series of fishes from sampling stations throughout Oklahoma donated by Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) that have not yet been cataloged.  The COV-Amphibians and Reptiles collection includes specimens from around the world including Chilean lizards and Ozark Plateau salamanders.  These collections include type specimens of species described in the last 10 years and have provided materials for these descriptions to researchers at several other universities.  Nepalese specimens potentially hold additional undescribed species and ODEQ specimens have great potential for understanding long-term patterns/processes in stream ecology, impacts of environmental change and contaminants, and effects of changing patterns of land use.  This project will support installation of high-density, compactible shelving and stainless steel tanks, and to replace substandard containers.  The collection catalogs are partially digitized, but only Oklahoma fish are georeferenced, and no catalog is currently searchable via the Internet. The project will allow for digitization and georeferencing of all catalogs and development of a searchable database.  Collaborations established with interdisciplinary college-level and K-12 cross-disciplinary programs at OSU and a growing collaboration with Comanche Nation College will be leveraged through the supported improvements and digitization. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and the public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Oklahoma State University Collection of Vertebrates (OSU COV) was founded in 1936. The mission of the OSU COV is to document the vertebrate faunal history and biodiversity of Oklahoma, the United States, and other regions of the world and to maintain collections in conditions that promote conservation, education, and research. These collections are available to faculty, staff, and students of OSU, researchers from other institutions, and the public. Previous CSBR funding in 2010 made it possible to make a number of needed renovations to the OSU COV Collection of Mammals, but the Collections of Fishes and the Collections of Amphibians, and Reptiles were still badly in need of attention. This report summarizes the accomplishments to improve those latter collections of the COV through the present NSF CSBR grant.The Fish Collection consists of around 32,600 lots containing approximately 810,000 specimens. Around 65% of these specimens come from Oklahoma, providing an excellent spatial and temporal representation of the state?s icththyofauna.&nbsp; The collection also includes specimens from 43 other U.S. states and 14 other countries. Of particular significance are 1,871 lots from Nepal, among the world?s most extensive collection of Nepalese fishes, from which a number of new species have been described. Amphibians and Reptiles include approximately cataloged 14,400 specimens. It houses sizeable holdings (including type specimens) of several salamander species endemic to the Interior Highlands and a significant collection of Chilean lizards, including paratypes. Holdings span some 21 families of amphibians and 47 of reptiles.Prior to the project, jars were stored on mismatched wood and metal shelves. Many jars were crammed beneath shelves and were difficult to access. Lids were often ill fitting, rusted, or cracked. There was no standardization of jar or lid sizes and ~ 60% of jars were inadequate to preserve specimens or prevent evaporation of alcohol. The OSU COV also contained a massive backlog of uncatalogued material accumulated over decades. Amphibian and Reptile catalogs still had not been digitized. None of the collections were web-accessible.In order to better house the existing collections and to accommodate future growth, old shelves were removed and replaced with high-density moveable shelving (Figs 1-2). The new system greatly expanded the storage capacity of the COV, providing stable and secure housing for all holdings as well as adequate room for future expansion. Low quality jars were replaced with flint glass jars and polypropylene lids of five standardized sizes (Fig 3). Larger specimens were transferred from metal drums to stainless steel specimen tanks (Fig 4). Every jar was examined during the re-shelving process, allowing the first full inventory of the collections in their more than 80 year history. Thousands of new labels were made to replace damaged or faded ones or to reflect nomenclatural changes. If alcohol was the wrong concentration, badly discolored, or contained excessive precipitate, it was replaced. Jars were re-shelved following a schematic, making it easier to quickly locate specimens. Most of the backlog was catalogued (over 183,000 specimens). Digitization was completed for Amphibians and Reptiles.&nbsp;The OSU COV Teaching Collections had long been heavily utilized in courses and outreach efforts. These holdings consist of quality specimens that lack adequate data to be cataloged in the research collections. No catalog or inventory for these specimens existed prior to the project. New specimens were added and these collections were inventoried and digitized.&nbsp;This project provided support and trained 2 postdoctoral fellows, 4 undergraduates, and 1 high school student in natural history curation, museum science, and taxonomy. The project also provided training for an additional 2 graduate students as Collections Managers (Fig 5) and 24 undergraduates (Fig 6) who enrolled in BIOL 4700 Practicum in Natural History Collections led by the PI. Groups that are historically underrepresented in science participated at all stages of this project. We presented posters at two conferences and gave seminars at two academic institutions along with multiple talks/tours for lay audiences. The work of this project was incorporated into National Lab Day for high school students for all the years of the grant. Throughout all of these efforts, we sought to foster an appreciation for the dynamic, integrated, and fundamentally important role that natural history collections continue to play in research, conservation, and education.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Stanley&nbsp;F&nbsp;Fox</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458273/1458273_10374275_1591025508597_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458273/1458273_10374275_1591025508597_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1458273/1458273_10374275_1591025508597_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fig. 1.
