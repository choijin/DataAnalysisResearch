<AbstractNarration>This study will investigate interactions between moths from the genus Hadena (the lychnis moth) and two divergent populations of the flowering plant species Silene latifolia (the white campion), an established research species that is also naturalized in the US.  The S. latifolia populations vary extensively in floral, vegetative, and life-history traits, which are likely adaptations to dissimilar environments.  The moths are nursery pollinators:  adult moths pollinate, but the larvae parasitize fruit.  Interactions including moth preferences, larval performance, and fruit damage will be examined in the natural European habitat.  This research will suggest whether the balance between mutualism and parasitism varies among distinct environments with these nursery-pollinator and host-plant species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an interdisciplinary research project that combines ecology, evolution, and behavior to investigate the divergence of intricate biological interactions between natural populations.  This project will offer extensive training in pollinator biology and ecological/evolutionary field techniques for young graduate and undergraduate researchers.  These results will also provide empirical evidence of regional variation in plant-pollinator interactions.  Additionally, this work will suggest whether conservation efforts should consider habitat-specific differences in the management of other pollinator species.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project combines ecology, evolution, and behavior to investigate the divergence of intricate biological interactions between natural populations.  We studied interactions between divergent plant populations and their pollinators using the herbaceous flowering plant, Silene latifolia, and its primary moth pollinator, Hadena spp.  These moths are nursery pollinators, meaning that adult moths pollinate the host plant but female moths also lay eggs on female flowers where larvae then consume developing seeds.  These moths provide a service but are also a parasite to the plant.  In this study, we initially show through a pollinator exclusion experiment that Hadena spp. moths provide a crucial pollinator service because nighttime pollination significantly increases fruit and seed set, but nighttime pollination also results in significant fitness costs from seed predation.      Furthermore, we found that moths have habitat-dependent interactions with their host plant.  We used two divergent populations of the plant Silene latifolia that differ greatly in floral morphology, which from other research we know is likely an adaptation to different habitats.  Plants from the wet environment make many, small flowers, while plants from the dry environment make few, large flowers.  Previous research has shown that fitness costs are higher (more seeds are consumed) when eggs are laid directly on the flower ovary and larval survival and growth are impeded by petal oviposition.  We found that in the drier habitat where plants make few very large flowers, moths are forced to oviposit on the petals of these large flowers, which reduces seed consumption.  When non-native plants with small flowers were introduced, however, we found that moths from the drier habitats 1) recognized the plants as potential host plants, 2) oviposited on the ovary of the small flowers.  This shows that flower size (particularly length) directly affects moth behavior.  Because length in particular is exaggerated compared to the increase of other floral measurements, floral length in the dry habitat likely functions to mitigate seed-herbivory losses.  In wetter habitats, plants many make small flowers, and moths oviposit almost exclusively on the ovary of these small flowers.  We found that fruit abortion rates were higher in this population than in the larger-flowered population, which has been shown in previous studies to reduce secondary herbivory damage as larvae move to additional fruits.   However, when non-native plants with larger flowers were introduced into the wet environment, we found that the moths again recognized these plants as potential host plants, but the moths oviposited almost exclusively on the petals.  This suggests that floral size, which variation is adaptive in different habitats, directly affects moth behavior and larval success.      This project provides a greater understanding of how biotic and abiotic factors influence divergence across habitats.  We found empirical evidence of regional variation for plant-pollinator interactions, and we show that habitat-specific differences may be important for managing plant-pollinator systems.  These results show that pollinator behavior is influenced by plant floral traits, and because these traits are likely adaptive to different environmental conditions, coadaptation of the pollinator and its host plant are also affected by environmental differences.  In addition to the intellectual information provided by this research, this project also provided resources for immersive training in pollinator biology and ecological/evolutionary field techniques for several young researchers, including a graduate and undergraduate students.  The project also strengthened international collaborations as we worked with local researchers at the international field sites.
