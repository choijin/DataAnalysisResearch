<AbstractNarration>This project examines continent-wide variation in the dimensions of biodiversity. New data are collected on the biodiversity and extinction risk of 2,500 Western Hemisphere reptile species. These data are combined with existing data for mammals, birds, and amphibians to measure and map the diversity of all 13,000 terrestrial vertebrate species of the Americas, in three dimensions. The first is phylo-temporal diversity, measuring the genetically distinctiveness of the species in an area. The second is compositional diversity, measuring which species occur in an area. And the third is trait diversity, measuring how the species in an area vary in place, food, time, and size niches. For each of the three dimensions, measures will reflect differences over space (dissimilarity). All data will be published in open access databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is important scientifically in representing novel, hemisphere-wide analysis of the genetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity of a major species group. This will allow determination of relationships among the three dimensions of biodiversity, and, by using the extinction risk data, prediction of impending changes in these relationships. These analyses have important practical implications, because the degree to which the dimensions covary will determine the efficiency possible in their conservation. Our PI institutions comprise four universities and the non-governmental organization NatureServe, the latter of which provides a channel for incorporation of results into conservation decisions, as well as providing real-world exposure to the two postdoctoral associates, and three graduate and approximately 40 undergraduate students, who the project will employ. The project includes significant international capacity building through Red List workshops in Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Chile, along with research coordination meetings in Brazil. Both students and PIs will be traveling and collaborating with in-country scientists during these meetings, with support provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this work was to study the multiple dimensions of tetrapod species diversity to determine mechanisms driving its origin, distribution, maintenance, and function. Integrated analyses were conducted of the relationships between the dimensions of biodiversity and biodiversity loss in all major groups of tetrapods. This is a new approach because previous studies have focused primarily on single dimensions of biodiversity in single groups of organisms. The three dimensions that were studied were the genetic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions. However the mechanisms that generate biodiversity, speciation and diversification, were further studied to determine how they influence the distribution and abundance of species and interact with the three dimensions. Of the major tetrapod groups, the reptiles were notable in lacking critical data and therefore efforts were made to obtain those data, including distributions and information on extinction risk. Analyses of species relationships and times of divergence from genetic data generated comprehensive evolutionary trees scaled to time of the major tetrapod groups and species for use in all of these biodiversity studies across three dimensions. Statistical biases in widely-used methods were revealed and analyzed leading to improved methods of analysis of diversification data in general. Speciation and diversification were found to be surprisingly constant overall, derived from random events including genetic mutational changes and the extinction and survival of lineages. This result predicted that the geographic pattern in abundance of species would be best explained by the age of evolutionary lineages, not the rate of diversification or environmental variables, and further tests supported this prediction. Nonetheless, environmental and ecological variables were found to have a significant influence on mammal species assemblages globally. In another multi-dimensional analysis it was demonstrated that median body mass of New World tetrapod assemblages is lower than expected in areas with a longer history of high human population density and land conversion. This work has many broader impacts. The extinction risk and distributional data for Western Hemisphere reptiles in coordination with the IUCN Red List Program provides core knowledge and performance standards for organizations such as the World Bank in their distribution of development and environmental funds.
