<AbstractNarration>A workshop will be held in Washington DC to identify and widely distribute best practices for recruiting and retaining a diverse community of scientists in the fields of evolutionary biology, ecology and systematics.  Doing so is important because the representation of individuals in these disciplines does not reflect that of the general public, and this discrepancy is projected to increase.  A diverse workforce is essential to attract the best talent and to foster innovation. The workshop will be built on a foundation provided by an extensive online community that the organizers will create beforehand.  Participants will include a wide spectrum of stakeholders: students, professors, university administrators, professional societies, and federal agencies.  All materials will be made publically available through a "wiki" that focuses on the theme of "What works?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the organization of the workshop is unique for three reasons.  First, it will rest on the collective input of virtual communities, established and facilitated by the workshop organizers to discuss and document best practices, challenges, needs, and opportunities.  Because this will occur before the workshop, participants will arrive at the workshop thoroughly prepared and highly committed.  Second, it will be designed around the principles and practices of Appreciative Inquiry, which focuses on the simple and positive question: What works?  Appreciative Inquiry has not been used previously in the Biological Sciences to help broaden participation.  Third, it takes a proximate and practical approach by focusing on what individuals can do; institutional change, which is ultimately necessary, will presumably follow from successes at the individual level.  Dissemination is provided by extensive online resources that will be created and made publically available.  Scalability is fostered through establishment of networks of individuals with common interests and involvement in broadening participation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broadening Participation in Environmental Biology &ndash; Exploring What Works:  Project Outcomes Report  NSF Award # 1447326  Principal Investigator: John F. Cabra  Co-PI: Andy Burnett  This project involved an approach designed to elicit effective broadening participation tactics from the ?front line? and disseminate them across the biology community in general, but with a particular focus on the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) community. In essence, we produced a body of knowledge, and a network of people, that would be inspired to help individual faculty members answer the question, "What one thing could I do - immediately - in my lab or classroom, that would help to broaden participation?" This project was designed to apply the Appreciative Inquiry (AI) methodology within the DEB community. AI is a theory of organizational change that, in its simplest terms, suggests that instead of looking at a system?s failings, we look for what is working, study those pieces, and then find ways to replicate and disseminate the knowledge.  As a way to complete the workshop grant, we planned and delivered a SACNAS preconference workshop and conference breakout session. Additionally, a book was produced for this event to communicate the results from interviews with faculty members and some of their mentees in regards to what has worked in broadening participation, based on personal and professional experiences.  Our process included interviewing successful mentors across the United States to find out what has worked to engage underrepresented students in the sciences. Using these interviews, we compiled a set of habits, skills, environments, tools, techniques, and processes that can be tweaked and applied to practically any mentoring situation. The end in mind for this book was threefold: namely, 1) to provide preconference workshop participants the opportunity to dive into these mentoring stories and lists, and see how they might broaden their outreach; 2) to leverage the existing stories as primers to produce new stories of success; and 3) to solicit feedback involving ways to better disseminate stories of success.  Specifically, our research asked several questions:  Describe a time that made you most proud--a high point, when you mentored someone successfully to do something challenging.  What were the most memorable parts of the mentoring experience, including challenges? Reflect on: "root causes of success." What were your best qualities, or the mentoring mindset/qualities that helped you succeed? What did you actually do?   What environment did you foster that led to the high points? Why was it important/ significant/surprising? What did you learn from it?   Imagine you had a magic wand and could have three wishes granted to improve mentoring.  What would they be? What tips can you give to advisers to more effectively approach mentoring? Mentoring is one approach to broadening participation. Over and above mentoring, what else have you found that worked to broaden participation?   During the time in which our project was funded by the NSF, we converted interview narratives into short stories and skill sets for a book; completed two professional development webinars on Appreciative Inquiry, which were also designed to entice people to attend SACNAS preconference workshop; designed a public website containing the best practices identified by the participants (https://whatworks.hub.ki/community/publications); and disseminated peer-to-peer qualitative study results involving what works in broadening participation by hosting sessions at the SACNAS and AESS conferences (description below).  Title  Mentoring in Environmental Biology - Exploring What Works Among Underrepresented Students    Description  This session is for college educators that are curious about what their peers are doing successfully to mentor underrepresented students in scientific and technical fields. We will share qualitative data that stem from semi-structured interviews of mentors and their mentees and host a dialogue about techniques for sustaining and supplementing mentoring practices.  Session Goals There are three overarching goals: 1) To introduce the concept of Appreciative Inquiry (AI) and describe how AI can be of value to educators, their institutions, and their personal lives; 2) To disseminate the results of an NSF study to explore what worked in the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) to mentor underrepresented students; and 3) To discuss future efforts to strengthen and sustain the application of what worked within the life sciences community, and apply those practices to participants? respective contexts.  We Completed a SACNAS preconference workshop on What Works in Broadening Participation  We attracted 18 curious, enthusiastic participants who were prepared to share stories (large or small) about what has worked for them. This workshop did not involve lectures. Instead, we dedicated a day to learning from successes, forming new partnerships, and inventing new tactics. The event was held at the same location as the main SACNAS conference.             Last Modified: 09/13/2016       Submitted by: John F Cabra]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
