<AbstractNarration>The research goal of this project is to help people react to major natural and man-made disasters by developing a system that can automatically generate descriptions of disasters, whether man-made or resulting from climate events. Through the generation of descriptions of disaster impact several months after the disaster has occurred, the system can document the impact of different scale disasters in different locations from country to city. Information for the description is drawn from news and social media. Descriptions are told from an objective point of view, describing the facts as known, and from a personal point of view, describing the experiences and emotions of people who experienced the disaster. Enriching the descriptions of disaster impact by access to personal stories provides a compelling look at how disasters impact individuals.  Through generation of descriptions of the impact of a disaster as it happens, relief organizations can better coordinate delivery of aid to where it is needed.  The generated descriptions are being made available through a public website so that all people interested in impact of a disaster will have access. This project is creating technology with the potential for social good and thus, will have appeal to many students, including undergraduates who seek to make their contributions meaningful to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projet brings together research on generating descriptions that highlight the structure of large-scale events with research on automatic identification of riveting personal stories. Semi-supervised and supervised approaches to the problem are used, drawing on large-scale online sources of data as well as smaller collections of annotated data. The project features the use of semi-supervised approaches to learning event relevance that exploit 11 years of summaries generated by Columbia's Newsblaster system plus other online large-scale semantic information.  It features construction of an event tree given textual descriptions from news and social media where nodes represent events (both larger scale and sub-events) and the tree structure can represent subsumption, temporal and causal relations between events. Finally, it uses a supervised approach to learning when a text taken from social media conveys an  interesting story based on a socio-linguistic theory of narrative structure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Goals   Our goal was to develop technology that can automatically generate descriptions of disasters and the sub-events they trigger.

Our second approach used a learning to search method that significantly improved computational efficiency, while retaining the salience model.   The problem of identifying  and summarizing personal, riveting accounts that convey to readers the difficulties imposed by the disaster on individuals is a new one for the natural language community. We addressed this task using a technique based on Labov's theory of narrative (Labov 2013). This theory identifies the components of a good narrative, with the narrative hinging on inclusion of a Most Reportable Event that can be characterized as a life and death experience. We developed an approach to automatically identify and summarize the most reportable event.   We adapted this work so that it could be used in a cross-lingual environment. Natural disasters can occur in any part of the world, where languages may be spoken for which we do not have good machine translation. Thus, we developed a summarization approach that could work for both objective and personal summaries when it must take poorly translated texts as input.     Intellectual Merit   Our key outcomes fall into the area of providing objective updates about what happened during a disaster, of providing summaries of personal narrative and of providing  fluent English summaries of translations of news and narrative from a foreign language.   Objective Updates  We developed features for detecting salience sentences in news streams for disaster summarization. We created a batch processing stream summarization algorithm that jointly combines salience predictions with clustering to produce an extract summary. We created a fully online summarization algorithm (using Learning2Search) to summarize news streams. The update models we created were evaluated at shared tasks at TREC where they were top performers.      Personal Views   We created the only narrative summarization corpus in existence, as well a  summarization corpus that provides aligned extractive and abstractive summaries. We created an extractive summarization system designed for the genre of personal narrative, which outperforms systems designed for summarizing news. We created a paraphrase alignment system capable of aligning long phrases with very few words in common. Paraphrase is important for rewording the informal language of online narratives so that the generated summary is fluent.       Cross-Lingual Summarization  We created an approach to multi-lingual summarization through the creation of a summarization corpus for multi-lingual scenarios by translating articles from the New York Times summarization corpus into three foreign languages and then back into English, thus producing a corpus  of poorly written articles paired with well-written English summaries.  We designed a training pipeline to produce cross-lingual abstractive summarization systems for any source language. We created three language-specific summarization systems for Somali, Swahili, and Tagalog. We created a mixed-language summarization system that outperforms all of the language-specific systems..  We demonstrated generalization of summarization systems to new and unseen languages.       Broader Impact   This work has the potential to help people react to major natural and man-made disasters. Through real-time generation of descriptions of the impact of a disaster as it happens, relief organizations can better coordinate delivery of aid to where it is needed. Access to personal stories will provide a compelling look at how disasters impact individuals.
