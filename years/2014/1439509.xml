<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Symposium on the Growth of III-Nitrides (ISGN) series of conferences have been premier international forums for experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories to present their latest progress and exchange ideas in the fundamental and applied aspects of III-Nitride bulk and epitaxial growth technologies as well as related device advances.   III-Nitride compound semiconductor materials underlie many of today's most advanced high-performance devices such as LEDs, laser diodes, and transistors which are becoming an essential part of the solution of many global problems.  In the future, III-Nitride solar cells, nanostructure materials, and other innovative devices will play a similar significant role in improving the human condition.   This conference was organized to foster the continued advancement of this important field of research and development, and it provided an opportunity for student training and development in several ways.  First, it provided a venue for students to give their presentations to a wide audience with many experienced specialists in attendance which provided a very useful interaction in the question sessions and beyond at coffee breaks and in the evenings.  Secondly, it allowed the graduate research assistants (GRAs) to interact and compare experiences and research ideas.  Thirdly, it provided an opportunity for the GRAs to see state-of-the-art equipment and services related to this field which is difficult to experience any other way than by attendance at a conference.  Finally, it will give them an opportunity for the publication of their results in a well-recognized refereed journal.  The funds provided by NSF were used to support the USA-based graduate students who gave oral or poster presentations at this  conference.       Last Modified: 11/11/2014       Submitted by: J.
