<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1447893&lt;br/&gt;PI: Cunningham, Brian&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;Title: EAGER: Lab-in-a-Smartphone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance:&lt;br/&gt;The wide availability of a low-cost, robust, and multimode biosensor detection capability will spur accelerated development of sensing applications in myriad settings where laboratory capabilities are lacking, or where current closed platforms are aimed at only a very specific commercial market. Smartphone-based detection systems are expected to find applications in situations where laboratory facilities are not available such as point-of-care analysis in the home, clinic, farm, or remote locations. The integrated approach to be developed in the proposed work would enable mobile sensing applications that include diagnosis of disease through sensing of specific biomarker proteins (cardiac, cancer, and others), specific identification of infectious disease (viral or bacterial, as performed by PCR), sensing of allergens in food, food/drug manufacturing quality control, sensing of counterfeit drugs, breath analysis, and environmental monitoring of air/water/soil resources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Description:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this EAGER proposal is to utilize integrated semiconductor laser diodes and LEDs as illumination sources within the smartphone, and a thin film waveguide/grating coupler to bring light to the sample. The system will operate simply by placing the sample-under-test over the analysis opening, while a custom software application controls all other aspects of the measurement. The resulting system will be capable of performing UV/Visible wavelength absorption spectroscopy, UV/Visible wavelength reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and label-free optical biosensor measurements. The platform will use custom microfluidic cartridges designed to perform sample preparation, liquid mixing, and other steps of cell/biomolecular assays that can be developed by the entire ecosystem of mobile application developers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we designed, built, and tested a method for making a highly miniaturized spectrometer.  Due to the small vertical thickness of the system, the low cost of its components, and the accuracy with which it renders spectra in comparison to conventional spectrometers, we envision potential incorporation of the system into mobile communication devices, such as smartphones and tablets, as a means for providing a dedicated sensor for health diagnostic, environmental monitoring, and general-purpose color sensing applications.  We demonstrated the capabilty of the sytem for health diagnstic tests for maternal health, where we tested colored liquids and colored paper test strips with equivalent accuracy as large laboratory-based instruments.  The system is comprised of a conventional silicon image sensor, such as those used in current mobile phones, with a graded-wavelength optical filter attached directly over the sensor pixels.  A test object is illuminated from the side by an integrated set of miniature LEDs and a miniature plastic cylindrical lens.  The system is capable of measuring the optical spectra of light sources (lasers, LEDs, light bulbs), the abosorbtion spectra of colored liquids, the emission spectra of fluorescent liquids, and the scattered spectra of solid object.  The system is therefore capable of measuring the most important and widely used classes of biological assays used for health diagnostics.
