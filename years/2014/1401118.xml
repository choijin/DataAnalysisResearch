<AbstractNarration>This project provides travel support for the 12th World Meeting of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA), to be held in Cancun, Mexico, July 14-18, 2014. The theme of the conference will be on theory, modeling, and applications of Bayesian statistics. It is anticipated that the conference will be attended by an international group of academics, researchers, professionals, government employees and students, from countries around the world. The main focus of this project is on funding for junior researchers that reside in the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian methods provide a coherent framework that facilitates blending information from different sources and communicating findings and conclusions using probabilities.  ISBA-2014 is a scholarly conference where new Bayesian statistics ideas will be exchanged. It is a truly international meeting for the dissemination of state of the art statistical methods that use the Bayesian approach. The meeting will promote the development of statistical theory and its applications to engineering and the sciences.  It will provide participants with the opportunity to interact with colleagues from different countries, working in a variety of fields of application of statistical methods.</AbstractNarration>

The scientific program featured four lectures on foundations of Bayesian statistics, five keynote speakers, 28 invited sessions, 16 contributed sessions, five short courses, and 180 posters distributed along four poster sessions. The NSF award provided the opportunity to 22 junior researchers, based in American academic institutions, to participate and present their work at the meeting. The availability of funding was widely advertised using electronic mailing lisst that reach more than 2,000 researchers with an interest in Bayesian statistics. Applicants were requested an up to date resume and a copy of the technical paper that they intended to present either orally or as a poster.
