<AbstractNarration>Facilitating workload consolidation and improving server utilization are critical for reducing cost and improving energy-efficiency of modern datacenters. One major challenge for improving utilization is to do so without affecting the quality of service (QoS). On modern servers, various co-located jobs may share critical resources including 1) micro-architectural resources such as last level cache, memory bandwidth, and functional units, etc., and 2) energy resources including grid power and distributed batteries that provide an additional power source especially during high load period. Multiple co-located jobs may contend for shared these resources, causing interference, threatening application QoS or even triggering the circuit breaker and resulting in costly downtime and severe QoS violations.&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these challenges by designing a cross-layer system that effectively manages workload consolidation, quality of service (QoS) and various energy sources to optimize for energy efficient computing. Our system spans several layers, including profiler, static compiler, online lightweight monitoring and prediction, runtime execution management, hardware power state control and energy sources control. The compilation technique identifies and inserts markers in contentious code regions in low-priority applications, as well as critical regions in high-priority applications that require QoS protection. The lightweight runtime utilizes the compiler hints, monitors the QoS, power consumption, etc., and adaptively adjusts the pressure applications generate to the shared resources such as shared cache and memory bandwidth, manages battery (dis) charges and hardware power states to guarantee QoS and achieve efficient power shaving.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The core of the proposal is to design and develop an effective cross-layer system to significantly improve data center energy efficiency by improving server utilization under power constraints while guaranteeing applications? quality of service (QoS).  This is one of the key challenges facing datacenters nowadays given the massive amount resource and energy these large-scale infrastructures consume nowadays and the ever-growing compute demand in our society.    One key insight we have is that there is a significant amount of dynamisms in data centers: there are various types of hardware platforms, the applications may co-run on the same server and generate interference among each other, the user load changes constantly and the hardware configurations change dynamically.  A system needs to adapt and adjust to all of these dynamisms in order to provide satisfactory QoS with high efficiency. In addition, because both software and hardware play a factor in the dynamism,  we need to design cross-layer runtime systems that can manage and exploit of these types of dynamisms.    To this end, during the course of the project, we have designed a cross layer system spanning application, compiler, runtime and hardware layers. Our framework is composed of a dynamic compiler coupled with a set of dynamic optimizations, precise performance prediction models, a hardware/software co-designed fast voltage scaling systems. Equipped with these components,  our framework can dynamically re-layout code with little overhead and/or adjust the hardware configuration to exploit the dynamism and achieve high performance and efficiency.    Specifically, our contributions  include 1) a dynamic compiler, protean code, that facilitates near free dynamic code transformation to exploit the dynamism. This system has solved one of the holy grail problems in compiler design of achieving low-overhead dynamic code transformation and opens up a new set of opportunities for compiler research.     2) a performance prediction modeling, SMiTe, for co-run environment in datacenter to increase utilization by maximizing opportunities to consolidate applications without hurting QoS.    3) a HW/SW co-designed system, Adrenaline, capable of fast and precise DVFS to achieve high power efficiency under varying load.    4) ShapeShifter, dynamic loop optimizations that rely on our compiler framework, protean code, to exploit the dynamism and improve performance.    With these effective strategies for managing runtime QoS, resource contention and aggressive power management, this research achieves the goal of improving utilization, significantly increasing the energy efficiency for data centers, reducing the energy consumption and energy footprint. Thisl expands the utility of massive scale data centers to greatly advance a wider range of technologies in areas such as pharmaceutical development, environmental science modeling, big data applications, and many others.  In addition, this research project also leads to 5 publications at top tier conferences, (1 SC ?13, 2 MICRO ?14, 1 HPCA ?15, 1 MICRO ?16 ), 4 grad students and postdoc trained.
