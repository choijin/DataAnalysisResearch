<AbstractNarration>It is proposed to study several problems in probability. One class of problems concerns the phenomenon of localization under the occurrence of a rare event, with applications to problems ranging from nonlinear dispersive equations to random graphs. A second class of problems involves cutting-edge issues in concentration of measure, particularly related to a topic called "superconcentration". The PI is proposing to writing a book-length monograph on these topics, compiling a bunch of results that he proved in previous work together with some new results and ideas.  Finally, a third class of problems centers around a continuation of the proposer's earlier work of normal approximation in modern problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concentration of measure and large deviations are basic mathematical tools that are frequently used in statistics, computer science, engineering, physics, and many other fields. In this proposal, the PI has outlined a plan that may shed light on some fundamental issues in large deviations and concentration of measure, with applications to open questions in partial differential equations, random graphs and networks, and several other topics. The purpose of the proposed book-length monograph is to elucidate the ideas to a broad audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All proposed research problems from the project "Concentration of measure, large deviations, normal approximation and applications" have been successfully solved within the scheduled due date.   The first research problem in the project proposal was the problem of establishing localization phenomena in a variety of stochastic models. This was achieved in a number of problems. The PI solved a localization problem arising in the context of nonlinear Schrodinger equations in his paper "Invariant measures and the soliton resolution conjecture". Another localization problem, on random geometric graphs, was solved in a paper that the PI wrote with his student Matan Harel. In a recent paper with his student Erik Bates, the PI proved localization in a model of directed polymers.   The second research problem in the project proposal was about proving new central limit theorems. The PI carried out this program with his student Sanchayan Sen, and more recently in a joint paper with his colleague Persi Diaconis.  The third activity proposed in the project proposal was writing a monograph on a stochastic phenomenon known as superconcentration, that has appeared in many problems of contemporary interest. The PI finished this book project and the monograph with published by Springer.  Besides the above activities that were specifically mentioned in the project proposal, the PI also worked on a number of related problems, such as large deviations for random graphs and quantum ergodicity.  The broader impacts of these outcomes are many. Central limit theorems are ubiquitous in all the applied sciences, and the new techniques developed by the PI and his collaborators will be helpful to future researchers in these areas. Localization phenomena in nonlinear PDEs and random geometric graphs would be of interest to engineers and physicists. Localization in polymer models are relevant in physics and chemistry. The superconcentration phenomenon is at the cutting edge of the research on concentration inequalities, that are widely used by researchers in machine learning, computer science and statistics.
