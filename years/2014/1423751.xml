<AbstractNarration>Juries are the bedrock of the American judicial system.  Six or twelve people join together in a collaborative effort to arrive at a verdict.  During deliberation, jurors must not only come to a verdict based on the evidence presented during the trial, but they must also remember the evidence.  To a large extent, jurors must rely on their own memory.  Here, the assumption of the Courts is that the collective memory of a jury is likely to lead to a better, more complete recollection than any individual effort.  The difficulty with this position is that there is burgeoning psychological evidence indicating that groups often remember less than the sum of what individuals are capable of remembering.  Moreover, extant research demonstrates that what one person says in a conversation can alter the memory of other participants - by imposing misleading information or inducing forgetting, for example.  Although both types of conversational effects can affect subsequent decision-making, it is possible that, even more critically, both types can be mitigated in certain circumstances.  To this end, the present research explores the way jury deliberation might reshape the memories jurors have of the evidence presented during the trial, the effect any change in memory might have on the verdict of the jury, and the means of mitigating these deliberation effects.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves seven experiments employing a mock jury methodology.  They will examine whether (1) research concerning collaborative remembering applies to jury deliberations; (2) the emergent consensus story of a jury reflects the conversational dynamics consistent with what is known about conversational remembering; (3) the verdict of a jury can be traced to these conversational influences on memory; (4) the conversational influences on memory are a function of the composition of the jury; and (5) ways exist to mitigate these potentially negative conversational effects through instruction or use of mnemonic technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The funded research project examined how jury deliberations (i.e., conversations) may shape the way jurors come to remember the facts of a trial and, in turn, their decision-making process.  Although the Courts have emphasized the benefits of collaboration on memory in their instructions to jurors, psychological research suggests that what a group remembers may neither be accurate nor complete.  Indeed, it can even be worse than if remembering occurs in isolation.  When applied to jury deliberations, the extant research would suggest that the judgment of a jury may be biased by their collaborative efforts to remember testimony in ways that might adversely affect their final judgments. However, our results, generally, do not support these suppositions. That is, we found that deliberation helped jurors remember more details surrounding the facts of the trial. While further research is needed, these results help begin to inform the US Criminal Justice System, as well as the broader social aspects of memory field, on how conversations may shape the way individuals and groups remember the past.  Broader Impacts  First, this project provided a more ecologically valid context by which to understand how jury deliberations shape the way jurors remember the facts of a trial and, in turn, may influence their decision-making process. Second, the research has important theoretical implications outside the legal setting in that it traces in detail, the relation between various communicative influences on memory on not just subsequent memory, but also various judgments that rest on these memories. Not enough research has been done to date in charting these relations. This project, then, not only adds to the extant jury decision-making literature, but also provides a closer examination at the relation between communicative influence, memory, and judgment.  Third, the research is at its heart interdisciplinary. Not only does it address concerns to the legal community, it offers a means for bridging the fields of cognitive psychology, social psychology, and sociology. Finally, the present project engaged both graduate students and undergraduates, including underrepresented minorities, in research relevant to both experimental psychology and the judicial process.
