<AbstractNarration>With this GOALI award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professors Milton Smith and Robert Maleczka of Michigan State University and Jossian Oppenheimer of Dow Chemical Company to develop new catalytic reactions that form carbon-boron bonds.  Molecules with boron-carbon bonds are valuable building blocks in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and specialty electronics industries. They can be directly synthesized by reacting boron-containing compounds and carbon-hydrogen bonds in a process called carbon-hydrogen borylation. The most efficient and robust catalysts for carbon-hydrogen borylation utilize iridium, which is the least abundant metal in the Earth's crust. For sustainable practice using iridium, it is critical to recycle the metal and the ligands involved in the catalysis. There are two challenges in improving the sustainability of this chemistry. The first pertains to the abundance of iridium, and this university-industry collaborative group is focusing on improving the iridium recycling in the catalytic process. The second challenge pertains to the boron reagents used in carbon-hydrogen borylation. These compounds are currently made using lengthy processes that utilize hazardous reagents and generate considerable chemical waste. This group is working on developing "greener" approaches to synthesizing these boron reagents with the goal of reducing waste, improving safety, and lowering costs. The chemistry developed in this research could be broadly adopted both in scientific research as well as in commercial applications. Students participating in this research project are experiencing the work environment and practices in an industrial research and development setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team is exploring various strategies to recycle the metal and ligand in carbon-hydrogen borylation, including supporting catalysts on surfaces with the aim of translating selectivities in homogeneous catalyst systems to heterogeneous ones. New ligands are being synthesized to modulate the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst and to anchor catalysts on a silica surface.  Catalysts are being characterized and the reaction chemistry is being quantified using an array of analytical techniques.  The team is also exploring strategies to develop more facile syntheses of the boron reagents that are used in stoichiometric amounts in the carbon-hydrogen borylation chemistry. New approaches to boron-boron bond formation are being developed to minimize the number of steps and improve the scalability of current synthetic routes to this class of reagents, and smaller alkoxide ligands on the boron center are being examined in hopes of making the boron reagents cheaper and easier to obtain.  Both research aims are critical to improving the sustainability of carbon-hydrogen borylation and could be broadly adopted both in scientific research as well as in commercial applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit &mdash; Organoboron bearing aromatic molecules are useful building blocks for agrochemicals, materials, organic electronic and other valuable compounds.  These molecules are usually prepared from starting materials that have a pre-installed synthetic handle.  This needed initial operation can be lengthy, generate significant waste, and increase the inherent environmental hazards.  Once the starting material is ready for introduction of the organoboron group, that installation often requires energy intensive cryogenic temperatures and the use of pyrophoric reagents.  During the course of fundamental research studies, Michigan State researchers developed a way to generate organoboron bearing aromatic molecules without the need for a pre-installed synthetic handle.  This catalytic CH borylation (CHB) process streamlined preparations and eliminated the need for cryogenic temperatures or pyrophoric reagents.  Equally notable, the only theoretical waste product was hydrogen gas.  CHBs are thus considered a green chemistry approach to organoboron bearing aromatic molecules.   Through this NSF GOALI grant Michigan State researchers joined forces with Dow Chemical scientists and engineers to advance CHB chemistry.  Specifically, this collaboration looked to lower barriers to CHB being broadly adopted by industrial and academic researchers alike.  We were successful in developing CHB conditions that made previously unrealized selectivity possible on fluorine containing aromatics that are of importance to the agrochemical research community.  The resultant selectivity lessened the formation of byproducts and chemical waste.  Achieving this outcome was the result of redesigned catalytic systems and/or by following up the CHB with a second reaction.  Notably, the subsequent chemical event made productive use of a waste product of the silicone industry, further expanding the green nature of the chemistry.  We were also successful in replacing the traditional rare earth metal (e.g. iridium) traditional used in CHBs, with earth abundant cobalt.  The cobalt CHB reactions further advanced CHB chemistry as the enabled access to an entirely different class of organoboron bearing molecules.   Finally, through both experimental and computational studies we gained additional mechanistic knowledge that can be used in future generations of CHB research.  Broader Impacts &mdash; In keeping with the aims of GOALI, the execution of this project included regular exchanges between Michigan State faculty and students with Dow scientists.  In this way students and faculty will experience chemistry from an industrial perspective, while industrial chemist will get the opportunity to develop fundamentally new reactions.  Notably one student was able to spend a sustained period of time at Dow.  All students involved in these studies gained enhanced industrial awareness, which upon graduation has benefited them and their future employers.  Furthermore, Dow participated in an MSU industrial chemistry course, which benefited students beyond those directly involved in the research.  This project also produced a mix of intellectually protected technology and widely disseminated publications and presentations.  Thus the "green chemistry" developed during this work has to potential for direct economic development and adoption by researchers in various industrial and academic settings.
