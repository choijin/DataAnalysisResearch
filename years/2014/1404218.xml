<AbstractNarration>Experimental nuclear physics helps us to understand the properties of the nuclei at the center of atoms and how the elements are synthesized in stars and their explosions. This project enhances our understanding of these fundamental questions by accelerating nuclei to high energies and measuring gamma and charged particle radiation that is emitted when they interact with other atomic nuclei. The focus is on accelerating beams of atomic nuclei that are unstable to beta decay, living for times as short as seconds. The interactions between atomic nuclei informs our understanding of the properties of atomic nuclei, especially those far from stability that are more weakly bound, as well as helping us to understand how the parents of the stable elements were synthesized. The project exploits state-of-the-art instruments and accelerator facilities in the U.S. Central to this effort is enhancing the education of students and postdoctoral scholars and preparing them for careers in education and fundamental and applied research.  The nuclear physics results from this project are also of importance in astronomy, to understand the abundance of elements observed in the cosmos, and for nuclear energy and national security, to understand properties of and reactions on fragments from fission of actinides. To expand the reach of this project, the principal investigator presents workshops to undergraduate students on how to prepare for graduate studies and gives lectures to the public and schools on this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the frontier areas of nuclear physics is the study of the structure of atomic nuclei far from the valley of stability.   In atomic nuclei the single-particle orbitals are expected to change as a function of neutron and proton number, and in addition are very sensitive to the presence of deformation.  Single-particle characteristics can be probed in single-particle transfer reactions. Light-ion transfer reactions will be studied with beam energies near the Coulomb barrier and about 35-MeV per nucleon. Studies will concentrate on neutron-rich nuclei near the N=50 neutron shell closure, accelerated fragments following fission of 252Cf and light nuclei important for understanding the synthesis of nuclei in stars and their explosions. These studies will be carried out with accelerated beams of rare isotopes at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University and the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory.  The NSCL focus is to extract spectroscopic strengths with reduced dependence on theoretical model parameters.  At ATLAS the group will exploit Gammasphere-ORRUBA: Dual Detectors for Nuclear Structure Studies to probe the fragmentation of single-particle strength with coincidence measurements between charged particles (measured with ORRUBA, the Oak Ridge Rutgers University Barrel Array of position-sensitive silicon strip detectors) and gamma rays (measured with Gammasphere, the array of 110 Compton-suppressed Ge gamma-ray detectors).  The group will also further develop capabilities to measure particle-gamma-ray coincidences with scintillator detectors coupled to ORRUBA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit. This project has advanced our understanding of the structure of and reactions on atomic nuclei away from the valley of stability.  The main activities used neutron transfer (d,p) reactions with stable and radioactive ion beams to probe the structure of nuclei near the N=50 neutron shell closure and near 132Sn with closed shells of both neutrons (N=82) and protons (Z=50). By studying properties of unstable nuclei that we can experimentally probe now we have provided results that serve to inform theoretical models that extrapolate to more exotic species. We have demonstrated that the shape of the nuclear potentials of neutrons excited in low-angular momentum states in heavy nuclei can be constrained by measuring the same reaction at two very different beam energies. Therefore, the single-particle strength, i.e., spectroscopic factor, can be deduced with uncertainties dominated by experimental statistics.  These initial measurements with 86Kr beams laid the foundation for additional studies with radioactive ion beams.     We have observed for the first time excitations in 135Xe and 127,129Sn above the N=82 shell gap. The results from the (d,p) reactions with radioactive A=126,128,130,132 and stable A=124 tin beams were analyzed to deduce direct semi-direct neutron capture cross sections on these nuclei near the path for rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.    Neutron capture (n,&gamma;) reactions are important for understanding the synthesis of heavy elements in stars and their explosions via the slow (s) and rapid (r) processes that occur on predominantly unstable nuclei.  Understanding (n,&gamma;) reaction rates is also important for applications in nuclear energy and national security.  Because of the importance of these reactions on unstable nuclei, validated surrogate reactions are required to deduce these rates with radioactive beams on deuterated targets.  The (d,p) reaction in coincidence with gamma rays has been validated as a (n,&gamma;) surrogate and we have developed the techniques to measure the (d,p&gamma;) reaction with radioactive ion beams.  These surrogate validation and instrument efforts laid the foundation for future (d,p&gamma;) reaction studies with radioactive ion beams near N=50 and on fission fragments.   This project also collaborated on efforts to enhance our understanding of synthesis of lighter elements in stars and their explosions. A common theme was to understand the stellar synthesis and destruction of 18F, a key target for gamma-ray telescopes. Important resonances in the 18F+p final nucleus 19Ne were studied in the (p,d) reaction with a 20Ne gas-jet target and (3He,t) reaction on a 19F target. Subsequent calculations of the 18F(p,alpha) reaction significantly reduced the uncertainties in this rate.    To realize these experimental results required the development of new techniques and extensions of existing instruments.  The Oak Ridge Rutgers University Barrel Array (ORRUBA) of position-sensitive silicon-strip detectors was the instrument central to these measurements.  ORRUBA was successfully coupled to the Gammasphere array of Compton-suppressed high-purity Ge gamma-ray detectors to realize Gammasphere ORRUBA: Dual Detectors for Experimental Structure Studies (GODDESS).  GODDESS was commissioned with 134Xe beams to measure the (d,p) reaction in coincidence with gamma radiation. Subsequent measurements with 3He beams were made to study the (3He,t) reaction on 19F targets.  This project also advanced neutron detection capabilities by developing liquid scintillator detectors. These detectors were exploited in measuring to unprecedented low energies the 13C(alpha,n) reaction, the primary source of neutrons in the slow neutron capture nucleosynthesis process.   The results were disseminated in invited and contributed oral and poster presentations and refereed journal publications.  Three Master of Physics theses and a Ph.D. dissertation were completed.
