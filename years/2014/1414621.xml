<AbstractNarration>High-dimensional polygons, commonly called polytopes, are geometric objects arising from finite sets. For certain types of polytopes we can produce a polynomial, called the h*-polynomial, that encodes interesting information about the polytope, such as its volume. One interesting property of the h*-polynomial, called unimodality, is when its coefficients rise and then fall when read from left-to-right.  This project aims to show that the h*-polynomials of a well-studied collection of polytopes are unimodal. These polytopes are important structures in algebra, integer programming and other areas of mathematics. By proving the h*-polynomials of these fundamental polytopes are unimodal, this project intends to add to our understanding of both the collection of polytopes themselves, and the property of unimodality for h*-polynomials in general. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Takayuki Hibi, a leader in the study of h*-polynomials, at Osaka University in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes a new geometric method to investigate unimodality of the h*-polynomial of the n,k-hypersimplex. Specifically, one can show that a well-studied unimodular triangulation of the n,k-hypersimplex restricts to a triangulation of a nested class of subpolytopes within the hypersimplex. It is well-known that a shellable unimodular triangulation can be used to compute the h*-polynomial of a lattice polytope. This project aims to define a shelling of this triangulation that respects the nesting of these subpolytopes. Through the analysis of this shelling the PI will study relations among the h*-polynomials of the subpolytopes and the hypersimplex. Particularly, the PI aims to relate the h*-polynomials of the subpolytopes in such a way that yields a result on unimodality of the h*-polynomial of the n,k-hypersimplex. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High dimensional polygons, commonly called polytopes, are geometric objects arising from finite sets.  For certain types of polytopes we can produce a polynomial, called the h*-polynomial, that encodes interesting information about the polytope, such as its volume.  One interesting property of the h*-polynomial, called unimodality, is when its coefficients rise and then fall when read from left-to-right.  The hypersimplices are a collection of polytopes that are important in algebra, integer programming, and other areas of mathematics.  The goal of the PI's current research is to show that the h*-polynomials of the hyperpsimplices are unimodal.   During the 2014 EAPSI Japan program, the PI and host researcher, Dr. Takayuki Hibi, investigated a new geometric approach to showing the h*-polynomials of the hypersimplices are unimodal.  Recently, the PI has identified a collection of subpolytopes, one nested inside the next, that live within each hypersimplex.  We call these subpolytopes the r-stable hypersimplices.   The r-stable hypersimplices share a nice geometric connection with the hypersimplex containing them.  The hypersimplex can be subdivided into a collection of polytopes with integer vertices that have smallest possible volume.  This collection of polytopes is called a triangulation of the hypersimplex, and this triangulation restricts to a triangulation of each r-stable hypersimplex.  This means that given an r-stable hypersimplex we can glue on more of the small polytopes in the triangulation to build up to the next largest r-stable hypersimplex.  By repeating this process again and again, we build all the way up to the hypersimplex itself.  If this process is done in an appropriate order, we can use this data to compute the h*-polynomial of each r-stable hypersimplex along the way.  This is done by adding certain values to the coefficients of the previous r-stable hypersimplex's h*-polynomial.  With this in mind, the PI's current goal is to identify at least one r-stable hypersimplex inside each hypersimplex with a unimodal h*-polynomial.  Then the next goal would be to build up to the hypersimplex using the triangulation, and show that the unimodality property is preserved along the way.  This Summer, the PI and host researcher worked to identify an r-stable hypersimplex inside each hypersimplex with a unimodal h*-polynomial.  Completing this goal is a key step in the direction of proving unimodality of the h*-polynomials of the hypersimplices using the described method.  Currently, many of the known methods for proving unimodality of an h*-polynomial require that the polynomial be symmetric.  A polynomial a0+a1x+a2x2+...+adxd with ad not equaling 0 is called symmetric if ai=ad-i for every i=1,2,...,d.  A well-known result of DeNegri and Hibi provides a geometric criterion for determining precisely when a polytope has a symmetric h*-polynomial.  The PI and host researcher implemented this criterion and successfully determined all r-stable hypersimplices with symmetric h*-polynomials.  Using the triangulation described above, the PI and host researcher then verified that these r-stable hypersimplices all have unimodal h*-polynomials.  Due to this work, we now have a large class of hypersimplices that contain an r-stable hypersimplex with a unimodal h*-polynomial.  In these cases, we can now work to check if the unimodality property is preserved as we build up to the hypersimplex via the method described above.  The work completed by the PI and host researcher supports the intellectual merit of the project in the following ways.  The hypersimplex is one of the most basic examples of a polytope, and consequently has been well-studied.  The h*-polynomials are relatively new structures, and thus have been previously investigated for the hypersimplices.  While much is understood about the h*-polynomials of the hypersimplices, many questions remain unanswered.  Due to its algebraic implications, one interesting unanswered...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
