<AbstractNarration>Lower atmospheric small-scale gravity waves (GWs) play a crucial role in determining the dynamical and thermal structure of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. This project will address how GWs influence the vertical coupling in the atmosphere-ionosphere in terms of energy and momentum budget, variability, thermospheric composition, and ionospheric electron density distribution. Two comprehensive GCMs will be coupled and used to simulate the atmosphere-ionosphere from the tropopause to the topside ionosphere. A suite of available upper atmosphere measurements, such as, from the TIMED satellite, SuperDARN, and Fabry-Perot Interferometers, will be used to validate the model fields.&lt;br/&gt; Specific topics to be addressed are: (1) GW effects on the circulation and composition of the thermosphere and on the distribution of ionospheric electron density; (2) The influence of gravity waves in shaping the variability of the high-latitude ionosphere, in both geomagnetically quiet periods and those of higher magnetospheric variability, (3) The impact of sudden stratospheric warming on the upward propagation of GWs and the resulting changes in GW dynamical, thermal, and compositional effects in various geomagnetic and solar conditions; (4) The direct GW propagation from the lower atmosphere during atmospheric and geomagnetic transient processes as a possible link between meteorological and space weather processes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of our research project is to better understand the influence of atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) in the upper atmosphere. While the notion of the lower atmosphere refers generally to the troposphere (0-15 km); the middle atmosphere includes the stratosphere (15-50 km) and mesosphere (50-100 km) and the upper atmosphere is the layer of the atmosphere above about 100 km known as the thermosphere (Figure 1). GWs are produced by meteorological processes, e.g., weather, in the lower atmosphere and propagate upward to the middle and upper atmosphere where they can impact the wind and temperature distributions as they transfer the energy and momentum they carry to the background atmosphere. GWs can be studied observationally, e.g., by satellites and GPS (global positioning system) total electron content (TEC) measurements, and theoretically, e.g., by global climate models. Our research has involved both observational and modeling approaches to study GW dynamics. Overall, throughout the project period, we have produced several comprehensive review papers on the influence of GWs in terrestrial and planetary atmospheres; organized a number of conference sessions on GW dynamics; disseminated our research results on GWs and the upper atmosphere via research papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Some key outcomes of the project are as follows:</p> <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GWs interact extensively with the diurnal tide in the middle and upper atmosphere. They primarily enhance the diurnal tide in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. However, higher up in the thermosphere, their effects can weaken or enhance the tides depending on the latitude.</p> <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis of GW activity during the Great American eclipse of 2017 showed an unprecedented view of the small-scale GW-induced variability in GPS-TEC observations. &nbsp;The GW activity was high close to the path of the total eclipse and decreased away from it.</p> <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During a major geomagnetic storm, there is a significant amount of hemispheric asymmetry in the thermosphere-ionosphere, in particular, in the thermospheric circulation. The asymmetry changes during the different phases of the storm. This behavior implies that dramatic changes in the circulation will have an impact on the propagation and dissipation characteristics of gravity waves in the thermosphere.</p> <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During sudden warmings, which often take place in the stratosphere in the Northern Hemisphere during winter time, GW propagation and dissipation undergo significant changes because of the sudden changes in atmospheric properties, such as, winds and temperature. These changes modulate the upward propagation of GWs from the lower atmosphere and can therefore control to what extent GWs originating in the lower atmosphere can affect the upper atmosphere. &nbsp;</p> <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our research has embarked on a poorly studied topic of space weather effects on GWs. We looked into how magnetic storms, caused by the impact of the Sun on &nbsp;Earth's geospace environment, could affect different atmospheric constituents. The SABER instrument onboard NASA's TIMED satellite enables the retrieval of neutral atmospheric temperature profiles up to about 110 km, which can be used to extract GW activity in the middle atmosphere in terms of temperature fluctuations. Similarly, SABER observations of atomic oxygen, ozone (O3) and nitric oxide (NO) were used to look into the storm effects. The results show clear enhancement of GW activity in the mesosphere below up to 80 km. Also enhancement in NO and depletion in O3 is observed. These observations motivate modeling studies that could provide further understanding of the processes involved in these variations.</p> <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined analysis of TIMED/SABER observation in the middle atmosphere with GPS-TEC measurements in the ionosphere has suggest that the GW activity decreased both in the middle atmosphere and the ionosphere during the period of the major warming event. The results were interesting comparing them with the previous general circulation model (GCM) studies of SSW effects on GWs, which have shown an increase in thermospheric GW activity during a minor warming event. Therefore, the response of the upper atmosphere to GW processes and the associated GW activity therein strongly depend on the character or type of the sudden warming. Future research can study the details of wave propagation and dissipation during major warmings by using time-dependent three-dimensional GCMs.</p> <p>Overall, our research results lead to the conclusion that GW processes in the upper atmosphere can be effectively studied when both observational and modeling analysis are combined. GWs can be successfully parameterized in global circulation models and it is also possible to extract small-scale GWs from upper atmosphere observations. Nevertheless, further progress is required in both the observation and modeling aspects of GWs in the upper atmosphere. While GCMs and GW parameterizations can benefit from further improvements, increased coverage in thermospheric and ionospheric data would also help better characterize GWs. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Erdal&nbsp;Yigit</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1452137/1452137_10373179_1567637680663_f2_atm_layers--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1452137/1452137_10373179_1567637680663_f2_atm_layers--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1: Vertical structure of Earth's atmosphere"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1452137/1452137_10373179_1567637680663_f2_atm_layers--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Vertical structure of Earth's atmosphere"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The figure illustrates the different atmospheric layer from the lower to the upper atmosphere.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yi&#287;it, E., A.
