<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Stojkovic, Kinney, and Wackeroth at the State University of New York, University at Buffalo. The goal of this research project is to make important progress in providing answers to key open questions at the frontier of of particle physics, cosmology and gravity research, and in doing so to go significantly beyond the current state of the art in the field. The PIs propose individual research programs with elements which will be executed jointly.  New particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and envisioned successors are probing new physics at the energy frontier and are capable of providing answers to important questions about the structure and history of the universe. On the other hand, cosmology provides a unique laboratory to  study questions in physics inaccessible to traditional particle physics methods, and forms a valuable complement to accelerators. Our current understanding of the fundamental problems about the origin, evolution and future of our universe is still in its infancy, and a synthesis of many independent lines of evidence will be necessary to point the way to explanations. This project reflects that synergy, and promises to make significant progress in connecting high-precision cosmological and accelerator data to fundamental questions such as the origin and evolution of the universe, the unification of gravitation with quantum mechanics, the role of the vacuum in the structure of space and time.  In addition the PIs will continue with their very active and successful presentation of the latest scientific results to a wide public in the form of public talks and various outreach activities. These will include The Science Exploration Day, Physics Open House, and Family Day. Kinney (with active participation of Stojkovic and Wackeroth) will continue organizing  Science and Art Cabaret} - a unique mix of cutting-edge science and technology with art, music, poetry, and performance, and the  At UB Symposium, a new interdisciplinary lecture series with a prototype event being held in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stojkovic's research will span topics within his expertise from particle physics to cosmology. Part of his research will be focused to the LHC physics, in particular on further development of a comprehensive LHC event generator BlackMax which is extensively used by ATLAS and CMS in search for exotic physics, and understanding implications of the recent Higgs discovery on gravity and cosmology (in collaboration with Wackeroth). Part of his research will be dedicated to cosmology, in particular to studying predictions of a recently proposed class of inflationary models  (in collaboration with Kinney), as well as studying new puzzling patterns in quasar light curves which seem to be closely related to the quasars' redshifts.   The main goal of Kinney's research is to make quantitative connections between new observational data and detailed properties of the early universe to address fundamental questions such as: What is the energy scale of cosmological inflation? What is the form of the leading-order operator in the inflationary potential? Is the inflationary Lagrangian consistent with a simple canonical field theory? Is there evidence for quantum gravity effects, for example a Planck-scale cutoff in quantum modes? Can we explain CMB anomalies, such as the hemispherical asymmetry observed by Planck? Are there viable alternatives to inflation? What properties do they have?   Wackeroth will concentrate on the precision electroweak (EW) physics, in particular on corrections to W and Z boson production in hadronic collisions, improving predictions for H,W, Z production in association with heavy quarks, and NLO EW corrections to triple EW gauge boson production with non-standard couplings. This work will be directly relevant to analysis of upcoming LHC data.</AbstractNarration>

Among the questions addressed are:  How did the universe begin? Why is the universe accelerating? What is the dark matter? Are there hints of physics beyond the Standard Model?   Key outcomes from this project included:  Analysis of the "Natural Inflation" scenario in light of data from the BICEP2 and Planck measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background.  Forecast prospects for direct detection of primordial gravity waves by proposed space-based direct detection experiments, such as DECIGO. Gravitational waves as a "smoking gun" for cosmological inflation.  Demonstration that Eternal Inflation is generic even at energy scales far below the scale of quantum gravity.  Analysis of quantum entanglement effects in cosmological inflation.  An asymmetry in abundance between neutrinos and antineutrinos as a resolution of the current discrepancy in Hubble parameter measurements.  Analysis of "constant roll inflation", showing that it is never an attractor solution.  Providing improved predictions for Higgs boson production in association with heavy quarks in a publicly available Monte Carlo generator (POWHEG). The recently discovered Higgs boson production with a top anti-top quark pair at the LHC has been compared with the Standard Model expectation provided by this code.  A comprehensive precision study of observables in Drell-Yan processes as an important first step to achieve an accurate simulation framework for the measurement of the W boson mass and the effective weak mixing angle at an unprecendent level of precision at the LHC.  Providing improved predictions for key Standard Model processes at the LHC with the Monte Carlo code MCFM by including weak corrections and studying their impact on observables and kinematic regimes which are sensitive to signals of new physics.  Generalization of the hoop conjecture to the expanding space-times.  Explicit demonstration of the problems in some recent emerging gravity proposals.   Gravitational wave production by Hawking radiation from rotating primordial black holes  Greybody factors and quasi-normal modes for black holes in massive gravity and scalar-tensor theories Modification of thermodynamic laws by gravity   Modification of the cosmic censorship by quantum effects   Broader impacts included research training for both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as numerous conference presentations and public talks. Among the notable outreach efforts completed during the period of this grant was the continuation of the successful "Science &amp; Art Cabaret" event, which has shown enduring public appeal, with ten events held during the life of this award.
