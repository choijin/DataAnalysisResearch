<AbstractNarration>a non-technical explanation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stromatolites, the macrofossil evidence of microbial activity, are an important biosignature in the search for life on early Earth and in extraterrestrial missions. Although it has become increasingly important to place value on organic biomarkers to define a record of past life, stromatolites remain the most readily visible microbial macrofossil. Yet, the taphonomic effect of diagenesis and metamorphism on stromatolites is poorly known, hampering their utility as a faithful recorder of past life.&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes to develop a new collaboration to describe and quantify the effects of contact and regional metamorphism and fluid-induced diagenetic changes on biogenic stromatolite beds of the 1,878 Ma Biwabik-Gunflint iron formations of the Lake Superior region. This target has been chosen because it offers a phenomenal natural laboratory setting that is accessible, samples can be carefully and accurately plotted in a three-dimensional framework, and the geologic history is complex and covers several divergent taphonomic pathways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full study will be significant to researchers studying paleontological and biogeochemical patterns in other altered sediments both on early Earth and extraterrestrial targets. The research will provide critical primary research experience for two undergraduate students at a primarily undergraduate institution, enhancing their careers with opportunities not available at their host institution. The teaching methods of the PI will be enhanced with a greater understanding of coupled petrologic and geochemical information. Most critically, by creating a new collaboration, there will develop additional opportunities for interdisciplinary project-based learning which forms an integral component of the PI?s pedagogy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a technical description &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this CNIC proposal is to work in a world-class laboratory at the Universit√© of Brest, France. During this visit, the new collaborative team will analyze samples for iron isotope and trace element geochemical proxies that will integrate with the PI?s extensive database on mineralogic and petrographic changes throughout the metamorphic gradient of a biogenic stromatolite layer. This specific collaboration will both complement and challenge previous research on the geochemical imprint of iron formations and the preservation of original geobiochemical signatures in ancient fossil deposits. The implications will be of major importance to researchers in fields as diverse as astrobiology, geochemistry, mineralogy, economic geology, and paleobiology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-CNIS project focused on developing a new collaboration between researchers from the California State University, Chico and the Universit&eacute; of Brest, France.  The specific scientific goals were to use the state-of-the-art laser-ablation high-resolution sector-field (Element2) and multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (Neptune) to analyze individual iron oxide grains in ancient, altered stromatolites.  Samples were previously collected from specific outcrops that recorded the effects of contact and regional metamorphism and fluid-induced diagenetic changes on biogenic stromatolite beds of the 1,878 Ma Biwabik-Gunflint iron formations of the Lake Superior region. More broadly, stromatolites were targeted as they comprise the macrofossil evidence of microbial activity and are an important biosignature in the search for life on early Earth and in extraterrestrial missions.  However, the taphonomic effect of diagenesis and metamorphism on stromatolites is poorly known.  Funds from the NSF supported the PI (Shapiro) and two undergraduate students to travel to Brest to work with collaborator Lalonde for two weeks.  A supplemental award allowed for the travel of Dr. Hannah Aird, a recent petrology hire to CSU Chico.    Prior to travel, the Chico team met weekly to discuss the methodology and prepare protocols for the study of the samples.  Meetings with Lalonde also took place via Skype.  While in Brest, the students gained firsthand access to the mass spectrometers as well as a microprobe.  Over two dozen samples were targeted and the team was able to analyze additional samples for future research.  Part of the success was leveraging of support from the Universit&eacute; of Brest.  Upon the return to Chico, the students continued to work on the data, eventually presenting the results at several national meetings.   Intellectual Merit:  The results of this CNIC project led to the realization that individual, sub-100 micrometer oxide (hematite, magnetite) grains can be analyzed by laser ablation and that multiple grains yield results that span a much broader gradient than is observed through whole rock analysis.  This leads to questions about the ability to reconstruct whole ocean geochemistry in Proterozoic&mdash;much less Archean&mdash;oceans.  Furthermore, Fe isotopes and REE spectra seemed to be broadly conserved through high-grade contact and regional metamorphism but showed strong alteration where impacted by post-depositional meteoric diagenesis.  Broader Impacts: This project was highly successful in both developing the collaboration between the two institutions and training the undergraduate students.  One of the students is continuing to work on the results and has been invited by Lalonde to return to France to expand the research.  One proposal has already been submitted to the European Union to allow for the French colleagues to travel to the United States.  The results will be will be applied to a follow-up full proposal to NSF-Earth Sciences (Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology).  Several presentations have already been presented at national meetings and the results played a critical role in the successful acquisition of a scanning electron microscope for CSU Chico through the NSF-MRI program.
