<AbstractNarration>Skeletal remains of past human populations provide invaluable windows onto the evolution of human morphology, as well as enhanced understanding of functional variation in modern human morphology, in part because the range of behavior in ancient humans was more varied than is seen today. Limb bones are especially important in this respect, as they dynamically respond to physical activity via a process called bone functional adaptation, or "BFA." As a result, arm and leg bones are often treated as a "behavioral proxies" that provide critical information about mobility, lifestyle change, and technological innovation in past populations. Evidence shows, however, that BFA is under some genetic control that regulates bone sensitivity to mechanical environment. Variation in long bone structure and associated function therefore may reflect genetic ancestry, as much as behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pelvis and skull vary in accordance with genetic expectations and can therefore reflect important aspects of population history (e.g., migration, divergence or population reduction). The primary question driving this dissertation research by doctoral student Gina Agostini (under the supervision of Dr. Brigitte Holt, University of Massachusetts Amherst) is whether the same is true of long bones, a question to be answered by comparing patterns of cranial and long bone variation among European populations and their South African descendants. Using caliper measurements and digitized bone casts, data will be collected on cranial and long bone shape for each population. These data will be analyzed using population genetics software to predict the genetic distances (relationships) among the populations under study. If long bones do reflect genetic variation, then the relationships produced by long bone shape should generally match those produced by the crania. If they do not match, this suggests that cranial and long bones primarily reflect different biological or environmental processes. Results will either advocate the novel use of long bones to infer population history or will reinforce their usefulness at discerning behavior (or other environmental stimuli).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clarification as to whether long bones primarily reflect genetic or behavioral signals is crucial for studies of human origins which must routinely extract information from limited skeletal data. Furthermore, because BFA is the same process that regulates bone plasticity, maintenance and healing, this project will show whether our ancestry influences the response time of our bones to a new exercise regime, sport, or fracture. This research also supports growing public interest in ancestry, a trend evidenced by the wide popularity of commercial ancestry kits and genealogical programs. In addition to publicly accessible reports, data generated by this project will be integrated into a series of community-based lectures, social media interactions, public workshops, and lifelong learning opportunities already conducted by the researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project (Award#1411887) investigated whether limb (arm and leg) bones, typically used to discern behavior, might also be used to detect genetic relationships when analyzed across many populations. This is important because the dense parts of limb bones are often well represented at fossil and archaeological sites, but are typically assumed to be so plastic in response to physical activity that any meaningful genetic information would be erased throughout life. However, this had not been robustly tested. If limb bones can detect genetic relationships, then fragmentary long bones, much like skull bones, might be useful in a number of genetic contexts. Examples of these include identifying relationships among ancient populations (perhaps even determining ancestral affiliations for newly discovered burials), determining the taxonomy (i.e., species) of fossil hominins, tracing the movement of ancient humans as they spread globally over time, or even in contexts of forensic human identification (as seen with software programs like &ldquo;Fordisc&rdquo; and &ldquo;3d-id,&rdquo; both of which apply population genetics to skull bones for means of identification).</p> <p>With the NSF funds, Agostini gathered skull and long bone data on nearly 750 individuals from samples that spanned the Medieval Era-to-present in Italy, South Africa (interior and Western Cape), and England (North and South).&nbsp; These data were used to test whether limb bones conveyed a genetic signal, and if so, whether they did so as well as skulls are known to. Results show that while long bones are more plastic, this liability does not erase meaningful genetic information. In fact, genetic predictions generated by the limb bones significantly match those generated by the skull even when there were behavioral differences among the populations under study. The genetic patterns detected were corroborated by contextual information from historical documents regarding the colonization of South Africa. This means that with independent confirmatory testing, certain aspects of limb bone structure may one day be used to discern genetic information in a way that is not destructive and can be applied to very ancient contexts. Furthermore, a supplemental analysis detected evidence of physical activity. This means that depending on the methods employed, long bones can be used for dual purpose&mdash;to discern behavioral information on the one hand and genetic information on the other.</p> <p>The NSF support allowed Agostini to gain invaluable experience organizing international scientific data collection, managing a complex database, conducting statistical analysis with the software platform R, gaining proficiency with population genetics software (RMET 5.0), and establishing international and domestic contacts. This grant will help Agostini secure a tenure-track academic position and funding for new projects to follow. Results for this project were presented by Agostini at a public PhD defense in June 2016. An abstract was submitted to present this work at the 2017 professional meetings of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists&mdash;the first opportunity to do so since obtaining results. At least three (likely more) publications will be submitted to relevant journal outlets in the upcoming six months, including the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, the Journal of Human Evolution, and the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology. The NSF data will be publically available as the publications are released. Additionally, products generated by this project have already been incorporated into various lectures given by Agostini and the project was presented internationally at the University of Bologna. &nbsp;</p> <p>This award also allowed Agostini to train four undergraduate and community college research assistants (including two minorities, a veteran, and three females), all of whom aided with computer processing and analysis. Two students completed independent research papers and a third currently works on a population genetics honors project using these data. This student will submit an abstract to present her work at a 2017 undergraduate research symposium. Of these students, one went medical school, another is applying to Anthropology graduate programs, and another actively seeks more research opportunities. Future students will likely use these data for their own independent projects over the next several years as Agostini continues her active mentorship of young researchers.</p> <p>Agostini publically shared images and experiences from her travel, research, and field site visits while she worked in South Africa, Italy, and England. She did this through social media (most still accessible via her active twitter profile, @Osteodonna). She shared elements of the NSF-funded project, but also a number of unique opportunities that arose while in the field, such as interaction with rare fossil hominins from Sterkfontein and Swartkrans, ancient Oldowan and Acheulean stone tool technologies, and a photographic tour of the Etruscan/Roman site of Roselle in Tuscany from which one sample originated.
