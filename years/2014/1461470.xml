<AbstractNarration>This research project will provide an empirical investigation into the realities of respondent driven sampling (RDS) data collection.  RDS is a new method for sampling rare or hidden populations.  The method starts with the members of the target population and traces their social networks as well as the networks of those to whom they are connected.  Although this method is growing in popularity, there is a scarcity of publicly available RDS datasets.  As a result, methodological assessments of RDS are very limited.  This research project will conduct a theory-drive methodological assessment of RDS.  The project will provide a platform to develop design features for RDS studies that minimize potential errors and violations of critical assumptions.  By developing appropriate inference strategies, rare or hidden populations will be more fully represented in the data collected by RDS methods.  Absent these types of examinations, behavioral and social science data collected through RDS runs the risk of mischaracterizing rare or hidden populations in unknown ways.  To the extent that these data inform public policies, rare or hidden populations may benefit from this research.  New datasets will be generated and made publicly available to promote methodological research beyond this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will conduct an empirical assessment RDS within the Total Survey Error (TSE) framework.  TSE is a framework in survey methodology that allows for the systematic examination of errors.  This project seeks to improve current RDS data collection and inference practices by examining sampling productivity, error properties, and replicability.  The investigators will collect data on two rare populations in Los Angeles County for which external probability-based sample data are available.  The probably-based data will be used as "gold standards" against which estimates from the RDS collected data will be compared, providing a unique opportunity to assess RDS not only as a sampling method but also as a data collection method.  The data sets will empirically inform a simulation study that will examine the effects of various network structures and response propensities on sampling productivity and inferential errors.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project has examined operations of respondent driven sampling (RDS) and errors within by empirically implementing RDS in two surveys targeting different types of populations (ethnic minorities vs. illicit substance users) using different modes (Web vs. in-person). The first survey, Health and Life Study of Koreans (HLSK), was designed as a Web-based survey targeting foreign-born Korean Americans living in Los Angeles County and State of Michigan. Before launching the survey, we conducted formative research with roughly 35 participants through focus groups in February, 2016 in order to assess the perception of RDS by foreign-born Korean American community members, reasonable incentive levels and effective communication methods with participants. Informed by the formative research, study websites were created in both English (<a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/korean-healthlife-study/">https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/korean-healthlife-study/</a>) and Korean (<a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/korean-healthlife-study-kr/">https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/korean-healthlife-study-kr/</a>), and the HLSK started June, 2016 and continued until March, 2018, collecting data from 639 such adults.</p> <p>Soon after the launch of the HLSK, we prepared the second survey, the Project Attitudes towards Health (PATH), which targeted persons who inject drugs (PWID) in Southeast Michigan, specifically, Wayne, Macomb and St. Clair counties, all hit hard by the opioid crisis. To increase the team&rsquo;s efficiency in data collection with the illicit substance users, we partnered with local stakeholders by forming a steering committee. The committee included officers from state and local public health departments and staff from local agencies serving PWID communities. As part of the formative research, we conducted in-depth one-on-one with current or recent PWID which informed our survey design. For the survey, we identified three data collection sites, all accessible by public transportation with an inviting atmosphere. Four trained interviewers worked as a team and rotated across sites. Those interested in participating in the PATH were instructed to contact the team and schedule an appointment. To insure participant privacy, all participant visits were based on appointment, allowing one participant for a given time slot. After the interviewers administered a screener questionnaire to ascertain PWID eligibility, the main questionnaires were administered through Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview Software (A-CASI) that did not display any text related to question content.
