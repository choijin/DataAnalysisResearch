<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce an online Matching Tool for Middle School teachers to connect with Science, Math, Engineering and Technology (STEM) experts and find STEM Project-Based-Learning (PBL) products. With this Matching Tool, teachers will be able to connect virtually with diverse STEM experts for teacher and student mentoring, virtual discussions and presentations; find PBL products for individual and group projects; and locate diverse STEM experts who are familiar with PBL products and projects. STEM experts will be recruited during the project with an emphasis on women, people with disabilities, underrepresented minorities and veterans. Middle School is a key stage in children's education and aspirations. The broader impact of the project is to bring real-time, diverse faces of STEM experts both to the teacher and into the classroom thus increasing children?s self-esteem and interest in STEM by using the "if you can see it, you can be it" truth in education. The central goal of this project is to create strong and measurable links between STEM experts and Middle School teachers and students, thus inspiring America's next generation of STEM experts and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Matching Tool addresses a validated teacher need to connect industry and university STEM experts to Middle School teachers and students.  The Matching Tool also provides matches to PBL products and projects, thus easing the adoption of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) standards that require project-based learning. The easy-to-use expert matching program will also provide a video portal for diverse STEM experts to pop up via video on classroom computer and mobile devices. The backend NGSS tagging system will aggregate and measure expert knowledge transfer from the STEM community directly to Middle School teachers and students. The Matching Tool will include two Dashboards for Teacher/School reporting and Corporate/Foundation reporting. With widespread commercialization of the tool, the resulting connection between industry experts, teachers and students should provide industry STEM mentors to over 12,000 middle school teachers via a network of over 100,000 STEM experts in the first two years.  The resulting impact will be to inspire students to study STEM fields and eventually secure STEM jobs. The resulting market impact is an increase in locally grown STEM employees, thus leading to an increase in American innovation and global competitiveness in many key areas of our economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) skills and careers are vital to maintain AmericaÃ†s global competitive growth and innovation.  Currently, the U.S. demand for STEM workers outnumbers the supply of STEM workers; there is thus a huge need to inspire more young students to persist and pursue STEM studies. During this Phase 1 project, the company designed, built and tested a prototype online Matching Tool, "STEMGrow",  that allows middle teachers to search for and connect with STEM experts.  Custom queries allow teachers to search for experts by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), Common Core Math standards and demographics information. The majority of the STEM experts, including corporate, university, non-profit and "student and teacher experts" recruited were from under-represented groups in STEM.  The Matching Tool was validated via testing with public and private school teachers and administrators in elementary, middle and high school.  Teachers provided feedback on the tool; along with additional features they would like to have in the tool allowing for continuous iterations of the tool to best meet teachers needs.  The NGSS and Common Core standards are being implemented in many states and focus on real world project based learning.  Broader Societal Impact  The broader impact of this project is that the commercialization of the Matching Tool will provide a way for teachers to connect with STEM Experts virtually to make connections between STEM industry professionals and in turn connect their students.     Teachers desire industry connections to learn about the new developments in each scientific and math field; this tool allows teachers to easily find and connect virtually with STEM industry professionals for project advice and mentoring.   The increase in connections between teachers, industry and academic experts and middle school students will provide real world examples of STEM professionals that in turn inspire an increasing number of students to continue their science and math studies and pursue STEM majors in college and in their respective careers.
