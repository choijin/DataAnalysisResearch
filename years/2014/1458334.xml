<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An award is made to the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) to complete the transition of its Genomic Resources Facility to a state-of-the-art liquid nitrogen system, the gold standard in modern cryopreservation.  UAM is home to one of the largest research collections of frozen animal and plant tissues in the world.  In addition to its global scope, it features unparalleled holdings of arctic and subarctic material from a region undergoing profound environmental change and rapidly increasing human encroachment.  Notable holdings include the largest and fastest-growing collection of marine mammal tissues in the world; samples from migratory birds that come from six continents to breed in Alaska each year; and permafrost-preserved tissues from extinct Pleistocene organisms.  The conversion to a liquid nitrogen system will secure an incalculably valuable scientific resource for ongoing and future research and education efforts.  Nearly all frozen tissues are associated with voucher specimens, adding to their information content and allowing for research on countless aspects of organismal biology beyond genetics and genomics.  For example, samples from the UAM-GR are routinely used by scientists globally to investigate questions in evolution, ecology, toxicology, biomedicine, and numerous other fields.  The project will also train students in modern cryopreservation technology and collection management and outlines plans to leverage ongoing outreach of the UAM to highlight the research, education and wider societal benefits of the collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded to facilitate the purchase and installation of four Liquid Nitrogen cryovats and associated racks to replace failing mechanical freezers.  Additionally, a liquid nitrogen plant of sufficient production capacity to maintain eight cryovats will be maintained. The resulting configuration represents a 68% increase in space efficiency and will accommodate all samples currently housed in failing mechanical freezers as well as an anticipated 20 years of continued growth.  The transition to a cryopreservation system entirely based on liquid nitrogen will enhance specimen security and significantly reduce energy consumption.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge cryopreservation methods and collections-based research in the biological sciences.  Outreach at UAM-GR will continue to target visitors of all ages including K-16 students, researchers, politicians, and the public.  These efforts will be augmented through the production of podcasts and videos targeting native Alaskans, a group that is significantly underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cryopreserved biological samples have a profound impact, both realized and potential, on human and ecosystem health, especially as our climate continues to rapidly warm and emerging pathogens become detectable and problematic. For example, small-mammal samples archived in the University of Alaska Museum's Genomic Resources facility (UAM-GR) were featured in a 2017 publication highlighting a novel strain of orthopoxvirus detected in a local resident, and avian samples continue to feature prominently in ongoing research into avian influenza. This project provided valuable upgrades from UAM-GR's inherently unstable and unreliable mechanical freezers to state-of-the-art cryopreservation technology that maximizes the stability and longevity of the collection while significantly reducing energy demands. A larger-capacity liquid-nitrogen (LN2) generator was installed in our facility, along with five new cryovats and a movable working surface for processing loans and staging new accessions. With help from two female undergraduate students, all of the mammal, insect, fish, and bird tissue samples are now housed in LN2 cryovats and are object tracked in Arctos, a relational database, through machine-readable 2D barcodes.</p> <p>Animal tissues for molecular work have primarily been archived long term at -80C in mechanical freezers, whereas plant material is often archived at room temperature in silica. Research has confirmed that samples maintained in either scenario continue to degrade, irreversibly compromising an irreplaceable resource. With funding from this grant, we have been working with the National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian) on ways to cryogenically preserve plant material in order to forestall continued degradation. We hope these practices will be adopted by other institutions that house similar material.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of this project, two female graduate and four (two male, two female) undergraduate students were exposed to collections-based natural history research and trained in cutting-edge cryopreservation methods through their inclusion in the loan-review and tissue subsampling processes. As a team, the PI, CoPI, and students developed educational materials for events outside the museum, led countless behind-the-scene tours, and participated in annual open house events. UAM-GR is a wildly popular attraction; over 2,000 people of all ages visit each year, including school groups, researchers, politicians, and the public at large. Outreach materials were designed by students to explain both the technical aspect of cryopreservation and research involving our samples. Co-PI Powers developed and taught three classes for Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) on themes related to genetics, genomics, and specimen-based research.</p> <p>Response from the academic community to our upgrades has been overwhelming.
