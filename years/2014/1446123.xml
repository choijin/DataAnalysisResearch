<AbstractNarration>This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting," a conference series in which the 2014 event will take place on November 8, 2014, on the campus of Washington and Lee University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting (VOTCAM) is an annual regional conference that has taken place since 1992.  It brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interest is in function theoretic operator theory and related areas. A sampling of the topical foci of the 2014 event is given by the following: operator theory and complex analysis, operator theory and mathematical physics, operator algebras. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
