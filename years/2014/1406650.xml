<AbstractNarration>The interactions between plants and their pollinators has been gaining increased attention recently due to the recognition of extensive pollinator loss due to anthropogenic activities.  One trait that is important for pollinator success is flower size.  This project will investigate the cellular and genetic bases of flower size as it relates to selection by pollinators in the phlox family of flowering plants (Polemoniaceae).  The goals of this study are: 1) determine the phylogenetic relationships among members of genus Saltugilia, 2) measure cell area of petal epidermal cells in developing flowers using microscopy techniques, 3) identify and isolate the possible genes responsible for the control of flower size based on data from other species, 4) determine the expression profiles of these genes in developing flowers and in species with different pollinators, and 5) demonstrate the function of these genes in regulating floral size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide the co-PI with training in current genetic and cellular techniques, in addition to training two undergraduates in laboratory techniques.  Hands-on modules for high school students will be developed to teach common laboratory techniques such as DNA extractions and polymerase chain reaction.  High school teachers will be trained in these protocols to increase the implementation of the modules.</AbstractNarration>
