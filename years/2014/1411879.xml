<AbstractNarration>Blazars are a subset of active galactic nuclei, which are highly energetic cores of galaxies, singled out by the fact that their jets of material, flowing out at speeds approaching that of light, just happen to be arranged so as to point towards us.  As such, blazars provide a direct view of how energy is radiated away and degraded in and around fast moving plasmas.  Unfortunately, the current explanations have proven inadequate.  This research team has introduced a new model that looks very promising in initial, approximate, studies.  This project will use new computational techniques to simulate the motions of large amounts of high-speed plasma, to study the problems in sufficient detail to distinguish between the possible alternatives by comparing with astronomical observations.  The research tool developed for this work will be packaged for others to use in many areas of plasma science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blazars are the primary sources of persistent extragalactic gamma-ray radiation detected by ground- and space-based observatories.  They provide a direct view of dissipation and radiative processes in relativistic collisionless plasmas.  Recent observations of rapid intense flares imply that the emitting regions are very compact and propagate with much higher Lorentz factors than the bulk jet values deduced from radio observations.  A semi-analytical model using localized, relativistic sub-flows, called minijets, has reproduced the main features of flaring blazars, but is based on crude approximations.  This project will use a new, fully radiative Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code to study collisionless reconnection in relativistic plasmas, including the effects that plasma magnetization, the strength of the magnetic guide field, and the plasma composition, can have on bulk plasma motions, particle acceleration, and radiative signatures.  Simulated time-dependent spectra will be compared to existing data.  The puzzling gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula cannot be due to shock acceleration or any other magnetohydrodynamic process, and this research team's comprehensive model is the first compelling case for reconnection as the main dissipation mechanism in a distant astrophysical system.  The present work will study the bulk kinematics of relativistic reconnection outflows, the effects of plasma composition on reconnection outflows, and radiation processes in these self-same outflows.  These will be the first kinetic simulations to model relativistic reconnection in an electron-ion plasma, and among the first to treat radiative losses self-consistently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The powerful research tool used here will be made freely available, with all necessary documentation, test problems, diagnostic tools, and sample scripts.  The study itself applies widely not only to other astrophysical systems such as pulsar wind nebulae, gamma-ray bursts, and accretion disk coronae, but also to space physics applications and laboratory plasmas.  One postdoctoral researcher will be supported, trained, and mentored in high-performance computing and the use of simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Of all the ways black holes make themselves known, the most dramatic is the creation of powerful jets of gas that travel very close to the speed of light, sometimes traversing millions of light-years.  When seen end-on in objects called "blazars", these jets produce intense, flickering radiation at all wavelengths.  The investigating team used a powerful new computer code to study how this radiation is produced, what it tells us about the magnetic field thought to propel these jets, and how this magnetic field interacts with the black hole's intense gravitational field.   Because these jets of gas are so dilute, they form a nearly collisionless plasma in which individual particles (electrons and protons, or electrons and anti-electrons, i.e., positrons) interact with background electromagnetic fields rather than with each other.  To track the behaviors of these particles, the team used the technique of Particle-In-Cell simulation on large supercomputers, following as many as 200 billion particles at a time.  What made their code unique was its ability to simultaneously calculate the radiation emitted by the particles as they exchange energy with their surroundings.  The team used several different starting points for their simulations, including a well-ordered system of electric currents leading to the systematic dissipation of magnetic energy - a process called "magnetic reconnection" - and turbulence driven by fluctuating external forces, which leads to more chaotic dissipation.  Surprisingly, all cases studied led to a similar energy separation between the bulk of the plasma, which was heated steadily, and a sizable minority of the particles that acquired a "nonthermal" energy share far larger than the mean.  The team discovered that the properties of this nonthermal "tail" of high-energy particles depend mainly on the ratio of the magnetic energy to the energy of the gas particles, and that it seems capable of explaining the fluctuating gamma rays emanating from blazar jets.  By analyzing their simulation results, the team derived several empirical formulae describing the relative numbers of particles with different energies, the fraction of energy going into electrons vs. protons, and the effects of changing the strength of the background magnetic field.  Results from these simulations are also applicable to other astrophysical systems, including the disks of hot gas surrounding black holes in the process of swallowing matter, and the magnetized bubbles inflated by pulsars - strongly magnetized, spinning neutron stars - as they spin down.  In addition to its intellectual merit described above, this project contributed more broadly through training a number of graduate students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral researchers, who gained valuable skills and insights into the design and implementation of large-scale numerical experiments in the rapidly-developing field of plasma astrophysics.  Several of these participants have gone on to specialize further in this area, joining the still-small cohort of young scientists pushing this field ahead.  The team made their code package, Zeltron, freely available to the community, along with documentation and diagnostic tools, thus potentially stimulating an even broader range of applications.
