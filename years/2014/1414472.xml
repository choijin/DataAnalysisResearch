<AbstractNarration>The project will enable students to defray the costs of traveling to and attending the 41st International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA-41), to be held June 14-18, 2014, in Minneapolis, MN. ISCA is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This&lt;br/&gt;symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips, and systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have two primary broader impacts. First, the ISCA conference will be strengthened as a result of the greater attendance that this travel support will enable. Second, those students receiving travel support will personally benefit from the opportunity to interact with peers and experts, as well as establish connections that will help their professional careers. More broadly, we expect additional indirect impacts. First, the available support will be widely advertised in order to attract women and under-represented minority groups (through postings on computer architecture web-sites and mailing lists). Second, by focusing on students, the project will help foster the mentoring of subsequent generations of computer architects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips, and systems. The purpose of this grant was to support student travel to attend ISCA-41.  Such travel enriches the conference, exposes students to the latest scientific findings in the field, and helps educate the next generation of scholars and practitioners in the field.  It also provides support for under-represented groups to attend the conference.  Approximately 150 students from around the world applied for a student travel grant to ISCA.  The total sponsorship totalled $48000 with $15000 coming from the National Science Foundation.  All eligible students were provided some support to attend the conference.  On average, students received approximately $312 on average to defray their travel expenses.  The award from the National Science Foundation supported the partial travel costs of 49 US citizens or students.   Among these students, 6% were hispanic, 41% were women, and 2% were undergraduates involved in research.   Some students did not report their ethnicity so these percentages may be underestimated.  The average award amount provided per student with NSF funding was $293.  The US students supported by this grant will likely seek employment at US corporations, universities, and government research labs. Hence, the travel awards made possible by this grant helps contribute to the creation and retention of a highly trained, diverse, and capable IT work force which is critical for continued economic growth.
