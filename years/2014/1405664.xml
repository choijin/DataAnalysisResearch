<AbstractNarration>The project is a collaborative effort among Columbia University, U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Passaic County Community College, and Centralia College to develop, evaluate and refine undergraduate science and mathematical modules based on applications of tree rings to age dating, climate and environmental change, volcanic hazards, statistical modeling, and forensic science. Interactive multi-media modules are being made available through a website and are accompanied by background material and guidelines for flexible use to instructor adoption. Students can measure tree-ring widths virtually and/or use datasets to conduct inquiry-based investigations and quantitative analyses, with an emphasis on learning the process of science. The project is also conducting faculty-development workshops at the partnering institutions, and undertaking rigorous evaluation of learning outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in its innovative approach to leveraging the readily grasped basic premise and wide range of applicability of tree-ring science to engage students in learning scientific methods and quantitative reasoning. Broader impacts include infusion of tree-ring science in the undergraduate curriculum at the diverse partnering institutions and beyond. Skills and attitudes imparted by the modules both benefit students who go on in STEM and bolster scientific literacy among the general population.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Dendrochronologists often travel to remote regions across the world in search of old, slow growing, trees that capture the environmental conditions where they live in their annual growth rings. By studying these trees, scientists learn about environments and climates, hundreds-to-thousands of years in the past. For example, scientists have used trees from such sites to reconstruct temperature variability of the past two thousand years in the Northern Hemisphere, to place exact calendar dates on ancestral pueblos in the U.S. Southwest and to reconstruct streamflow estimates for the U.S. Colorado River. Because the basic premise of dendrochronology is so easily understandable &mdash; non-expert audiences can see climate variability through time with the naked eye by looking at tree cores &mdash; tree rings provide a wonderful window into how scientists do science and why they do it, and provide students with the opportunity to generate and evaluate relevant geoscience data and research.</p> <p>We have built five publically available labs, geared for undergraduate instructors and their students, that tap into the excitement of launching an expedition while introducing students to groundbreaking tree-ring studies that have had important societal impact. Tree-Ring Expeditions (TREX) immerses students in the field of dendrochronology and allows them to experience science as a process, as a scientist would, working within a scientific community to advance our understanding of the natural world.</p> <p>With TREX, students have the opportunity to use many of the same tools and strategies that tree-ring scientists do, including: exploring important tree-ring sites, measuring and evaluating data from those sites and using online research and analysis tools and databanks. They will also hear from scientists who led research projects through video interviews about how they got started, what motivates them, and what advice they have for undergraduate students interested in scientific careers.</p> <p>TREX was developed through a partnership of education and research professionals working in diverse teaching settings, including two community colleges, a military academy, a four-year state school, and a research institute. We developed the site to appeal to a variety of student populations and for broad adoption in existing courses. All materials have been classroom tested and assessed. The TREX website includes instructor guides, answer keys and a separate section for students that guides them through labs and provides student activity sheets to download. TREX labs are freely available to instructors and the public.
