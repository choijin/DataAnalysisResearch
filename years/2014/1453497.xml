<AbstractNarration>This project provides travel support for the IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications to be held in March 2015 in St. Louis, MO.  The conference spans many technologies that are fundamental to Cyber-Physical Systems specifically, including sensor systems, as well as the computer and information sciences more broadly. This project will fund 20 students to attend the conference, and a selection committee and process will be used to choose from potential invitees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference provides important networking opportunities for the students, and will cover technologies that are fundamental to future CPS. Ultimately, attendance and participation in conference activities including the student sessions will have strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and cyber-physical system experts.</AbstractNarration>

In particular 27 US-based students were provided travel grant to attend IEEE PerCom 2015 held in St Louis, Missouri on March 23-27, 2015; and 8 students were supported to attend IEEE PerCom 2016 held in Sydney, Australia on March 14-18, 2016. Among these 35 students, 11 were female and 2 were under-represented minority students. Five of them were undergraduate students engeged in research and a couple of them were postdoctoral fellows at early stage. All of them had valuable opportunity to listen to cutting-edge research and keynote talks; learn about state-of-the-art research and development in pervasive computing, systems and applications; participate in the PhD forum and other associted events like workshops, demo, poster, and work-inprogress sessions; and above all network with peers. They acquired professional training, motivations and skill sets to be successful in high quality research publications. In addition to creating awareness of pervasive computing research among students, they also gained inter-disciplinary research ideas in pervasive computing systems and applications, such as cyber-physical systems and smart environments.This unique experience will inspire them to go for higher edcation and/or choose academic and research careers.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/24/2016<br>      Modified by: Sajal&nbsp;K&nbsp;Das</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
