<AbstractNarration>This early-stage design and development, integrated media and research project will contribute important new understandings to the informal science learning literature by exploring science engagement on social media when integrated with broadcast television. It will help answer questions including: What does such engagement look like?  Who participates?  How and why does it happen? and What is the degree or depth of engagement?  The project builds on the previous successful work by WGBH nationally distributing the television series NOVA scienceNOW and the research expertise of EDC.  WGBH's NOVA scienceNOW program will collaborate with EDC to develop new metrics to understand how and why learners engage with science on social media. Deliverables will include six one-hour episodes of NOVA scienceNOW, short online videos, moderated online discussion events, and an online film festival. A new social Media Initiative will develop six live broadcast microblogging events, six post-broadcast online discussion events, daily social media updates, and an online film festival that will feature user generated videos.  A range of STEM content in the videos and online posts will be framed around big science and engineering questions such as animal communication and survival systems, the biology of sleep, climate change, new technologies, energy, genetics, and natural disasters.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The continued innovations and expansion of social media channels provides significant new opportunities for providing learner's access to high quality science content, researchers, and opportunities to participate in science. In the first phase of this work to deepen the evidence based understanding of how social media supports informal science engagement, NOVA and EDC will collaborate to develop new measurement instruments: (1) a Network Profile to quantitatively represent the size and activity of NOVA's social media network; (2) an Informal Science Engagement (ISE) index to measure the degree of engagement by coding and analyzing conversations and posts; (3) a Follower Profile to assess the degree of activity and the nature of the engagement; and (4) a Science Social Media Engagement survey instrument.  They will then use these measures and data collection protocols to explore whether and how the initiative might influence science engagement.  External expert reviewers with content and methodological expertise will review all aspects of the project at critical junctures. This project will contribute important new knowledge and research instruments and methods to better understand how the learning opportunities of social media channels can be realized most effectively.  This has significant potential for broad and lasting benefits to society as well as advancing the informal science learning field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NOVA Wonders is a multi-platform media project from the producers of NOVA exploring the biggest questions on the frontiers of science. From the mysteries of astrophysics to the secrets of the body to the challenges of inventing technologies that could rival&mdash;and even surpass&mdash;the abilities of the human mind, it reveals how far we’ve come in our search for answers, how we managed to get here, and how scientists hope to push our understanding of the universe even further. Along the way, we meet the remarkable people who are transforming our world and our future.     With content delivered across broadcast, digital and social platforms, the project’s total video content was viewed approximately 17 million times, reaching a range of audiences. The centerpiece of the project was a six-part PBS series which premiered on April 25, 2018 and was hosted by a team of young, charismatic scientists of color: Talithia Williams, a mathematician and statistician at Harvey Mudd College, where she builds data models about the human body and the environment; Rana El Kaliouby, a computer scientist, originally from Egypt, who studied at MIT and is developing emotion recognition technology used in artificial intelligence; and Andr&eacute; Fenton, a neuroscientist at NYU who has done pioneering research on the biology of memory.     It was our aim to bring new faces and new talent to our audience&ndash;through both the selection of the hosts as well as the scientists whose research we featured throughout the series&ndash;in order to challenge stereotypes and people’s preconceived notions about who scientists are and what they look like.  This is an overarching goal of all of NOVA’s programming: to encourage everybody, especially young people, to be able to imagine themselves as a scientist.     Each episode posed an intriguing question that scientists are investigating across a multitude of disciplines. The six episodes are:  What Are Animals Saying? What’s Living in You? Are We Alone? Can We Build a Brain? Can We Make Life? What’s the Universe Made Of?     In addition to the series and related video content, the project explored the potential of social media to promote informal STEM learning online, specifically through Facebook &amp; Twitter. Overall, our findings suggest that informal STEM learning is possible on social media, as certain styles of posting and engagement on the part of a social media facilitator can make a big difference in learning and engagement. We found that with small changes to post style, resource type, and facilitation, certain learning outcomes can be supported amongst social media users. We developed a measure of informal science learning on social media and ran a six week "live" experiment on NOVA’s social media during the NOVA Wonders broadcast to explore how to best moderate a social media space to enhance informal learning.     The team found that small changes in social media design can have a big impact on learning and engagement online. Specifically, to promote traditional engagement, small content decisions can make a big impact on engagement. Short videos outperform other posts in terms of engagement, "teaser questions" outperform other post types for total engagement and comments, and "high facilitation" by the social media manager promotes more overall engagement.     Most importantly, we found that social media managed by a more active "facilitator" better supports informal STEM learning. To achieve a "high facilitation" condition, NOVA social media managers were more present on the feed, responded to posts more actively, and asked follow-up questions in different ways to get the audience to engage more significantly. In general, high-facilitation by a social media manager supported more and different types of informal learning among social media followers, as opposed to a traditional, low-facilitation approach. In particular, with a more active facilitator, audiences were more curious, asked more questions, and were more likely to connect what they learned to other knowledge and experiences. However, traditional, "low facilitation" social media was more effective at bringing in potential additional followers; it was better at promoting "networking" through shares.     As more science communicators and media producers move to social media to disseminate their messages, it is important to know whether learning is feasible in these environments. These findings have implications for how media producers and educators can use social media to promote learning. This helps social media producers move away from focusing strictly on platform-derived analytics and instead consider how to more deeply engage their audiences to achieve their missions of enhancing STEM literacy and learning.
