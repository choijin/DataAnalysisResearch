<AbstractNarration>Arctic sea ice is undergoing significant and accelerating change, which has been observed in increasing detail over the past several decades. Stakeholders in the Arctic and beyond are impacted by the cascading effects that these changes have on resource accessibility, ecosystem health, and earth?s physical climate system. Planning mitigation and adaptation strategies requires improvements in the ability to predict the arctic climate system. Confounding predictive model development are large gaps that remain in the understanding of the role albedo feedbacks are playing in sea ice loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve the understanding the impacts of solar energy absorption and partitioning on ice mass balance by tracking Arctic Observing Network (AON) sea ice sites as they move through space and time, using the rich datasets being collected at the sites as case studies. The approach integrates AON data with measurements from prior field campaigns, atmospheric reanalysis products, and high resolution remote sensing data using a 3D resolved sea ice-ocean mixed layer coupled model. The objectives are to quantify the deposition of solar energy within a 10x10km study domain around the sites with meter-scale resolution, identify the fate of that solar energy over time (e.g. ocean storage vs. ice bottom melt vs. lateral melt), and improve the ability of our resolved scale model to represent the processes controlling solar absorption and fate. The model explicitly represents critical ice and ocean processes such as melt pond formation, brine drainage, freshwater balance, and upper ocean stratification, providing a tool for data integration that can account for all first order processes impacting radiative transfer and heat storage. Important gaps in initialization datasets will be addressed by an ensemble modeling approach. Iterative comparison of site observations with model states will inform the selection of poorly constrained initial conditions, evaluate system sensitivity, and allow testing of improved model parameterizations for processes such as pond evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Arctic is warming faster than many areas around the globe. One reason for this is because earlier melt of sea ice results in heating from greater sunlight absorption.  Melt ponds, pools of meltwater on the ice surface, are important in darkening the ice.  We seek to understand what causes ponds to start forming and find that warm, moist air blowing in from the south may play a large role.  Our study examines data from the past 18 years and uses a model of sea ice to estimate where the energy comes from that melts snow and leads to ponds forming. The model simulates the formation of melt ponds and their evolution over time by keeping track of the warming of the ice by sunlight and heating from the atmosphere.    Our model shows that sunlight is the source of most of the energy, but that pond formation is prevented by cooling from cold air passing over the surface and from infrared radiation loss to space. We find that when warming exceeds the loss of surface heat, ponds form.  We determined that reduction in and/or reversal of cooling by the air is more important in controlling melting at our coastal study site than infrared radiation loss to space.
