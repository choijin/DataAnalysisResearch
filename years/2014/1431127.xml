<AbstractNarration>Raindrops do not stay in a constant state as they fall towards the surface.  They can change shape, size, and speed.  Weather radars can measure some of these aspects, but need to rely on assumptions about others.  This project will combine observations of droplets with numerical modeling to provide researchers a better idea about how many of each size of drops there are, how the drops interact when they collide, and how the radar views the droplets.  The result will be better data for the estimation of precipitation from radars, which impacts flood forecasting and hydrology.  The project will also provide training opportunities for students, the next generation of scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will combine observational analysis with numerical models in order to increase the accuracy and completeness of rain drop sizes, oscillations, and fall speeds.  Knowledge of these quantities will enable a new evaluation of the importance of collisional-forcing of drop oscillation in moderate-to-intense rain rates.  The observations and modeling will also allow the PIs to create new "drop-by-drop" calculations of scattering matrices and polarimetric radar observables.  The observational part of the project will take place at a highly instrumented site near the University of Alabama-Hunstville campus.  The main instruments to be used will be the Meteorological Particle Spectrometer, for imaging and measurement of small drops, and the low-profile 2D-video disdrometer (2DVD) for overlap and larger drops.  Modeling work will consist of extending the "drop-by-drop" scattering methodology to include both symmetric and asymmetric shapes, the latter computations to be based on advance method-of-moments surface-integral-equation techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since 1988, the US National Weather Service has operated a network of around 160 advanced Doppler weather radars for monitoring severe weather and issue warnings, for example, of tornadoes, flash floods, etc. The last major upgrade of these radars occurred in 2013 involving dual-polarization capability which greatly enhances the ability to remotely monitor flash-flood producing storms and extreme rainfall from land-falling hurricanes. Our three-year project was focused on the factors that improve the measurement accuracy of rain intensity by such radars using advanced instruments (drop size meters or disdrometers) that measure the properties of individual raindrops such as size, shape, concentration and fall speeds. From knowledge of these properties in different rain intensities and types, the algorithms for radar estimation of rainfall rates were placed on a more solid foundation enabling greater accuracy than possible hitherto.&nbsp;Our project was aimed at understanding the differences in rain properties using two types of disdrometers which were sited in semi-arid climate of Greeley, CO and in the sub-tropical climate of Huntsville, AL. One of these disdrometers is an optical array probe (or, Meteorological Particle Spectrometer: MPS) which accurately measures the small drop end of the DSD spectrum from 0.1-1.5 mm while the second instrument is the 2D-video disdrometer that covers the size range form 0.8-8 mm (see Huntsville site in image 1). Thus, we were able to construct the complete DSD spectrum from 0.1 mm upwards to the largest drop sizes. Over 12,000 1-min averaged DSDs were obtained from the two sites. We found that the generalized gamma distribution could fit the observations with high fidelity and capture the drizzle mode and the large drop tail of the DSD as well as the frequently observed "shoulder" region in between (see image 2).&nbsp;The shapes of raindrops are very important to establish in addition to the DSD. The 2D-video disdrometer gives two orthogonal views from which the 3D shape can be reconstructed (image 3). Scattering matrices using the method-of-moments solution to the surface integral equations from both the frequently occurring symmetric (oblate) and the 3D-reconstructed asymmetric drops were superposed "drop-by-drop"&nbsp; for a highly organized line-convection embedded within a larger system. This method simulates the radar observables in a "realistic" manner and is valuable for the development of algorithms to retrieve rain rates.&nbsp;The large database of DSDs were normalized so that the underlying shape of the distribution could be studied and compared between the two climates and under various rain intensities and types. Image 4 compares the normalized shape from the outer rain bands of Irma with a 1D Monte Carlo numerical model from the German Weather Service. We have more or less established the invariance of the normalized shape which shows that the variability of the DSDs between, for example, land-falling hurricanes and mid-latitude severe storms is due to variations in mean drop size and/or rain water content and not due to differences in the normalized shape. This constraint is invaluable for, (a) developing more accurate radar-based rain intensity algorithms especially in hurricanes and tropical storms that cause devastating floods, and (b) to use radar data to retrieve the lower order moments of the DSD which we demonstrated and validated in one convective storm event mainly as proof-of-concept. The lower order moment retrievals are important as various processes that govern DSDs such as breakup, evaporation and coalescence are functions of the lower order moments.&nbsp;The raindrop fall velocity is an important property and is generally a well-defined function of drop size. But in cases of high wind gusts or turbulence we have shown that mm-sized drops can be "slowed" down by as much as 20-25% on average. In addition, the fall velocity has a Gaussian-like distribution for a given drop size (the width increases with turbulent intensity but even for light turbulence the width is finite) so the well-defined functional relation commonly used in both radar algorithms and in numerical models may not be valid.&nbsp; The main upshot is related to collisions between small drops and mid-to-large size drops which depends on their fall velocity differences and, in turn, could alter the process rates of breakup and coalescence.&nbsp;The project outcomes are detailed in eight journal articles and presented at numerous conferences. Two female PhD students were partially supported by our grant and one Hispanic student was supported for deploying two of our instruments at the Greeley, CO site. One female post-doc was given assistance in 2D-video data processing. Collaborations with colleagues from NASA/Marshall and University of Huntsville; Joanneum Research, Austria; German Weather Service; Kyungpook University, Korea and Prof. Michael Bell and his female post-doc at Colorado State University were an important factor in the successful outcomes of our grant.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/18/2019<br>      Modified by: Viswanathan&nbsp;N&nbsp;Bringi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431127/1431127_10346071_1571450528596_image_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431127/1431127_10346071_1571450528596_image_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Site in Huntsville, AL"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431127/1431127_10346071_1571450528596_image_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Site in Huntsville, AL"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Instruments sited inside wind shield.
