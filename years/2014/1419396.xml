<AbstractNarration>This is a pilot project to extend and broaden utilization of existing educational resources created with support from the NSF to each of two PIs in separate large grants 5 years ago.  The extension is through a type of course that has become ubiquitous across American colleges and universities: the "freshman seminar." The information content of the existing educational resources meets the criterion of being important and interesting to a broad spectrum of our society. The materials that underpin this pilot are broad, varied, and adaptable to local circumstance as well as extensible as new knowledge emerges. A positive characteristic of the project is that the base resources (book, video, social media outlets, web sites) exist, the delivery vehicles (freshman seminar courses) exist, a publicly visible scientist is available and interested in participating, and that scientist's MOOC on climate science will continue to be offered and could become part of local courses. This pilot project will test the response of faculty who teach environmental science courses to the opportunity of selecting freely from a rich set of materials that can be used as course building blocks. It will also examine the impact that their use has on enrolled students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Read for the Earth</em> (RFTE) takes a new approach toward climate change education. Passport to Knowledge/Geoff Haines-Stiles Productions, Inc. (P2K/GHSPi) assembled the <em>Earth: The Operators&rsquo; Manual </em>(ETOM) suite of educational resources (NSF-0917564) that are rich in scientific information, highly accessible and imbued with a message of hope , with the aim of reaching wider audiences than are typically receptive or responsive to climate change information. This collaboration between P2K/GHSPi and the National Council for Science and the Environment&rsquo;s (NCSE) Council of Environmental Deans and Directors (CEDD) tested use of these resources to affect college students&rsquo; <em>knowledge</em>, <em>attitudes</em>, and <em>behaviors</em> regarding climate change, particularly freshman and those with limited science backgrounds.</p> <p>ETOM utilizes high quality video, a book, web resources and social media to convey a consistent message about climate change and clean energy. Resources include:</p> <ul> <li>A three-part documentary (ETOM) originally aired to      millions of viewers on PBS, hosted by Penn State geoscientist and      glaciologist, Dr. Richard Alley </li> <li>The companion book, <em>Earth:      The Operators&rsquo; Manual</em> by Dr. Alley<a href="file:///G:/ETOM/Read%20for%20the%20Earth%20project%20outcomes%20report.docx#_ftn1">[1]</a></li> <li>A website (http://earththeoperatorsmanual.com/) including      access to the ETOM videos, energy use quizzes, other supplementary      materials and opportunities to act </li> <li>ETOM social media accounts including Facebook and Twitter</li> <li>Opportunities to engage with Dr. Alley via web conferences      or during campus visits</li> <li>The Climate Adaptation Mitigation E-Learning (CAMEL)      website (http://www.camelclimatechange.org/) including articles, podcasts,      assignments, lesson plans, and other resources for educators and students      developed by NCSE/CEDD (NSF- 0950396)</li> </ul> <p>Each presents evidence for human-caused climate change, using stories of individuals and communities to humanize the issues facing our planet and to highlight efforts to combat climate change. The earlier ETOM grant provided for the use of these materials in informal learning environments. RFTE tested these materials in the college classroom.</p> <p>In 2014-15,<em> </em>faculty participants from many disciplines incorporated ETOM in undergraduate classes at 13 colleges and universities in 12 states. Schools included community colleges, state universities, liberal arts colleges, and tribal colleges. Class size and format varied from an intimate four-student seminar to large lecture-based courses of more than 100 students. Some classes included labs, and one was offered entirely online. This variety helped test the ETOM resources in a wide range of environments.&nbsp; Three classes interacted with Dr. Alley via web conferences (Google Hangouts). A total of 1,225 students participated, plus thousands enrolled in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) organized by Penn State University and Coursera. Weber State University hosted Dr. Alley for a live talk.&nbsp; Most classes involved consisted predominantly of freshman. All but one faculty member estimated that at least 50% of their students were non-science majors with limited science backgrounds.</p> <div> <p>ETOM was well-received by students and professors, who appreciated its clear and concise scientific explanations, optimistic outlook, and non-partisan approach. These features set ETOM apart from other educational materials on climate change and helped make ETOM successful in the classroom. While many college freshmen already accepted the science of man-made climate change, ETOM helped improve their understanding of how it works and what people can do about it.</p> <p>The professors were all very pleased with ETOM.&nbsp; Professors and their students appreciated that the resources carry a hopeful tone despite the serious subject matter. Faculty liked that the science content was appropriate for their students, especially freshman students with limited science backgrounds. Faculty commended the way that the resources are geared toward a wide range of audiences, including people with different political leanings or who might not otherwise be receptive to climate change being linked to human causes.</p> <p>593 pre-surveys and 491 post-surveys of students were collected and matched to assess changes in content knowledge, attitudes, and reported behaviors. Questions about perspectives demonstrated that most students already understood that climate change is man-made and that action is needed. Students reported significantly increased frequencies of positive behaviors related to climate change with more students having discussed climate change with their friends or family, participated in a public meeting or event, volunteered for a climate change organization, and changed their personal behaviors to lessen their impact on climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp; 92% of the students said they would recommend ETOM to other students. Students liked the range of perspectives including positive outlooks for the planet. Comments from military personnel in the ETOM videos impressed some students and professors.</p> <p>Overall, <em>Read for the Earth </em>demonstrated that the ETOM materials are a valuable contribution to the educational resources available on climate change and have great potential for shaping students&rsquo; scientific understanding and positive attitudes in a wide range of college settings. A blended approach that combines content of different media engages students. The project shows that undergraduate students without much scientific background can learn about climate change and climate solutions to help be a part of a clean energy future.</p> <br />  <hr size="1" /> <div> <p><a href="file:///G:/ETOM/Read%20for%20the%20Earth%20project%20outcomes%20report.docx#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Alley, R.
