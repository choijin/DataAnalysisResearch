<AbstractNarration>Measurements and chemical analysis of super-micron (greater than 1 micrometer) sized particles in the atmosphere are being made as part of the aircraft-based Wintertime Investigation of Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER) field campaign, scheduled to take place during January and February 2015. An important goal of the WINTER campaign is to characterize the multiphase chemical processing and transport of air emissions over the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic US during wintertime. These data, when combined with the measurements being made by other campaign investigators, are expected to provide unique insight into the chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere during the winter months This research is relevant to the development and optimization of models used for predicting air quality and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical analysis of the aerosol samples will provide data on the concentrations of soluble ions (chloride, nitrate, sulfate, oxalate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium and calcium) in the atmosphere. The abundance and distribution of aerosol chloride can play a critical role in the production of nitryl chloride (ClNO2) and influence regional atmospheric photochemistry. Supermicron sea salt and dust particles can serve as strong sinks for gas phase nitric and sulfuric acids and influence the chemical cycling of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, possibly competing with processes leading to new particle formation. The combined results from the WINTER campaign will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the year-round fate of anthropogenic pollutant emissions in the atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Wintertime Investigation of Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER) was an NSF sponsored airborne atmospheric chemistry campaign in February-March 2015. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Center C-130 was deployed to Virginia to conduct 13 research flights studying the emissions from major cities, large power plants, and oil and gas extraction activities throughout the eastern US.  The primary objective of WINTER was to investigate what happens chemically to these emissions during the winter season when the colder and darker conditions greatly reduce emissions from vegetation, and the abundance of the hydroxyl radical (a very short lived species that attacks many atmospheric pollutants, but need sunshine and water vapor to be made) is also much lower than it is during summer.  The WINTER team suspected that less abundant, and less well-studied, radicals like NO3 and ClNO2, which are known to be present and active oxidants at night, would assume a proportionally larger role in transforming pollutants into other compounds during the winter season.  It is believed that ClNO2 is mainly formed on atmospheric particles.  Likewise, NO3 can react to make dinitrogen pentoxide which can go on to produce nitric acid (the main atmospheric sink for nitrogen oxides.) This critical final step also requires a particle surface for the reaction to occur.     In addition to a full suite of gas phase instruments the WINTER payload included several instruments to count atmospheric particles and determine their size distribution, and three experiments to measure the composition of the particles.  The particle into liquid sampler (PILS) and the aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) both determine the composition of fine (diameter less than 1 micron) particles, while our (UNH) filter-based bulk-particle sampling technique collects fine and coarse (up to 4 micron diameter) particles.     By comparison between fine and bulk measurements, we found that coarse (greater than 1 micron) sea-salt particles were abundant in the lowest km of the atmosphere everywhere that was sampled during WINTER, and there was very little fine sea-salt.  When the airplane sampled urban pollution plumes over the North Atlantic Ocean we found evidence for reaction between sea-salt particles and acids, displacing chloride from the particles into the gas phase.  The amount of chloride "missing" from the coarse sea-salt was strongly correlated with the abundance of gas phase hydrochloric acid and ClNO2 observed at the same time, supporting the theoretical understanding of ClNO2 formation.      We also found that aerosol nitrate was more abundant than nitric acid early in the WINTER campaign, in sharp contrast to summer time experiments in the same region when nitric acid was overwhelmingly dominant.  By the end of WINTER nitric acid became more abundant, but there was still much more aerosol nitrate than during summer.  These differences can be explained by a combination of temperature and the abundance of the hydroxyl radical.     Further analyses of the entire WINTER data set are very much ongoing, targeting deeper understanding of the fate of pollutants emitted during winter.
