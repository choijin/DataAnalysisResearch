<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The development of new materials for advanced technologies usually requires that a large number of different samples be synthesized and tested one by one to find those best suited for the intended application.  An alternative to this often-tedious process is to produce a material incorporating a chemical gradient in which the composition gradually varies along a single sample. The speed at which optimum new materials are developed and identified is thus greatly enhanced.  These rapid-throughput-screening applications of chemical gradients find possible utility in the development of better catalysts for production of pharmaceuticals, plastics, lubricants and fuels and in the fabrication of surfaces with adhesion properties tailored for the attachment and growth of biological tissues.  Chemical gradients also find direct utility in the separation of specific components from complex chemical mixtures and in guiding the delivery of liquids, chemical precursors and cells in miniaturized chemical devices and sensors.  For all such applications, the gradients to be employed must have well defined chemical and physical properties.  Ideally, they would exhibit gradual, monotonic compositional and properties variations extending from the macroscale down to molecule levels.  In reality, such idyllic character seldom exists. Unexpected properties variations may arise from the spontaneous separation of the gradient components during preparation, producing materials that exhibit stepwise rather than gradual properties variations, and limit the participation of often-desirable cooperative interactions.  These attributes make gradient materials uniquely more complex and valuable than either single component materials or uniform nongradient films prepared from identical precursors. This activity emphasizes exploration of the chemical and physical complexity of organosilane gradients prepared by novel wet-chemical methods recently developed by the principal investigator's groups. The outcomes will lead to development of gradients having better understood and better controlled properties that can be more effectively implemented in advanced materials.  The synergy between the collaborating groups will lead to the enhanced training of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art materials synthesis and their characterization by advanced chemical imaging methods.  These students will be actively mentored by both investigators and will participate in a summer exchange program between the two campuses and weekly web conferences to broaden their educational, scientific and career horizons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;With the support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Material Research, the principal investigators will (1) investigate the extent to which phase separation and synergistic interactions occur along multicomponent organosilane gradients prepared by the sol-gel process and (2) evaluate the sizes and compositions of the resulting domains. Materials to be investigated will include multicomponent polarity, acidity, charge and dopant gradients derived from different organoalkoxysilane precursors.  Over the long term, the impacts of nanometer-to-micrometer scale phase separation and cooperative interactions on the macroscopic properties of these gradients will be explored. Gradient composition will be characterized on multiple length scales (micrometer-to-millimeter) by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman mapping.   All three will yield quantitative data on the distance scales over which gradient composition varies and will allow for the chemical origins of any cooperative effects to be fully understood. Single molecule superlocalization microscopy will be used to probe the gradients on nanometer length scales and to elucidate cooperative interactions between the gradient components themselves as well as between a probe molecule and the film components. Quantitative data on materials polarity will be obtained through implementation of unique single molecule level measurements of the local dielectric constant of the films.  In all cases, results from the gradients will be compared to those from uniform nongradient samples.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical gradients are ubiquitous in nature, driving many phenomena critical to life.  They have also been used in a broad range of technological applications such as a means to guide motion on a surface or as new media for chemical separations.  By definition, chemical gradients must contain at least two components.  In many cases, it is assumed the gradient surface behaves as a simple mixture, with properties defined by those of the pure individual components. In reality, this may not be the case.  More fundamentally and technologically interesting materials are formed when the different functional groups work together to yield emergent activity that cannot be achieved when the components act independently. One important goal of this work was to explore two important phenomena on gradient thin films and surfaces prepared by sol-gel methods:  (1) the occurrence and consequences of component phase separation along multicomponent gradients and (2) to identify and explore cooperative interactions between neighboring functionalities along multicomponent silane gradients.   During the course of this work, we have fabricated acid-base multi-component silane gradients containing weakly basic groups (-NH2) and acidic groups (SiOH; -SO3H). Very different surface chemistry was obtained depending on whether the individual groups neighbor each other (align) or are on opposite ends of the substrate (oppose).   Aligned multi-component gradients demonstrate the most interesting behavior because the individual functional groups are in close proximity to each other along the entire length of the substrate.  We have demonstrated that these acidic and basic groups act together to define the local surface charge and simple chemical equilibrium models can be used to predict the specific characteristics of the charge distribution across the surface. We have also shown that infusion order is important as is the hydrophobicity of the underlying substrate. We have also developed approaches for studying such materials including electrokinetic measurements to evaluate surface charge and the Wilhelmy plate dynamic contact angle to explore wettability and microscale heterogeneity.  Working with our collaborators, we demonstrated the broader utility of organosilane-based gradients by showing they could be used to elongate and align DNA molecules by deposition from aqueous droplets that spontaneously moved down the gradient, that DNA molecules could be captured, stored, and released from certain charge gradients prepared on electrode surfaces by application of an electrical potential, and have promise in the field of chemical separations.  This work has served as an important interdisciplinary and enhanced training ground for students in chemistry, material science, and analytical science.
