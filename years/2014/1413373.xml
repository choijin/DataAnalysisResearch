<AbstractNarration>X-ray crystallography is the gold standard for determining molecular structures such as DNAs and proteins.  However, the trouble of growing crystals for macromolecules has become the main bottleneck in crystallography.  An alternative technology called X-ray coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) has the potential of determining noncrystalline structures of single macromolecules.  An essential part of CDI is to solve the mathematical problem called phase retrieval for noncrystalline structures, in order to recover the phase information destroyed by the photon detection process.  The investigator studies the random mask method as a way to recover this information.  Because detection and reconstruction of an optical signal after it has propagated some distance is a basic procedure in optical communication and information processing, effective and efficient phase retrieval for noncrystalline structures can affect not only the development of CDI but also progress on some of the National Research Council Grand Challenge Questions raised in the 2012 report "Optics and Photonics: Essential Technologies for Our Nation."  Graduate students are trained in the course of this project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project focuses on developing the mathematical foundation and numerical schemes for the random mask method (RMM) to enhance the performance of current CDI.  RMM is a quantitative coded-aperture imaging technique that employs a random mask in photon detection and exploits the mask effect in reconstruction.  The investigator and his colleagues study RMM's potential for significant performance gains in the following aspects: accurate reconstruction, efficient computation, improved data quality, and reduction of demand for data and prior knowledge, all of central importance to the ultimate impact of CDI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project develops the theory and algorithms for exploiting the intriguing effects of using random masks in  coherent diffractive imaging (CDI), an imaging modality that uses no  lens, measures wave intensities only (i.e. no phase) and heavily relies on computational techniques for reconstruction.  Due to the simplicity of the measurement set-up   and hardware requirement (Figure 1), CDI holds great potential for imaging across many scales  from single molecules to bulk materials.    In theoretical and computational studies we have established rigorously that the use of a random mask results in significant  performance boost in data quality, reconstruction accuracy, computational efficiency, data and prior information reduction.   A striking finding is that a near minimum number of  binary sensors with any threshold in an explicitly defined range are capable of collecting  sufficient information for fast, simple reconstruction of reasonable quality, indicating a lower level of data and hardware requirements than previously realized. This theoretically and empirically verified method then provides an excellent initialization for more accurate reconstruction  (Figure 2).    These advances open the door to tackling other uncertainties in CDI such as  unknown random mask  and unknown object orientations. For example, if we scan the unknown mask throughout an extended object under a well-defined set of conditions that we have established, then we can leverage  the coupling between the adjacent scans  to reconstruct  both the object and the unknown mask simultaneously (a.k.a blind ptychography).    One of the most interesting features of our ptychographic schemes is the presence of certain irregularity in the scanning positions, implying that the standard raster scan is a poor choice and should be avoided (Figure 3).  Informed by the measurement conditions that we have analyzed, our algorithms have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction.    In summary, we have proposed and analyzed rigorously fast convergent algorithms for CDI, in particular a novel method for initialization. We have established first rigorous  theory for blind ptychography and characterized a class of scanning schemes for optimizing the ptychographic measurements. We have also proposed and analyzed novel algorithms for blind ptychography that outperform the existing ones in the literature.
