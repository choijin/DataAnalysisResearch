<AbstractNarration>Heart disease is responsible for 24.2% of the deaths in Unites States in 2010, and annual economic costs related to heart diseases are around $448.5 billion in the Unites States. Smart cardiac care calls for on-line monitoring, early identification of disease patterns and timely delivery of life-saving preventive care. Real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) contains a wealth of information on cardiac dynamics. Realizing the promise of ECG sensing, however, depends to a great extent on the advancement in information processing methodologies. Existing methodologies increasingly fail to address fundamental issues important to patient-centered care. The proposed technology, Mobile and E-network Smart Health (MESH), advances cardiac telemedicine with wireless sensors, smart mobile devices, and big data analytics. Specifically, the proposed technology enables mobile-based ECG sensing and network-based information processing for anyone, anytime and anywhere (especially in rural areas and developing countries).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MESH technology supplies in-situ information processing capabilities, and enables physicians to access the patients' ECG signals in real time, remotely interact with patients and rapidly respond to life-threatening cardiac disorders. The MESH technology will overcome critical technological barriers in the early identification of acute cardiac events, personalized cardiac monitoring, and smarter management of heart health. The MESH technology will bring the ECG to people's daily life and raise the public awareness of smarter health and wellbeing.</AbstractNarration>
