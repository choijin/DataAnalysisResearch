<AbstractNarration>As the Internet grows in importance, it is vital to develop methods and techniques for educating end-users to improve their awareness of online privacy. However, the development of Web-based education tools for online privacy is still in the early stage.  Traditional solutions involving professionals can make the tool development costly. It is also not clear how motivating, inspiring, and/or effective these education tools are to general users, especially novice users who have rarely dealt with privacy issues.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through interdisciplinary research between a computer scientist and two social scientists, this project aims to exploit both group-sourcing and crowdsourcing approaches to develop effective education tools for online privacy. Research activities include: (1) designing novel methods to generate collective wisdom from non-expert user groups for the development of innovative ideas of privacy education tools; (2) investigating the main characteristics of a wise group that is capable of developing creative and high-quality ideas for privacy training; (3) developing methods to enhance the originality and practicality of the ideas generated by the non-expert groups; and (4) integrating group-sourcing, crowdsourcing, and experts' opinions to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed privacy training tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary, high-risk, high-payoff project will dramatically advance  research in security/privacy and social science. The research results will be disseminated broadly through curricular materials appropriate for computer science, College of Arts and Letters, and MBA students.</AbstractNarration>

Web-based education tools have been proven effective in many domains and have been increasingly adopted by many online professional and educational services. However, the development of Web-based education tools for online privacy is still in the early stages.

The traditional solutions always involve privacy experts who have sophisticated expertise, deep technical skills, as well as broad experience.

The project focuses on the privacy issues of three popular Internet application scenarios: social networking, cloud computing, and mobile computing. The theoretical significance is that the proposal advances the field by addressing four important issues that have not been explored extensively.

Second, it investigates the main characteristics of a <em>wise </em>crowd that is capable of developing creative and high-quality ideas for privacy training. Third, it develops various methods to enhance the originality and the practicality of the crowd-generated ideas.
