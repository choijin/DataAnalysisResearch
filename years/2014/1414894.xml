<AbstractNarration>A class of origami structures called origami tessellations is formed by taking small, simple 'tiles' of folds and arranging these into design patterns. These patterns can then fold into surface structures which - thanks to their tiled design - exhibit exotic geometric and mechanical behaviors. For example, the Miura Ori pattern is a simple tessellation that, when folded into a surface structure, can only deform to surfaces shaped like saddles. This particular pattern was used to send a deployable solar panel into space. More complicated patterns can deform into surfaces shaped like spheres, saddles and other combinations. This research will investigate the geometric and mechanical behavior of surface structures designed by origami folds. This research will be done in collaboration with Dr. Yasushi Yamaguchi and Dr. Tomohiro Tachi at the University of Tokyo in Japan. Dr. Yamaguchi leads a computer graphics lab with on-going projects in computational origami and Dr. Tachi is a leading researcher in the field of computational origami and origami tessellations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on developing analytic and computational models of the kinematics and mechanics of tessellated origami structures. These methods will be used to to simulate the 3D flexibility and to compute the mechanical properties of tessellated structures. Additionally, this project will develop techniques to design modified tessellated patterns that, when folded, form structures that approximate a surface with arbitrary curvature. The project's ultimate goal is to encourage the application of these structures to problems in design and architecture, soft robotic systems, and deployable space-bound payloads. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
