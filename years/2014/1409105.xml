<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate the preparation and characterization of advanced nanostructured materials whose structures are formed from polymers using novel non-equilibrium conditions. Such non-equilibrium processes allow access e.g. to new materials that have graded or asymmetric structures required in water-filtration membranes, which are not accessible via equilibrium routes. These new materials may have major impact in areas of separation, catalysis, and energy conversion and storage. This interdisciplinary research program includes chemical synthesis, characterization of the materials using various microscopic and scattering techniques, and membrane-performance tests.  It will also promote  interdisciplinary teaching, training, and learning for students of all levels. The program will involve other components of training and development of human resources, including the participation of underrepresented groups, enhancement of the infrastructure for research and education, and industrial outreach. To this end, the PI will also utilize the platform provided by the NSF-funded Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR). Efforts will include promotion of materials science and engineering to high school teachers and outreach aimed at broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a program on block-copolymer-directed hybrid nanostructures, the PI will investigate the synthesis/preparation and characterization of polymer-directed nanostructured materials using formation principles which move away from equilibrium towards non-equilibrium conditions. Three distinct bottom-up-type self-assembly approaches will be pursued, all employing various ABC triblock terpolymers as structure-directing agents of metals, oxides, and organic additives. The aim of this  program is to understand the underlying fundamental chemical, physical, and kinetic formation principles enabling general and relatively inexpensive wet-polymer chemistry methodologies for the efficient creation of multiscale functional materials with novel property profiles. The proposed research includes synthesis of all components, characterization of assembly structures using various scattering and electron microscopy techniques, as well as study of specific properties including membrane performance tests. Interdisciplinarity will be a central feature of the effort. It will be promoted by various collaborations as well as by the use of national facilities such as the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and the Nanofabrication Facility (CNF).</AbstractNarration>
