<AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this project is to provide a novel multidisciplinary research and education experience for rising sophomore, junior and senior undergraduates in the area of Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices.  Research in Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices focuses on the novel design of architectures that interact with biological systems and promote a desired response.  These advanced architectures have numerous applications including tissue engineering, sensing systems, and drug delivery.  Students will be recruited from various undergraduate disciplines including engineering, biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics.   Surrounding the University of Kentucky are numerous regional colleges and universities that have no graduate programs in these areas.  Recruitment at these institutions will encourage students that may not otherwise pursue an advanced degree.   In addition, recruitment for the program will focus on national institutions that do not have graduate programs.  Special efforts will be made to attract women and minorities to this program by recruiting at minority institutions and publicizing the program at national meetings of minority and women organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers.  Students accepted into the program will work closely with faculty and graduate students who are currently engaged in collaborative, cross-disciplinary research. The proposed REU program builds on these successful collaborations and integrates them with other educational components, such as seminars, workshops, and other technical and social activities.  The students will be exposed to the excitement of interdisciplinary research and by the end of the program will have an excellent knowledge of what is involved in graduate research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of Engineered Bioactive Interfaces focuses on the novel design of architectures that interact with biological systems and promote a desired response.   The need for this cross-disciplinary interaction between investigators working in biological systems and those creating novel engineered synthetic architectures has long been recognized.   These advanced architectures have numerous applications ranging from tissue engineering to sensing systems to drug delivery.   Successful development of these systems will depend on expertise not only in developing novel synthetic architectures through nanotechnology, self-assembly and hybrid systems but also on the interactions of these interfaces with biological systems such as cells and proteins.   As part of the REU program, the undergraduate students will have the opportunity to learn about three cross-disciplinary research themes that form the foundation of the research in this area.  These areas include 1) "Novel Bioactive Architectures", 2) "Cell/Protein Interactions at Interfaces", and 3) "Integration into Devices".  The students will work closely with faculty and graduate students who are currently engaged in collaborative, cross-disciplinary research across these three themes further supporting a highly multidisciplinary team research approach.  This REU Program will not only provide the students with true interdisciplinary mentoring and research training but will also stimulate the students' interests in Ph.D. careers in science and engineering through seminars, field trips and interactions with both graduate students and faculty, and will develop the students independence and confidence through participation in research and presentations both in house and at scientific meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acknowledgements:  Support for this Program is provided by the National Science Foundation's Division of Engineering Education and Centers.</AbstractNarration>

The REU students also met with  their graduate student mentor every other week in an informal setting  during lunch so that they had the opportunity to discuss informally any  concerns or questions they had about career opportunities, graduate  school or the progression of their research.  Each student was  also required to present a research update.   These sessions occurred at the middle of the program.  The  students presented their research progress to date and also discussed  challenges that they had encountered.    Finally, all REU students participated in a poster competition/awards  banquet at the end of the program.  The REU students also attended a  seminar each week to learn about various aspects related to graduate  school and research.  Finally, the students participated in outside activities including a  tour of Alltech Biotechnology and a number of social activities.  The program ended with a poster  competition and awards banquet.  The students were encouraged to invite their parents and  other family.  Each student received a certificate for  participating in the program and other awards were given such as best  poster, best blog and best research update.   Each year, we successfully recruited 12 - 16  outstanding students to our REU Program.  The average GPA of these  students was a 3.8.  The students came from universities all over  the nation and schools were targeted where students may not receive a research opportunity.   A large percentage of the participants (60%) were women and (30%) were  either African American, Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander.   One  of the major objectives of this program is to stimulate the students?  interests in Ph.D. careers in science and engineering.  Prior to participating in the REU program, 40% said they were definitely  going to graduate school and the rest said they were not certain.

As part of the REU Program, each  student was provided with $800 to attend a scientific conference to  present his or her research.  The majority of the students took  advantage of this opportunity and presented at least one oral or poster  presentation at a regional or national meeting.  A number of them won  awards in oral or poster competitions .          Last Modified: 06/06/2019       Submitted by: Kimberly W Anderson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
