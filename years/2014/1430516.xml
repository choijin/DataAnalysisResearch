<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation improvement grant will support the investigator, a PhD candidate, to engage in a study of home security devices using participant observation and interviews. She will address how moral norms are configured into devices, how the home as a physical space and domestic sphere is affected by the design of home security products, and how risk is made material and intelligible through home security devices. Through an examination of this technology, she will also address the much broader question of insecurity and how home security technology serves as a defense against a sizable number and variety of threats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute insights for better understanding how norms are configured into other technologies, particularly those that are designed to promote other prudential, individualistic ends, and how the resulting technologies in turn have an impact on societal norms. These are plausible, broader benefits of the results of this study to society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In contemporary Japan, the once proverbial truth "mizu to anzen wa tada" (water and safety are free) is, more often than not, either heard in the negative, or relegated to a position of skepticism. While lauded internationally as a preeminently "safe society" by OECD and Global Peace Index rankings, the designation no longer accurately reflects the national mood. Instead, shifts in crime trends coupled with high profile tragedies have contributed to a broad atmosphere of fuan (insecurity), further propped up by the mass media. Consequently, the phrase now suggests a yearning for a long-gone Japan, real or imagined, its utopian vision of free-flowing safety standing in contrast to the contemporary "jidai" (age)&mdash; an age where you must protect yourself.   Japan is commonly known for its stable, low crime rates since postwar recovery. In 1996, however, Japan?s national crime rate increased, the total jumping from 1,782,944 cases in 1995 to 1,812,119 known criminal offenses the following year (National Police Agency). It may have only been a 1% increase, but it set off an unwelcome trend that lasted until its peak in 2002. This project examined a society changed, first, by altered perceptions of Japanese safety directly connected to the period following ?96, and second, by the very initiatives (public and private) that successfully curbed crime. Safety is no longer a presumed given, but a sought-after entity, often tied to material forms of security.
