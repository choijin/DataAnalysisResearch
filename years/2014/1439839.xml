<AbstractNarration>Developing more, highly qualified science and mathematics teachers is a national priority. Through funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Phase II Noyce project will continue much of the work initiated in Newberry College's Phase I Noyce award.  This Recruit and Engage--Mathematics AND Science Teachers (RE-MAST) Phase II project will produce nine to sixteen additional STEM teachers over the course of the next five years, add leadership and mentor training for all parties in the project, and also conduct a longitudinal study of factors that contribute to Noyce Scholar recipients' pre- and in-service effectiveness and their persistence and leadership in the teaching profession.  In this Phase II project, Newberry College will partner with the Retain and Empower Teachers through Action, Innovation, and Networking (RETAIN) Center of Excellence, a state-supported research hub focused on teacher retention, which is currently housed at Newberry College.  The partner school districts of Fairfield, Newberry, Lexington, and Richland Counties in South Carolina will provide diverse settings for Noyce Scholars to explore and experience teaching, while at the same time benefitting from the number of nascent STEM teachers with solid backgrounds in science and/or mathematics, pedagogical skills and dispositions of determination for the potential of each student in their classrooms to learn consequential mathematics and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific activities of the RE-MAST Phase II project include 1) recruiting nine to sixteen additional STEM majors into teaching; 2) delivering educational supports for Noyce Scholars; 3) providing professional development opportunities for Mentors, Noyce Teaching Fellows (former Noyce Scholars), and grant personnel; and 4) pursuing a rigorous research agenda related to teacher retention, or persistence of mathematics and science teachers in the teaching profession. This research study will examine factors at both the program level and the Noyce Scholar level.  The project is explicit in its intent to benefit others through the sharing of research derivatives, including protocols, instruments, and professional development materials appropriate for use by practicing school professionals and teacher educators, as well as through scholarly publication of results and findings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the REMAST project were to recruit 9 to 16 additional STEM majors into teaching and to provide them educational support.  Professional Development opportunities were offered to all of those associated with REMAST.  Teacher retention and persistence were studied for the previous REMAST grant award.  The recruitment goal was met by year three and 80% of the in-service REMAST teachers were teaching in high-need SC schools.  In addition to providing preparation materials for the Praxis content exams, creative educational opportunities were provided to Scholars to increase the amount of exposure and experience in secondary education settings.   Opportunities included serving as judges for the Science Olympiad, hosting Homeschool Chemistry Days, offering special STEM-focused education courses, having opportunities for REMAST scholars to participate in the classroom of REMAST Teaching Fellows from the previous REMAST award, and sending REMAST Scholars with Grant personnel to discipline-specific conferences.  Besides Scholars, support and involvement of the REMAST Teaching Fellows (in-service teachers from the previous REMAST award during 2009-2015) provided networking opportunities and support of their teaching which built confidence in their abilities. REMAST Mentor teachers from area high schools were involved to share their experiences with current and future teachers and to learn from them as well. The REMAST leadership team consisted of Newberry College faculty. The Professional Learning Community formed from this collective group of people allowed for an exchange of ideas and unsurpassed synergy within a small liberal arts college of 800-1200 students during REMAST, 2009-2021.  The monthly REMAST professional development (PD) opportunities provided comfortable networking opportunities among scholars, teaching fellows, and mentor teachers from a diverse collection of schools and districts as well as the Newberry College REMAST Leadership Team. This venue allowed everyone the time and place to share experiences, techniques, approaches, solutions, successes, and disappointments in the classroom.  National, regional, and state conference attendance within their content area in addition to educational meetings vastly expanded their view of the world and teaching thus providing additional resources for teaching. These conferences also allowed REMAST participants to see science and math applied in the real world.     As an example, the types of conference opportunities a typical chemistry major with secondary education  had included the following:  National: ASCD (previously Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development), Noyce National Conference, ChemED, American Chemical Society National Conference; Regional: Southeastern Regional Noyce, SERMACS (Southeastern Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society); Local: REMAST summer workshop, Upstate Technology Conference, local seminars and mini-conferences.  Biology and math majors had similar opportunities with discipline specific options.  The summer workshops provided a different type of experience combining a conference and training. Themes explored included primarily topics in education or technology which allowed a deeper understanding for use in the classroom.  Having the REMAST scholars paired with REMAST Teaching Fellows or REMAST Mentor Teachers during field experiences and student teaching worked extremely well to provide REMAST scholars with a solid realistic view of teaching.
