<AbstractNarration>Irish Gaelic, a Celtic language, was the language spoken by all of Ireland before English colonization, famine, emigration, and social pressures caused it to become endangered. Today it is still spoken as a community language by perhaps 70,000 to 140,000 people (between 1.5% and 3% of the population of Ireland). Despite strong governmental support, it remains endangered. Documenting the properties of Irish is a matter of urgency, both for posterity and for the purposes of teaching Irish. Today there are many more people learning Irish as a second language than as a first language, including people in the United States, where many are of Irish heritage. Such second language speakers could represent the future of the language. In this context, perhaps the most difficult feature of the Irish sound system for English speakers to learn is its palatalization contrast. Every consonant of Irish comes in two varieties, one that is palatalized - involving a supplementary tongue gesture of raising and fronting, and one that is velarized - involving a supplementary tongue gesture of raising and backing. This palatalization contrast itself is endangered and waning in the speech of younger speakers, even in Irish speaking communities, because of the heavy influence of English. As a linguistic feature more generally, palatalization is uncommon across the world's languages and of interest to understand. Yet the production of Irish palatalization and velarization has never been documented with imaging technology, and it is inadequately documented with such technology even in better-studied languages having palatalization, such as Russian. Beyond Irish, an investigation of the production of a palatalization contrast will aid in understanding why languages lose contrasts between sounds depending on things like the identity of the consonant in question (e.g., [p] vs. [t]), its position in a syllable, or the vowels that surround it. It will also provide information about how speakers coordinate rapidly shifting speech gestures and what strategies they use to maintain contrasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will gather data on the production of palatalized and velarized consonants using a portable ultrasound device. Ultrasound imaging provides direct information about tongue body shape and movement, crucial to an understanding of palatalization and velarization. The researchers will also record video of lip movement, and audio, simultaneously with the ultrasound video. Data will be gathered from all three major dialect regions of Irish (Ulster, Connacht, and Munster). The Irish participants will be professional broadcasters who work for RTÉ Radió na Gaeltachta, (the national broadcaster's Irish medium radio station). In a context in which the speaker base is rapidly declining, these participants are all considered exemplary speakers of their dialect. Because of their occupation, they are comfortable with sound technology and with speaking while being recorded. The shape of the tongue body, and of the lips, will be extracted from video and averaged by statistical means. This data will be the basis for studying the effects on the palatalization contrast of syllable position, consonant identity, etc., discussed above, as well as speaker strategies for maintaining contrast and coordinating gestures. The researchers will also compile a substantial web repository of images of the tongue body and lips during palatalized and velarized consonants. This repository will be of use to linguists and to anyone interested in learning Irish or learning about Irish.  This repository will constitute a valuable resource to phonologists and phoneticians who aim to develop a deeper understanding of articulatory contrasts involving palatalization and velarization in Irish or in other languages; it will also serve as a useful aid to students learning Irish as a second language.  In addition, the project will strengthen domestic and international scientific collaborations and will provide important training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in linguistics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Although English is the dominant language in Ireland today, the language spoken in Ireland historically was Irish (sometimes called Irish Gaelic). Irish is still used at home and in the community daily by 1-3% of people in the Republic of Ireland. Though Irish is the first official language and has strong government support, it is still a minority language in Ireland and arguably endangered.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the remarkable features of Irish is that consonants come in two varieties, which are traditionally called 'broad' and 'slender'. In linguists' terms, slender consonants are palatalized: while the consonant is being produced, there is an additional gesture of raising and fronting the tongue body. Broad consonants are velarized, involving an additional gesture of backing the tongue body. This project used ultrasound for the first time to study the production of the palatalized vs. velarized consonant distinction in Irish. Our first goal was to document the production of this distinction. Since Irish is a minority language in an English-dominant environment, and since features of Irish are at risk of being lost, documenting the language is important, particularly documenting it using both audio and video capture. We are documenting consonants as produced in all three major Irish dialect areas, Ulster, Connacht, and Munster (in the northwest, west, and southwest of Ireland respectively).</p> <p>As one outcome of the project, we are making our data accessible to the public, using the open access repository Dryad (data available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.7291/D1WC74">https://doi.org/10.7291/D1WC74</a>). This includes the raw sound files and ultrasound video, as well as some processed data to make analyses more accessible. So far we have made data from the Connacht dialect region available.</p> <p>We have also created a web site for this project that is useful both to linguists and to anyone else interested in the Irish language (<a href="https://irishpalatals.sites.ucsc.edu/">https://irishpalatals.sites.ucsc.edu/</a>), including those who want to understand how to pronounce Irish slender vs. broad consonants. This web site explains the project, explains the phenomenon we study (Irish slender and broad consonants), shares results, and explains why the project is important. The web site includes a page with example ultrasound videos showing the production of slender vs. broad consonants, along with animations that make it clearer what is happening (<a href="https://irishpalatals.sites.ucsc.edu/for-speakers/animations/">https://irishpalatals.sites.ucsc.edu/for-speakers/animations/</a>).</p> <p>Apart from its descriptive value, this project investigates a number of research questions. The project has led to two publications and several international conference presentations so far, including one in the Journal of the International Phonetic Association (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0025100317000494" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1017/S0025100317000494</a>). Several more publications are planned. Our research results so far include the following:</p> <p>1. Tongue body fronting vs. backing is used to distinguish all slender vs. broad consonants in Irish. This is true even for labial consonants (those made with the lips), even though traditional descriptions have suggested otherwise.</p> <p>2. The palatalized vs. velarized (slender vs. broad) consonant contrast in Irish is produced not just by fronting or backing the tongue body but by widening or narrowing the pharyngeal cavity.</p> <p>3. Velarized (broad) consonants in Irish are produced with a degree of lip rounding as well as tongue backing.</p> <p>4. Principal components analysis can be fruitfully used to understand the nature of a contrast involving different tongue shapes.</p> <p>Though the NSF project funding period has ended, there are more research questions we will be addressing. For example, we will compare the production of the slender vs. broad distinction in consonants at the beginning of words to that of consonants at the end of words. Across languages that have a palatalization distinction like the Irish one, that distinction is more often lost at the ends of words, so we predict differences in production that help us understand this fact. Our data will also allow us to test hypotheses about how speakers maintain and produce distinctions between sounds, and about how those strategies may depend on what precedes or follows the sound in question. We will be able to compare the production of the slender vs. broad consonant distinction across the three major Irish dialect regions. Finally, we also have video data telling us about how lip rounding contributes to maintaining the distinction between slender and broad consonants.</p> <p>Over the course of this project, seventeen undergraduate students and three graduate students have become familiar with the core methods of ultrasound research and acoustic analysis, and have gained substantive knowledge about phonetics and phonology.
