<AbstractNarration>The Red Sea is arguably the most under sampled and least understood marginal sea in the World Ocean in terms of its circulation and dynamics. This is due in large part to the difficulty of obtaining in situ oceanographic and atmospheric observations in a region that has been largely off-limits for scientific research for decades.  The large-scale circulation of the Red Sea has a significant impact on the health of its mostly pristine coral reef ecosystem, which faces a myriad of natural and anthropogenic threats. This study will contribute to the development of ocean forecast models for predicting the spread of pollutants and mitigating their negative impacts. The work also involves collaboration with international partners and support for a postdoctoral investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research is to increase understanding of the Red Sea circulation and its governing dynamics, through the analysis of observations and model output, including (1) several new unique in situ data sets of currents, water properties and air-sea fluxes, (2) time series of satellite-derived sea surface temperature, sea level anomaly and scatterometer winds and (3) recently generated numerical model products from the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model, as well as realistic and idealized configurations of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model. The research will focus on the structure and dynamics of eastern boundary currents, and the impact of narrow mountain-gap wind jets on surface circulation and air-sea fluxes. The project will also revisit an existing model in the context of an idealized numerical simulation to assess its suitability for describing the overturning circulation.</AbstractNarration>

This is due in large part to the historical difficulty of obtaining in situ oceanographic and atmospheric observations in a region that has been largely off-limits for scientific research for decades. This project analyzed several new unique in situ data sets of currents, water properties, and air-sea fluxes together with satellite observations.

A specific objective was to find out the impacts of the extreme mountain-gap wind events on the ocean surface and air-sea fluxes.      This work demonstrated that the westward wind events are a typical wintertime phenomenon and cause intense evaporation, at a rate much higher than the already high Red Sea mean evaporation. The study also found that occurrence of these extreme wind events has consistently increased over the last three decades, which is consistent with observed changes in the regional climate, and the colossal surface heat transferred from the sea to the atmosphere in these events occurs because the winds coming from the Arabian Desert are extremely dry. Thus, these wind events were called "dry-air outbreaks," in analogy to the "cold-air outbreaks" that cause extreme evaporation events off of the coast of the northeastern US when strong winds bring cold, dry air over the warm Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, the study also revealed that the dry-air outbreaks in the Red Sea are very likely to be connected with the wintertime Shamal winds that cause intense sandstorms in the Arabian/Persian Gulf, and therefore affecting the entire Middle East weather.   These outbreaks may have far-reaching impacts in both the atmosphere and ocean since evaporation is a source of moisture for the atmosphere and also control the formation of the Red Sea Overflow Water that spreads throughout the Indian Ocean and beyond.         As outcomes of this project four articles were published in the scientific literature, an article for the general public was written and published, and numerous talks have been presented in national and international meetings, as well as for non-academic audiences. Two postdocs have been trained, and the unique in situ data sets of currents, water properties, and air-sea fluxes have been made publicly available.
