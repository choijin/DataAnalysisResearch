<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be the development of an alternative, renewable route to fuels and chemicals that is based on biomass that does not compete with the food supply. The process will use underutilized feedstocks such as corn stover and forestry residue to produce fermentable sugars, which can be converted into various raw materials and finished products. The project will add to the scientific understanding of ionic liquid bioprocessing and has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate rural job creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objective of this Phase II research project is to develop an integrated process for converting lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. The process uses ionic liquids that dissolve biomass and afford monomeric sugars at high yields via a reaction that is both simple and fast. What is lacking is an affordable method for separating sugars while recycling the ionic liquid. In Phase I the project demonstrated an efficient strategy for sugar recovery. By the first half of Phase II the goal is to integrate sugar recovery into the process front end. Unit operations taking raw biomass to clean sugars and lignin will be performed in batch open loop in order to close mass balances and set a baseline for further process development. Then, the loop will be closed with the addition of ionic liquid cleaning and drying. By the end of this project, the objective is to demonstrate a stable and high-yielding process, including experimentally validated techno-economic projections showing unprecedentedly low capital and operating costs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hyrax Energy, Inc. is developing a biorefinery technology that can break down waste biomass into fermentable sugar, which can be sold to manufacturers of renewable plastics, chemicals and fuels. Thanks to NSF?s generous support, we were able to develop and design a complete process that transforms raw forestry waste into pure glucose and lignin. All process steps were operated in order to produce demonstration materials for external evaluation by partners.   Chiefly among the technical outcomes were two major inventions: (a) a separations process for  obtaining clean sugar with quantitative recovery and recycle of ionic liquid (IL); and (b) preconditioning-assisted IL hydrolysis giving several-fold improvement in biorefinery performance over the previous IL hydrolysis technology.  Our separations process enables the extraction of sugars from hydrophilic ILs and the recovery of both as pure separate streams. Hydrophilic ILs are powerful solvents with a wide range of potential applications, but lacking a recovery method until now. Preconditioning-assisted IL hydrolysis uses two inexpensive unit operations to make raw biomass more amenable to transformation. It introduces several compounding advantages, such as dramatically reducing the mechanical energy input and time required to breakdown biomass fibers into glucose, as well as simplifying downstream purification steps.  Overall, we showed that even though ILs are still considered specialty chemicals that are more expensive than common organic industrial solvents, it is entirely feasible to use them in the process without losses, therefore more than off-setting the extra materials cost through overall reductions in capital and operational cost inputs.  The integration of these two major inventions resulted in the simplest known process capable of delivering clean sugars from non-food biomass. Its simplicity justified relatively light capital requirements to build and operate a Hyrax biorefinery, similar to those necessary for US corn dry mills, yet delivering higher quality sugars. In one study, we arrived at a minimum sugar selling price per pound of 13 cents, which compares favorably to the 14 cents arrived by NREL using enzymatic hydrolysis, even though it outputs much higher purity sugars and at 1/5th of scale.
