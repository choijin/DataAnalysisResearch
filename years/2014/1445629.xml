<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Free Boundary Problems and Applications," held at the University of Pittsburgh on March 11-14, 2015. Free boundaries in mathematical models (interfaces, moving boundaries, shocks, and so on) arise in a wide range of applications in various sciences and real world problems, including gas dynamics, material sciences, geometry, complex fluids, water waves, phase transitions, mathematical finance, mathematical biology, and medicine. The breadth of the free boundary problems presents challenges and opportunities, and also leads to the development of research in different directions with unifying themes regarding methods and techniques. The aim of the conference is to bring together leading experts in various theoretical and applied aspects of free boundary problems to promote and enhance those unifying techniques, in particular, to exchange and explore ideas, to establish new connections, to foster new collaborations, and to provide training for students and junior researchers. Leading experts will speak in the conference. The program of the conference will be structured to foster integration of research and education, and to broaden opportunities and enable the participation of members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of free boundary problems has become an important aspect of nonlinear partial differential equations. Modern approaches to the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations have brought various new insights and new methods to understand the free boundary problems. New important and challenging problems have been emerging in physics, engineering, industry, material sciences, finance, biology and medicine, and other fields. The conference provides an opportunity for experts in analysis and applications to present their research results,  discuss mathematical theory and techniques critical for many research fields and applications, explore new important and challenging problems emerging in various applications,  establish new connections,  and potentially foster new collaborations among the participants. The conference also provides an opportunity for  students and junior researchers, including those from the groups underrepresented in mathematical sciences (women, minorities) to be educated in the research field and to present their recent research results. The conference will disseminate research results and promote the research area through talks, a web page, flyers, and posters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: www.math.pitt.edu/~dwang/conference2015.html</AbstractNarration>

It began with two mini-courses on the first day  on     "Compensated Compactness Method" and "Nash-Moser Method", followed by 24 research talks by senior and junior researchers from USA and abroad. The topics of the talks included compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, isometric embeddings in geometry, hyperbolic conservation laws, shock reflections, transonic flows, water waves, quasi-geostrophic equation, dynamics of fronts in nonlocal systems, tumor growth with drug application, compressible vortex sheets,  variational wave equations, nonlinear Schr#odinger equation, compressible Navier-Stokes equations, compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations, and so on.  The conference hosted 24 speakers. Nine speakers were students, postdocs, or junior researchers; and the conference provided them a platform to present their recent research results to a broad audience. The conference was well-attended, with about 60 participants. About 35 of them were students, postdocs and young researchers at the early stages of their careers, and many of them were from outside institutions. The introductory two mini-courses were accessible to graduate students, postdocs, and junior researchers. The researchers interacted through lectures and discussions. The mini-courses and research talks provided training to students, postdocs, and young researchers.  New collaborations were established among the participants during the conference.   The conference webpage was created at: http://www.math.pitt.edu/~dwang/conference2015.html.  In particular, it contains the full program of the conference including the titles and abstracts of all the talks.  In summary, the conference provided an opportunity for the speakers to present their recent research results, provided training to students/postdocs, and fostered new collaborations among the participants.
