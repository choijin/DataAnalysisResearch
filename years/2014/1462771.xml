<AbstractNarration>Carbon nanotubes are nanomaterials that are comprised entirely of carbon atoms arranged in a cylinder. The diameter of a carbon nanotube is only about 1 nanometer or 1 billionth of a meter. Carbon nanotubes are among the best conductors of electricity that have ever been discovered. They promise to increase the speed and complexity of computing devices, increase the bandwidth and energy efficiency of commercial and military wireless communications technologies, and lead to new types of unconventional electronics that are not rigid but can be stretched, rolled, and folded. To realize nanotubes' promise, researchers must first learn how to assemble them into aligned arrays on substrates. This award supports fundamental research on a recently discovered manufacturing process for achieving this goal. Inks containing semiconducting carbon nanotubes are spread into thin films on the surface of a water trough. The nanotubes deposit and align themselves on a substrate as it is withdrawn from the trough. The overarching objective of the research is to increase the uniformity and improve the organization of the nanotube arrays to open the door for large-area nanotube array manufacturing for commercial applications. These advances will benefit the U.S. economy, high-tech electronics industries, and society. Moreover, the efforts on nanomaterials metrology and manufacturing will impact the development of new undergraduate laboratories on materials characterization for engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nanotube assembly occurs via a process called floating evaporative self-assembly. The uniformity and organization of nanotubes will be improved by: (1) determining the mechanisms that direct nanotube organization during floating evaporative self-assembly; (2) controlling packing density and inter-nanotube spacing by using multifunctional polymers to wrap the nanotubes and mediate inter-nanotube interactions during assembly; and (3) developing metrology to understand the link between processing-structure-electrical properties. In preliminary research, floating evaporative self-assembly has been exploited to align arrays of ultrahigh purity semiconducting nanotubes prepared using conjugated polymers as nanotube-differentiating agents. The excellent degree of alignment and control over the packing density of the nanotubes using this method has led to gains in nanotube array field effect transistor performance of 1400x in on/off ratio (at constant conductance) and 30-100x in on-conductance (at constant on/off ratio). Increasing the uniformity of these arrays will open the door for commercial opportunities in thin film applications and macroelectronics. Further controlling the microstructure will open the door for increased conductance and commercial opportunities in high-frequency linear amplifiers and logic transistors.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are among the best semiconductors ever discovered and are tantalizing candidates for next-generation electronics. Semiconductors can be switched back and forth between electrically conducting and insulating states and are the active materials of field effect transistors, integrated circuits in the brains of computers, high-frequency electronics for cellular and military communications, plastic electronics, and sensors ? all essential to society. CNTs promise to improve the speed, energy-efficiency, bandwidth, and sensitivity of these devices, compared to currently employed semiconductors such as silicon.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite this promise, the application of CNTs in electronics has been held back for 25+ years by materials science and manufacturing roadblocks. The largest roadblocks have been that: (a) CNTs are heterogeneous and (b) it has not been possible to assemble them on a large-area scale into the ideally organized and aligned arrays that are required to fully exploit their properties in applications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Shortly before the onset of this project, our team discovered a novel yet scalable method to deposit CNTs in aligned arrays onto substrates to address challenge (b). The approach is called floating evaporative self-assembly (FESA). One advantage of FESA is that it allows for the deposition of CNTs with exceptional semiconducting electronic-type purity. Another advantage is that the CNTs are individualized and well isolated within the arrays ? critical for creating high performance electronics. During FESA, a receiving substrate is withdrawn from a water trough with control over position and velocity. A droplet of ?ink? (e.g. CNTs in water-immiscible solvent) is placed on the water surface. The ink spreads until it reaches the substrate, after which a defined band of aligned CNTs is deposited.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In this project, we studied the scientific principles that cause CNTs to align in FESA; increased the scale of FESA; discovered a continuous version of the process; exploited the process to create CNT transistors better than silicon transistors for the first time; developed improved routes for controlling CNT surface chemistry; and conducted educational outreach. Highlights of accomplishments include:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>(1) We scaled FESA to larger areas and discovered underpinning mechanisms.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We scaled FESA to deposit bands of aligned CNTs over a 25 mm by 25 mm area. The scaling was performed using an automated, custom-made apparatus. We used this apparatus and a high-speed camera to track interfaces during FESA. We discovered that three fundamental processes occur: (i) CNTs adsorb and accumulate at the water-solvent interface; (ii) diffusion and internal flows carry the CNTs along the interface towards the substrate; and, (iii) CNTs deposit onto the substrate with their long-axis oriented, aided by a flow tangential.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>(2) We invented a 2<sup>nd</sup> generation of FESA, termed tangential flow self-assembly (TaFISA), that enables the continuous deposition of aligned CNTs. </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>FESA undesirably produces alternating regions of aligned and randomly aligned CNTs because of the drop-wise nature of ink delivery. Using the knowledge gained from highlight (1), we developed a continuous version of FESA called TaFISA to homogeneously deposit aligned CNT. TaFISA is more scalable and has the potential to uniformly coat entire substrates of arbitrary size and composition with continuous arrays of aligned CNTs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>(3) We exploited FESA to realize a 7<em>x</em> gain in the performance of CNT field effect transistors, compared to CNT transistors made by other methods ? exceeding equivalent silicon transistors for the first time. </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our FESA process, along with advances in CNT sorting and improvements in CNT contacts (supported elsewhere), enabled us to create CNT transistors for the first time that exceed the performance of equivalently dimensioned silicon FETs.</p> <p><strong><br /> (4) We developed new chemistries that modify the surface of the CNTs, enable their manipulation, and then desirably degrade. </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We discovered that metal chelation can be used to remove a common polymer wrapper from FESA-assembled aligned arrays of CNTs with ~100% efficiency, desirably leaving bare CNTs for devices. Moreover, we developed a new degradable polymer using an imine link that can selectively wrap semiconducting CNTs, be used to align CNTs via FESA, and then be removed from the CNTs via decomposition. We also established the design rules for dispersants based on block copolymers (BCPs) with pyrene functionalization. These polymer dispersants were tailored to perform multiple functions, namely to: (a) solubilize CNTs, (b) debundle CNTs, and (c) lift-off CNTs following processing. All these methods importantly leave bare CNTs available for chemical or biofunctionalization.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>(5) The supported researchers led and participated in educational outreach and broader impact efforts</strong>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These efforts included volunteering at engineering open houses for the public; developing and presenting lectures on photovoltaics for the public; mentoring 7 undergraduate researchers in the laboratory ? some who have now gone onto graduate school; and, the mentoring of a high school Science Olympiad team.
