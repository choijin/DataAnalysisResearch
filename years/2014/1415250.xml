<AbstractNarration>For many decades, salmon in the Pacific Northwest have been sought after for a multitude of reasons. Due to regional declines in adults returning to their natal rivers to spawn every year, the rearing and release of hatchery salmonids has been utilized for many decades. Unfortunately, hatchery raised salmon have shown a significant decrease in home stream fidelity and impose an assortment of ecological issues due to increased interaction with wild populations. One proposed explanation for the lack of home stream fidelity in hatchery salmonids is inadequate learning of chemical cues in natal river water. The purpose of this study is to determine if the chemical nature of natal river water is altered by simple, daily hatchery operations. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Hiroshi Ueda, an expert in dissolved free amino acids (DFAA's) in salmonid imprinting and homing, at the Hokkaido University in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is well understood that salmon use olfaction to identify distinct chemical cues of natal river water when navigating to their natal rivers to spawn. However, the distinct set, or "bouquet" of chemicals that salmon use for this phenomenon has yet to be identified. Recently, considerable attention has been directed towards DFAA's as a set of molecules that salmon use to navigate and identify their natal rivers. Research has shown that salmonids possess the ability to distinguish between certain water sources based on their DFAA compositions. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) will be used to analyze the content of DFAA's in river water. By analyzing water collected from certain locations within a hatchery setting, it will be determine if current hatchery operations may significantly alter the chemical nature of their source river water. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>While it has been known for a long time that salmon remember the specific odor profile of their natal streams as juveniles, and subsequently recall this odor profile information for identifying their natal streams when returning as adults to spawn, the specific set of chemicals salmon use for this amazing feat has yet to be specifically identified. Over the last two decades, special attention has been paid to dissolved free amino acids (DFAA's) as a potential set of odorants that salmon use for home stream identification. This homing ability is very accurate and precise, but is not perfect and salmon do stray to non-natal locations on occasion. This "straying" can be beneficial in some circumstances for wild salmon, but straying of hatchery reared salmon to non-target return locations (such as their hatchery of origin) can pose several genetic and ecological threats to naturally reporducing salmon populations. During my time in Japan I analyzed water samples collected from a hatchery in Oregon for dissolved free amino acids using high-performance liquid chromatography. The premise for my study was that the potentially higher rate of straying in hatchery reared salmonids might be due, in part, to their inability to distinguish between the DFAA profiles of their target return locations and nearby natural spawning areas. My results showed no significant differences between hatchery water and adjacent river water&nbsp;in the concentration or percent composition in any of the 15 DFAA analyzed. These results suggest that the DFAA profiles of hatchery being released from a hatchery fish trap may be highly similar to that of the river water which the hatchery is located adjacent to. Furthermore, the results of my study might suggest that salmon may not be able to differentiate between these two water sources, and that potentially higher stray rates of hatchery reared salmonids might be due, in part, to the high similarity in DFAA profiles of hatchery water and adjacent river water. Throughout the last year my japanese colleagues and I have been preparing two manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals, and have designed several new research projects to help gain a better understanding of how salmon utilize DFAA for their incredible homing abilities.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2015<br>      Modified by: Joseph&nbsp;R&nbsp;Lemanski</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
