<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Pearl Sandick at the University of Utah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several compelling reasons to expect that our current Standard Model of particle physics is incomplete, not least of which is the puzzle of the nature of the dark matter in the Universe.  Professor Sandick's research involves theoretical investigations of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, in which each Standard Model particle has an as-yet unobserved "superpartner" particle.  Even in the most minimal supersymmetric models, the lightest of these superpartners provides a natural explanation for the dark matter.  Currently, experiments are becoming sensitive to interesting observable phenomena predicted in many supersymmetric models.  Taken together, experimental results from dark matter searches and particle colliders provide insight about the fundamental theory of particle physics that describes the world in which we live, but conclusions about whether a particular theory is excluded or supported by data rely on a robust understanding of its observable signatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Sandick aims to improve our understanding of minimal supersymmetric parameter spaces by making explicit connections between experimental signatures and the aspects of particle physics models necessary to generate them.  As part of this project, extensive studies of the consequences of different types of model complexity will be performed, highlighting the lessons we can learn about the characteristics of new models of particle physics from dark matter experiments and particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  The main focus is on connecting collider signatures to the signatures in dark matter detection as well as  astrophysical signatures from dark matter annihilation and/or decay.    This work will advance the knowledge of specialists, and also represents an opportunity to harness the broad public enthusiasm for dark matter and particle physics to educate the public about exciting advances and the future of the field and to recruit talented women and minorities to the physical sciences.  These broader impacts will be accomplished through a suite of outreach and professional development programs in which the PI is involved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to shed light on models of new particle physics that can explain the dark matter in the Universe. Professor Sandick explored minimal models of new physics, inspired by well-studied scenarios such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, in order to further understand the relationship between different types of model complexity and discoverability of new particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and/or in dark matter searches.  As a result of this project, a new class of minimal models that can explain the dark matter abundance while maintaining consistency with collider data was explored in a series of papers.  Prospects for discovering these models at a variety of existing and future experiments were detailed.  Some of these models present novel signature combinations which, if observed, would provide important insight about the fundamental physics of our Universe.       Professor Sandick has shared her research and her scientific perspectives in many talks and outreach events during the funding period.  Each summer, she ran a one-week course module on the physics of the LHC for the women in the ACCESS Program at the University of Utah, a program for incoming college students who are interested in science majors and careers.  At institutions around the country, she met with undergraduate students to discuss her research and career path and provide information and guidance about becoming involved in undergraduate research and applying to graduate programs. Professor Sandick also appeared on Science Friday, drawing public attention to exciting new results in particle physics.
