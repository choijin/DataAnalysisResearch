<AbstractNarration>A significant challenge for embedded systems is developing the high-performance, reliable, low cost, and low-power integrated circuits. This project addresses this challenge by developing accurate testability and timing analysis techniques for integrated circuits. The main objective of this effort is to address timing-related reliability, testing and design challenges faced by the semiconductor industry due to significant increase in process variations. The project will develop new methods for modeling the process variability that benefit from advanced data structures and novel algorithms. A new direction in determining gate delay models in the presence of process variations is investigated. The goal is to reduce modeling errors and is expected to identify critical path delay faults that current methods skip. Moreover, it is expected to result in more accurate estimates for the delay of the circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research activities will help semiconductor companies in developing reliable and faster integrated circuits and microprocessors. This will have impact on the society since cell-phones, cars, airplanes, unmanned vehicles, and biomedical devices are a major factor in the quality of human life. The fundamental modeling of process variations will be developed with the center member companies, ensuring rapid technology transfer and uptake of new methods. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the center research portfolio while potentially attracting new members. The proposed research will be used as a vehicle to help students develop interests and abilities to conduct research in the VLSI design and test automation area, and undergraduates will be inspired for graduate studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  It is a intrinsic fact of any type of manufacturing, that no two items will have identical characteristics.  This is generally not a problem when manufacturing large times.   However, the variation in performance and power consumption between two supposedly identical integrated circuits, is becoming a very big and costly problem.  If a chip runs much slower or consumes too much power than expected, then that translates directly to loss of revenue. For over thirty years, static CMOS logic has been the dominant design methodology for digital systems. During this period dimensions of devices were scaled down from 10,000nm to 22nm (a 500X reduction), density increased by 65,000X, and the technology transitioned through 18 process generations.  As CMOS technology is scaled down in to the deep nanometer regime, control of the physical parameters, such as the feature size of transistors, their doping levels, and oxide thicknesses, has become extremely difficult. Also, the close proximity of devices to each other has given rise to significant interference from elements surrounding a device, due to inductive and capacitive coupling, and due to environmental factors, such as power supply and temperature fluctuations. These and other factors are contributing to significant loss of yield of the manufactured circuits and are threatening the growth and profitability of the semiconductor industry. Addressing these challenges requires a complete overhaul of the existing design methodology to make it variation-aware and provide a tighter integration with the manufacturing process technology. This is to enable the design of high-performance circuits that meet the designer?s specifications even in the presence of large process and environmental variations. Since performance and power vary from chip to chip, one has to provide a distribution of these quantities over a large sample.  The present simulation based methods are extremely time consuming and with exponentially increasing chip densities, accruately predicting the performance or power by simulation becomes virtually impossible.  The intellectual merit of this research project is to provide a fast and accurate and fast methods to estimate the distribution of the performance of integrated circuits, in the presence of process variations.  The research led to a novel method for achieving this, without the artificial assumptions often made by existing techniques to simplify the analysis. The result of this work has led to 10X to 100X improvement in estimation time. Another significant outcome is that the same approach can be used to estimate the performance of software that runs on multicore processors.  An example use of this is to estimate the time it would take to load a web page on a mobile device.  Being able to accurately predict the performance of a mobile application will lead to better ways to control the device to make it more responsive and be more energy efficient.  Broader Impact: Improving the accuracy of estimating the performance or power of an IC will allow semiconductor manufacturers to  produce more reliable and faster integrated circuits and microprocessors which will result to reliable and high-performance real- time embedded systems. The methods when successfully applied to software of mobile applications can help improve their response and result in greater user satisfcation when using the mobile system.   A user?s satisfaction with a smartphone is determined by two factors&mdash;the browser?s response time, in terms of how fast web pages are accessed and displayed, and the battery lifetime. Poor user satisfaction due to a slow browser results in significant loss of revenue to the website, and poor user satisfaction due to low battery life results in loss of market share and revenue for phone manufacturers.  Therefore, accurate prediction of performance will enable better control of the operation of the device, resulting in greater user satisfication and better energy effiency.
