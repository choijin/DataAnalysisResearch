<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in removing sulfur compounds from various fuels such as diesel, gasoline and mixture of refined fuels known as transmix. It is critically important to reduce sulfur levels below 10 ppm as the emissions from transportation vehicles can cause acid rain and associated undesired effects. Sulfur removal from fuels is even more critical for implementation of fuel cell technologies due to fuel reformer catalyst poisoning at sulfur levels as low as 1 ppm or below. Finally, there is a need for sulfur-tolerant catalysts and sulfur removal processes in value added chemical production using bio-derived and fossil derived fuels. The global market for hydro-desulfurization catalysts in the transportation fuel segment is estimated at over $1B and growing fast. The company's proposed catalyst could address a market size of $150-200M/yr or more. It may find additional applications in commercial markets in ultra-low sulfur diesel, fuel reformer technology and sulfur tolerant catalysts. The development of a scalable manufacturing method for advanced materials undertaken in this project will contribute to U.S. competitiveness and strengthen Cleantech and energy sectors in the state of KY. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the development of high performance catalysts needed for the removal of sulfur from hydrocarbon fuels. However, sulfur removal at concentrations below 50 ppm is difficult due to the presence of hetero-cyclic thiophenic species. During Phase I, the company developed a catalyst product and demonstrated its performance in terms of ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization activity, reducing sulfur levels from 200 ppm to much lower than 1 ppm in a variety of fuels. Phase II studies will allow optimization of the catalysts for hydrodesulfurization activity and mechanical properties. Catalysts with bi-functional activity toward aromatics hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization will reduce several process steps, thereby reducing the costs involved in hydroprocessing of fuels. Phase II studies will enable development of a process for scalable production of nanowires. The fundamental insight from the performance can be extended toward designing various high performance catalysts using nanowire supports. Some beneficial effects using nanowire supports include unique active metal/support interactions; single crystal surfaces for uniform morphologies for active metals and their alloys and management of active sites. Specifically, in the case of hydrodesulfurization, nanowire supports provided an easier diffusion pathway for sulfur transfer to maintain active metal sites for desulfurization activity.</AbstractNarration>

Using a continuous, drymanufacturing process, researchers convert zinc metal to ZnO nanowires by exposing the zinc to a plasmahydrocarbon flame. The company is now producing 150 kg/day of ZnO nanowires and expects to increase production to 1 ton/day by 2018. To produce the catalytic adsorbents, researchers load the nanowires with active metals, mix them with binder, and then extrude the mixture to achieve a high crush strength. The resulting nanowire-based catalyst can reduce the sulfur content of fuels from 200 ppm to 1 ppm, even under mild temperatures and pressures (i.e., 220&ndash;290&deg;C, 15&ndash;30 bar). In addition, the process does not generate H2S. The company&rsquo;s AdE-Sorb catalyst can remove sulfur in diesel at atmospheric pressure without hydrogen. This option could be useful for smallto-medium-scale refineries that do not have access to a hydrogen supply. Existing refineries could add the AdE-Sulfur ultra-deep HDS process as a polishing step to reduce sulfur content to less than 5 ppm. For a refinery with a capacity of 6,000 bpd, the process would cost $0.036/gal or less. Using AdE-Sorb, desulfurization without hydrogen would cost $0.034/gal and reduce sulfur content of diesel from 600 ppm to less than 15 ppm for a 6,000-bpd refinery. In addition, this process would reduce CO2 emissions by about 320 tons/day. Independent Oil Corp. in Canada has recently tested this process in one of their pilot scale facilities.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/14/2018<br>      Modified by: Juan&nbsp;He</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430633/1430633_10340166_1534278626548_ScreenShot2018-08-14at4.28.22PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430633/1430633_10340166_1534278626548_ScreenShot2018-08-14at4.28.22PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ULSD catalyst"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430633/1430633_10340166_1534278626548_ScreenShot2018-08-14at4.28.22PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ULSD catalyst"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Nickel nanoparticles are loaded onto zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires to form catalytic adsorbents.Refineries can install a polishing step that uses these catalysts to reduce ultra-deep desulfurizationcosts and the environment impact of diesel production.</div> <div class="imageCredit">https://www.aiche.org/resources/publications/cep/2017/november/catalyzing-commercialization-ultra-deep-desulfurization-diesel</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Juan&nbsp;He</div> <div class="imageTitle">ULSD catalyst</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
