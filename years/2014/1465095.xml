<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Gerard Parkin of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University investigates fundamental chemistry of compounds of Earth-abundant main group metals.  This research is required for developing the use of such compounds as catalysts for organic transformations and for constructing new materials.  Catalysts are critical for the conversion of chemical feedstocks into more useful compounds, and an important objective is to discover new catalysts that do not incorporate precious metals.  Magnesium and calcium are two examples of Earth-abundant main group metals that are investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigation focuses on the use of multidentate ligands to enforce well-defined coordination environments for main group elements.  Specific examples of ligands that are used in this research include (i) tridentate tripodal ligands, such as tris(pyrazolyl)hydroborato and tris(2-mercaptoimidazolyl)hydroborato, and (ii) tetradentate tripodal ligands, such as tris(2 pyridylthio)methyl, while examples of target compounds include those with terminal alkyl, hydride, and fluoride ligands, and also those which feature metal?metal bonds.  The research involves the use of single crystal X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopic methods to determine the structures of the synthesized molecules, and computational methods to analyze the bonding.  An important aspect of the activities is that it involves training students to be future professionals, be it in an academic or industrial setting. As is customary for the research group, the research activities not only involve graduate and undergraduate students, but also involve high school students, thereby providing a significant STEM experience for them at a critical point in their education.  In addition, the research group is also involved in performing chemistry demonstrations for children from ethnically diverse New York City public middle schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Main group metals, such as magnesium and zinc, are of considerable interest because they have a high abundance and thus offer considerable potential for future technological applications.  However, a detailed investigation of compounds of these elements is essential in order to harness fully their capabilities.  Therefore, the intellectual merit of the activities has focused on developing the chemistry of these metals with reactive functionalities.  For example, with respect to magnesium, an exceptionally reactive compound that features a terminal hydride ligand was synthesized.  Significantly, this compound also exhibits catalytic properties, which include hydrosilylation, hydroboration, and hydrogenation.  These transformations are of particular interest because they typically employ precious metal catalysis, and so the ability to perform them with an element that is abundant in the Earth's crust is of considerable societal benefit.  In addition to the synthesis of a terminal magnesium hydride compound, the first magnesium compound with a terminal fluoride ligand was also synthesized and structurally characterized.  Metal compounds with terminal fluoride ligands are most uncommon by comparison to the other halide derivatives.  Such compounds, however, are of interest because of their potential for participating in (i) hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding interactions (both of which are important with respect to crystal engineering), and (ii) C-F bond formation, which is of note because of the significance of introducing fluorine into organic molecules.  Therefore, it is noteworthy that the magnesium fluoride compound was demonstrated to serve as both a hydrogen bond acceptor and a halogen bond acceptor.  Furthermore, it was also shown that that the magnesium fluoride compound could be used to form a C-F bond.  For a given metal, M-C bonds typically have similar lengths in different compounds.  It is, therefore, of note that it was discovered that M-C bond lengths can be manipulated by varying the nature of the linkers in atrane systems.  Depending upon the identity of the central atom and its ligands, two coordinate molecules can exhibit either linear or bent geometries.  However, it is not expected that a given molecule would exist in both forms.  Therefore, is significant that it was demonstrated that a carbodiphosphorane compound can exist in both linear and bent forms in the solid state, an observation that is a consequence of the fact that the energy required to bend the bonds in the molecule is small, such that crystal packing effects may influence the structure.   Broader impacts of the activities are associated with the fact that the research was performed by both male and female students and the accompanying training allowed them to take up successful professional positions.  In addition to graduate and undergraduate students, high school students also participated in research.  These high school students received awards from several Science Fairs and are currently enrolled in undergraduate programs at various institutions, including Columbia University.  The graduate and undergraduate students in the PI's research group also participated in other outreach activities with school students and this likewise contributed to their professional development.  In addition, an article that was published in the Journal of Chemical Education is of pedagogical interest because it facilitates a student's understanding of bonding in molecules that feature 3-center-2-electron bonds.
