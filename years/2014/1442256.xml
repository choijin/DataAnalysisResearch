<AbstractNarration>Although individual animals have long been considered a fundamental unit of evolution, we now know that each is really a co-dependent collection of host animal and microbes. This co-dependency reaches from ancient times through to the present day. Many animals depend on gut bacteria to process food and incorporate essential nutrients into the host's own tissues.  To untangle the importance of this partnership for hosts and symbiotic gut bacteria, this project will study a diverse and ecologically important social animal group, the turtle ants.  As social organisms, ants and humans share ways for acquiring helpful and harmful bacteria.  State-of-the-art molecular and genomic methods will be used to investigate ancient and modern influences on the symbiosis, the function of the bacteria for host health, and the means of passage and maintenance of the bacterial symbionts over millions of years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explaining global patterns of biodiversity and their drivers have long been central challenges in the fields of ecology and evolution.  Increasingly, it is becoming apparent that biodiversity is itself a function of interactions across different levels of biological organization.  Among the metazoans, symbioses with microbes are a defining feature, and individuals are integrated collections of host and symbiont cells, together defining the "holobiont".  By studying the diverse and tractable turtle ant system, this research will address the relationships between symbiosis and the dimensions of holobiont biodiversity with unprecedented clarity.  Specifically, this research will address: 1) the roles of time, biogeography, and habitat in host diversification (host taxonomic dimension); 2) variation in gut communities across host ant phylogeny, geography, habitat, and ecological niches (symbiont taxonomic dimension integrated with host taxonomic and functional dimensions); 3) the extent of codiversification for ~10 core, host-specific symbiont lineages, and the impacts of host phylogeny, geography, and ecology on symbiont transfer (symbiont taxonomic dimension integrated with host taxonomic and functional dimensions); 4) variation in genome evolution and innovation across symbionts with varying degrees of codiversification, and across genes with varying function (taxonomic, genetic, and functional integration of hosts and symbionts); and 5) symbiont function in light of symbiont genome evolution, host-symbiont codiversification, and host phylogeny, geography, and ecology (taxonomic, genetic, and functional integration of hosts and symbionts).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The beneficial symbiosis between animals and gut bacteria is now known to be prevalent throughout the animal kingdom, and critical for animal success and health. Nevertheless, there is much to learn about how such "microbiome" symbioses evolve through time and how they might be influenced by the present-day interactions that animals engage in with each other and their environment. In this collaborative project, the overarching goal has been to understand the relative influence of history and present-day interactions on animal-microbe symbioses. This goal was tackled using the turtle ants, a group of more than 100 species that are ideal for this area of research because they are "hosts" of an old gut microbiome symbiosis that can still be influenced by present-day interactions. In the component of this collaborative research focused on the environmental interactions of the hosts animals, interactions related to the nesting resources were found to be especially important. The sharing or sequential use of nests has the potential to provide opportunities for microbe exchange, and thus influence the microbiome of any given species. Yet while the group as a whole uses a very broad set of nesting resources found in any environment, each species uses a very specific resource range that is dictated by the species' physical features. This provides the key insight that the potential for present-day influences on the microbiome via nest sharing is actually highly structured: nesting resources, and therefore the potential for microbiome exchange, is highly limited to physically similar species that share the same needs in nesting resources. In contrast, interactions that occur over food resources, another place where microbes might be exchanged or influenced, involve an initial scramble among all ant species in an environment. Yet once discovered, most species successfully defend a food resource, again limiting potential opportunities for microbe exchange among species. In summary, this work reveals unexpected ecological structure and limitations on present-day opportunities for microbe exchange among species. Other components of the overarching collaborative project are examining whether the structure of host ecological interactions are related to meaningful differences in the gut microbes themselves. This work was made possible by integrating a diverse team of researchers spanning high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Scott&nbsp;Powell</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1442256/1442256_10328082_1609270296433_Nestingresources--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1442256/1442256_10328082_1609270296433_Nestingresources--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Turtle ant nests"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1442256/1442256_10328082_1609270296433_Nestingresources--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Turtle ant nests"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The structured use of nesting resources by turtle ants.
