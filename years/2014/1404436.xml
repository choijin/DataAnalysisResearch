<AbstractNarration>This project develops a low-cost and non-invasive method that can help in assessing cardiovascular health and disease by deriving personalized cardiovascular risk predictors.  Cardiovascular disease remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States and around the world. The developed methods can be widely used to improve cardiovascular risk stratification and thereby reduce the incidence of stroke and heart disease.  This project provides new opportunities for technological advances in pervasive and personalized medicine, which can ultimately improve the quality of life of human beings. This project also impacts education by developing new multi-disciplinary course modules and encouraging minority students to participate in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research derives a methodological framework to infer cardiovascular risk predictors from the analysis of blood volume waveform signals measured by low-cost and non-invasive modalities such as oscillometric cuff oscillations.  In this framework, model-based adaptive signal processing methods analyze blood volume waveform signals measured at peripheral locations on the body to derive personalized blood pressure waveform signals.  Then, cardiovascular risk predictors are derived from a model-based analysis of these blood pressure and volume waveform signals.  The research work includes: (1) deriving mathematical models that dictate the relation between blood pressure versus volume waveform signals; (2) deriving adaptive signal processing methods that transform blood volume waveform signals to blood pressure waveform signals; and 3) deriving methods that compute cardiovascular risk predictors from blood pressure and volume waveform signals.  This project makes contributions to the derivation of a unified framework for mathematical modeling of the relation between blood pressure and volume waves.  It also contributes to the advancement of adaptive signal processing methodologies relevant to physiological system modeling and health monitoring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most prevalent chronic disease in the United States and around the world.  However, state-of-the-art techniques for estimating CV health and risk parameters are inconvenient and costly.  It is arguable that these cost and convenience issues have hampered early detection and timely treatment of CVD.  Hence, novel technologies to complement the state-of-the-art CV health and risk parameters estimation techniques via convenient out-of-clinic monitoring and tracking of CV risk parameters may significantly improve the prevention, early detection, and treatment of CVD.  Effort has been made to enable more convenient and affordable estimation and tracking of CV risk parameters based on the automated cuff devices.  However, vast majority of the prior work have two shortcomings: (1) the techniques rely on population-based transformation (called the generalized transfer function (GTF)) and thus may not achieve optimal accuracy; and (2) CV risk parameters other than central BP, especially those associated with the central aorta (such as aortic pulse pressure (PP) amplification and pulse wave velocity), cannot be readily estimated due to the absence of relevant distal aortic pulse measurement.  In this project, we investigated a novel multiple measurement information fusion approach to the estimation of CV risk parameters from non-invasive pulse volume (PVR) waveforms measured conveniently at the body?s diametric locations.  Leveraging the fact that diametric PVR waveforms originate from the common central BP waveform, the approach estimates CV risk parameters in three steps by: (1) deriving subject-specific lumped-parameter models of the central-diametric arterial lines from diametric PVR waveforms, (2) estimating central BP waveform by analyzing the diametric PVR waveforms using the derived arterial line models, and (3) estimating CV risk parameters (including central BP waveform, central systolic and pulse pressures, aortic PP amplification, and aortic pulse transit time) from the arterial line models and central BP waveform in conjunction with the diametric PVR waveforms.  In this project, we reported the results of investigating the performance of this novel approach using the experimental data collected from 164 subjects.  Experimental results obtained from 164 human subjects with a wide BP range showed that the approach could estimate cardiovascular risk parameters accurately (see Figures 1 and 2).  Further analysis showed that the approach outperformed a generalized transfer function regardless of the degree of pulse pressure amplification, but especially in low and high amplification ranges.  The approach may be integrated with already available dual-cuff devices to enable convenient out-of-clinic cardiovascular risk parameter monitoring in everyday life.
