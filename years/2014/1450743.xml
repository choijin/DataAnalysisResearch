<AbstractNarration>This EArly-Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award provides support for the development of new theory and methods for optimization of dynamic resource allocation problems. Its objective is to provide an enhanced but tractable framework for these problems, expanding the applicability of existing methodology to broader, more realistic applications. This research has the potential to be transformative in the theoretical field (opening up new lines of research ) and in applications across diverse domains, such as defense (e.g., goal-oriented deployment of heterogeneous assets, minimizing cost of failure), medicine (clinical trials with failures and cumulative costs), education, health monitoring, and computer science (dynamic operation of multi-modal sensor networks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic resource allocation problems have been traditionally approached within the multi armed bandit framework, under the following restrictions. At each period over a time horizon, a controller activates one project of a finite collection of independent projects, advancing the state of the selected project while the others remain frozen. Rewards, collected from each activated project, are discounted at a constant rate, either modeling risk or accounting for compounding interest. There is a uniformity of the time-scale as well as a structural symmetry among the projects. The primary objectives of this research project are: i) To break the uniform time-scale restriction. ii) To break the structural symmetry among the projects. To achieve these goals we plan to investigate project dependent "halting events." These halting events allow the modeling of projects that operate at different rates, as well as "singling out" projects - generating rewards from successful projects and incurring costs for unsuccessful ones. A main challenge is to model the expanded frameworks in a way that makes it possible to obtain insight into the structure of optimal solutions. A second challenge is to develop efficient computational methods for these inherently large scale data and optimization problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The focus of this project was to develop new theory and methods for optimization of dynamic resource allocation problems and models, when there is incomplete information. Such problems have been traditionally approached within the `multi armed bandit? (MAB ) framework,  under the following model restrictions. At each period over a time horizon, a controller activates one project of a finite collection of independent projects, advancing the state of the selected project while the others remain frozen. Rewards, collected from each activated project, are discounted at a constant rate, either. There is a uniformity of the time-scale as well as a structural symmetry among the projects.  These mathematical models play a crucial role in the operation and design of systems in a variety of fields, including engineering, economics, statistics, web analytics," clinical trials, online learning etc. Achievements in this area include the following:    We were able to break the uniform time-scale restriction. This provides solutions to many important practical problems where an activation or course of action (investment in a project, assignment of patients in a clinical trial, employment of a military asset, etc.) is subject to a commitment of a (possibly random) duration of activation before a change to a different project is allowed.   We were able to break the structural symmetry among the processes.  This was done with the introduction of `halting events? (that correspond to random times that terminate the whole MAB process). These halting events allow the construction of several models in which bandits may be "singled out? - the controller potentially receiving rewards from successful bandits and/or paying costs for unsuccessful bandits.   We were able to place each bandit individually on a random bandit-dependent time-scale, in order to essentially achieve a significant (for many applications) middle ground between the finite horizon and the infinite horizon situations. This allows for a much more realistic model of actual projects and behaviors while still remaining theoretically tractable.   We were able to obtain explicit asymptotical optimal solutions to several, important special models including bandits generating rewards with: a) uniform distributions of unknown parameters, b) Gaussian distributions with unknown means and unknown variances.   In addition this award provided support for a number of related projects, listed below. Specifically, we developed new theory and solution methods for:  Computing the stationary distributions of large scale state space systems modeled by Markov chains. In addition, we compared the new methods with popular alternatives and developed efficient solutions for queues with Coxian inter-arrival distribution. Inventory control models where a firm can finance its inventory (ordered or manufactured) with loans in order to meet random demand which in general may not be time stationary.  Pricing strategies for a firm that in each period of a finite horizon receives replenishment quantities of a single product which it sells in two markets,  an on-site market and  a long-distance market.    These related projects serve two primary purposes. a) Project 1 above, facilitates the implementation of the general theory through better practical algorithms, as many applications of interest exhibit not only Markovian dynamics but also extremely large scale state spaces.   b) Projects 2 and 3 pursued a similar approach to optimal theory as applied to practical classes of operations management problems.  This work has been either published in scientific journals, or online and it has been presented in international conferences and workshops.  Many of these findings have been incorporated in the material taught in graduate courses at Rutgers, both at the Business School and at the Computer Science department.     The award included partial summer support for the PI for summers 2015 and 2016. It also supported the work of two PhD students one of whom graduated in May 2016.
