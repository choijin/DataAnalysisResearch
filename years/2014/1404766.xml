<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at the University of Cincinnati (UC) entitled, RET Site on "Challenge-Based Learning and Engineering Design Process (EDP) Enhanced Research Experiences for Middle and High School In-Service Teachers",  under the direction of Dr. Anant Kukreti, Director for Engineering Outreach, College of Engineering and Applied Science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal establishes a RET Site for a total of 36 (12 per year) STEM in-service middle and high school teachers in Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) and Engineering Design Process (EDP) pedagogy. The goals are three fold: 1) To educate, cultivate, and enrich science and math teachers' content delivery in their classrooms by exploring the engineering design-and challenge for 7-weeks during the summer. 2) To improve grades 7-12 students' science and math achievement and stimulate interest in STEM careers as a result of better instruction and curriculum delivered by participating teachers trained in engineering content and design-based instruction. 3) To support participating teachers in becoming role models by applying their research experiences in their classrooms and communicating them effectively to their colleagues. The RET Site builds on the proven success of 2 NSF RET Sites, 5 NSF REU Sites, and 2 RET Supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RET Site broadens the impact of the current Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Mathematics and Science Program (CEEMS), a NSF Targeted Math &amp; Science Partnership (MSP) Program grant, which includes 14 Ohio school districts with 73,392 students and 4,709 teachers. This RET Site includes 14 non-CEEMS school districts (12 in Ohio and 2 in Kentucky) with 72,546 students and 4,369 teachers.  Since RET and CEEMS teachers both develop and test curriculum design, teaching techniques, and student learning modalities using CBL-EDP pedagogy and include 71.1% of the students regionally in Ohio, collectively they will clearly impact the way math and science curricula are delivered to meet new standards regionally.</AbstractNarration>
