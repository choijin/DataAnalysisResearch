<AbstractNarration>This program includes research on a wide range of theoretical topics within the context of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs).  The main objectives are to: (i) use GRBs as lighthouses of the high-redshift Universe, to probe the physical conditions of the Interstellar Medium in star-forming regions and their evolution with redshift; (ii) generalize previous dust echo calculations and use them to reconstruct the properties and distribution of dust around the massive stellar progenitors of GRBs; (iii) use the properties of short GRBs to learn about the various channels of binary star merger; (iv) perform a generalized study of ultra-relativistic shockwaves in arbitrary media; (v) study gravitational instabilities in the hyper-accreting disk believed to provide the GRB source of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and development of a planetarium show on GRBs at the Fiske Planetarium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant has been devoted to a multiplicity of studies of the Gamma-ray Bursts sources,  their relation to the Star Formation history in the Universe, and to another population of interesting sources, the so-called "Magnetars', that is neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields, the strongest ever measured in the Universe. Neutron stars are very dense objects, in which a mass of about one and a half that of the Sun is concentrated in a volume of roughly 10 km in radius. They are the remnants of the explosions of massive stars, with an initial mass larger than about 7-8 solar masses, but smaller than about 40 solar masses.  Gamma-Ray Bursts are the most energetic explosions in the Universe, releasing energy over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from the very energetic gamma-rays (the so-called prompt emission) to X-rays, Optical, and all the way down to the low-energy radio waves (the so-called 'afterglow radiaion). One of such events, in particular, was so luminous that its optical afterglow could have been detected with human eyes, without the need for a telescope. And this was an event that occurred so far away that the Universe was about half of its current age when it happened!  Scientists believe that the origin of gamma-ray bursts can be due to two physical scenario: either the collapse of a massive star, or the merger of two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole.  My research supported by this grant has contributed to our understanding of the properties of those special stars which yield a gamma-ray burst when they die, as well as our understanding of the merger of two neutron stars, and their connection to gamma-ray bursts on one side, and to the Galactic population of magnetars on the other side. Among the several dozens of publications supported by this NSF grant, there is also the first GRMHD (i.e. General Relativistic, magnetohydrodynamical) simulation of the merger of two neutron stars which produces a stable neutron star of higher mass. The enclosed images show snapshots of that simulation from the paper by Giacomazzo &amp; Perna (2013).       Last Modified: 09/30/2015       Submitted by: Rosalba Perna]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
