<AbstractNarration>The research funded by this award is designed to promote a better understanding of atomic nuclei, the basic building blocks of all normal matter in the Universe.  How did they form following the Big Bang, and how do they now interact to change their basic elemental nature?  Are there new forms of matter made up from very exotic types of atomic nuclei and how might we make and study these?  To this end the group will develop special new techniques in nuclear science, as well as train future scientists that can help answer some of these questions.  One important training component will be a continuation of the well-established and highly successful outreach to faculty and students at New Buffalo High School in Michigan that has introduced these students to interesting, important, and exciting careers in the sciences.  The technology developed and used in this research will have applications in other important areas, such as homeland security (nuclear terrorism), the safe storage and monitoring of nuclear wastes, and applications in nuclear medicine, including radiation therapy. The latter includes a new modality directly related to this research: the production and imaging of ion beams to treat particular forms of cancer tumors. Nearly 50% of graduate students and other personnel trained in the group's past research projects are currently pursuing careers in nuclear security or nuclear medicine, and it is anticipated that this will continue as a result of the present grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing stable as well as short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies.  This includes use of the TwinSol low-energy radioactive ion-beam facility in operation at the University of Notre Dame (ND), developed jointly by the University of Michigan (UM) and ND.  Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability to elucidate the effect that the exotic "nuclear halo" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier.  Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity to the continuum is the characteristic defining feature of weakly-bound systems.  These studies will be carried out at TwinSol in collaboration with a group from the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), utilizing a prototype active-target time-projection chamber (AT-TPC).  A related program will use the full AT-TPC recently commissioned at the reaccelerated beam facility (ReA3) at NSCL.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the UM-UND collaboration, under the primary direction of the UM research group and their colleagues, will continue advanced development and application of deuterated scintillators for nuclear measurements involving neutrons.  This will include selected measurements of (d,n) and (3He,n) reactions involving both stable and unstable beams, and in particular 7Be(d,n) which is of interest in astrophysics.  Since these detectors permit neutron spectroscopy and cross section measurements without neutron time-of-flight, they have a particular advantage when used with the high-intensity, low-energy, non-pulsed accelerators suitable for nuclear astrophysics measurements.   The latter includes the new 5 MV accelerator recently installed at ND and we will pursue such experiments, and in particular several key (A,n) measurements, together with the nuclear astrophysics group at ND.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique neutron detector array the group has recently developed has potential for wide-spread applications both in nuclear science as well as in homeland-security and nuclear non-proliferation. As in the past, the proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from ND and UM, together with faculty members and students from several primarily undergraduate schools located in close proximity to these universities. The highly-technical nature of the proposed research will thus contribute significantly to the training of a technically-literate work force.</AbstractNarration>

Early experiments emphasized the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability. Later work tended to involve RNB studies relevant for nuclear astrophysics and fundamental nuclear interactions.  Certain experiments involving beams of stable nuclei have also been carried out.  Because of the basic-research nature of the project, its major output was the production of 40 manuscripts published in refereed physics journals.  One instrumentation development project involved the ion-trap program of Dr. Maxime Brodeur of Notre Dame, funded by the NSF, which requires a dedicated RNB line for its implementation.  A dipole magnet obtained from Oak Ridge National Laboratory was installed so that other RNB programs can also be carried out without disturbing the ion-trap apparatus.  Unfortunately, the ion optics of this configuration results in a very large beam spot due to the increased magnification of TwinSol beams because of the large increase in distance to the new focal point.  This problem has an elegant solution, namely the introduction of a third solenoid, with a much shorter focal length, after the dipole.  This "TriSol" project is currently under development.  Recent calculations have shown that a beam spot size of approximately 8 mm in diameter can be achieved, and that many of the most interesting beams will be doubled in intensity.  Deuterated-scintillator neutron detectors for use in neutron spectroscopy without time of flight have been developed for both exotic- and stable-beam measurements; this work has applications to national-security programs. A program in support of the development of an active-target time projection chamber, recently installed at the ReA3 facility at Michigan State University, was carried out.  Finally, development work on the solenoidal spectrometer for nuclear astrophysics (SSNAP) continued.  This device, inspired by the success of the HELIOS project at Argonne National Laboratory, uses the first of the two TwinSol solenoids to focus the primary beam onto a target at the center of the second solenoid, through a tube whose outer surface is surrounded by position-sensitive silicon detectors.  The reaction products (alpha particles and protons) are identified by their energy, position, and time of flight after proceeding along a helical path in the solenoidal field.  All particles with sufficiently low momentum that their orbits do not exceed the inner radius of the solenoid chamber return to the axis and therefore strike the silicon array.  Unlike the situation for HELIOS, the solenoidal field is not uniform because TwinSol uses iron-free solenoids.  However, the particle orbits were simulated using the program GEANT4.  The results of the simulation showed good agreement with experimental data, confirming the validity of the method.  A broader impact of the project on graduate, undergraduate, and high-school education, as well as the development of a technologically literate work force, was pursued. This involved graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Notre Dame (ND) and Michigan State University (MSU), together with faculty members and students from several primarily undergraduate schools located in close proximity to ND and MSU, in nuclear-physics related research.  In addition, a highly successful program involving high-school students from the socioeconomically-challenged New Buffalo, MI school district in physics-related research was carried out.  In the summer of 2016, the program had two components: the development of a nuclear-physics curriculum satisfying State of Michigan standards in this area and a two-week nuclear physics "summer day camp" at ND and Hope College in Holland, MI.  This latter program was designed for selected (and highly-motivated) NBHS students interested in learning about careers in physics. The summer program was arranged so that the students directly interacted with physics graduate and undergraduate students and faculty from nearby colleges and universities who shared their knowledge and experiences of physics as a career.  Several of the students in this program ultimately decided to pursue a career in science, with one or two eventually obtaining doctorates.  This and other outreach activities had a measurable impact on the general science awareness and interest of people who will ultimately not be scientists or engineers. Unfortunately, the summer program was discontinued in 2017 due to a lack of funding.   This project has shown that continued operation of a university-based facility for research and education can be an important component of the national nuclear-physics program, in support of national laboratories such as the Facility for Rare Ion Beams at Michigan State University, and that world-class research can be carried out there.
