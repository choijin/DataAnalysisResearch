<AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial funding for a workshop focus on the interdisciplinary study of tephra to be held at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon on August 4-7, 2014. The discussions at this workshop will have implications for the understanding of geologic hazards, climate change and human origins. The goal is to bring different communities that use tephra in their research to learn from each other's practices and scientific interests. The participants will include volcanologists, tephrochronologists, and archeologists, geochronologists, paleoclimatologists, paleoecologists, paleolimnologists, glaciologists, petrologists, atmospheric scientists, Quaternary scientists, data managers, statisticians, among others. The three objectives of the workshop will include: 1) to discuss modern techniques used in volcanic stratigraphy and sedimentology; 2) to discuss modern advances in tephrochronology; and 3) to begin to develop a model of atmospheric transport and terrestrial, glacial, and submarine distribution of tephra. Materials related to presentations (abstracts and videos) will be made available via the open-access forum Vhub.org. Participants at this workshop will include scientists at different stages of professional careers from different countries, and will be recruited via announcements in listservs for the different scientific communities and invitations to some scientists. One of the outcomes of this workshop will be a resource book for tephra studies. The workshop will start with a field trip to Mount St. Helens, followed up by presentations, group discussions, and hands-on training sessions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Scientific communities studying tephra are interested in different aspects of these important volcanic deposits and over the years have developed their own terminologies, techniques and knowledge-bases. As a result, collaboration among the communities can be difficult, and knowledge of some tephra deposits is limited to the area of expertise of the community which has studied the deposit. The aims of the workshop included introducing each community to research activities and advances of the others, working towards an agreement on terminology, introducing some notions of modern volcanology and tephrochronology into all communities so that field observations and information are collected in ways that make them usable for a broader set of research questions, and developing consensus around greater data sharing so that more complete knowledge of tephra layers is widely available.   I.1. Intellectual merit   The workshop fostered increased communication and collaboration among diverse scholarly communities, resulting in a synergism that benefited all tephra researchers. The three main intellectual goals were: 1) to discuss modern advances in volcanic stratigraphy and sedimentology that allow paleoclimatologists, tephrochronologists and archaeologists to better understand and interpret both primary and reworked tephra layers; 2) to discuss modern advances in tephrochronology, particularly (A) advances in major-element, trace-element, and isotopic analyses for geochemical fingerprinting of glasses and minerals, (B) identification of ultradistal tephras in paleoarchives such as peat bogs and ice cores, (C) improvements in high-precision Ar-Ar and U-Th dating techniques, and (D) the use of age modeling to produce time-stratigraphic frameworks of enhanced precision by incorporating data from multiple sites and sequences linked together by tephra isochrons; and 3) to begin to develop a global understanding of the atmospheric transport and terrestrial, glacial, and submarine distribution of tephra.   I.2. Broader Impacts   The workshop resulted in increased communication among diverse scientific communities that rely on various aspects of the detailed study of tephra. The workshop and follow-up work aid research on topics of broad public interest including geologic hazards, climate change, and human origins. This effort addresses a demonstrated need for improved communication among scientific communities. This was recognized during a similar initiative that was started in Europe (Dugmore et al., 2011). However, no other such effort has been initiated, and the difficulties of communication among the different communities were not completely addressed by the European initiative. The workshop helped to produce better understanding of the work that needs to be done among and within communities to address knowledge gaps.   The workshop met its goals and involved a mix of over 70 senior and early career researchers from diverse fields and under-represented groups. It provided training in tephra sampling and modeling, and  resulted in a report and work sheets that may serve as a resource book for tephra studies. Submitted abstracts and videos of the presentations are available online through an open-access forum (Vhub). The workshop also initiated a dialogue among the different communities using tephra with the goal of building a consensus structure for a global database of tephra.
