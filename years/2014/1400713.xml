<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Bohua Zhan is "Low-Dimensional Topology: Heegaard-Floer Homology." The host institution for the fellowship is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Tomasz Mrowka.</AbstractNarration>
