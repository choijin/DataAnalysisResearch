<AbstractNarration>PI: Rani, Sarma L. /Koch, Donald L. &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1436100 / 1435953&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed study is to explore the formation of droplets and the production of rain from  a cumulus cloud. This is a topic relevant for the prediction of rainfall and of hazards such as tornados and flash flooding. Warm cumulus clouds exert significant influence on the climate system of the earth by processing atmospheric aerosols, interacting with electromagnetic radiation from the sun and earth, and redistributing earth's water and energy through the hydrologic cycle. This study addresses two central outstanding questions in the current understanding of warm rain production, namely, the mechanisms leading to the formation of fast-growing 'statistically fortunate' drops, and the growth of the cloud droplets, both of which hasten the 'colloidal instability' of the cloud, resulting in precipitation. To understand the effects of turbulence, it is essential to gain insights into the interactions between large-scale processes such as turbulent entrainment, mixing and intermittency, and microscale processes such as particle clustering, droplet relative velocities and collision efficiency. In terms of outreach and education, it is proposed to involve graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research at the confluence of turbulence, cloud and particle physics. The PIs plan to reach out to students at Alabama A&amp;M University and Huntsville High School to encourage the students to pursue undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in STEM-related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborating PIs will conduct a multiscale investigation, in which a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) will be used to model the whole cloud and to feed energy to a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) model, in order to explain how very small droplets appear and grow in size within a cloud. The hypothesis is that intermittency in turbulent shear and flow acceleration are driving the formation and the coalescence of the droplets. The proposed work is for high Reynolds number cloud turbulence at practical scales. Using the proposed energy transfer method, inertial-range LES turbulence intermittency information will be included in the DNS. The theoretical research will focus on developing stochastic models for both microscale and macroscale cloud physics including: 1) Detailed microscale models for the local flow field in the vicinity of bidisperse interacting drops with statistical properties characteristic of cloud Reynolds numbers; 2) Effects of particle inertia and differential sedimentation on the stochastic flow field ?seen? by the drops; 3) Effects of non-continuum, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between drops on their collision efficiency; and 4) Macroscale model that accounts for the effects of turbulence intermittency and eddy mixing on the stochastic kinetics of droplet growth. The proposed research is expected to shed light on aerosol-cloud interactions that are important in generating precipitation and in affecting climate patterns.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A new stochastic theory was developed for predicting the clustering of  clustering of rapidly settling, low-inertia particle pairs in isotropic  turbulence.  This study was published as a two-part paper in the Journal  of Fluid Mechanics.       In this two?part study, we present the development and analysis of a stochastic theory for characterizing the relative positions of monodisperse, low-inertia particle pairs that are settling rapidly in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In the limits of small Stokes number and Froude number such that Fr &#8810; St &#8810; 1, closures are developed for the drift and diffusion fluxes in the probability density function (PDF) equation for the pair relative positions.

In the Part I paper, we present the derivation of closure approximations for the drift and diffusion fluxes in the PDF equation for pair relative positions r. The drift flux contains the time integral of the third and fourth moments of the ?seen? fluid velocity gradients along the trajectories of primary particles. These moments may be analytically resolved by making approximations regarding the ?seen? velocity gradient. Accordingly, two closure forms are derived specifically for the drift flux.

In the second drift closure, we instead assume that the ?seen? strain-rate and rotation-rate tensors scaled by the turbulent dissipation rate and enstrophy, respectively, are normally distributed. A key feature of the second closure is that it accounts for the two-time autocorrelations and cross-correlations of dissipation rate and enstrophy. These correlations quantify, as well as illustrate the mechanisms driving particle clustering. Analytical solution to the PDF  (r, &theta;) is then derived, where the &theta; is spherical polar angle.  It is seen that the PDF has a power-law dependence on separation r,  analogous to that for the radial distribution function of non-settling  pairs. An explicit expression is derived for the power-law exponent in  terms of the drift and diffusion closures. The   (r, &theta;) solution  also shows that for a given r, the clustering of St &#8810; 1 particles is  only weakly anisotropic, which is in conformity with prior observations from direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence containing settling particles.

The theory predicts that the spherical harmonic coefficient scales with &beta; . Since the drift flux, and thereby &beta;, is seen to decrease with gravity for St &lt; 1, the anisotropy is also correspondingly diminished.     Five journal papers have been published.  Sixth one is under prepration.     We developed a theory that will provide detailed fundamental insights  into the relative motion of low-Stokes-number particle pairs that are  settling under gravity in isotropic turbulence.  The insights gained  from the theory will help us better understand the dynamics of droplets  in cumulus clouds.     The insights gained from the theory will help us better understand the  dynamics of droplets in cumulus clouds.  THe research currently underway  will provide far-reaching insights into turbulence-induced suspension  behavior in applications such as ice-crystal dynamics in clouds, indoor  dispersion of asbestos fibers, and fiber sedimentation in paper-making.
