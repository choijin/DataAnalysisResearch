<AbstractNarration>Dr. Lisa Nagaoka and colleagues, of the University of North Texas, and Dr. Timothy Kohler, of Washington State University, will undertake research to study the impact of climate change, particularly drought, on societies reliant on dryland agriculture. Non-irrigated or dryland agriculture is a cultivation process in arid areas where water for crops comes from precipitation and from stored soil moisture. Many societies today rely on dryland agriculture; the key to long-term success is dealing with fluctuations in the availability of water, and thus crop yield, across time. During wet and productive years, environmental carrying capacity can greatly increase, resulting in good crop years and increased human population growth. But dry years can lead to significant crop failure and famine. Much of the current research on contemporary dryland agriculture focuses on increasing crop yield through genetically modified crop varieties and better soil and water management. Archaeology is well placed to understand the societal impacts of a failure to deal with fluctuations in water availability because it provides numerous past "experiments" using a variety of management techniques to study. Some societies developed management practices that led to long-term success, while others adopted approaches that resulted in societal collapse. Understanding the conditions under which some societies reliant on dryland agriculture succeed while others fail can provide insight into which variables matter most in terms of sustainable dryland farming over long periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drs. Nagaoka and Kohler and their research team will study the relationship between climate change, water availability, and dryland agricultural productivity. Previous archaeological research on this topic has focused on modeling crop yield at the regional scale, which requires numerous assumptions about variables such as soil quality that are difficult to measure in a prehistoric context. In this study, the research team will focus on the effects of soil moisture on the potential for crop failure at the local scale of farmland around large pueblo villages by documenting the wilting point of dryland soils, a known level of soil moisture at which no water can be extracted by plants. The research will be conducted in the Mesa Verde region of southwestern Colorado, where prehistoric culture change is often used as a cautionary tale of societal collapse. The numerous large multi-storied pueblos speak to the large population that once lived in the region. Yet, by the late AD 1200s, these communities were all abandoned. A prolonged and severe drought is often cited as a cause for the collapse. However, there were several periods of drought during the previous thousand years that did not lead to collapse indicating that there is more to learn about what factors lead to failure or sustainability of dryland farming over the long term. The team of researchers has backgrounds in archaeology, environmental science, hydrology, remote sensing, and geographic information systems, which they will use to understand how the likelihood of crop failure varied at large pueblo villages depending on soil type, topographic features, and vegetation, and how these varied across time during periods of higher precipitation and during drought. The team will generate new methods for studying agricultural productivity that can be applied in other areas of the world where dryland farming is important, and the interdisciplinary emphasis of the project will also provide unique educational and training opportunities for students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main economic foundation for the agricultural societies of North and Mesoamerica before European colonization was maize (corn). In the US Southwest, these farming societies came to be very large and successful, responsible for building the sites that today are preserved in Mesa Verde National Park and Chaco Canyon National Historical Park for example, and of course many descendants of these societies continue to thrive in these and adjacent areas.  Over the last 30 years archaeologists and tree-ring scientists have developed techniques for estimating how much maize could be grown in specific plots of land in every year, using tree-ring widths to estimate local precipitation and temperature. This work has shown that the estimated amount of production is related to many social phenomena, including the density of population, episodes of depopulation, and even the degree of wealth inequality and amount of violence.  This project was designed to put one assumption of such models on a firmer footing by accurately and very locally establishing the degree of soil moisture, and how that is related to maize production, in some of the areas for which large-scale production models have been built (in most cases through prior NSF support). We found that soil moisture is significantly positively related to maize production in contemporary gardens.  Areas in which geographic information system modeling projected higher soil moisture did indeed have higher soil moisture as measured by soil moisture sensors. In the one off-site area where this could be examined, it was also found that the soils where geographic information system modeling projected higher soil moisture contained archaeological corn pollen, suggesting that corn was indeed grown in or near these areas.  Among the broader impacts of this research will be its use to improve existing maize production models and to increase our confidence in such estimates, which are driven largely by indirect estimates of soil moisture. It is important to understand the large degree to which the success of farming societies in this area was dependent on adequate moisture for crops. For people in these societies, climate variability was of paramount importance for their prosperity and well-being.
