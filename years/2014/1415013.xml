<AbstractNarration>Solid-state light sources, such as lasers, can be made more efficient by correlating the physics of light emission in semiconductors, materials with light emission properties and decent conductivity, with their composition and physical structure. The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of a promising ultraviolet light source, zinc oxide, by fabricating it in the form of a nanowire, a nano sized wire structure. Vertical nanowires, instead randomly oriented wires, are ideal for studying the link between the optical physics and the material properties. The efficiency of these nanowire light sources can be improved by decorating the wires with metal nanoparticles. The goal of this project will be to fabricate vertical nanowires and decorate with aluminum, with possible better light-emission enhancement properties than either silver or gold. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Professors Yi Chun Liu and Hai Yang Xu at Northeast Normal University in China, known around the world for fabricating vertically oriented zinc oxide nanowires for lasers applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vertical nanowires to be grown are similar to previously studied randomly oriented zinc oxide/magnesium oxide core/shell nanowires, where the additional photoluminescence enhancement observed is dramatically enhanced by plasmon-exciton coupling due to a silver nanoparticle coating. Alumium nanoparticles, not previously studied with zinc oxide nanowires, have a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that fully overlaps the band edge exciton emission of zinc oxide, making it more promising for photoluminescence enhancement of zinc oxide than silver nanoparticles, who's LSPR does not fully overlap zinc oxides band edge emission. In this project, magnesium oxide and zinc magnesium oxide will provide spacer layers between the plasmonic and semiconducting materials allowing for both the plasmon-exciton coupling strength to be fully studied and for optical cavity effects in the core-shell structure to create additional enhancement. Aluminum nanoparticle plasmon-exciton coupling strength will be compared to silver nanoparticle coupling strength. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Solid-state light sources, such as lasers, can be made more efficient by correlating the physics of light emission in semiconductors, materials with light emission properties and decent conductivity, with their composition and physical structure. The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of a promising ultraviolet light source, zinc oxide, by fabricating it in the form of a nanowire less than a thousandth of a millimeter in diameter. A "carpet" of vertically oriented nanowires is ideal for studying the link between the optical physics and the material properties of the nanowires. The efficiency of these nanowire light sources can be optimized by coating the nanowires with an insulating shell material that creates standing waves of light inside the wire, allowing more light to be emitted. Decorating the wires with metal nanoparticles makes the wires even more efficient as light emitters by creating local electric fields that increase the light output and reduce the amount of energy lost by heating the nanowire.     The goal of this project was to (1) fabricate vertical nanowires, (2) coat the wires with an insulating shell material of varying thicknesses, and (3) decorate with either silver or aluminum nanoparticles, comparing the light emission enhancement properties of each wire type. This research was conducted in collaboration with Professors Yi Chun Liu and Hai Yang Xu at Northeast Normal University in China, known around the world for fabricating vertically oriented zinc oxide nanowires for lasers applications.  The research continues at Vanderbilt University under Professor Richard Haglund and in collaboration with Professor Richard Mu at Fisk University.     The vertical nanowires, grown through a solution method at Northeast Normal University, are similar to previously studied randomly oriented zinc oxide nanowires grown from a powder source.  Vanderbilt/Fisk Universities now has the capability to grow both nanowire types.  The nanowires grown in solution as well as those grown from a powder source are highly crystalline forms of zinc oxide, where the distinct differences between the nanowires are their growth orientations and diameters.  It is found that the larger diameters of the zinc oxide nanowires grown through the solution method are less effective at enhancing the light output when coated with an insulating cladding material.  This is because the larger diameter wires do not confine standing wave optical modes as effectively as the smaller diameter, powder source zinc oxide nanowires.  Thus, while distinct optical modes can be seen to enhance the light output of the small diameter nanowires at specific cladding thicknesses, no distinct standing wave modes are seen in the results for the larger diameter nanowires.     When coating the nanowires with silver and aluminum nanoparticles, it was found that particle size, material, and spatial distribution determine the enhancement in the light output of the nanowires.  As the size of the nanoparticles changes, the strength of the electric field at a specific color changes.  Each metal has a distinct region of wavelengths in which it can be tuned, with silver nanoparticles having a high electric field enhancement at wavelengths longer than the emission of zinc oxide, and aluminum nanoparticles having a high electric field enhancement at wavelengths shorter than the emission of zinc oxide.  The electric field enhancement of both the silver and aluminum nanoparticles does not exactly overlap the emission of the zinc oxide nanowires, even with size tuning.  Only when the nanowires had a uniform coating of nanoparticles did enhancement of the zinc oxide light output occur.  For the uniformly coated nanowires, the zinc oxide emission was strongly enhanced due to coupling between the electric fields emitted by the metal nanoparticles and the light emitted by the zinc oxide nanowires.  The only nanowires to achieve completely uniform nanoparticle coating were th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
