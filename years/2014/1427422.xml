<AbstractNarration>This research project is about designing better legs for legged robots.  When a robot needs to move across rough terrain, as would be the case when searching for victims in a disaster area, legged robots have advantages over wheeled or tracked robots.  They can traverse such terrain more easily, for example, stepping over fallen beams and bricks.  However, legged robots are inherently more complex.  They have many more joints and are more difficult to control.  The goal of the project is to use ideas from nature to overcome some of these difficulties.  The shape and compliance of four-legged animals adds to their stability passively when they trot or gallop.  These ideas will be incorporated into a four-legged robot, making its locomotion abilities more robust.  A major issue to duplicate from nature is the animal's ability to adaptively change the compliance of their joints and legs.  This is a primary objective of this project. In addition to the research objectives, this project also includes educational components involving graduate and undergraduate students as well as outreach to secondary schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach taken in this project will simplify the control of quadruped robots by the use of directionally compliant legs to passively stabilize the robot under dynamic gaits such as trotting.  Active control of the stiffness and joint equilibrium positions will allow for adaptive parameter changes to changing terrain, gaits, and robot variation (carry a load for example).  The system will employ a hybrid controller using passive, under-actuated legs during gaits, but actively changing the passive characteristics.  Stability of the robot is measured by the pitch and roll of the robot body.  The adaptive controller will minimize errors in the desired pitch and roll by changing the joint stiffness, equilibrium angles and positions of each joint.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research explored the passive stability and energy efficiency of a bio-inspired quadruped robots. The legs of the robot are under-actuated.  The only actuators are at the shoulders/hips.  There is a torsional spring at the elbow/knee and a distal spring at the foot.  The bio-inspiration is in the configuration of the legs ? the elbows point back and the knees point forward.  This is the same configuration that came about in convergent evolutionary pathways in biology.  This configuration tends to make the ground force reaction vector point toward the center of mass of the animal or robot, resulting in passive stability in gaits such as trotting.     The work on the grant pursued two main paths.  In one, adaptive algorithms were developed vary the compliance of the distal spring and the stride length of the robot during trot.  The goal of the adaptive algorithm was to minimize the energy consumption of the robot, measured as cost of transport, at all times without having direct knowledge of the ground conditions and other operational aspects. A computationally efficient method that can be easily implemented in real time was derived using a variation of the sign-sign adaptive filter. Conditions that ensure stable operation of the robot when its parameters are under adaptation were also derived. The algorithm was tested extensively in simulations, and the results indicated that the adaptive approach developed in this research converged quickly, and reduced energy consumption substantially for all operating environments considered. Furthermore, the bio-inspired leg design exhibited low pitching and rolling motions, measures of stability of the robot. A number of variations of the algorithm, including an approximate stochastic gradient adaptation algorithm were also explored in this research.      The second path involved designing and building a robot to demonstrate the validity of the bio-inspired robot configuration and the adaptation algorithms in practice. Experiments on the robot trotting on a treadmill demonstrated the energy efficiency of the robot design, and further reduction of the cost of transport with the adaptation of the stride length and compliance of the legs.  In addition to algorithms that minimize the cost of transport,  adaptation algorithms designed to minimize the pitch rate of the robot were also derived and implemented, and the results demonstrated reduced pitching, indicating increased stability.
