<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates  (REU) site in non-linear dynamics at the University of Maryland. The main goal of the program is to engage undergraduate students in cutting-edge research in the area of nonlinear dynamics. Through guided mentorship by faculty members and interactions with post-docs and graduate students, undergraduates will gain hands-on experience by participating directly in the research process.  One major impact of the program of the program will be in the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Further, the program offers seminars and trips that expose students to a wide variety of subjects and opportunities while building a sense of community.  Another impact of the program takes the form of the refereed publications generated by the research efforts of the TREND students and other program participants, in addition to the conference presentations that arise from the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site will support ten undergraduates per summer in ten weeks of research.  Potential research topics include: magnetic reconnection, turbulence, and nonlinear phenomena in plasmas; chaos and synchronism in large systems of network-coupled components; dynamics of granular and soft-matter flow; development of singularities in fluids and solids; nonlinear dynamics in optical systems and charged particle beams; autonomous control of vehicles with forecast uncertainty; and nonlinear physics of living systems. Two weekly seminar series will complement and reinforce the learning experience. The first seminar series will expose students to state-of-the-art research in nonlinear science at a level appropriate for undergraduates. The second seminar series will focus on research skills development, including critical reading of research papers, oral and written communication, and preparation for graduate school. Students will give oral presentations and participate in a poster session on the final day of the program, and funding will be provided to all students to subsequently present their work at a relevant national or regional conference.</AbstractNarration>
