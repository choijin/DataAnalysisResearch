<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Fayetteville State University will implement a project entitled: Development of an Interdisciplinary Materials Research and Education Laboratory. Materials Science is an interdisciplinary field, studying materials synthesis and fabrication, processing, structures, properties and applications. The project seeks to have an impact on over 500 undergraduate students through curricular improvements, improvements to the research and education infrastructure, faculty engagement, and opportunities for students to participate in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to (1) develop an interdisciplinary materials research and education laboratory at to infuse materials science education into the curricula and to enhance undergraduate students' participation in this field; (2) enhance the institution's research and education infrastructure through laboratory equipment modernization; (3) promote faculty engagement in research through interdisciplinary collaborations; and (4) increase student enrollment and graduation in chemistry and physics. The Materials Laboratory will allow faculty and students to engage in research including X-ray radiation detection using scintillator nanowires by a novel electron microscopy method, and ultraviolet and infrared radiation detections using composition- and size-controllable nanowires.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This HBCU Targeted Infusion Project is to develop an Interdisciplinary Materials Research and Education Laboratory (IMREL) at Fayetteville State University (FSU). The established IMREL comprises four research groups: Materials Physics Group, Materials Chemistry Group, Biomaterials Group and Computational Materials Group, with 12 faculty members from different STEM departments at FSU. Laboratory equipment was upgraded for Materials Science research and education. Faculty members in different disciplines were engaged in collaborative research in external grants applications and research publications, with 12 successful grants and 27 publications in this project period. Each faculty member published at least one publication, and each research group submitted at least one external grant. This project increased the number of minors of the Department of Chemistry and Physics who received research training at IMREL. In addition, the graduation rate was improved through the research training in this project.</p> <p>This project established a new STEM program, Materials Science Minor Program, for undergraduate education at FSU. Six new courses were offered to students, including MATS 160 &ldquo;Introduction to Materials Science&rdquo;, MATS 204 &ldquo;Properties of Engineering Materials&rdquo;, MATS 260 &ldquo;Introduction to Nanomaterials&rdquo;, MATS 301 &ldquo;Polymer Science&rdquo;, MATS 311 &ldquo;Scanning Electron Microscopy and Microanalysis&rdquo;, and MATS 321 &ldquo;X-ray Diffraction Analysis&rdquo;. In these course studies, the students had the opportunities to use the state-of-the-art instruments for research at IMREL. This project supported the undergraduates for hands-on research training, mentored by IMREL faculty members. The undergraduates who attended the faculty-mentored research received monthly stipends, upon the completion of required hours on their submitted monthly timesheets. In sum, the number of students who received training in the Materials Science courses or faculty-mentored training was 9 in 2014-2015, 16 in 2015-2016, 26 in 2016-2017, and 24 in 2017-2018. The number of students was increased since the first year.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project created certificates for qualified undergraduates. It was found that the certificates could stimulate the students&rsquo; interest in the research training. Two kinds of certificates were offered: (1) IMREL Student Award, based on the academic performance in Materials Science course studies or faculty-mentored research training; and (2) Instrumental Certificate, based upon the completion of the instrumental course and passing through the instrumental test.<strong> </strong></p> <p>FSU Student Chapter of Materials Research Society was organized in this project, with 8 student members. Peer mentoring is an effective strategy to provide high-quality research experiences to students. Since the students have similar backgrounds and are close in age, they can learn effectively from peers and make collaborations, resulting in both academic and interpersonal growth. The students of the Chapter conducted monthly meetings for research presentations, experimental demonstrations and outreaches. Such community gathering enabled students to work with and learn from peers. A Special Projects Grant, proposed by MRS Student Chapter President, Chibu Umerah, a female African American undergraduate, was awarded by the Materials Research Society Foundation in the amount of $999.34. This award supported the student chapter activities.</p> <p>The students attended research projects, mentored by IMREL faculty members. In this project, the students made 16 publications and 11 presentations. This project produced a number of motivated students, greatly enhanced the STEM educational quality. There were 12 successful students who received prestigious internship scholarships or entered STEM graduate programs, based on nationwide merit competitions, including 3 students entered a Ph.D. program, one student entered a masters program, 6 students had research publications, and 11 students received summer internships with stipends.</p> <p>Through the STEM educational practices at IMREL, this project demonstrated an effective pedagogy to improve the STEM education using an open platform of IMREL through the following approaches: (1)&nbsp;interdisciplinary education. Not only faculty members, but also undergraduates in different disciplines can work together to conduct collaborative research to improve learning experiences; (2)&nbsp;hands-on education. All state-of-the-art instruments were open to the undergraduates for guided research training to improve the learning experiences; and (3) peer mentoring and community learning. IMREL provides a platform for students to learn, collaborate and communicate with peers to stimulate their intellectual growth and interpersonal communication skills, increasing the graduate rate.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/21/2018<br>      Modified by: Zhiping&nbsp;Luo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div
