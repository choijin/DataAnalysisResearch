<AbstractNarration>The Yeast Genetics and Genomics Course serves a critical role in the training of investigators new to the use of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for biological research. Yeast has long been, and continues to be, an outstanding organism for many different types of studies, ranging from basic research on genetics and cell biology to applied research on biotechnological, pharmaceutical, or industrial uses. The highly intensive three-week course is attractive to researchers, as it offers an opportunity to become proficient in the fundamentals of yeast genetics and state-of-the-art uses of this important organism. The broader impact of the course is the training of researchers in the most up-to-date experimental and computational resources and tools available for biological research in the yeast model. Students in the course are diverse, ranging from graduate students to professors, with backgrounds in genetics, molecular and cellular biology, bioinformatics, engineering, and physics. The diversity of their backgrounds and their exposure to a wide range of experimental approaches during the course increases the chances that they will go on to carry out the interdisciplinary research that is vital for meeting today's global challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course includes laboratory experiments that are broken into twelve multi-part sections that cover a variety of topics including, fundamentals of working with yeast, classical genetics and related topics in cell biology, introduction to yeast molecular and cell biology, genetic and physical interaction analysis, and genomics. The experimental portion of the course is complemented by daily theoretical lectures by instructors chosen for their proven expertise in the system and by a world-class seminar series from renowned investigators that utilize the yeast system. Although the overall organization of the course remains the same from year to year, changes in content are introduced as yeast biology and genomics advances; novel technologies and approaches are incorporated into the curriculum, in part by the recruitment of new instructors. However, because at least two instructors remain from year to year, this evolution does not come at the sacrifice of continuity. The course enrolls 16 students per year, who are chosen from a large pool of applicants using criteria that emphasize need, diversity, and commitment to broadly disseminate information acquired in the course.   Many of the students are likely to have educational and supervisory responsibilities in the near future; others are already professors or post-doctoral fellows who will immediately pass on what they have learned in the course. In recent years, there has been a good balance of female and male students, and several under-represented minority students have participated. The course is advertised widely and specific contacts are made to institutional programs that facilitate recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in the life sciences. Periodically, the experimental protocols and associated materials are published in the form of a laboratory manual, and reach a wider audience through that mechanism.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course on Yeast Genetics and Genomics  July 26 - August 15, 2016  INSTRUCTORS:  Grant Brown, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada  Maitreya Dunham, University of Washington, Seattle, WA  Marc Gartenberg, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ  COURSE TEACHING ASSISTANTS:  Bryce Taylor, University of Washington, Seattle, WA  Evelyn Okeke, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ  Brandon Ho, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada     The Yeast Genetics &amp; Genomics Course is a modern, state of the art laboratory course designed to teach students the full repertoire of genetic approaches needed to dissect complex problems in the yeast Saccharomy cescerevisiae.  Combinations of classical and modern genetic approaches were emphasized, including the isolation and characterization of mutants, tetrad analysis, complementation and mitotic recombination.  Synthetic biology was explored through CRISPR/Cas9-directed engineering of heterologous biosynthetic pathways in yeast.  Students learned array-based methods, next generation sequencing, and genome-based methods of analysis facilitated by the yeast genome sequence, the deletion collection, and other genomic resources available to the community.  Molecular genetic techniques, including yeast transformation, gene replacement by PCR, construction and analysis of gene fusions, and generation of mutations were also emphasized.  Students used classical approaches and modern whole genome sequencing to gain experience in identifying and interpreting various kinds of genetic interactions including suppression and synthetic lethality (including SGA).  Students were immersed in yeast genomics and performed and interpreted experiments using DNA arrays, whole genome sequencing, and multiplexed DNA barcode sequencing.  Students gained first-hand experience in modern cytological approaches such as epitope tagging and imaging yeast cells using indirect immunofluorescence, GFP-protein fusions and a variety of fluorescent indicators for different subcellular organelles.  Lectures on fundamental aspects of yeast genetics were presented along with seminars given by prominent experts in the field on topics of current interest.  This course was supported with funds provided by the National Science Foundation.       Last Modified: 09/29/2017       Submitted by: David J Stewart]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
