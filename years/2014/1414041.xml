<AbstractNarration>Outbreaks of native insects periodically strip forests in many parts of the U.S., and understanding the natural forces that lead to outbreaks has been a long-standing scientific goal. Much less studied has been how human activities may interact with natural processes to promote or inhibit outbreaks. This project will investigate how the governance of forests at local to federal levels, human-caused climate change, fire frequency, and forest composition together determine outbreaks of the mountain pine beetle in western North America. This native insect has recently expanded its range and abundance and killed millions of hectares of trees. Results are expected to provide a scientific basis for the crafting of new policies that can better prevent or mitigate outbreaks of this and other insects and the substantial economic losses they cause. A modeling tool for managers and researchers will be made publicly available, and the project will collaborate with the U.S. Forest Service to support control of outbreaks. The research will also train graduate students from groups underrepresented in science and reach out to K-12 and undergraduate students through local events and an open, online course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to advance understanding of coupled natural and human systems that are governed by feedbacks between government policies, ecological processes and climate change. The study will develop an agent-based, computational model with submodels for social and ecological components that interact to produce emergent, large-scale patterns of forest change under a variety of climate change scenarios. Researchers will employ high-performance, parallel computing that strategically distributes climate, insect, and human decision-making to provide a multitude of simulations representing the space of potential future landscape patterns. Uncertainty analysis will provide insight into how various human and natural processes interact over time to influence the location and timing of outbreaks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Our modeling work on the spread of MPB epidemics advanced knowledge about the use of agent-based and spatio-temporal approaches in forest pest systems.  This includes insight on the importance of long-term temperature data for explaining MPB epidemics and provides additional support for the management practice of thinning as a way to reduce impacts from MPB in individual forests.  Our modeling work advanced knowledge around the application of agent-based models to disturbances and land management policies. This includes modelling considerations, such as how temperature averages impacted modelling of bark beetle winter survival, how forest stand conditions affect MPB outbreak patterns, and how national forest managers respond within the context of multi-scale pressures and incentives. Our research on content analysis and a topic modeling approach for analyzing responses to ecological disturbances advanced knowledge around methods for modeling and understanding discourse and content in policy related to ecological disturbances. In addition, this work contributed to broader impacts by providing a free content analysis tool for scientists and researchers to continue to expand its utility in ecological policy research. Our research reviewing existing federal policies and the role of federal agencies in managing forest health can provide guidance for enhancing ability and capacity for concentrated future policy efforts. This is important for contributing to future goals of policy tools and resources that adequately consider increasingly complex sustainability challenges across forested lands.   1)    Our case study research advanced knowledge around understanding how to increase resiliency to mountain pine beetle and similar fast-moving disturbances. This has implications for how land managers and other stakeholders might consider shaping land management approaches in the future. In particular, our results indicate that federal land managers need a broad and flexible set of strategies (enabling programs, tools, and authorities) that are adaptable to local social-ecological contexts and for working across boundaries and addressing shifting forest health needs. In addition, agency managers also need staff and financial capacity to accomplish environmental analysis and implement work on the ground. Stable appropriated funding can provide the foundational capacity important in response and mobilization. Finally, place-based collaboration and social support remain pivotal in shaping the options that managers and partners have for responding to disturbance in their local areas. Our research was the first effort to examine these criteria in the context of a single phenomenon (MPB outbreak) across multiple geographies, presenting new opportunities to build and share lessons based on comparative research.  Our award accomplished understanding how: 1) climate change and forest governance have collectively influenced bark beetle outbreaks in the American West over the past 100 years; 2) communities are able to respond to large scale bark beetle outbreaks given federal and state level government constraints and existing organizational relationships; and 3) communities can respond to bark beetle outbreaks in the uncertain future of climate change. This included the following outcomes:  Peer reviewed journal publications, a technical report, webinar, policy brief, project website and other outreach to communities of interest. Creation of models. This includes a mountain pine beetle simulation model that reinforced the current management practice of thinning to reduce MPB damages. It also suggests ways in which the complex MPB/host system behavior can respond in non-linear ways to changes in biotic and abiotic environment.  Additional modeling demonstrated the importance of using longer-term temperature data, as opposed to single-year data, in correlating MPB overwinter survival and high host tree mortality.  130 interviews with key stakeholders in case studies of four different landscapes (including 5 states and three USDA Forest Service Regions). Content and document analysis of federal forest policies, program documents, and mountain pine beetle related legislation.  Numerous training and professional development opportunities for over a dozen students, postdoctoral scholars and early career faculty.  Information sharing to communities of interest. This included: a nationally advertised and attended webinar "Management Responses to Mountain Pine Beetle Infestations on National Forestland"; meetings and presentations with USDA Forest Service decision makers, leadership in Washington DC about how project results advanced their understanding of responses to epidemics and outbreaks on national forest system lands; and a newsletter and targeted email to participants and stakeholders.  Information sharing with federal land managers and relevant stakeholders about how our research results on this project informed their future land management.       Other findings:   Disseminating information to stakeholders was key to sharing lessons from this project that may inform future land management or decision making.  Long term (i.e. decadal) temperature trends are better at predicting year-to-year mountain pine beetle outbreak-induced tree mortality than prior year temperatures. Forest policies over the 20th century have created over-mature pine forests that are more susceptible to mountain pine beetle outbreaks.  We identified productive models of local- to regional-scale governance approaches capable of adaptively responding to environmental change events while working within policy and budgetary constraints.
