<AbstractNarration>Mountains provide an important and distinctive type of coupling between natural and human systems. First, mountains themselves have especially diverse and intricate arrangements of habitats for both wildlife and people. Second, mountains are prone to natural catastrophes such as landslides and earthquakes and vulnerable to human-caused erosion and shifts in habitats due to climate change. Third, the interactions between natural montane systems and human systems extend considerable distances into lowlands, through use of such resources as water and timber. Fourth, different mountain ranges often differ in species and cultures and so provide comparative examples of how coupling between nature and humans works. This research coordination network will advance basic understanding of how natural and human systems affect one another by synthesizing data from the many individual studies of natural and human processes in mountains around the world. Results will inform management of forests and water supplies and protection of biodiversity and human livelihoods and culture in the U.S. and elsewhere. Through the Rocky Mountain Sustainability and Science Academy, researchers and stakeholders will receive professional training to enhance career opportunities and support collective action.  The project will also train graduate students and promote international scientific cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an innovative global-framework approach, the network will identify commonalities and differences in present-day dynamics and explore alternative future trajectories of montane coupled natural and human systems worldwide. Researchers, stakeholders, and policy-makers will develop and test mountain system typologies and trajectories using dynamic models. The network will engage in exercises with simple models to build common understandings and co-production of knowledge with a range of stakeholders. The modeling work and analytical discussions will promote learning, conceptualization, and comparative analysis of coupled processes and changes in mountains.  The network will provide novel opportunities for sharing knowledge, experience, and data through face-to-face and virtual interaction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mountain Sentinels Collaborative Network successfully addressed its goals of expanding  an international network of linked mountain biophysical and social science researchers and diverse stakeholders. They have several hundred people who now receive their newsletters and participate in webinars they call ‘Virtual Coffee’ and other events.   They have approximately 400 people who follow them on social media, and continue to expand their reach.  They organized panels at academic meetings (such as the introduction of an annual "Mountain Day" at the American Association for Geographers) and reached mountain stakeholders and students beyond academia (for example, they have worked with 17 diverse Mountain Fellows and have created K-12 educational materials focused on mountain social and ecological systems).   Through workshops and follow-up peer-reviewed publications, the RCN explored the key challenges in mountains (they call these "mountain paradoxes") and opportunities to overcome these.  They explored and evaluated tools and approaches to address mountain futures, especially those that use collaborative processes.  They compared different desired futures across mountains worldwide and found common desired and undesired futures, but also explored different desired futures and pathways towards them across diverse mountain contexts.  The Mountain Sentinels RCN also significantly contributed to a new way to do science in a collaborative manner, a process they call "Science with Society".  This aligns with the RCN goal to promote international, transdisciplinary approaches linking science with policy and practice.  They found that partnership formation can be a large barrier to effective collaborative problem-solving, and that addressing issues of unequal power dynamics can also lead to more effective outcomes.  They also found that projects initiated by non-academic researchers tend to lead to greater policy outcomes.  The RCN advanced knowledge regarding threats to mountain livelihoods and environmental sustainability across the world’s mountains &ndash; and identified ways to catalyze paths forward.  They synthesized and created new knowledge regarding participatory approaches to address sustainability challenges, and laid the groundwork for future success.  The project engaged undergraduate student classes and individuals and also worked with graduate students, and early career faculty.  This stimulated new funding proposals and research publications among students from diverse institutions in the US and abroad.  The project funded Fellows, several of whom are Indigenous to the US and underrepresented and served in STEM.  Publications and associated media work brought public attention to the global importance of mountains, the challenges they face, and opportunities to address mountain sustainability challenges.  The project also learned how to engage the public more effectively in the scientific process.          Last Modified: 01/04/2021       Submitted by: Julia A Klein]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
