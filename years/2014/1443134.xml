<AbstractNarration>This project is in support of a week-long workshop at UC Berkeley on "Coding: From Practice to Theory", to be held at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. The workshop is part of a program on Information Theory which will take place from January 13 to May 15, 2015. The intellectual roots of the workshop include deep results in algebra and combinatorics that yield efficient codes, new paradigms for securely storing, distributing, sharing and compressing data in distributed systems, and technological considerations related to mobile devices, deep space probes and low power computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will enhance communication among the mathematics, computer science and engineering communities. It will be open to all potential participants and the workshop findings (including videotapes of presentations) will be distributed to the public for comments and engagement. We will support students to attend the workshop, and will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds to contribute to a wide range of application</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The first workshop of the thematic semester on "Information Theory" was entitled "Coding: From Practice to Theory." It was co-organized by Michael Luby, Alex Dimakis, Thomas Richardson and Ruediger Urbanke and it took place the week of February 9th-13th, 2015.  The aim of the workshop was to concentrate on modern computational applications that likely could use codes as part of their solution, look more deeply into the requirements of those applications, and then see if existing coding technology is sufficient, or if coding technology with different properties needs to be developed.  In order to accomplish our goal we invited people from a broad range of backgrounds, including engineers, theoretical computer scientists, mathematicians, and also people with a background in statistical physics. An important further aim of the workshop was to foster stronger interactions and exchange of ideas between these groups and to discuss recent developments in the areas such as polar coding, spatial coupling, sub-linear decoding, and computationally bounded channels.  The range of applications that can potentially benefit from coding is considerable and these applications include content storage and delivery applications, peer-to-peer data distribution that is reliable and scalable, peer-to-peer content sharing applications, e.g., streaming and file sharing, intermittent connectivity and mobility, e.g., sharing data among mobile devices, automobiles, in deep space, etc., concurrent path delivery, e.g., multiple LTE paths, WiFi, Broadcast, low power computing, e.g., computing below threshold where reliability is sacrificed for power savings, sharing data across time, i.e., storing and accessing data long into the future in reliable, simple and scalable ways, high speed communication within devices, e.g., high speed buses, flash drives, etc., data compression and processing on compressed data, security applications, e.g., the fuzzy fingerprint vault.

The first day consisted entirely of so called "lightning talks." These were five-minute mini-presentations. The remaining four days of the week were dedicated to twenty-five thirty-minute research talks. These were given in pairs, followed by a short break and grouped by themes. The breaks served several important functions. First, they allowed people to ask follow-up questions in a social setting, thus greatly enhancing the interactions.

Another theme of the workshop that received considerable attention was the finite-length behavior of codes. This is typically formalized by looking at the so-called "scaling" exponent. Techniques to analyze this scaling exponent and potential methods to improve it were discussed from a variety of viewpoints by people working in very different communities. This connects closely to a very vexing open problem in this area, and one that is currently written prominently on the "Open Problems" board of the Simons Institute: prove that Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity (and that they have essentially optimal scaling behavior).  It quickly became clear after the workshop that several of the problems had captured the imagination of the participants. Some progress has already been made and new connections were formed.  For example, the computation and optimization of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
