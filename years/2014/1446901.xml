<AbstractNarration>Wireless body area sensing networks (WBANs) have the potential to revolutionize health care in the near term and enhance other application domains including sports, entertainment, military and emergency situations. These WBANs represent a novel cyber-physical system that unites engineering systems, the natural world and human individuals. The coupling of bio-sensors with a wireless infrastructure enables the real-time monitoring of an individual's health, environment and related behaviors continuously, as well as the provision of real-time feedback with nimble, adaptive, and personalized interventions. Recent technological advances in low power integrated circuits, signal processing and wireless communications have enabled the design of tiny, low cost, lightweight, intelligent medical devices, sensors and networking platforms that have the potential to make the concept of truly pervasive wireless sensor networks a reality. To develop the WBANs of the future, this breakthrough research will pursue the interfaces of sensing, communication and control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to investigate energy and delay sensitive sensing, communication, decision-making and control for health monitoring application of wireless body area networks. In these systems, sensors with varying accuracy observe heterogeneous source signals that must be processed and communicated and used for inference and decision-making purposes. All of these operations must be carried out in the presence of constraints on power and energy resources at the sensors, limited communication and computational abilities and with low end-to-end delay between the sensing of information to its eventual utilization. In this project, a global (end-to end) perspective is adopted that optimizes network operation to improve the information quality and enhance the lifetime of the network, focusing in particular on optimal use of sensor resources such as energy, new sensing and communication paradigms that balance information quality and energy expenditure, and real-time encoding and decoding methods that provide strict delay guarantees on information delivery. The proposed work will contribute to several research areas including optimal resource allocation at sensors, adaptive sensing methods, real-time encoding and decoding and event-based communication. The educational impact of the proposed research will come through the training of new information technology professionals and scientists with expertise in cross-disciplinary research,  development of new courses based on the proposed research activity and continued efforts to include women and under-represented minorities in the research program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Internet of Things promises to revolutionalize how devices interact.  Such devices could have a combination of computing, sensing, communicating and computing components.  It is generally assumed that these devices interact via communication.  The fields of wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation and embedded systems have all influenced the modern definition of IoT.  Examples of IoT systems include smart homes, autonomous vehicles, drone platoons and of particular interest to this project: wireless body area sensing networks. In this project, we have investigated energy and delay sensitive sensing, communication, decision-making and control in the context of IoT systems. We have particularly focussed on systems where sensors with varying accuracy observe heterogeneous source signals that must be processed and communicated and used for inference and decision-making purposes. All of these operations must be carried out in the presence of constraints on power and energy resources at the sensors, limited communication and computational abilities and with low end-to-end delay between the sensing of information to its eventual utilization.     We have considered the optimal use of sensor resources such as energy, new sensing and communication paradigms that balance information quality and energy expenditure and real-time encoding and decoding methods that provide strict delay guarantees on information delivery.  A very important problem in the quest for unified sensing, estimation and control is the ability to accurately and efficiently track an unknown (usually time-varying) process in an uncertain environment by adaptively exploiting available heterogeneous resources such as different sensor types or actuation.

This is known as the active state tracking problem.

Example research outcomes of this project have included: the design of remote estimation strategies with implicit communication.   Our work on minimax decision-making in team provided the first systematic way of optimizing decision strategies in a backward inductive manner. By modeling active sensing and resource-constrained communication as decentralized decision problems, we have applied our insights from decision-making in teams to optimize resource utilization and estimation/decision quality trade-offs in systems such as WBANs.   We have defined a new class of research problems based on observation-driven scheduling.  We have further made connections between these problems and the field of Machine Learning.   An important contribution of the project has been the design of active hypothesis testing mechanisms.  In contrast to most prior work, we have focused on the regime of decision making within a finite number of observations.  Our strategies are provably asymptotically optimal, but achieve the optimal probability of error rate significantly faster than the (often randomized) asymptotically optimal methods.    Our framework for the observation-driven scheduling can also be used to model communication constraints in other research fields such as Organizational Economics - CEOs interacting with team members and receiving subsets of information optimally.  We have also been applying our methods to the modeling of bacterial populations in collaboration with USC colleagues in Biophysics.  Such efforts can enable the potential "engineering" of microbial populations to say create high performance microbial fuel cells or the design of interventions for infection that do not require antibiotics.  The project has trained graduate students to integrate knowledge and understanding from diverse fields like optimization, stochastic control and decentralized decision-making to address theoretical as well as practical questions relating to sensing, communication, estimation and control in the context of cyber physical systems and the Internet of Things. All of the graduate students on this project have presented their research in conference settings and within the group meetings.  The principal investigators have given numerous talks at universities and corporations, sharing the findings of this project.  The research has generated a number of published journal and conference articles.          Last Modified: 05/13/2020       Submitted by: Urbashi Mitra]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
