<AbstractNarration>With with award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Christopher Arumainayagam at Wellesley College to study chemical reactions that are driven by interactions with light and/or electrons.  Dr. Arumainayagam has devised probes to study the composition of nanoscale thin films under ultrahigh vacuum conditions before and after irradiation by low-energy electrons or photons.  These probes enable his team to observe and characterize the subtle but important chemical changes induced by irradiation.  This important category of chemical reactions impacts low-temperature plasmas used in industrially important processes such as plasma etching; use of low-energy electrons instead of photons for highly selective bond dissociations; identification of tracer molecules associated with specific pathways for interstellar synthesis of complex organic molecules (COM); and the relative roles of electrons and photons in atmospheric processes.  Involvement of women and minority undergraduate students in this research is planned to promote diversification of the STEM workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work specifically seeks to assess the differences and similarities between reactions initiated by low-energy (&lt; 8 eV) electrons and photons. Target systems include condensed-phase ammonia, water and methanol, each of which is investigated using post-irradiation temperature programmed desorption, post-irradiation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, and isothermal electron/photon-stimulated desorption. Electrons/photons with sub-ionization energies are used to avoid production of low-energy secondary electrons, thereby ensuring that fundamental differences between electron and photon irradiation are probed. Among the objectives of the research are: (i) to measure the effective cross-section for electron/photon-induced reaction and desorption, and to identify all of the electron/photon-induced reaction products; (ii) to study the dependence of the reaction cross-sections and yields on electron/photon fluence, incident electron/photon energy, and film thickness; and (iii) to determine if the products identified by post-irradiation temperature-programmed desorption are nascent radiolysis products. The studies are designed to establish whether electron-induced condensed phase reactions generate unique molecular species; and whether electrons are more effective than photons for initiating specific condensed phase reactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit     The projects we have worked on during the last three years have resulted in seven manuscripts (three publications, one book chapter in press, and three submitted). While one manuscript focused on the role of low-energy electrons in atmospheric chemistry, the other six pertained to the role of photochemistry and radiation chemistry in astrochemistry. The goal of the latter studies is to provide a fundamental understanding of how prebiotic molecules are synthesized in ices found in the interstellar medium.  "Low-energy (&lt;20 eV) and high-energy (1000 eV) electron-induced methanol radiolysis of astrochemical interest" (Published 2016)  We reported on the first infrared study of the low-energy (&lt; 20 eV) electron-induced reactions of condensed methanol. The findings presented in this publication are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that high-energy condensed phase radiolysis is mediated by low-energy electron-induced reactions.  "The Role of Low-Energy (&le; 20 eV) Electrons in Astrochemistry" (Published 2016)  We illustrate a need for astrochemical models to include the details of electron-induced reactions in addition to those driven by UV photons. We hypothesize that cosmic ray-induced low-energy electron processing of interstellar ices and dust may occur via three mechanisms, the most important of which is the interaction of cosmic rays with molecules within ices, generating a cascade of low-energy electrons which interact with molecules within the bulk of the ice mantles.  "Photochemistry of Condensed Ammonia" (Published 2018)  We have completed the first post-irradiation photochemistry condensed ammonia (ND3) study that demonstrates hydrazine (N2D4), diazene (N2D2), triazane (N3H5), and triazene and/or cyclotriazane (N3H3) formation at incident photon energies less than 7.4 eV, below the ~9.0 eV threshold for the production of secondary electrons. Previous post-irradiation studies of condensed ammonia photochemistry have used photons sufficiently energetic to ionize condensed ammonia, causing radiation chemistry in addition to photochemistry. Ion-molecule (e.g., NH4+&ndash;NH3) reactions cannot be ruled out in such studies.  "The Role of Low-Energy Electrons of Atmospheric Chemistry" (In press, 2018)  In this invited book chapter, we discuss the role of low-energy electrons in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial atmospheres. According to a recent hypothesis, the subject of significant current controversy, low-energy electrons produced by cosmic rays, in addition to UV-VIS photons from the sun, interact with chlorofluorocarbons to produce chlorine atoms that subsequently destroy ozone in the Antarctic.  "Extraterrestrial Prebiotic Molecules: Photochemistry vs. Radiation Chemistry of Interstellar Ices" (Submitted, 2018, Chemical Society Reviews)  While gas-phase reactions and surface reactions on bare carbonaceous or silicaceous dust grains contribute to cosmic chemistry, energetic processing of cosmic ices via photochemistry and radiation chemistry is thought to be the dominant mechanism for the extraterrestrial synthesis of prebiotic molecules. Because a primary objective of chemistry is to provide molecular-level mechanistic explanations for macroscopic phenomena, our ultimate goal in this review paper is to critically evaluate our current understanding of cosmic ice energetic processing which likely leads to the synthesis of extraterrestrial prebiotic molecules.  "Detection of Methoxymethanol as a Photolysis Product of Condensed Methanol" (Submitted, 2018)  We report the identification of methoxymethanol (CH3OCH2OH) as a photolysis product of condensed methanol based on temperature-programmed desorption studies conducted following photon irradiation at energies below the ionization threshold (9.8 eV) of condensed methanol. The first detection of methoxymethanol in the interstellar medium was reported in 2017 based on data from Bands 6 and 7 from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Methoxymethanol was first identified in 1995 as an electron-induced radiolysis product of condensed methanol. The results presented in this study indicate that methoxymethanol can be formed from both the radiolysis and photolysis of methanol.  "Electron-Induced Radiolysis of Astrochemically Relevant Ammonia Ices" (submitted,2018)  Astrochemical processes were simulated under ultrahigh vacuum conditions by high-energy (1 keV) and low-energy (7 eV) electron-irradiation of nanoscale thin films of ammonia deposited on cryogenically cooled metal substrates. Experiments with isotopologues of ammonia provide convincing evidence for the electron-induced formation of hydrazine (N2H4) and diazene (N2H2) from condensed ammonia (NH3). To understand the dynamics of ammonia radiolysis, the dependence of hydrazine and diazene yield on irradiation time, film thickness, electron flux, incident electron energy, and ice temperature was investigated.  Broader Impact  During my 2015&ndash;2018 NSF-RUI grant, I have contributed significantly to the education and mentoring of approximately 50 research undergraduate students. During the last five years, students from the PI?s lab have gone on to several graduate schools (e.g., MIT (4), Northwestern (2), Dartmouth (1), Yale (1), University of Michigan (1), University of California (Berkeley) (1), University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (1), and Stanford (1).  The PI?s research continues to receive international recognition, as evidenced by presentations in Lithuania (2016), Brazil (2016), France (2016, 2017), Chile (2017), and Vietnam (2018).
