<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Stephen Bergmeier from Ohio University and colleagues Hao Chen, Michael Held II, Justin Holub and Marcia Kieliszewski will acquire a high resolution orbitrap liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. In an orbitrap instrument there an outer section that acts as an electrode and a coaxial inner spindle-like electrode that traps ions in an orbital motion around the inner electrode. An image of the current is produced and converted to a mass spectrum using mathematical (Fourier transform) methods. This spectrometer will also be used in curricular activities involving students and researchers from the southeastern Ohio region and it will be used also by industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) the study of proteins involving elucidation of glycoprotein structures, probing protein redox chemistry, detection of miniature protein ligands and analyses of protein damage from oxidative stress; (b) characterizing synthesized drug candidates, natural products and their metabolites; and (c) establishing chemometric approaches for the identification of biomarkers and validation of chemometric models and algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
