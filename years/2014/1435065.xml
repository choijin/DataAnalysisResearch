<AbstractNarration>Engineers and scientists generally think in terms of three means to mix fluids, which can be easily explained in terms of mixing cream in coffee.  Diffusion disperses the cream in a cup of coffee via molecular collisions; chaotic advection, or stirring, generates thin layers of coffee and cream that merge; turbulence mixes the coffee and cream by strong agitation or vigorous stirring.  However, the simple technique of cutting and shuffling, much like what takes place in shuffling a deck of cards or mixing the colors of a Rubik's cube, is also a means of mixing that is commonplace.  However, it is not well understood in the context of engineering systems such as mixing powders and granules for pharmaceuticals, plastic resins, and chemicals.  This award supports the development of a formal mathematical framework to predict mixing by cutting and shuffling that is validated by computational and experimental results.  The theory is inspired by abstract mathematical concepts, but is motivated by systems for blending and mixing bulk particles or granules, a common process in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  The research links fundamental mathematics and practical applications while training the next generation of scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While molecular diffusion, chaotic advection, and turbulence as mixing mechanisms have long been studied, mixing by cutting and shuffling is not well explored or understood.  This award centers on a relatively new mathematical approach that describes cutting and shuffling known as Piecewise Isometries (PWI).  The idea is to apply PWI concepts to mixing as well as to connect PWI with traditional dynamical systems approaches.  The objective is to develop and utilize PWI within a dynamical systems framework to predict mixing by cutting and shuffling in 2D and 3D geometries with eventual applications to practical mixing systems.  The development of the 3D dynamical systems framework will be informed by the mixing of granular materials, leading to an integrated theory inspired by abstract mathematical concepts but connected to practical applications of cutting and shuffling. The mathematics of PWI will be integrated into the dynamical systems toolkit, while complementary experiments and simulations will be used to confirm the applicability of the theoretical approaches to a model granular mixing system.  The merging of new mathematics, dynamical systems approaches, and physical applications could result in an entirely new paradigm for understanding and predicting mixing.</AbstractNarration>

By combining the mathematics of Piecewise Isometries, or PWIs, with dynamical systems approaches and tools, we were able to reveal the fundamental aspects of mixing driven by cutting and shuffling. Our findings were communicated in twelve papers (nine published, three currently in review) and two PhD dissertations, as well as numerous talks and poster presentations at international conferences.  The project provided advanced research training for four PhD students and one postdoctoral student.  Two of our papers addressed the simplest cutting-and-shuffling system, namely a line segment.  In this model system, a line segment is cut into a finite number of pieces and then those pieces are shuffled to reform the line, see Image 1.  Repeating this process leads to mixing, and using different cut locations and different shuffle orders greatly influences the degree of mixing.  In one paper we showed how real-world variation in cut-location-accuracy affects the degree of mixing.  In the other paper, we examined how line segments could be optimally mixed with a fixed shuffling order by varying the cut location between successive shuffles.    The remainder of our work examined mixing driven by cutting-and-shuffling a hemisphere.  This particular system was selected due to its close connection to a real world system consisting of a spherical tumbler filled with granular materials and alternately rotated about two distinct horizontal axes (called the Biaxial Spherical Tumbler, or BST).  Theoretically, we explored the geometry of the set of all cutting lines, called the exceptional set, for the BST PWI parameterized by the two rotation angles of the spherical tumbler, see Image 2.  The exceptional set in this case is rich in structure, consisting of uncut (and thus unmixed) "islands" surrounded by a fractal sea of cutting lines.  The form of the structure is highly dependent on the rotation parameters, see Image 3.  We characterized the fraction of the hemisphere covered by the exceptional set and explained how parameters generating low coverage also generated poor mixing and were related to resonances of the map defined by successive application of the PWI, see Image 4.  Additionally, we considered the effects of the angle between the two rotation axes and the interaction of cutting-and-shuffling with the much better understood mixing mechanism of stretching-and-folding. We also completed two experimental works in the BST system which showed that the exceptional set structure predicted by the PWI generated remarkably persistent structures when the tumbler was filled with identical particles, see Image 5, as well as  segregation structure when the tumbler was filled with a mixture of large and small particles, see Image 6.  Finally, we completed a review/perspective piece (currently under review) outlining an array of possibilities of cutting-and-shuffling mechanisms, grounded in one-dimensional systems and evolving from there to two-dimensional planar, two-dimensional spherical, and fully three-dimensional geometries.  The broader impacts of our work include the realization that the skeleton of mixing in solids or systems with a finite shear strength is well-described by the formalism of piecewise isometries.  Besides their fundamental utility, these results promise to result in improvements in understanding granular systems and other yield-stress system that are of immense economic importance in industries ranging from mining to pharmaceuticals.
