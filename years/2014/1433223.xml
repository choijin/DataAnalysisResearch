<AbstractNarration>This project will explore several interconnected questions in the area of modulation-invariant time-frequency analysis. The first group of questions is concerned with the return times phenomenon for measure-preserving systems. Here, one is interested in the convergence of weighted averages along flows in dynamical systems, specifically when the weights are generated by a flow in a second dynamical system.  Two problems of particular interest are to determine the amount of Lp regularity required for convergence, especially when the averages are replaced by singular integrals, and to determine, in terms of variation-norm estimates, how quickly this convergence occurs. These problems should be addressed by proving suitable extensions of the Carleson-Hunt theorem. The second group of questions concerns the bilinear Hilbert transform. One problem of interest here is to find new estimates which are uniform in the parameter which determines the singularity set for the transform. A second problem is to determine the rate of convergence for truncated transforms and the associated maximal operator. Although, at first glance, these two groups of questions may not seem to be related, their resolution is expected to be largely guided by a common set of tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research falls under the broad umbrella of harmonic analysis, a discipline which studies the decomposition of many types of data into combinations of basic waves of varying frequencies. These decompositions have been broadly applied in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and finance. An application which is especially relevant here is data compression, where one seeks to represent a signal, such as a movie or audio track, accurately while using a minimum amount of storage space. Convergence rate estimates, as in the previous paragraph, can in principle be used to characterize how much space is needed to give a "good" representation of a signal. The project also makes significant contact with areas of mathematics outside of harmonic analysis, including ergodic theory and additive combinatorics, and can be expected to stimulate many active discussions with faculty and students of the LSU math department, and with collaborators across the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Most research in modern pure mathematics lies in one of the three areas of algebra, analysis, and topology. My work lies in the branch of analysis known as harmonic analysis and, more specifically, in the subspecialties of Radon-transforms and time-frequency analysis. For purposes of context (although my interests are more towards the pure end of the spectrum), the former area has seen applications in medical imaging, such as the reconstruction of an image from CT-scan data. The latter area is centered around the convergence of Fourier-series, a topic of interest for modern image, video, and audio compression algorithms.   This award has resulted in the publication of ten articles, five each in the two areas above. I will briefly place three of these papers in context.         For the last two decades, the most intensively studied question in the area of Radon-transforms has been the Kakeya problem. This asks "Given a collection of lines in Euclidean space, one of which points in each possible direction, how large (in terms of dimension) must their union be?" A natural variant of this is the question "Given an arbitrary collection of lines, how large must their union be in terms of the size of the collection?" In Unions of lines in Fn, I give a complete answer to this latter question in a model setting where Euclidean space is replaced by a vector space over a finite-field.  The modern rigorous treatment of calculus was essentially motivated by the early nineteenth century question "Under what conditions and in what sense does the Fourier series of a function converge?" It was not until 1966 that one of the main aspects of this question was answered by the celebrated theorem of Carleson on pointwise convergence. In Bounds for Mq,* Carleson and related operators I explore some extensions and refinements of this question.  Finally, in 1946 Paul Erd ?os famously asked "Given a finite collection of points in Euclidean space, how large can the set of pairs of these points which are distance one apart be, relative to the size of the set of points itself?" Despite much attention over the years, this has yet to be fully answered. In Unit distance problems, we propose and consider a variant of this problem where the finite collection is replaced by an infinite collection.
