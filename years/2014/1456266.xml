<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project presents novel technology to fabricate dry, removable, reusable adhesives based on aligned polymeric nanofibers using scalable electrospinning methodologies.  This new approach offers the potential advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle-free nanofiber spinning processes. Dry reusable adhesives as a replacement for messy liquid glues will improve product safety and reduce environmental impact. Removable and reusable adhesive tapes and labels will also eliminate waste and facilitate product recycling. The resulting products will have strong shear adhesion and easy peel, leading to broad application with a wide range of substrates like glass, metal, wall board, and plastics. Proof-of-concept samples have confirmed market-driven value propositions. The Phase II project will develop commercial products and applications for consumer and industrial applications, for automotive assembly systems, for decorative wall murals, and for medical device and health care uses. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the manufacturing process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phase I project has confirmed proof-of-concept dry adhesive samples with shear adhesion strengths exceeding 20 N/cm2 in dynamic mode and 45 N/cm2 in dead weight mode.  The resulting samples have low peel strength and are reusable. In Phase II, the electrospinning process will be optimized using novel polymer blend systems to achieve performance targets for specific customer product development. The nozzleless electrospinning process will be scaled to the pilot level for product testing and to provide the engineering design basis for commercial manufacture. A continuous roll-to-roll process to produce aligned nanofibers will break new ground in the electrospinning industry.  New applications in medical devices have been proposed by strategic partners to capitalize on the self-adhesion properties of these materials.  Dry adhesive applicator systems will be developed to allow the aligned adhesive nanofibers to conform to surface asperities. With the Phase I success of proof-of-concept prototypes, the Phase II effort will move the development of aligned nanofiber dry adhesives into the market introduction phase in preparation for commercial manufacture and sales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) SBIR program and the NSF I-Corps program, Akron Ascent Innovations (AAI) has developed and commercialized a new bio-inspired dry adhesive, called ShearGrip, that offers a unique combination of high strength, excellent clean removability, and reusability on a wide range of surfaces, not possible with conventional adhesives.  AAI is a startup company based in Akron, Ohio that has developed and scaled up a revolutionary new type of ultra-low tack, removable adhesive material made from electrospun nanofibers based on intellectual property licensed from the University of Akron. AAI?s new class of adhesive materials is able to achieve a strong, but easily removable, bond between surfaces through nanoscale interactions.

In 2019, AAI was selected as a winner of the Green Chemistry &amp; Commerce Council (GC3) Startup Network 4th Annual Technology Showcase for this green, sustainable adhesive technology which eliminates VOCs, sticky residue, and messy liquids.   Initial adhesive backed products have been commercialized for the consumer market segment to position decorative and functional materials on interior surfaces and can be found at www.akronascent.com.  AAI?s platform approach can be used for a wide range of applications ranging from temporary commercial signage, wall hanging hooks, and picture frame tabs to automotive assembly, flexible packaging, electronics handling, smart clothing and health care materials.  The ShearGrip dry adhesive is produced commercially in a wide format roll-to-roll manufacturing process and then converted into a final product form depending on the end use application.  At scale, ShearGrip dry adhesive backed products can be produced at competitive costs to specialty pressure sensitive adhesives. The nanofiber adhesive technology platform will be expanded by optimizing the proprietary polymer blend formulation for specific end use applications with collaborative development partners.  The development and commercialization of this new dry adhesive technology platform would not have been possible without the strong support of the National Science Foundation SBIR and I-Corps programs and the excellent guidance of Program Director Ben Schrag.
