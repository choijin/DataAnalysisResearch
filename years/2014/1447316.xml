<AbstractNarration>Systems engineering is the technical activity that coordinates all the parts of a large system development.  To date, a major part of systems engineering management of the development of large complex engineered systems such as aircraft, spacecraft or transportation systems has been based on predicting the outcome of the development project:  How much time it will take? How much will the development cost? Or, how much will the eventual product cost to manufacture?  In current practice, answering these questions almost always results in underestimates.  Despite decades of research on improving such predictions, no progress has been made.  This project will attempt to find a more successful approach to managing these systems that does not rely on prediction, but instead focuses on control, controlling cost, weight, schedule and performance.  This is a short, high-risk exploratory research project to establish the feasibility of a controls-based management strategy.  If the strategy is feasible, further research will be necessary to develop the new method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan is to deconstruct systems engineering to its essence and reconstruct an approach based on methods and ideas available in modern control theory, and then determine how to measure the performance of this new approach, exploiting promising research methodologies from other fields.  However, actual measurement of the performance of the method through case studies will be left for future work.  The project will employ a basic optimal regulator as one strategy, and will explore a dynamic-programming-like approach as a second approach.  The results will, if successful, provide insights into a new and more effective approach to systems engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Very large systems development projects, such as designing an electrical power station or designing a Mars rover, currently rely on predicting exactly how the design ought to turn out, and then driving the design organization toward that prediction.  This should be unnecessary, because what is needed is a very good design, perhaps even the best possible design, not a design that was imagined beforehand.    This project explored various ways of creating a very good design without predicting how the design would turn out -- that is, performing systems engineering without using requirements.  Theory suggests that use of requirements has a strong detrimental effect on advanced technology complex systems.  This project searched for systems engineering methods that could avoid the negative effect of requirements.    This was planned as an exploratory, high-risk project -- we did not know what we would find or whether any of our attempts at radical methods would work out.  In the end, we did find some approaches that may mature into alternative ways of designing complex systems, and we deepened our understanding of how large organizations create high technology products.  The work on this project was mostly done by students, and most of the funding went directly to support students.  Five students worked on various phases of the project, and they all learned a great deal about systems engineering and about research methods.  Two of the students were women and one was a member of a minority that is underrepresented in STEM fields, so it is fair to say that this project actively contributed to improving the representation of women and minorities in STEM fields by training these students and funding their education.
