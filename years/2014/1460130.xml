<AbstractNarration>This award is expected to yield improved understanding of turbulence not only in the interplanetary medium, but also in the solar corona, through interplanetary and interstellar space, and to astrophysical plasmas throughout the Universe. The project will combine theoretical investigations, numerical simulations, and data analysis of spacecraft observations, contributing to the solar wind models along with similar efforts from other research teams. The expected research results will be broadly disseminated through conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals; making them fully accessible to the international scientific community. Public talks to audiences such as high school students will be given in order to convey specific project results in the context of general space science education. The project will involve a junior postdoctoral researcher supporting the NSF Strategic Goals in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrust of this SHINE project is to study fundamental properties of the short-wavelength turbulence in the solar wind, including processes by which fluctuating energy is transferred among various possible turbulence fields, as well as address the energy dissipation from those fluctuations into the heating of solar wind plasma. The primary goal of this research project is to obtain a comprehensive plasma physics description of the solar wind turbulence in observed frequencies above 0.5Hz, which correspond to the short-wavelength fluctuations of the order of or less than the proton inertial length. For such fluctuations, velocity-space processes are essential for understanding the physics of the solar wind plasma. The project team will use both hybrid and particle-in-cell simulation techniques to pursue theoretical and computational aspects of the research. The proposed observational studies will utilize data from several different spacecraft flying in the near-Earth's space, and these data will be closely related to the diagnostics of the numerical simulations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The NSF-SHINE research project "Short-Wavelength Turbulence in the Solar Wind" was funded over the period April 2015 through March 2019.  The research was carried out primarily by Principal Investigator S. Peter Gary (Space Science Institute) and Co-Principal Investigator Tulasi Parashar (University of Delaware).  The primary tools of the research were particle-in-cell and hybrid computer simulations; the primary subjects of the research were to compare the various types of simulations appropriate to study the forward cascade of short-wavelength turbulence in collisionless plasmas, and by appropriate choice of simulation codes come to better understand the fundamental nonlinear physics of that cascade.              Plasma turbulence may be defined as an ensemble of broadband, large amplitude fluctuations in an ionized medium.  The usual scenario for such turbulence is that long-wavelength fluctuations transfer energy toward shorter wavelength modes (the "forward cascade") where the waves are eventually dissipated.              The Turbulent Dissipation Challenge, first advocated by Co-Investigator Tulasi Parashar, uses several different kinds of simulations to study the forward cascade as well as the dissipation of plasma turbulence.  The first part of this project compared the turbulent electric fields in fully kinetic and incompressible two-fluid models to show that the kinetic range electric field is well captured by a reduced version of a generalized Ohm?s Law.  The second part of this project used a fully three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation code to obtain scaling laws for the electron and ion maximum heating rates and entropy increases due to kinetic Alfven turbulence.  Although these results were obtained from an idealized homogeneous collisionless plasma model, they nevertheless represent an important step forward in understanding how solar wind turbulence transfers magnetic fluctuation energy into plasma species heating.
