<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Southeast Analysis Meeting: SEAM 2014" that will be held March 14-15, 2014, on the campus of Clemson University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the latest in a twenty-nine-year-long series that has hosted conferences covering a wide spectrum of subareas of analysis and that has become the leading venue in the U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2014 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring five plenary speakers who will address topics in operator theory (John McCarthy, Stefan Richter) and harmonic analysis (Ingrid Daubechies, Michael Lacey, Camil Muscalu) in one-hour talks. Three junior speakers (Yen Do, Kate Juschenko, Constanze Liaw) will deliver thirty-minute plenary lectures. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

The topics of the plenary lectures reflected the major current developments in the area of mathematical analysis.  The intimate format of the meeting fostered collaborations between younger and more senior mathematicians.  SEAM 30 successfully continued the tradition of serving as the first significant research conference for many beginning researchers and advanced graduate students. Out of the 79 registered participants, 32 were graduate students.   NSF funding was used primarily for participant support.
