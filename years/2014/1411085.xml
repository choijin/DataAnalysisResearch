<AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) and Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Programs, both in the Division of Materials Research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: The broader significance of this project is for the emerging Big Data era. The research is aimed to investigate a new field of ultrafast magnetism switching that could improve data storage, retrieval, and processing. The ultrafast switching has a potential to enable data storage media with unprecedented performance. The project involves researchers with different knowledge background of physics, materials science, optics and nanotechnology and thus provides a highly interdisciplinary training environment for graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students (including women and minorities) and the opportunities for them to learn and work together. This project generates new knowledge and educates future workforce in an emerging research area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The objective of the project is to study the complicated interactions of electron, spin and lattice for the spatial resolution beyond the optical far-field diffraction limit. The goals are to understand and manipulate the nanoscale magnetism at ultrafast time scales. Such manipulation is enabled by using plasmonic effects to achieve the nanometer scale resolution for otherwise not accessible due to the diffraction limit and by applying state-of-the-art ultrafast techniques with femtosecond lasers to achieve ultra-short temporal scale of magnetization reversal, which occurs in ferrimagnetic nanomaterials. The scope of the project is at the frontier of ultrafast all-optical magnetization reversal of ferrimagnetic nanomaterials, and merges two scientific areas: plasmonics and magnetism. The fundamental physics of ultra-fast plasmonic magnetism is explored via a variety of state-of-the-art experimental techniques and nanomaterial processing methods.</AbstractNarration>

Consequently, great challenges have been brought to electronic hardware with its demands on higher operation speed, larger capacity of storing information, and faster and more efficient approaches to process as well as record/store information. Our research programs aim to address these challenges by investigating modern femto-magnetism and ultrafast spintronics, and low dissipation technologies to create innovative high speed magnetic memory devices, spintronic information processing units and even THz applications.   In magnetic memory devices and spintronic devices, logical "1" and "0" are represented by 2 stable states of magnetization domain or electron spin, either "up" or "down". Thus, the recording and processing of information corresponds to magnetization reversal as well as manipulation of electron spin. And in our research program, we particularly focus on manipulating spin on a sub-picosecond timescale using femto-second laser pulse, which is one of the shortest ever manmade events, in a state-of-the-art optical probe-pump setup build by ourselves. Moreover, we designed and successfully fabricated a plasmoinc nano-disk lattice in our magnetic device to enhance its magnetization reversal process. Our results also provided insightful understanding for the fundamental physics of this femto-magnetism. Another significant outcome of our research is our newly developed magneto-optical technique to, for the first time, directly measure and quantify the spin orbit torques (SOTs) in a prototypical heavy metal/magnetic insulator (YIG/Pt) heterostructure. In this structure, spin orbit torque is induced by heavy metal with strong spin orbit coupling and can serve as an alternative approach to induce ultrafast spin dynamics.

These findings will definitely accelerate the development of magnetic and spintronic devices to address the challenges brought up by the Big Data Era and open a new stage for the research on fundamental  physics in thiese fields.
