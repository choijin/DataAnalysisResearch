<AbstractNarration>The PIMS Undergraduate Workshop in Supersymmetry will be held at the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences at the University of British Columbia, on May 25-31, 2014. In physics, supersymmetry is a pairing between bosons and fermions appearing in theories of subatomic particles.  One may study supersymmetry mathematically by using adinkra symbols, which are graphs with vertices representing the particles in a supersymmetric theory and edges corresponding to the supersymmetry pairings.  The workshop will combine lectures on the mathematics of supersymmetry, emphasizing graph theory and algebraic structures, with problem-solving sessions.  Sylvester James Gates of the University of Maryland, recipient of the National Medal of Science, will be the keynote speaker.  The workshop's website is https://people.uwec.edu/whitchua/supersymmetry/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will have direct impact on undergraduate education, by introducing students to a thriving area of research outside the standard curriculum.  Students will gain tools to choose and evaluate a graduate program and valuable skills in using computer algebra systems for mathematical experimentation.  The speakers and problem session leaders will build a community of mathematicians interested in undergraduate research in supersymmetry; they will use this experience to enhance the undergraduate research program at their home institutions.  This award defrays travel costs for eleven US-based undergraduate students participating in the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
