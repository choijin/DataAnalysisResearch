<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the 27th Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing, to be held during May 16-17, 2014, at West Virginia University.  The conference will feature several one-hour invited talks and a number of contributed talks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic objective of the conference is to bring together researchers with expertise in graph theory, combinatorics and computer science in order to make advances in these areas. The conference will give both junior and senior researchers opportunities to present their own new results in combinatorics and computer science, and to work collaboratively on unsolved problems. The majority of the funds will be targeted for travel and accommodation support for students, post-docs and under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Twenty-Seventh Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing was held at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia from May 16 to May 17, 2014.  The conference was sponsored by National Science Foundation and the Department of Mathematics at West Virginia University.   The conference attracted over 100 researchers (including over 20 women) to share their own, new results in both theoretical and applied mathematics and in computer science.  The conference also provided attendees with a venue to collaborate on unsolved problems in an informal atmosphere.  A full list of conference participants is available at the conference website.  The meeting featured six plenary speakers: Fan Chung (University of California, San Diego), Mark Ellingham (Vanderbilt University), Jerry Griggs (University of South Carolina), Hal Kierstead (Arizona State University), Po-Shen Loh (Carnegie Mellon University), and James Oxley (Louisiana State University).  Additionally, 48 contributed talks were scheduled in three parallel sessions.  Complete abstracts for all talks are included in the conference's Program Book, which is publicly available as a PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) on the conference website.  In addition to the six plenary speakers, NSF funds supported travel for 34 participants, including 15 women, 17 graduate students, one undergraduate student, and 4 postdoctoral researchers.
