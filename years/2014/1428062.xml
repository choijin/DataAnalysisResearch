<AbstractNarration>The investigators have recently discovered the first example of a beneficial, symbiotic alga entering cells of a vertebrate host. The host in this association is the common spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) from Eastern North America. The green algal symbiont enters tissues and cells of the salamander embryos soon after they begin development in temporary vernal pools. The project will use several experimental approaches, including cell co-culturing, mRNA sequencing, and laser-based cell sorting, to determine the mechanisms of algal cell entry into the salamander host and the physiological implications of this unique association. The successful completion of this project will also make new tools available for introducing foreign genes (transgenics) in both the algal symbiont and salamander host, which will allow further investigation into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable this intimate association. The project will include training of undergraduate students from Gettysburg College in both field sampling of multiple salamander species as well as advanced techniques in cell culture, cell sorting, and next generation sequencing. The project will also support a museum video exhibit through the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), and fund a post-doctoral researcher at the museum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project outlines several high-risk high-reward experiments that will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this intimate association and provide a suite of research tools for future investigations. The methods that will be employed to accomplish these goals include: Collecting salamander embryos from New York, Pennsylvania and Washington State; Culturing embryos and their algae from two salamander species and switching symbionts between hosts; Dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of host cells containing algal endosymbionts; Transcriptomics and accompanying bioinformatics to determine differentially expressed genes in the host+endosymbiont cell population; Establishing host endoderm cell culture for in vitro co-culturing with algal symbionts; Pilot transgene transformation of both host and symbiont cell cultures using protocols and vectors established in closely related model organisms. The results from this work will reveal how a host?s response to a beneficial symbiont can differ from known vertebrate reactions to harmful pathogens that enter host cells.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships allow two or more organisms to gain new selectable traits. A subset of symbiotic mutualisms, where the cells of one organism enter the cells of another (termed endosymbioses), are able to dramatically alter the physiology of the host organism. In the past, such endosymbioses led to great innovations in the tree of life, such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration, through the acquisition of unique bacteria that have become chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively. Since those events, many other mutually beneficial endosymbiotic relationships have been established, including the ecologically important endosymbioses between corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellates. These allow corals to live in nutrient poor waters and survive through photosynthesis. Importantly, however, only one such endosymbiosis has been observed in vertebrates.</p> <p>That <em>vertebrate </em>endosymbiosis occurs between spotted salamander embryos and a green alga, <em>Oophila amblystomatis</em>. The reasons for this unique relationship are unclear, but the mechanisms have the potential to inform us on how vertebrate animals can respond to and accept endosymbionts, thereby extending vertebrate cellular biology. That this alga has consistently been characterized as a beneficial microbe provides an immediate contrast to intracellular pathogens. By investigating this system we can parse the cellular responses to pathogen invasion of cells (such as the malaria parasite <em>Plasmodium</em>) that are linked to a disease outcome. Similarly, little is known about salamander immunity, which is an important aspect of regeneration research and emerging infectious diseases in salamanders.</p> <p>Our approach to investigating this relationship involved collecting salamander eggs with their associated alga from wild populations, identifying embryos containing large numbers of symbionts, separating salamander cells containing symbionts from cells that did not contain symbionts, and querying those subsets of cells for changes in gene expression correlated with the endosymbiotic state. In parallel, we also investigated the genes expressed by ectosymbiotic algae from the egg capsule of the salamander and compared them to algae inside salamander cells. With this approach we were able to infer the types of changes occurring in both organisms associated with their endosymbiosis.</p> <p>Surprisingly, we found that the algae living inside of salamander cells drastically altered their metabolism. Rather than completing photosynthesis and using aerobic cellular respiration, the intracellular algae are apparently starved for sulfur and oxygen and exhibited gene expression patterns associated with silencing photosynthetic machinery and undergoing fermentation. In related green algae, this process is associated with the release of hydrogen gas, and is important in biofuels research. The result suggests that the algae are not entering the salamander cells as a refuge and happily producing sugars through photosynthesis that the salamander can then use for energy (as is the case for corals). Something more complex is occurring.</p> <p>However, there are hints that the salamander may indeed be obtaining some nutrients from their intracellular algal partners. The salamander has altered gene expression patterns associated with nutrient sensing. These include genes that regulate and respond to insulin concentrations, an interesting link between the metabolites that the alga may be releasing and insulin sensitivity in these salamanders. Further, we did not observe hallmarks of cellular stress in the salamander cells, suggesting that they tolerate the symbionts well and are not taking drastic measures to expel them or kill themselves as they might with an internal pathogen. Despite the lack of a stress response, the salamander does initiate a limited immune response. These embryonic cells exhibit gene expression changes associated with attenuating factors that would subvert a large scale immune response mediated by the transcription factor NF-Kappa-B. Some of those factors overlap with those associated with tolerance of commensal bacteria in the human gut.</p> <p>We also set up &ldquo;reciprocal co-cultures&rdquo; of algae extracted from the egg capsules of two salamander hosts. Both the eastern <em>Ambystoma maculatum</em> and western <em>Ambystoma gracile</em> have <em>Oophila</em> algae living in association with their embryos. However the endosymbiosis only occurs in <em>A. maculatum. </em>Both algal strains entered <em>A. maculatum </em>in our <em>in vitro </em>experimental set up, although the <em>A. maculatum</em> derived strain did so with greater frequency. Neither strain entered <em>A. gracile</em>, indicating that the <em>A. maculatum</em> host is unique in its ability to recruit, or tolerate, its algal endosymbiont.</p> <p>The state of the art sequencing technologies used to complete this work will open this system for further investigation. Our data and analysis provides a new public data set of sequences from both organisms that can also be used in comparative studies with other intracellular associations. The work gives us a handle on a unique type of biological interaction, which is of broad interest to a number of fields.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/24/2016<br>      Modified by: Ryan&nbsp;Kerney</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1428062/1428062_10303701_1472076045889_SummaryFig-rect3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1428062/1428062_10303701_1472076045889_SummaryFig-rect3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Summary of dual RNASeq"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1428062/1428062_10303701_1472076045889_SummaryFig-rect3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Summary of dual RNASeq"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Summary of dual RNASeq experiments showing transcripts that are down regulated (parentheses) and upregulated in algae and host salamander cells.
