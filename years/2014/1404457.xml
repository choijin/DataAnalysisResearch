<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: This research project investigates the properties of a new class of 2-dimensional nanomaterials, i.e., layered transition metal dichalcogenides, where unique electronic, optical and transport properties not observed in the bulk phase can be harvested through the control of the dimensions in nanoscale. The research team, consisting of experts in the spectroscopic characterization and computer simulation of the materials, collaborates to gain an understanding on how the variations of the physical and chemical structures can tune the material properties. The outcome of this research will be valuable to the potential optoelectronic applications of these nanomaterials. The principal investigator of this project also develops, in collaboration with an industrial partner, a training program on instrumentation, focusing on signal measurement and processing, for both undergraduate and graduate students in multiple disciplines. This effort narrows the gap between current curriculum on such topics and the instrumentation skills required in many science and engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The project utilizes chemically synthesized titanium disulfide nanodiscs in solution as a model system. The nanodisc thickness can be controlled in chemical synthesis, varying from a few to more than ten atomic layers, and the nanodisc diameter can be varied from tens to hundreds of nanometers, providing a significant range of dimensional control in two perpendicular directions. Using these nanomaterials, the research focuses on the following specific tasks: (i) understanding how the optical transition energy and interlayer phonon of titanium disulfide nanodiscs are influenced by the variations of both the nanodisc thickness and diameter and by the photoexcitation of the charge carriers; and (ii) understanding the rates and pathways of the charge carrier relaxation and charge transfer correlated with the dimensional variation and the interfacial structure. Time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy and electron microscopy are the main experimental tools to elucidate the structure-property relationship. The calculation of the electronic and vibrational structures of the nanodiscs of different dimensions, employing density functional theory, provides an atomistic picture of the structurally dependent material properties of this layered material system.</AbstractNarration>

The research team consisting of experts in the spectroscopic characterization of the material properties and computer simulation of the materials worked together to obtain deeper understanding on this subject. The following specific outcomes are obtained from the research on two different materials (TiS2 and WSe2), for which the team have achieved sufficiently high level of dimensional control to address the issues mentioned above.   (1) Experimentally and computationally confirm the presence of anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in colloidal TiS2 nanodiscs. (2) Demonstrated the capability to control the spatial orientation of the colloidal TiS2 nanodiscs either in liquid or on a substrate using electrokinetic response, which will be useful to utilize their anisotropic material properties on the device platform. (3) Utilize the dependence of the optical absorption in colloidal multilayer TiS2 nanodiscs on the conduction band electron density to measure the rapid Li intercalation and deintercalation kinetics. This demonstrated the potential of the colloidal nanocrystals of 2D layered material as battery material that can charge and discharge rapidly. (4) Examine the ability of TiS2/TiO2 hetero nanostructure to separate electron and hole more efficiently for potentially higher performance in photoinduced chemical processes, such as photocatalysis. (5) Confirmed that the unique 2D exciton-like properties in large sheet of monolayer WSe2 can be combined with strong lateral confinement effect in colloidal 0D quantum dot (QDs) of monolayer WSe2, and discovered a new pathway for vibronic coupling involving the edge bonds.    New understanding on the distinctly different properties of the colloidal TMDC nanocrystals from their large-area counterpart will be useful for utilizing these colloidal TMDC nanocrystals as the source of photons and charge carriers in their applications. In addition, the new synthesis method for the colloidal quantum dots (QDs) of monolayer TMDC developed during this project is applicable to other TMDC material systems, further expanding the opportunities that colloidal TMDC QDs can bring.
