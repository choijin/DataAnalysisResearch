<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research to University of California Los Angeles is to develop a toolbox for creating new antimicrobials with high specificity to control the distributions of species in microbial communities in controlling virulent strains without harming commensal strains. Current approaches use potent broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or drug, inhibiting or killing beneficial and pathogenic species alike. Although species-specific antibiotics are in principle possible, it is not practical to make antibiotics for individualized targeting for all species of interest. In nature, bacteria make multi-functional antibiotics to inhibit closely related strains competing for the same environmental resources. The proposed research is to mimic this approach, and to build molecules with tunable antimicrobial properties, and integrate them into molecules with adjustable "windows" of antimicrobial activity against multiple species within a specific set of environmental condition. Antimicrobials from host-associated microbial communities would have beneficial impact on human health by inhibiting pathogenic bacteria without harming host cells or beneficial commensal bacteria. These approaches would have the potential to regulate complex microbial colonies, and leverage the natural competition between bacterial species to "commensalize" the population. The proposed multidisciplinary research topic is conducive to training students for different academic and industrial careers. The proposed research topics will be incorporated into the PI's advanced undergraduate/graduate classes. Additionally, educational modules will be provided to an economically disadvantaged high school where the PI attended using several mechanisms, including a new type of "reverse outreach". The co-PI is a faculty-in-residence at the campus, and will leverage this role to broaden the participation of more diverse student populations in STEM topics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to develop a toolbox for creating new antimicrobial peptides with high specificity to control species distributions in microbial communities by controlling virulent strains without harming commensal strains. This research program leverages recently developed sequence design rules for antimicrobial peptides, where charge and hydrophobicity are both necessary conditions for antimicrobial peptide (AMP) activity. With this award, the researchers will develop: a) baseline tunable AMPs with a "threshold" activity profile using pH-switchable charge; b) antimicrobial peptides with lo-hi-lo "window" activity profile using pH-switchable hydrophobicity and charges; and c) multi-functional antimicrobials that simultaneously hit synergistic bacterial targets to amplify activity. To achieve these goals, aminoacid residues will be altered that contribute to the hydrophobic and/or cationic activities of AMPs such that these properties are attenuated by environmental conditions.  The research plan is to make helical AMPs that turn on and off at specific and tunable pH values, by incorporating masking groups at arginine, histidine and/or lysine residues at specific locations in AMPs.  Such masking groups will directly control the acid dissociation constant (pKa) at which residues become positively charged and activating the AMP. This research will also target bacterial species within a colony that thrive at a specific pH range using designed AMPs that only turn on within a finite pH range, using cleavable masking groups for tyrosine and/or tryptophan residues at strategic locations in AMPs. Finally, the design of cell-penetrating peptide transporter sequences to chaperone traditional antibiotics into cells will be guided by the charge/hydrophobicity design rules for different niche environments. This will allow in targeting anaerobic bacteria that do not uptake antibiotics, to circumvent resistance mechanisms such as efflux pumps, and to transport antibiotics into bacteria that reside within human host cells. With respect to broader impacts, the multi-disciplinary nature of the research will provide students with ample educational and career opportunities in this emerging field, and would be conducive to training for academic and industrial careers. In addition, results from this will be incorporated into the PI's advanced undergraduate/graduate classes. Enrichment educational modules will be provided to an economically disadvantaged high school in the PI's hometown with a new type of "reverse outreach" program. The co-PI, a faculty-in-residence at the campus, plans to broaden the participation of a diverse student population in STEM areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Antibiotic resistance is an urgent unsolved problem. Essentially all antibiotics target growth processes, and are ineffective against slowly growing cells. Moreover, most current approaches use potent broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or drug cocktails, inhibiting or killing beneficial and pathogenic species alike, thereby imparting a significant selection pressure on all species to evolve resistance. Approximately 70% of hospital acquired infections in the US are resistant to at least one antibiotic. Progress on antibiotic development has been slow. Since the 1960s, only two new classes of antibioticshave been approved, and there is already resistance to both.      There is a critical need for antibiotics that are less susceptible to bacterial resistance evolution.  More specifically, antibiotics that are active against multidrug resistant bacteria, biofilm bacteria, anaerobic slow growing bacteria, and bacterial "persisters", with minimal development of resistance, are necessary. Finally, there is a need to develop new antimicrobials with high specificity to control species distributions in microbial communities and to impact virulent strains without harming commensal strains.   The main research goals of this proposal were to develop new ways to control the activity of antimicrobial peptides by modifying their chemical structure, and to design new hybrid antibiotic-peptide conjugates that exhibit activity against difficult-to-kill bacteria.  We previously discovered the unique and specific structural requirements that allow peptides and their conjugates to cross bacterial membranes, and that charge and hydrophobicity are both necessary conditions for antimicrobial peptide activity.  Using this fundamental knowledge, we demonstrated that through careful selection of sequence and composition, a peptide transporter can be designed to carry a traditional antibiotic across bacterial membranes, regardless of metabolic state. We reported a single prototype peptide-antibiotic conjugate that demonstrated remarkable activity against persisters.   In this supported work, we applied our fundamental knowledge of antibiotic design to develop new peptides witha?threshold? activityprofiles. More specifically, we modified known antimicrobial peptides so that their bioactivity could be switched on and off depending on the pH of the local environment. The change in pH either causes a change in the positive charge of the peptide or alters the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the peptide. Since many pathogenic bacterial infections also have a locally lower pH, these new antimicrobial peptides only become active at low pH where they gain a positive charge.  This change in charge fulfils the fundamental requirements for crossing bacterial membranes, and thus the peptide becomes active. We also designed, tested and synthesized a series of new antibiotic-peptide conjugates to cross bacterial membranes regardless of the metabolic state of the cell. We systematically varied the composition, location of conjugation, and distribution of hydrophobic and cationic residues along the peptide chain to determine which structural variants most greatly impacted the ability to cross bacterial membranes.  We determined that there is an inverse relationship between the activity and membrane permeabilization in E. coli, which suggests that the ability of the peptide-antibiotic conjugates to permeabilize the E. colimembrane does not directly reflect their antibacterial activity on growingbacteria. This implies that the antibacterial activity of the peptide-antibiotic conjugates against actively growing bacteria is not solely dependent on bacterial membrane disruption (the mechanism of AMP bactericidal activity). That is, the peptide-antibiotic conjugates can enter the bacteria via active drug influx processes. However, this active drug influx is easily shut down on dormant cells (persisters), in which active transport is drastically diminished and membrane permeability is expected to more closely correlate with antibacterial activity. Higher levels of membrane activity correlate well with antimicrobial activity against persisters.  This is significant as persisters are thought to contribute significantly to the development of resistant strains.  Finally, because the peptide-antibiotic conjugates we designed and synthesized are of moderate molecular weight (1-2 kDa), they are resistant to efflux. Taken together, these results suggest that these new peptide-antibiotic conjugates are able to enter bacteria regardless of their metabolic state, and are able to accumulate intracellularly because the efflux pumps are ineffective against higher molecular weight compounds. This results in remarkable activity of these drugs against multidrug resistant bacteria, biofilm bacteria, anaerobic slow growing bacteria, and bacterial "persisters". Thus, we have achieved our goal of developing a general ?toolbox? for treating resistant infections and controlling microbial communities.
