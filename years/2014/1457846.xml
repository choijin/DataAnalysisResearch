<AbstractNarration>The ozone layer plays a vital role in intercepting harmful solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) from reaching Earth's surface. However, its effectiveness in doing so has fluctuated in the past and little is known of the impacts of a thinning ozone layer on vegetation. Anticipating potential consequences in the future depends on understanding time intervals with heightened UV stress in the past. The largest mass extinction in history at the end of the Permian Period (~252 million years ago) may have been one of these time intervals. Plant fossil records from this crisis show two odd features worldwide. Many pollen grains produced by vanishing woodland seed plants were malformed, and proliferating herbaceous plants (lycopsids) spread their spores frequently as unseparated clusters of four. Heightened UV exposure is hypothesized to have caused these abnormalities. Compounds produced by the largest volcanic province in history, the Siberian Traps, likely caused prolonged or frequent deterioration of the ozone shield. In this study researchers will test if high UV-B radiation levels could indeed explain the abnormalities and extinction patterns in plants observed during the end-Permian biotic crisis. This research is important to society because it will assess whether future activities weakening the ozone layer could destabilize forest ecosystems through reproductive failure of economically important groups of plants. Outreach from this work will raise public awareness of environmental changes in the past through developing a publicly accessible educational exhibit and web-module on ecosystems and extinctions of the Paleozoic Era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using growth chamber and germination experiments, the researchers will determine whether elevated UV-B exposure triggers similar malformations in pollen and spores as observed in the fossil record, and whether this may lead to contrasting reproductive success between the tested living relatives of plant groups impacted by the crisis. They hypothesize high levels of UV-B will have a negative effect on conifer reproduction, but not severely affect fertility in lycopsids. In addition, they will also investigate whether UV-induced developmental responses appeared during times of active volcanism at its very source. For this, they will analyze end-Permian fossil pollen and spore assemblages from sediments within the Siberian Traps.  Using observations in combination with a contemporary ecological experimental approach is a novel approach which will test an important hypothesis in paleoecology and may lend insight into species response under contemporary abiotic stressors.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For almost 2.5 billion years, the ozone layer has played a vital role in intercepting harmful solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) from reaching Earth's surface &ndash; something most life forms on our planet have come to rely upon. However, its effectiveness in doing so has likely dropped intermittently in the past and little is known of the impacts of a thinning ozone layer on vegetation. Anticipating potential biotic consequences in the future depends on understanding time intervals with heightened UV stress in the past. Seasonal anthropogenic ozone shield deterioration in the past &ndash; for now quite effective curbed by the Montreal Protocol &ndash; has made this issue more than a matter of mere academic interest.</p> <p>The largest mass extinction in history of life on Earth, at the end of the Permian Period (~252 million years ago), is suggested to have been one of these time intervals during which the ozone layer deterioratied. Plant fossil records from this crisis show two odd worldwide phenomena. Many pollen grains produced by the vanishing woodland seed plants were malformed and an unusual group of proliferating herbaceous plants (lycopsids) spread their spores frequently as unseparated clusters of four. Heightened UV exposure is hypothesized to have caused these abnormalities and to have differentially affect the plant groups' fitness. Geophysicists and paleovolcanologists have concluded that atmospheric release of compounds associated with formation of the Siberian traps, the largest volcanic province in history, likely caused prolonged and frequent deterioration of the ozone shield.</p> <p>In this project we experimentally and observationally tested whether high UV-B radiation levels may indeed explain both the pollen and spore abnormalities as well as some of the end-Permian extinction patterns. Using growth chamber experiments, we demonstrated that elevated UV-B exposure not only induces the same types of pollen malformations seen in the end-Permian fossil record, but also could have played a role in forest recessions by causing premature death of seed cones of the Permian seed plants and thus affected reproduction. A study of so-called saccate-pollen-producing extant conifers demonstrated that pollen malformations are rarely produced in non-stressed conifers, specifically lineages with bisaccate grains. Saccate pollen are characteristic of certain gymnosperm lineages from the late Carboniferous to the present, and the range and composition their various morphological deviations may provide a unique way to assess levels of specific types of environmental in deep time. Lycopods survived similar UV-B treatments as the conifers, but were somewhat stunted in growth. However, they produced mature spores that are likely viable.</p> <p>Summarizing, we could observe an inverse effect of UV-B stress in conifers and lycopods: conifers being seemingly unaffected in health of mature plants but rendering them temporarily sterile for the duration of the UV-B stress, while mature lycopds may suffer some negative effects from extreme radiation levels but they retain reproductive capabilities. These experimental results observed in living plant groups representing prominent Permo-Triassic plant lineages fits well with the observed vegetational patterns during the tumultuous biosphere crisis caused by Siberian Trap volcanism. Moreover, if the Permo-Triassic terrestrial biotic crisis was, as we suggest, indeed caused by something that effected reproduction at the base of the food chain, we need to rethink how we view and explain episodes of mass extinctions. The latter is usually dominated by a quest for the "kill mechanisms" in the most literal sense (i.e. something causing mortality at vast scales), rather than for something that explains termination of evolutionary lineages through other ways of fitness reduction (i.e. reduced reproductive success).</p> <p>The results of our research have been of societal importance as it demonstrates that future activities weakening the ozone layer could severely destabilize forest ecosystems, such as the conifer dominated boreal forests &ndash; the largest terrestrial biome on our planet. Although everyone involved in this project has been very excited about the results it produced so far, due to a number of setbacks and the COVID-19 pandemic, several research avenues related to this NSF-funded project have been slowed and unfinished but nevertheless still continuing. Observed superficially, a suite of open-ended research may sound disappointing, but the opposite is true. The project has generated exciting collaborative spin-off projects utilizing the material (e.g., pollen and spores) generated in this study, that so many unanswered questions is a testament to the project's success rather than a product of pandemic-related slowdown. On a personal note, I think a scientist can hardly ask for a better outcome than that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/06/2021<br>      Modified by: Cynthia&nbsp;V&nbsp;Looy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457846/1457846_10358226_1617749956413_SettingupconiferUV-Bexperiments--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457846/1457846_10358226_1617749956413_SettingupconiferUV-Bexperiments--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Setting up UV-B experiments"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457846/1457846_10358226_1617749956413_SettingupconiferUV-Bexperiments--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Setting up UV-B experiments"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Jeffrey Benca exposed dwarf pines to 13 times the level of dangerous UV-B radiation we get on a sunny day, and found that the conditions, similar to what some think occurred during Earth�s largest extinction 252 million years ago, made the trees sterile.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen McNally, UC Berkeley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Cynthia&nbsp;V&nbsp;Looy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Setting up UV-B experiments</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457846/1457846_10358226_1617750398383_ConifersunderUV-Blamps--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457846/1457846_10358226_1617750398383_ConifersunderUV-Blamps--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pines in growth chamber"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457846/1457846_10358226_1617750398383_ConifersunderUV-Blamps--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pines in growth chamber"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dwarf pines in a growth chamber under simulated sunlight plus extra UV-B from two high-intensity lamps.
