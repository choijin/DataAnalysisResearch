<AbstractNarration>Earth Partnership: Indigenous Arts and Sciences (EP) will develop and refine a model for integrating Indigenous and informal and formal K-20 educators in ecological restoration, project-based learning and professional development. EP will involve participants in Native habitat restoration on community spaces, school grounds and nearby natural areas as a context for intergenerational STEM learning across age, ecosystem, discipline, learning style, culture and place. EP integrates Native knowledge and core values including relationship, reciprocity, respect and responsibility with Western STEM concepts and processes. The project will integrate the expertise of university social, physical, life and learning scientists and community and tribal practitioners to design, develop and test informal STEM learning incorporating ecological restoration, citizen science and cultural diversity.  EP grows out of a teacher professional development model funded by NSF and is a network that now includes participating individuals and organizations from many states. This network will enhance dissemination and provide a foundation for a larger project growing out of the results of this project. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;EP will build capacity of Native and non-Native informal educators and citizens to work together to generate engagement among young people and adults with ecological STEM learning and stewardship. The approach will integrate culturally authentic resources, inquiry and citizen science process skills (e.g., data collection, analysis, ecological restoration, water stewardship) in multiple learning settings. Stronger multicultural, intergenerational and community partnerships will be supported to restore aquatic and terrestrial habitats through community-based stewardship projects and Service Learning. Through EP, Native youth will be encouraged to explore STEM careers that will meet future workforce needs for managing tribal resources and become knowledgeable citizens able to use critical thinking and analysis of STEM-related issues in their communities.  The project will use a developmental evaluation approach to assess project planning processes and outcomes of educational programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         Earth Partnership Indigenous Arts and Sciences (IAS) integrates Western science with Native knowledge, process, and core values including relationships, reciprocity, respect and responsibility. Since initially implementing IAS with tribal partners in 2011, Earth Partnership has carefully listened to community partners and expanded its model from teacher professional development to one that emphasizes community, place, and culture. IAS now routinely seeks participation by tribal elders in its programs, including the presence of elders at youth and teacher institutes, year-round youth and family programs that support its work in schools, and an emphasis on program connections to traditional seasonal practices.    This Pathways project convened the expertise of elders and community members from Red Cliff and Bad River Nations with UW-Madison social, physical, and life scientists to expand informal science learning, by integrating ecological restoration, citizen science, and cultural knowledge. This place- and project-based approach to ecological restoration responds to a societal need for a diverse STEM workforce and provides a context for enhanced learning in Native communities. Indian Nations in Wisconsin, as in other states, monitor and protect their natural resources, underscoring the need for Native scientists. Yet Native Americans are the most underrepresented group in STEM fields. Native students need to navigate between the dominant culture of western science and their cultures? ways of knowing. Equitable science education involves the adoption of Native-centered and cross-cultural approaches to substantiate the validity of students' personally and culturally constructed ways of knowing.    Through this project, collaborators identified a three-part model for applying science to indigenous knowledge and community culture connections to address the challenges of accessing STEM careers leading to student interest in pursuing STEM programs, courses and careers. IAS engages students, formal and informal educators, elders, natural resource professionals, and parents in 1) community and family engagement, 2) informal-formal educator professional development and collaboration, and 3) year-round indigenized STEM learning experiences and mentoring for students in grades 8-12. IAS evaluation indicated these three components are critical for holistic student engagement fostering pursuit of STEM interests. Collaborative strategies for addressing needs and priorities under the IAS model of community engagement, professional development, and youth programs include:      Community engagement: Capacity building through listening sessions, development of guiding principles for effective partnerships, and year-round community events providing parents experience and knowledge of STEM curriculum and stewardship   Professional development: Collaborative learning with formal and informal educators sharing expertise, involvement of elders and community members, culturally congruent science instruction focused on native processes and language, and understanding tribal sovereignty and treaty rights   Year-round youth programs: Youth experiences in STEM learning in the field with elders, scientists, and mentors to deepen classroom experiences and encourage leadership and confidence in one?s culture, responsibility for implementing service learning projects, practicing skills for communicating data, and providing mentoring in the schools         This IAS model, refined through NSF Pathways, aims to achieve the long-term outcome for youth to have knowledge, competence, and passion in STEM-related fields, return to their communities, and manage their own natural resources as purveyors of indigenous ways of knowing.
