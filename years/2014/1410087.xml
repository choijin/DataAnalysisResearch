<AbstractNarration>The southeastern USA is botanically rich, with areas of high global biodiversity in both the Appalachians and the coastal plain.  Millions of plant specimens have been collected from this region over the past four centuries, and these specimens and the information they contain currently reside in museums, or herbaria, at universities across the area.  Scientists study these specimens intently; however, it is difficult to retrieve information at broad geographic and taxonomic scales without pipelines to move the information electronically from the specimen to an accessible pool of data.  SERNEC, or the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections, is a large regional network of botanical experts and collections that has, through an NSF-sponsored research coordination network (RCN) project, developed critical skills in biodiversity informatics.  The current project will allow the SERNEC group to make data available for over 3 million specimens using the latest photography and information capture tools and to engage citizen scientists and students to assist in transcribing and georeferencing this large dataset.  The research generated through this project can help regional planners, land managers and communities to manage their natural resources in our ever-changing environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction of scientists, citizen scientists, and students will provide a synergy to build a research tool of an unparalleled scale and scope.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an imaged and databased set of over 3 million specimens from over 100 herbaria in one of the most floristically diverse regions in North America and a global hotspot of plant diversity. This will represent a valuable data source for research on the response of vegetation to climate change, human development, and rapid migrations of introduced species. This region has been a biodiversity hotspot for 100 million years and this project should encourage research on changes over time to develop better predictive models as areas of biodiversity change. By partnering with Symbiota, Notes from Nature, GEOLocate, Adler Planetarium, iPlant/TACC, and Specify, the project will develop ways to best integrate various efforts for data accessibility. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over a period of five years we digitized and made available to the general public most of Tennessee's nearly one million herbariium specimens.  Herbarium specimens are dried, pressed specimens, which, in Tennessee, date from the 1840s through to the present and they represent specimens from all 95 counties.  They are an invaluable resource because they represent data points from times in the past and allow us to look back on species distributions that have changed, flowering times that have shifted, species that have been extirpated from Tennessee, and new species to have migrated into our state.  To protect these specimens from moisture and insects, they are held in metal cabinets and they are distributed across eleven Tennessee universities and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  While the metal cabinets and museum-like rooms have kept them safe for ~180 years, they have also been isolated from researchers, educators, students, conservation workers, policy makers, and the general public.  Over a five year span, beginning in 2014, Drs.

Furthermore, this funding allowed workers in Tennessee to add to the growing national and international efforts to digitize all collections of all biological specimens.  Tennessee?s plant data are now part of a growing international effort to combine all of the specimen data from all lineages of life toward the goal of allowing anyone on our planet to access the worlds biodiversity data and ask and answer complex questions.
