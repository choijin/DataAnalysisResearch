<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:   IIA - 1434142&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Dongming Mei&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   University of South Dakota Main Campus&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Workshop on Underground Science Applications for Germanium-Based Detectors and Technologies &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Science investigations in undergound research facilities have enabled pivotal discoveries about the dark matter that comprises over 80% of the total matter in the universe. This project will provide support for an interdisciplinary workshop to examine the status of detectors and technologies that can be used in characterizing dark matter. The workshop will be held in South Dakota, the home of the deepest underground research facility in US. The workshop participants will explore challenges, critical measures, and research and development opportunities related to detector technology development and experimental design. The national and international experts, faculty, researchers, students, and industrial partners who participate in the workshop will identify critical research needs and define a path forward. The workshop will serve to foster broader inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) in the emerging directions of particle physics, research using underground facilities, and dark matter exploration. The workshop outcomes can lead to novel training programs for young researchers, undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. Economic drivers for the workshop include potential commercial opportunities for manufacturing detectors and sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Germanium-based detectors and technologies are proving to be key enablers for detecting dark matter and neutrino-less double beta decays. This workshop brings together experts, practitioners, faculty, and students to share ideas on the status of crystal-growth techniques and low-threshold detectors. The workshop participants will learn about current and planned activities at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota including ton-scale dark matter, neutrino-less double beta decay, long baseline neutrino, and other large-scale experiments. Workshop activities will leverage the capabilities of SURF; catalyze the commercial fabrication of Germanium crystals, detectors, and wafers; and provide a forum for engaging and inspiring next-generation researchers. Workshop products include: a plan for formalizing a research consortium, white papers that identify critical research and development needs, and a road map for future experiments. It is also anticipated that the workshop will foster stronger ties between academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> workshop on Germanium (Ge) detectors and technology was held at the University of South Dakota on September 14-17<sup>th</sup> 2014, with more than 113 participants from 8 counties, 22 institutions, 15 national laboratories, and 8 companies. The participants represented the following big projects: (1) GERDA and Majorana for the search of neutrinoless double-beta decay (0nbb); (2) SuperCDMS, EDELWEISS, CDEX, and CoGeNT for the search of dark matter; (3) TEXONO for sub-keV neutrino physics; (4) AGATA and GRETINA for gamma tracking; (5) AARM and others for low background radiation counting; (5) as well as PNNL and LBNL for applications of Ge detectors in homeland security. All participants have expressed a strong desire on having better understanding of Ge detector performance and advancing Ge technology for large-scale applications.</p> <p>The purpose of this workshop was to leverage the unique aspects of the underground laboratories in the world and the germanium (Ge) crystal growing infrastructure at the University of South Dakota (USD) by bringing researchers from several institutions taking part in the <strong>Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research</strong> (EPSCoR) together with key leaders from international laboratories and prestigious universities, working on the forefront of the intensity to advance underground physics focusing on the searches for dark matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay (0nbb), and neutrino properties. The goal of the workshop was to develop opportunities for EPSCoR institutions to play key roles in the planned world-class research experiments. The workshop was to integrate individual talents and existing research capabilities, from multiple disciplines and multiple institutions, to develop research collaborations, which includes EPSCoR institutions from South Dakota, North Dakota, Alabama, Iowa, and South Carolina to support multi-ton scale experiments for future.</p> <p>The topic areas covered in the workshop were: 1) science related to Ge-based detectors and technology; 2) Ge zone refining and crystal growth; 3) Ge detector development; 4) Ge orientated business and applications; 5) Ge recycling and recovery; 6) introduction to underground sciences for young scientists; and 7) introduction of experimental techniques for low background experiments to young scientists. Sections 1-5 were dedicated to Ge detectors and technology. Each topic was complemented with a panel discussion on challenges, critical measures, and R&amp;D activities. Sections 6-7 provided students and postdocs an opportunity to understand fundamental principles of underground sciences and experimental techniques on low background experiments. To these two sections, well-known scientists in the field were invited to give lectures and allow young scientists to make presentations on their own research activities.</p> <p>Fifty-six invited talks were delivered during the three-day workshop. Many critical questions were addressed not only in the specific talks but also in the panel discussions.&nbsp; In addition to various progress related to germanium detectors and technology that were discussed in the presentations from the respective experiments, the following panel questions were discussed in depth:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Section 1: Panel discussion on germanium crystal growth</span></p> <p>a) Type, size, quality, and quantity demands on crystal growth.
