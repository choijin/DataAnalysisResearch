<AbstractNarration>This project will analyze the systematics and revise the taxonomy of onchidiid slugs (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Pulmonata). Onchidiid slugs are unique within gastropods for their ecological diversity - including species that live in the sea, fresh water, and on land. As such, research on Onchidiidae will provide a unique opportunity for this project to study general evolutionary transitions between aquatic and terrestrial habitats and between closely related species. Total species diversity and distribution are currently unknown (147 species have been described worldwide, most of which in the tropical Indo-West Pacific), and will be documented here with a new taxonomic revision based on both morphological and molecular data. Field expeditions will provide fresh material for systematic and ecological analyses. Results will be published as articles and monographic revisions, as well as taxonomic identification keys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research and education will be integrated through a series of innovative activities involving undergraduate students from the host institution. One PhD student and at least two undergraduate students will be trained in field collecting, anatomical dissection, Scanning Electron Microscopy, molecular systematics, and theoretical issues in taxonomy. Enhanced onchidiid systematics will be beneficial to scientists from different fields - for example, physiologists using onchidiids as a model to study photoreception, and conservation biologists using onchidiid slugs as a keystone indicator of the diversity and ecology of heavily-threatened coastal habitats.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There are still very many groups of organisms for which the species diversity is largely unknown. In fact, there are far more species that remain to be discovered than species already known. Biodiversity research requires field exploration (time spent in the wilderness to discover, observe, and collect live organisms in their own habitats) and taxonomic revisions (comprehensive comparison of newly-discovered species with known species). In this award, the biodiversity of a group of slugs was entirely revised, the Onchidiidae (Mollusca, Gastropoda), which is mostly marine (although a few species are terrestrial) and mostly diverse in South-East Asia.</p> <p>A major activity of this award was field exploration, and nearly 300 sites were visited worldwide, especially throughout South-East Asia. Prior to this award, 150 species names existed for the Onchidiidae. It was demonstrated during this award that, on the one hand, many of those existing names apply to the same species (i.e., they are synonyms) but that, on the other hand, many new species needed to be named. There are now 120 species, more than half of which are new to science. Species diversity has been investigated through an integrative approach, using both DNA sequences and anatomy for every single species. Complete revisions of an entire group including more than 100 species are rare because, usually, some species are missing in data sets. Thanks to an extraordinary amount of time spent in the field, all known species of Onchidiidae are represented in the data set built during this award. The natural history of every single species was also thoroughly documented with new, first-hand, field observations. As a result, species can now be easily and reliably re-identified using various tools, such as color of live animals and DNA sequences. Prior to this award, the relationships among all species was also extremely confusing. Now, all species are classified in 10 different groups (genera) that are all well known and well delineated. Half of those genera are new to science.</p> <p>Because detailed natural history data were collected in the field for every single living species of Onchidiidae, this award was also able to study patterns of biodiversity and biogeography (e.g., where the highest species diversity is found), evolutionary transitions to new habitats (e.g., from the rocky shore to mangrove forests), diversification processes (e.g., processes leading to high diversity in some genera).</p> <p>Most of the species newly discovered during this award are from South-East Asia, a region that hosts the most highly-diverse marine fauna in the world. Also, most new species were discovered in mangrove forests, a habitat that is critically threatened and that is in desperate need for intense naturalist exploration. Mangrove forests are a natural habitat found on the fringes of tropical and subtropical sea shores. They serve as a unique link between the land and the sea: mangroves are flooded by incoming daily tides and are exposed to air when tides are gone.

For many years, mangrove trees were cut down for lumber, and other anthropogenic pressures have deeply impacted mangroves worldwide.</p> <p>The diversity of animals living in mangroves is still very poorly known, especially the invertebrates.
