<AbstractNarration>Engineering innovation is one of the foundations of wealth generation. Innovation increasingly occurs through the activities of engineering design teams rather than through individuals. The objective of this research is to develop computational models of the innovation cycle of engineering design teams that allow for the study of the effects of varying parameters on improving innovation across development cycles. A computational model is used since it is very difficult and prohibitively expensive to study the effects of varying team parameters that might improve innovation in engineering design teams directly within organizations. Given the exigencies of the day-to-day activities of organizations it may not be possible to vary team parameters. Members of teams are modeled computationally and are provided with the ability to change and develop experience based on their interactions with other team members, social media interactions outside the team and feedback from the consumption behavior of consumers of their products. Consumers are also modeled computationally and develop experience based on their interactions with products produced by design teams and their social media interactions with other consumers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research project include a computational laboratory where parameters that have the potential to affect innovation performance can be studied. With this computational laboratory it will be possible to test strategies that are claimed to improve innovation over multiple cycles of product development. By running a range of experiments it will be possible to identify interventions that improve the innovation cycles of engineering design teams.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Motivation  Teams play a dominant role in engineering design as the scale and complexity of products has grown beyond the capacity of any individual to handle. The composition of teams, how the team members interact with each other, how they learn as they design together, what happens when a team member leaves, what happens when a new team member arrives are all questions of particular interest if we want to understand and improve team design. Normally, when researching such questions, we would run experiments where we can directly control each of these variables. However, with humans it is not possible to bring together sufficient subjects to produce statistically reliable results. Instead we construct computational agents that model those aspects of human behavior that we are interested in. We build teams from these agents producing a computational laboratory using agent-based modeling that allows us to run experiments that have the potential to be able to provide answers to the questions we are interested in.  Computational Models  We programmed our agents (as team members) to be:  social, ie, to interact to pass information to each other; cognitive, ie, they form concepts and interpret the information around them (rather than have all information fixed); adaptive, ie, they learn from their actions, generating experience, which is used in subsequent actions; affective, ie, they have simple emotions that are used to change their behavior; and trusting: ie, they assess the trust of the information based on their previous experience with the information giver.   Simulations  Having developed the computational model and turned it into a computational laboratory we were able to run an extensive number of simulations of various cases to develop an understanding of how teams behave under different circumstances. We ran each case multiple times using a range of values for the variables (called Monte Carlo simulations) to give us a statistically significant sample from which to make our assessments.  Results  The primary results showed that as team members worked longer together, they became more efficient in terms of expending fewer resources to achieve a satisfactory outcome. However, the longer they worked together the fewer different options were considered at any point in the design. The effect of this is that fewer novel designs were generated. The results allowed for a connection to be made to the current dual-process of model of thinking in cognitive science, thus expanding the ambit of the results. Many other important results have been found that can be further tested and then implemented to improve America?s international engineering design competitiveness.  Wider Impact  The project set out to study engineering design teams and the parameters that affect their performance. In doing this a number of other conclusions can be drawn that have a wider impact.  Agent-based modeling forms a good substrate for a laboratory to study teams and team behavior. Cognitively rich agents provide both the capability and the capacity to study a wide range of team effects. Researchers who worked on the project developed skills that are transferable to other domains than studying teams as the agent-based approach has a wide applicability across multiple domains.
