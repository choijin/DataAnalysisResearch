<AbstractNarration>In June of 2012 the residents of Bayou Corne, Louisiana began reporting the occurrence of earthquakes, and unusual gas bubbling in the local waters. The USGS deployed broadband seismic instruments in the region and confirmed that a swarm of shallow earthquakes was occurring near the west flank of the Napoleonville Salt Dome. On August 2, 2012 a sinkhole formed at the location, filled with a slurry of water, crude oil and debris, leading to a declaration of emergency and evacuation of nearby residents. Preliminary analysis of the seismic records revealed that the individual earthquakes have a source signature that indicates a volume increase, which is believed to be due to high-pressure fluid and gas migrating from the deeper reservoirs to the surface through rock fractures resulting from the collapse of a side wall cavern in the salt dome. Many of the seismic records for earthquakes at Bayou Corne share features that are observed in volcanic and geothermal systems in which fluids at depth can generate a variety of earthquake and tremor phenomena. The study of the Bayou Corne seismicity will shed light on fluid-controlled seismic source mechanisms, and the investigation of how the seismic signals changed over time will lead to understanding of how the system evolved, and the process of failure that lead to the formation of the sinkhole. The methods employed and refined through the course of the study will more broadly improve seismic monitoring capability and hazard assessment associated with ongoing mining, oil and gas production, wastewater disposal, as well as the monitoring of volcanic activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the course of the project the thousands of small (magnitude 0 to 2) earthquakes in the weeks prior to the formation of the sinkhole, and continuing afterward will be investigated. A method in which the seismic signals are continuously scanned enabling the autonomous detection, location and estimation of seismic source parameters used to determine full seismic moment tensors that are capable of resolving both shear and tensile components that will inform on the nature of deformation occurring in the system and the importance of gas-charged fluids in the seismic source process. Preliminary work utilized simplified one-dimensional seismic velocity models to describe the wave propagation from source to receiver, however the geology in salt dome environments is very complex, and the proposed research will utilize a three-dimensional seismic velocity model, and appropriate numerical codes, to generate three-dimensional propagation transfer functions to improve the imaging of the earthquake source mechanisms. In addition to the micro earthquakes there are observations of harmonic tremor that are similar to volcanic tremor and indicate a process of fluid migration through a network of fractures. There are also long-period (20s) tremor in which preliminary modeling has suggested they are the temporal pulsing of a volumetric source. There are even longer period signals that can be interpreted as broad tilting of the ground. The diverse signals will be modeled with fluid-crack dynamic models and other mechanical models to investigate the relationships between them, and to the failure process of the geologic materials within and adjacent to the salt dome, and the formation of the sinkhole.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated the nature of seismicity associated with the collapse of cavern on the flank of Napoleon Salt Dome in Lousiana. Such caverns are used for hydrocarbon storage, although in this particular instance it was filled with brine, and not in regular use.&nbsp; The collapse of the cavern lead to a sequence of small earthquakes reported by local residents, and the formation of the Bayou Corne sinkhole. Figure 1 shows a map of the study region. A graduate student carried out the research on the seismicity and has earned his Ph.D., and is presently working as a research scientist at a top University. The result of the research was quite surprising showing that the microearthquakes were atypical involving dominant volume increase components (regular earthquake show no volume change). We developed a new method for the modeling of seismic waveform data to determine seismic source parameters for this project, which has also benefitted the analysis of nuclear explosions. The method has been applied to the North Korean nuclear tests. In addition, to handle the large numbers of small earthquakes a continuous data scanning approach utilizing 3D seismic wavepropagation methods to account for the significant 3D structure of the salt dome environment was implemented and refined. Figure 2 shows the 3D velocity model domain used with the LLNL SW4 finite-difference code to model the 3D seismic wave propgation. With this method it was possible to analyze over 1,500 microearthquakes with magnitudes between 0.5 and 2.1. FIgure 3 shows the fit to the data for one of the microearthquakes. The mechanism is dominantly volume increase. The mechanisms of these events are interpreted to be due to the rapid opening of tensile cracks on the flank of the salt dome due to the ascent of gas-charged, high pressure fluid released through damage caused by the collapse of the cavern. This method of continously monitoring microearthquakes to define detailed seismic source parameters may have additional applications in the energy sector including frack and mine monitoring.
