<AbstractNarration>Molecular cloning--the construction of recombinant DNA--is the foundation of modern biology, particularly synthetic biology. However, traditional cloning methods and DNA synthesis have failed to meet growing demand and are limiting the pace of discovery and engineering. Advanced DNA assembly technologies are improving throughput, but the fact that researchers are still responsible for performing these steps in-house suggests there may be an unaddressed market opportunity. This I-Corps Teams proposal will explore the commercial feasibility of DNA assembly as a service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic biology has provided cutting-edge technologies that aid in the manipulation of recombinant DNA, but the full potential of these new techniques has not yet been realized. Many scientists shy away from adopting new methods because they seem overly difficult compared to their current practice. Some reluctantly pay exorbitant sums to get their DNA synthesized. A DNA assembly service company would disrupt the current custom DNA market, offering lower prices and faster turnaround times than any existing provider. The consequences of this advance will be two-fold: the general pace of research--both basic and applied--will accelerate; and the cost of research will be reduced. The latter effect has interesting implications for the education and training of the next generation of biologists and bioengineers. If the cost of conducting research is reduced, not only can more scientists be trained, but they can be taught to think differently, where they are restricted only by the scope of their ideas and aren?t limited by an inability to implement them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our iCorp project investigated the efficacy of commercializing a DNA assembly strategy by which large DNA multi-part "devices" could be synthesized from pre-built "parts." Synthetic biology is the field of encoding programming in the form of DNA devices that can be read by the living cell to actuate a desired output. These applications can range from accurately sensing environmental input signals to the production of chemicals of interest via fermentations. Synthetic biology efforts, both academic and industrial, are typically hindered by the slow and non-robust DNA synthesis process. Typically, many devices must be synthesized to empirically understand the design rules for optimal performance. We proposed to employ a modular DNA assembly strategy that enabled the reuse of many parts that had been pre-characterized using a robust DNA assembly strategy. Importantly, this strategy should be highly amenable to automation with steps that could be performed with a liquid handling robot.  After the iCorp course, we came to the conclusion that although the current potential client base could likely support a small company, the amount of growth would be directly dependent on the amount of growth of synthetic biology, particularly in the industrial sector. We have since published an open&shy;access paper in ACS Synthetic Biology and provided the 96 most useful parts through the non&shy;profit company Addgene such that the ease of DNA assembly can be shared with the field and also potentially becoming better candidate customers for using these parts.
