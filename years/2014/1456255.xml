<AbstractNarration>Computation in all its definitions (Computer Science, Computing, Computational Thinking, etc.) is becoming increasingly significant in STEM and non-STEM disciplines.  Historically, Mathematics has been the discipline seen as required by all other disciplines.  Computer Science faculty are wrestling with determining whether there is a single approach to infusing computation in other disciplines or whether there are many approaches. Coupled with the increased computational ability of students in other disciplines, it is known that interdisciplinary courses are more appealing to underrepresented groups.  Ideally, the Computer Science community would be provided with a set of validated approaches to interdisciplinary education. In order to reach this goal, the community must investigate the educational value of various approaches.  This workshop seeks to begin cataloging experiences to attain that goal.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative proposal a number of PIs from different college level institutions (research university, technology focused university, four-year engineering college, and four-year liberal arts college) will cooperate on holding a workshop where a number of different approaches to cross-disciplinary education will be investigated.  This workshop will gather a number of faculty who have attempted such courses. The outcome will be a report that outlines approaches to computational interdisciplinary courses.  This report will be made widely available.</AbstractNarration>

As computer science educators, the growth in the importance of computation in other fields presents us with a crucial challenge: how can we best prepare our students (both majors and non&shy;majors) to work effectively on interdisciplinary applications of computer science? While universities have been working towards supporting interdisciplinary research through encouraging collaborative projects across disciplines and rethinking tenure and promotion criteria to promote faculty who work across disciplines, very little has been done towards the preparation of faculty and students for interdisciplinary education. While far from the only answer, some educators are addressing this challenge (at least in part) through developing courses that emphasize computer science content, content from another discipline, as well as content that integrates across the two disciplines. Most universities and colleges implement alternatives where a student completes  (1) courses in CS that include or focus on projects from discipline X,  (2) a major in CS and a minor (or several courses) in discipline X, or  (3) courses in CS+X taught by a CS teacher with some knowledge of field X, or a teacher in X with some knowledge of CS.  In most cases, the courses are not truly interdisciplinary.   This project worked towards the vision of truly interdisciplinary undergraduate courses with both faculty from CS and X partnered in teaching a classroom of students in CS and students in X, learning and working together on projects. To be successful, faculty need to address several challenges not found in a typical classroom, e.g., how to establish a partnership with faculty from another discipline, how to facilitate learning of knowledge and skills across the disciplines given diverse student backgrounds, and how to best guide students through open-ended interdisciplinary projects in CS+X.   Key Outcomes:  1)      In this collaborative project, PIs from four institutions designed a workshop where a number of different approaches to partnered teaching for interdisciplinary computer science education were investigated. Besides the PIs, this workshop was attended by 20 faculty who have attempted partnered teaching of interdisciplinary computer science +discipline X courses at the undergraduate level where X includes a broad set of disciplines, including biology, music, law, mathematics, engineering, chemistry, and communications.     2)      The data gathered during the workshop was parsed and analyzed. The paper describing the findings, titled, "How do faculty partner while teaching interdisciplinary CS+X courses: Models and Experiences" was published in the Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges for a wider dissemination. The experiences described in the journal paper (e.g., partnering with other faculty, designing a course, delivering a course, etc.) can be used to understand which activities have been successfully tested, which ran into problems, and what strategies were employed to mitigate encountered difficulties.     Through our synthesis of important considerations in the partnered teaching of CS+X courses, interested faculty will be able to begin the task of course design from a more informed place than what would have been possible without our work. CS+X courses present a rich set rewards and corresponding challenges for both faculty and students.  As the world increasingly demands that computer scientists look outside of their field to engage with difficult interdisciplinary problems, the importance of these courses will only increase.  We hope that our work serves as a useful resource as more and more faculty take up this important challenge.          Last Modified: 10/23/2017       Submitted by: Sumita Mishra]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
