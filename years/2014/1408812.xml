<AbstractNarration>The coupling of the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field gives rise to a range of disturbance effects in the space environment near Earth.  Communications, navigation and energy production and distribution can be significantly affected by this space weather. The ability to forecast disturbances that may impact these technologies hinges upon detailed knowledge and understanding of the connected Sun-Earth system, including complicated coupling processes between the magnetosphere and ionosphere. A particular aspect of the latter is the deposition of energy in the upper atmosphere, especially at high latitudes in the auroral zone.   Energization of the upper atmosphere during geomagnetic storms happens in several ways. One energy source is energetic particles precipitating along magnetic field lines into the upper atmosphere and creating the wonderful auroral displays that are a visual manifestation of space weather.   The aim of this project is the creation of a tool to provide detailed global information about the auroral particle precipitation at a high cadence over the last three decades.   Unlike existing statistical precipitation models this new resource will facilitate studies of the global dynamics as well as the development of local features.   Ultimately, the results of the project will lead to improved local forecasting capabilities for auroral precipitation and associated space weather effects.  The project also pursues significant education and training goals. The PI is an early career female scientist and the project will provide her with an excellent opportunity to accomplish an important step on the path towards a successful independent scientific research career.  Summer internships for undergraduate students will also be provided as part of the project.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on the development of a powerful new tool (HyperOVATION) which will combine DMSP precipitation observations with superMAG global magnetic field maps to produce high cadence (1 min) maps of the auroral oval using next generation software based on OVATION-SM. Unlike other precipitation models (including OVATION and OVATION-SM) that produce climatologies of precipitation within broad ranges of solar and geomagnetic parameters and thus have no local detail, HyperOVATION will ingest local information as well as global information and produce precipitation maps consistent with the detailed patterns derived from magnetometers by SuperMAG.  These global maps will be generated separately for mono-energetic, diffuse, broadband and ion auroras.  During the course of the model development, this tool will be used to answer questions about the auroral precipitation and its relationship to the local and global auroral currents.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The HyperOVATION project examined the relationship between the solar output, seasonal impact, ground-based magnetic perturbations, and the aurora (intensity and morphology). The research resulted in several advances in our understanding of the complexity of the auroral response to external drivers as well as to the innate geometry of the Sun-Earth magnetic system. From external driving, we found that the auroral response is significantly modified by the dawn-dusk component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Previous research had indicated a possible hemispheric asymmetry in auroral response to dawn-dusk IMF, we were able to confirm this asymmetry as well as determine a preferential auroral response to dawnward IMF in the northern hemisphere. Substorm onset signatures were observe to occur more frequently in the hour after a dawnward IMF during winter in the northern hemisphere than for a duskward IMF with similar solar wind driving. Additional work showed the enhancement of dayside aurora in sunlight. While examining the substorm auroral response, data suggested preferential geographical locations for substorm onsets in both northern and southern hemispheres. These locations are not magnetically conjugate, causing some theories to be postulated on innate geomagnetic geometry playing a role in determining auroral response. The HyperOVATION project has advanced the underlying knowledge needed to construct an improved auroral model.
