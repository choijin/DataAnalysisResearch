<AbstractNarration>Topology optimization is a computational process for designing structures and materials that meet some optimality criteria, e.g. minimum weight or maximum stiffness. The technique has gained significant traction among design engineers and has been shown to identify designs where efficient use of materials resulted in unprecedented performance. The objective of this research is to develop a new topology optimization framework capable of designing structural topologies that are robust in the presence of geometric uncertainties. Accounting for dimensional uncertainties in the optimization process is of paramount importance in many engineering applications, for example in processes involving extreme miniaturization of the material architecture, where the physical realization of the optimal design is generally subjected to significant tolerances. The application of this research to state-of-the-art commercially available manufacturing technologies, including additive manufacturing, will greatly impact the development of architected cellular materials and promote technology transfer. Results of this research will be incorporated into graduate courses within the Engineering and Applied Science PhD program at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. This project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students at UMass Dartmouth (where many students are first generation college students), the University of California, Irvine and Johns Hopkins University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will result in a new design optimization framework capable of designing structural topologies that are robust in the presence of geometric uncertainties. A number of strategies will be explored based on novel integration of stochastic analysis and uncertainty representation and propagation methods with efficient topology optimization techniques and inverse homogenization-based material design frameworks. Stochastic topology optimization frameworks for both continuum and discrete structures will be developed where flaw-tolerance is achieved through careful incorporation of nodal and boundary uncertainties. Novel methodologies for the characterization and representation of geometric uncertainties are planned, including an experimental effort aimed at carefully measuring typical geometric flaws in architected cellular materials fabricated with state-of-the-art additive manufacturing techniques, and quantifying their impact on the statistical variations of the macroscopic mechanical properties. This experimental investigation will feed into the development of a topology optimization framework centered on flaw-tolerance.</AbstractNarration>

While the topology of the architecture plays a critical role in securing performance, any manufacturing process will inevitably introduce defects, which might negatively affect the response of the material. The overarching goal of this Collaborative Research project is the development of a new design optimization framework capable of designing engineered structures and lattice-like materials that perform in a robust manner in the presence of uncertainties and imperfections.  During this project, we achieved 3 key intellectual outcomes:  We investigated the effect of manufacturing defects on the mechanical performance of lattice materials fabricated with two key technologies: (i) self-propagating polymer waveguide (SPPW) templating, followed by metal coating and template removal, thus yielding a hollow metallic lattice; and (ii) fused deposition modeling (FDM), producing solid polymeric lattices. We combined detailed geometrical measurements (via SEM and CT scanning), Finite Elements simulations and a rigorous statistical analysis to identify the key geometric defects responsible for the scatter in the mechanical performance. Although the quantitative results in this work are specific to microlattices fabricated by SPPW templating, the methodology presented herein is equally applicable to any architected materials produced by other manufacturing approaches, in particular additive processes, such as Fused Deposition Modeling, Stereolithography and Selective Laser Sintering. We worked with our UMASS partners to demonstrate numerically and experimentally that classic topology optimization techniques for the design of lightweight and stiff lattice materials could potentially generate designs with exceptionally low buckling strength (particularly in the presence of manufacturing imperfections); to correct this problem, the UMASS team developed a novel approach for introducing a buckling strength constraint in a classic topology optimization framework.  Phononic crystals are mechanical metamaterials that are engineered to filter mechanical and acoustic waves. Here we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a novel approach for convenient, real-time introduction and modification of extremely low-frequency band gaps in phononic crystals, based on the interactions of negative stiffness inclusions. Investigating the effect of manufacturing imperfections on the location and range of band gaps is an ongoing activity.    Fundamental developments in systematic characterization of uncertainties in manufactured materials and components are likely to have significant impact on the manufacturing sector, primarily in quantifying variations and identifying those which are most detrimental to the desired performance. This will help guide future research to improve manufacturing precisions.
