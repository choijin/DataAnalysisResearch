<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will perform the critical research that ultimately leads to a robust, hand-held, video-rate surface metrology system to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces. The broader impact of this project will be to improve yield, performance, safety, and lifetime of components in a wide range of critical U.S. industries including automotive, aerospace, and medical devices. For example, minor surface imperfections on edges or in other critical areas can have a dramatic effect on performance of components such as turbine blades, cutting tools, or other high-stress elements. In the turbine industry, during maintenance inspections, wear scars or corrosion pits that can lead to catastrophic failures must be quantified to ensure only necessary repairs and replacements are performed; current inspection technologies lead to high rejection rates of good parts since lack of good quantification necessitates conservatism in part rejection. This high-precision, portable, shop-floor gage will greatly enhance quantification of such features, leading to enhanced competitiveness across multiple critical U.S. manufacturing industries that employ a wide range of processing technologies. The total available market for such an instrument is estimated to be greater than $45 million annually in the initially identified application spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the demonstration of a novel instantaneous whole-field optical method for measuring rough surfaces with micron resolution and centimeter field of view. Instantaneous whole-field acquisition enables high-resolution measurements to be made in environments not possible with current technology.  Benefits of this technology range from increased manufacturing capability in aerospace (for example, production of turbine blades with improved efficiency), to fields such as medical imaging where motion and vibration are intrinsic. The research objectives for this program are to develop and/or demonstrate feasibility of several key components: an efficient method of generating polarization-based fringe patterns to enable instantaneous measurement, a state-of-the-art light source, compact optics capable of high-efficiency illumination and large-area imaging, and robust data processing techniques. Extensive modeling and experimentation will be combined to ensure success of each of the technical objectives. Once key components are developed, a breadboard system will be built and comprehensively tested against a variety of critical metrology goals. At the end of this Phase I effort, the anticipated outcome will be a working breadboard capable of vibration-immune, three-dimensional surface metrology with micron-level lateral and vertical resolution, applicable to a wide range of precision machined surfaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of the Phase 1 program was to produce a robust, hand-held, video-rate surface metrology system with vertical and lateral resolution of several micrometers to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces.  Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacture and/or maintenance operations.  4D Technology successfully completed the primary objectives of this Phase I project and demonstrated a "proof of principle" for a novel surface measurement system to address that need.  Measurements from our breadboard system demonstrated the desired vertical range, resolution, and vibration immunity that were the primary goals of this research.  As part of the three primary objectives (technology selection, performance modeling, build/test of prototype hardware), we ultimately designed and implemented a polarization-based fringe projection breadboard utilizing 4D TechnologyÆs micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement and handheld capabilities. We developed new methods to extend 4DÆs existing polarization-based phase shifting interferometry from smooth surfaces to rough, shaped surfaces while maintaining micron-level resolution.  This will ultimately allow manufacturers to rapidly rapidly assess surfaces, quantifying critical geometries and defects to improve part lifetime and manufacturing yield. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project arises from the opportunity to increase manufacturing competitiveness across a broad range of U.S. industries, including automotive, aerospace, medical devices and implants, and general additive manufacturing.  This technique will ultimately allow for rapid feedback into the production cycle with a real-time, easy-to-use, robust shop floor surface gage.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has restricted manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  A recognized market need exists for higher quality surface finish in multiple critical industries to achieve longer lifetimes, better appearance, and improved performance.  Lack of metrology to confirm critical geometries and quantify defects is also a recognized barrier to applications growth in additive manufacturing with its complex and tightly controlled features.  This high-precision, portable, shop-floor gage will thus enable enhanced competitiveness across multiple critical U.S. manufacturing industries that employ a wide range of processing technologies.  Overall, this project was a success and the lessons learned during Phase I of this project will enable us to build a viable commercial prototype in Phase II.
