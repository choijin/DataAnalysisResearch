<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) to acquire a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) system, which will provide UML faculty, students, staff and external community partners with current genomics instrumentation and training. The system centerpiece, an Illumina NextSeq 500 Desktop Sequencer, will significantly advance UML infrastructure for conducting innovative genomic-level research in biological engineering, evolutionary biology and environmental sciences. The Illumina instrument and associated equipment will meet an acute need for modern infrastructure to support genomics research and training at UML, where previously there was no DNA sequencing instrument on campus. The Illumina machine will also be incorporated into student-centered research, experiential coursework and outreach activities at UML to broaden participation in cutting-edge research and expand opportunities for students in professional training for biotechnology careers. Numerous UML students enter the regionally important biotechnology workforce, and the awarded Illumina instrument will strengthen the local economy by exposing students to modern sequencing technology. The award will enrich education at UML with the development of an NGS learning module that will be implemented into several undergraduate and graduate courses. A workshop dedicated to the use and application of the Illumina instrument will be developed for faculty, students and external users. An annual NGS research and educational symposium at UML will facilitate collaborations and attract new users of the instrument. The University of Massachusetts Lowell serves an ethnically and economically diverse student body and faculty employing the NGS system will recruit underrepresented minority and female students for participation in research involving use of the Illumina instrument. In addition, UML undergraduates in a Service Learning Genomics course will devise presentations on NGS and genomics to high school students.  Accordingly, societal benefits of the project will include raising scientific literacy of the public, lowering barriers to scientific participation, and strengthening the regional economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will establish a new Genomics Core Facility at UML, where there are &gt;40 faculty and students conducting genome-focused research. The NGS system will considerably advance research in diverse disciplines, and projects employing the new Illumina instrument include those aimed at understanding: 1) trace element cellular metabolism; 2) venom evolutionary genomics; 3) microbial community structure; 4) metazoan phylogeny; 5) NGS assembly software performance; and 6) transcriptional control of immune cell development. These studies will utilize the Illumina instrument to perform a spectrum of techniques including: 1) targeted genome re-sequencing; 2) whole-transcriptome sequencing; 3) quantification of genome-wide expression levels; 4) sequencing of microbial DNA amplified from environmental sample; and 5) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to determine genome regulatory regions and DNA-protein interactions.  Thus, the award will significantly expand research opportunities for UML faculty and students and enhance the intellectual environment supporting biological research.</AbstractNarration>

Accordingly, the project has achieved its primary goals of acquiring and using modern high-throughput sequencing instrumentation at UML, training faculty and students in its use, and generating new research activities on campus.  Intellectual Impact  The Illumina NextSeq 500 next generation sequencer has proven to be an essential part of the success of multiple faculty and graduate student projects.  The acquisition of the NextSeq 500 also led to the hiring of a full-time molecular technologist who has been able to demonstrate the NextSeq 500 capabilities and who has been able to hold several UMass Lowell outreach and educational events as well as community outreach events.  Furthermore, the sequencer has attracted new faculty to the campus who would have otherwise not been able to complete their research at this institute, one of which is involved in NGS bioinformatics research. Since the acquisition of the NextSeq 500, group of graduate students and industry scientists have been trained on the entire next-generation sequencing workflow including NextSeq 500 operation.  This directly benefits workforce development by providing current and future industry researchers with the hands-on techniques required to meet industry advancement.  One of the trained students has since completed their PhD and has been accepted into a post-doctoral position at another university, while a second student was hired at a local company since completing their PhD both with the help of the NextSeq 500 to complete their dissertations.  Additionally, the NextSeq 500 and ancillary equipment were used to teach two semesters of a hands-on class of eleven Master?s students from Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology about RNA quantitation and quality assurance for use in downstream RNA sequencing.    Broader Impact  The NextSeq 500 technology and the accompanying workflow has been taught to four undergraduate classes by the core facility technologist: "Clinical and Nutritional Genetics", two "Genomics" classes, and "Laboratory Instrumentation" enriching the education of nearly 300 students in the classroom.  Additionally, the NextSeq500 has been a showcase instrument for two rounds of open workshops.The NextSeq 500 and ancillary equipment was presented by the technologist during a talk at the monthly Biology Department Colloquium to approximately 7 faculty and a mix of 30 undergraduate and graduate students.  The NextSeq 500 capabilities were showcased at the Kennedy College of Sciences Block party that is hosted annually for incoming freshman to highlight the scope and depth of technologies offered at UMass Lowell. The ability of the NextSeq 500 to be used in forensic investigations was highlighted at the first annual "Forensics Conversation Starter" hosted by the UMass Lowell Criminal Justice department.  Regarding the benefit outside of the university, an AP biology class from one of the area high schools held a field trip to the core facilities where DNA sequencing on the NextSeq 500 and genomics was a topic of discussion with the class.  A ninety-second flash talk was presented about DNA sequencing to prospective external clients, as well as new and current faculty during the first annual "UMass Lowell Core Research Facilities Showcase".
