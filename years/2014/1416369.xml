<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a simple general test strip that can be broadly used for the detection and characterization of bacteria such as pathogens and drug-resistant organisms.  The project is expected to result in a prototype low-cost device for rapid and specific characterization of bacteria.  The product will take the form similar to that of a home pregnancy test and will be ideal for immediate point-of-care diagnoses.  There is no such general product currently on the market and commercial potential is deemed high.  The proposed diagnostic platform will be versatile and broadly applicable for different applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is to deliver a low-cost, simple, handheld product that gives a rapid and accurate visible colorimetric indication (Yes or NO answer similar to a pregnancy home test strip) of bacteria relevant to disease, biowarfare concerns, environmental contamination, and the food chain. There is a need for a rapid, simple and inexpensive point-of-care test, especially in hospital ICU?s where there is a high risk and frequency of getting infection from sick patients who have compromised immune systems.   The detection platform is versatile and applicable to a large array of microbial infections, and has multiple applications in clinical and non-clinical setting. It is intended to transform the way pathogens are detected in the professional and consumer markets.  The proposal seeks to develop the design principles and fashioning of practical devices to achieve a rapid diagnostic kit for identification of bacteria using human samples.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Multidrug resistant organisms pose a major clinical and public health problem.  The screening methods that are currently used require culture techniques that have limited detection sensitivity, require 2 to 4 days to perform, and suffer from contamination problems.  There is a critical need for a rapid and inexpensive screening assay for detection of bacterial infection or contamination in clinical or environmental samples.  Ideally this could be performed directly, as a point of care (PoC) assay, by simple visible inspection (a color change) within a one hour time frame.  Such is the product that we have developed.  We have demonstrated that our detection technology can detect pathogens in different human samples, including urine, BAL, wound fluids, and nasal swabs, with no matrix interference from human enzymes.  The current prototype is simple (mixing and observation) and uses inexpensive reagents to provide rapid, selective, naked-eye detection of individual pathogens.  The assay is adaptable for detection of other clinical, biowarfare, or environmentally-relevant pathogens, or other enzymatic biomarkers.  Our Phase I studies demonstrated the general feasibility of the concepts and revealed the technical hurdles to be crossed during product performance optimization. The work also resulted in job creation and training of employees in state-of-the-art technologies.  At the completion of Phase II, the technology will be ready for sales of environmental pathogen detection kits, and for clinical studies and/or licensing for the commercial market.
