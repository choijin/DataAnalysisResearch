<AbstractNarration>This project will enhance understanding of atmospheric physics, chemistry, and dynamics on tropical cyclone activity. It will advance scientific confidence in projections of the influence of climate change on tropical cyclones. Linkages across chemistry, radiation, dynamics, and meteorology provide an ideal framework for the type of cross-disciplinary education needed for the next generation of climate scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding of the factors that influence tropical cyclones has broadened in recent years to include consideration of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), which can affect storm outflow temperatures and thereby potential and actual intensities. Observations from multiple sources show that the atmosphere in the vicinity of the TTL exhibits substantial variability on interannual and decadal timescales, which could affect variability and trends in tropical cyclones. However, the physical and chemical processes affecting these changes are not well understood, and reanalysis products and coupled general circulation models often do not agree on the magnitude of this variability. The effects of changes in volcanic aerosol, water vapor, and ozone in a hierarchy of radiative and chemical/dynamical modeling approaches will be examined, and implications of radiative processes for tropical cyclones will be identified.</AbstractNarration>

Much previous work has looked at how the temperatures of tropical oceans affect the intensity of tropical cyclones.

The storm top temperature is closely related to the temperature of the tropopause&hellip;the boundary between the troposphere (where most weather happens) and the dry stratosphere above it. The tropical tropopause is quite cold&hellip;.below -100 degrees Fahrenheit.  We found that the temperature of the tropopause over the North Atlantic, where hurricanes form, has been decreasing over the past few decades; yet elsewhere we could find no significant trends. The downward trend in tropopause temperature over the North Atlantic has made an important contribution to the increasing "potential intensity" of hurricanes. The "potential intensity" is a theoretical upper limit on hurricane wind speeds, given the temperature of the atmosphere and the underlying ocean. Although we could find no significant trends in potential intensity outside the North Atlantic, we did find that much of the year-to-year changes in potential intensity all through the tropics can be traced to fluctuations in the tropopause temperature.  We also tried to discover why the tropopause has been cooling over the North Atlantic, and what has been causing the year-to-year fluctuations of tropopause temperature there and elsewhere in the tropics. We found that large volcanic eruptions cause a warming of the tropopause over the North Atlantic that last about two years; thus we think that big volcanoes might suppress Atlantic hurricane activity for a few years.  Curiously, we could not find much signal of the volcanoes elsewhere. We also found that a slow, large-scale ascent that prevails in the lower tropical stratosphere &ndash; a circulation known as the "Brewer-Dobson Circulation" &ndash; has been increasing over the past few decades; this may be related to the cooling of the tropopause over the North Atlantic since upward motion tends to cool the atmosphere.
