<AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site renewal site advances applications of additive manufacturing has the powerful advantage of providing opportunities for interdisciplinary projects that culminate in excellent applied engineering research activities. The activities will help participants develop a passion for lifelong learning and will encourage entrepreneurship and global impact involving the useful "sometimes patentable" devices that will be created. The MSOE-REU Site will continue to be a research incubator for several first-generation and traditionally underrepresented students from all across the nation, especially from second tier/ non Ph.D. granting schools. To date, this program has provided 161 students with research opportunities.  Of the 148 students who have completed their baccalaureate, 59% have completed or are pursuing advanced degrees, with several in faculty positions. The most recent award has served 21 students, of whom 67% are from other institutions, 38% minorities and others (14% African American), and 52% women.  Of the 8 who have completed a baccalaureate, 75% are in graduate school.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commitment to diversity, strong mentoring environment, interdisciplinary nature of the program, and an established record of impact on participants' decisions to pursue graduate studies will continue to be major markers of the MSOE-REU.  A new feature in the proposed site is to broaden the participants' role in diversity through 1) creation of five K-12 learning modules amidst interaction with teachers and students on campus during summer and 2) enablement of a global perspective among all participants and advisors while two students engage in laser-based materials research at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the University of Johannesburg, South Africa during the middle six weeks of the 10-week REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year summer REU renewal site at MSOE, funded by the National Science Foundation's Division of Engineering Education and Centers, will offer seven undergraduates annually opportunities to conduct research in advances (micro-, hybrid, laser-based metal) and applications (bio-nano) of additive manufacturing (AM). The range of new and functional AM applications and materials is growing rapidly and unprecedented technological advances in this field are affecting our daily lives.  Also, the AM application, in addition to its unique features of accuracy, reduction in development and delivery time, and reliability, is becoming cost-effective because of the advancement of materials. The international component, with two participants conducting materials science research in a global setting during the middle six weeks of the program provides a new dynamic to all participants enriching their experience and bringing a global perspective besides the collaborative research accomplishments. These two participants will be typically MSOE juniors who have had exposure to AM on campus and have completed materials science course(s) with an adequate preparation to participate in advanced materials research at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, South Africa and the University of Johannesburg.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five participants conducting AM applications research on campus will be chosen among applicants from other institutions; they will create learning modules for K-12 outreach from their own research projects and will interact with Project Lead the Way teachers and students on the premises.  Bi-weekly virtual meetings will be arranged for interaction among all participants. This ten-week program is geared to attract a broad mix of students, typically 50% women, 25% underrepresented minorities and more than 60% from other institutions. Participants will conduct research in a strongly mentored environment. Students will receive a career-enriching experience from a well-established and well-run program culminating in a final paper, a national conference presentation and a strong desire to pursue a graduate degree.  Two additional participants under NSF Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power work alongside these students each year, making the team a rich cohort with excellent collaborative research interactions.</AbstractNarration>

While 13 participants are completing their undergraduate, 6 are pursuing graduate studies, and 7 are employed in industry with a definite interest in graduate school pursuit.   INTELLECTUAL MERIT   Several undergraduate research projects were successfully completed under the current site in advances and applications of additive manufacturing at MSOE's Centers for Excellence coupled and South Africa's CSIR Laser Center and the University of Johannesburg. Two MSOE students each year went to to South Africa to spend the middle six weeks in focused advanced materials research.

Besides interdisciplinary research involvement, the participants' communication skills have been enhanced through development of project abstracts, final research papers, participation in poster sessions, and PowerPoint presentations at the end of REU program, and direct participation in national conferences.  FIve journal or juried conference papers have resulted from this grant and 22 student papers published in the proceedings of the National Conference on Undergraduate Research.   Evaluation Results  Dr. Marsha Watson, our external evaluator observed the strengths of the program as creative collaboration with peers, advisors and staff, the ?real-world? experience of research with a practical purpose, and emphasis in this program on developing rhetorical skills to communicate the work to wide audiences.  The Likert scale response averages in the program evaluation continue in the range, 4.5 to 4.75 out of 5 (5 ~ strongly agree).  The advisor/participant interaction is at the highest (4.75).  One student, in an answer to most shining accomplishment in the program said, "being able to conduct my own research project which forces you to push yourself toward things you had never experienced before".  Another said, "overcoming communication issues and broadening my horizons".  On what they liked best about the program, the answers included "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of conducting research in another country", "the structured documentation coupled with the ability to freely use my creativity", "very insightful and helpful collaboration and status report meetings", "amazing global opportunity and many follow-up opportunities it continues to create for me" and "one-on-one advising and interaction".  BROADER IMPACT  The current program has attracted a technically diverse group of participants from all over the nation and we have purposefully extended outreach beyond MSOE, with 69% from other institutions.  The current program has more than fulfilled its goal of diversity: 42% minorities and others and 54% women. The inclusion of an RET supplement during summer 2017 has enhanced the creation of teaching modules by the REU participants.  The intersection of undergraduates, teachers, and advising professors has been very beneficial to the overall effectiveness of the program.  Prior REU participants have joined status report meetings at least once each year to encourage current participants. For example, Rebecca Statum (REU2015) joined in July 2017 and Sung Kwon (REU2008) in July 2016.

It was electrifying to watch them interacting with current participants when they personally attended the poster presentations on campus.  Unsolicited, the PI received this note from Robert Mueller, one of the first to take advantage of the international component of the current site: "Pursuing and accepting the opportunity to go to South Africa for research is something that I will never forget.
