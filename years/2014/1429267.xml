<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves acquisition of an X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) instrument at Kettering University to support materials research, integration of research and education, and outreach programs.  With the development of new degree programs at Kettering, new initiatives in innovative materials research have been launched with participation across disciplines and involving external industrial and academic partners.  The XPS provides much-needed capabilities to enable the projects to significantly advance their objectives and make important contributions.  On-campus availability of XPS also strengthens integration of teaching and research, with incorporation of the equipment in classes spanning physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and industrial engineering.  Additionally, this equipment significantly enhances the unique undergraduate research experience at Kettering.  Kettering has a long history of outreach activities for local youth, in which faculty members open research laboratories and equipment, including characterization instruments such as XPS, and create engaging demonstrations that highlight the relevance of such technologies in everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument is a Physical Electronics X-Tool model, designed specifically to reach a wider audience by adding automatic and easy-to-use features, without compromising full capabilities to obtain elemental identity and quantification, chemical states, depth profiles, and chemical surface mapping.  The research activities supported by the XPS equipment are addressing a multitude of scientific problems across disciplines, including advanced coatings to improve medical implants, improvement of materials for dentistry and orthopedics, materials to improve disease treatment and imaging, lightweight materials for transportation, enhancement of battery technology for electronic vehicles, development of protective coatings, materials for energy storage to address increasing energy demand, and membranes to improve biogas production, among others.  While the specific objectives vary by project, general goals and scope include development of innovative materials and coatings, process characterization, and tailoring the materials to meet the objectives.  The data from the XPS is evaluated to determine and quantify the links between the process parameters, the material chemical properties, and the application performance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Significant progress toward the intellectual merit and broader impacts has been made since the XPS was installed in March 2015.  The XPS has been extensively used with over 800 hours logged on the machine as of mid-October 2015.  The data from the XPS has been used to support seven (7) research projects involving eight (8) faculty members and 18 students whose home departments include Chemical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Electrical Engineering.  The acquisition of the XPS has supported the materials research projects across Kettering, enriched undergraduate training in research and development, enhanced the integration of research and teaching, and will reinforce the STEM outreach programs offered by Kettering.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT  Results from the XPS have led to key findings for the projects described below, and manuscripts are in preparation that include data from the XPS.  Grafting Biopolymers to Polyethylene for Reduced Wear  Biocompatible polymers were grafted to the surface of polyethylene using atmospheric pressure plasma (APP), as a means of reducing friction at the interface between metal and plastic in hip implants.  The modified surfaces would generate less wear particles and the immune response from any wear particles would be reduced to the bioactivity of the grafted polymer.  Surface chemistries were analyzed with XPS and FTIR.  Process-property relationships are currently being developed for the plasma system and resulting surface functionalities using these characterization methods.  Reduced Graphene Oxide Films  Samples of nickel foam soaked with graphene oxide were subjected to atmospheric plasma annealing (APA). The samples were characterized using ESEM, XPS and FTIR. The results from the samples indicated that it is possible to synthesize reduced graphene oxide by this technique.  The XPS data showed a trend with the ratio of C=C to C-O bonds, with the optimum number of 14 scans to obtain most C=C bonds.  Other characterization methods supported the XPS findings.  Characterization of the Deposition Behavior of Atmospheric Plasma Processes  Experiments were conducted using a variety of organosilicon chemicals to evaluate the deposition behavior of an atmospheric plasma process.  The characterization using the XPS revealed trends with normalized energy input parameters.  Depth profiles have shown how the chemistry changes throughout the process.  The analysis has revealed classifications of the organosilicon monomers, in which the deposition behavior is the same for chemicals in the same class.  Coatings and Fiber Surface Treatments for Natural Fiber Composites  Natural fibers from wood and paper waste were coated using atmospheric plasma and a variety of precursors.  The treated fibers were characterized by XPS, contact angle, and wettability.  The XPS characterization is used to screen precursors and process conditions for creating treated fibers to test mechanical properties in thermoplastic composites.  XPS data was included in a patent application submitted in June 2015 and will be included in a presentation at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers Annual Meeting in November 2015.  The XPS is also used for other projects in which evaluation of data and findings are ongoing.  BROADER IMPACTS  Many undergraduate students have been building skills in the XPS technique, theory and operation of the equipment, and advanced data analysis.  To date, fourteen (14) undergraduate students have used the equipment as part of an independent research elective course, while four (4) students were hired full-time during non-school term or part-time during a school term.  All students involved have conducted activities in one or more of the following:  operating the equipment and using theory to obtain the information needed, using advanced techniques to analyze the data, correlating the data to process conditions and other testing techniques, and reporting the findings in a presentation or writ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
