<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it offers low cost, and compact&lt;br/&gt;tablet/mobile devices with better wireless connectivity and increased battery life. Lower cost of these&lt;br/&gt;devices will enable their widespread use in the society and enable use of broadband services with higher&lt;br/&gt;efficiency and better connectivity. The transparent antenna technology offers a platform on which&lt;br/&gt;several other applications can be built. For instance, compact health monitoring sensors can be&lt;br/&gt;integrated with wireless capability by integrating antennas on their displays. This technology also will&lt;br/&gt;also improve wireless capability of wearables as they have very limited real estate for antennas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop transparent antenna&lt;br/&gt;technology for wireless consumer devices. This SBIR project will advance our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;interactions between touch sensor and transparent antennas and enable development of multifunctional&lt;br/&gt;touch sensors that not only operates as a touch sensor but also a transparent antenna as&lt;br/&gt;well. A very comprehensive research approach will be undertaken in Phase I. Namely, in addition to&lt;br/&gt;evaluating performance of the antenna technology in the presence of touch sensor, performance of&lt;br/&gt;touch sensor in the presence of transparent antennas will also be characterized to ensure that the&lt;br/&gt;proposed multi?]functional touch sensors meet the requirements of wireless consumer devices such as&lt;br/&gt;tablets and mobile phones.</AbstractNarration>
