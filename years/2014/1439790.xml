<AbstractNarration>Teaching in a high-need school is challenging work and, without appropriate supports, new teachers are at risk of low job satisfaction, burn out and leaving teaching altogether. To address these needs, the Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership (PRNP) consisting of Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges, Drexel University, La Salle University, the University of Pennsylvania, Saint Joseph's University and Temple University, together with the Philadelphia Education Fund and its Philadelphia Teacher Residency Program will develop a new teacher support program that will provide flexible, individualized supportive services to new first and second year Noyce teachers so as to increase their persistence and professional growth as STEM professionals in the Philadelphia region. The Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership will develop a model of early career teacher support using regional resources that will retain and sustain new STEM teachers.  These new Noyce teachers will have increased opportunities to participate in mentoring, professional development, communities of practice and social networks with regional STEM professionals in real and virtual environments. The new teacher support model will include the following components: (1) Individualized Support Plan (ISP); (2) Mentoring (Mentor Training Model Development, Mentor Training and Mentoring Support); (3) Professional Development; (4) Outreach and Networking; and (5) Website Based Resources and Communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will contribute to the subfield within STEM education focused on preparing,retaining, and supporting the development of high quality teachers in high needs settings. Specifically, through developing and testing an approach that supports both new teachers' emotional well-being and their instructional outlook and skills, the project will increase understanding of the challenges confronted by novice teachers in a large urban school district and ways that those challenges can be managed and met. By the end of the two-year project, there will be a refined regional model of new STEM teacher support that can be scaled to provide support for large numbers of new teachers. In addition to providing support for new STEM teachers working in high-needs schools in Philadelphia, to  increase their capacities as teachers and the likelihood that they will stay in teaching, the project will prepare experienced STEM teachers to serve as mentors of new teachers, enhancing the self-sustaining capacity of the network of teachers in Philadelphia. The project will strengthen a growing partnership across seven teacher education institutions in Philadelphia, facilitating regional cooperation efforts devoted to teacher development and support. Finally, through collaborative efforts, the partnership will offer a rich menu of supports for all new STEM teachers in the region, exceeding the capacity of any single institution to support its graduates.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership (PRNP) New Teacher Support Program was to develop a model of early career teacher support using regional resources that will retain and sustain new STEM teachers.</p> <p>To this end, 28 new teachers were engaged in a cohort-based community of learners that met monthly for professional development and peer support, thereby surpassing the project&rsquo;s target of working with 20 teachers. These teachers created an Individual Support Plan that focused on their professional, instructional and self-care needs.&nbsp; With the help of seasoned and well-trained mentors, the new STEM teachers worked to carry out their action plans, developing agency and self-efficacy.&nbsp; This model of induction for new teachers was different from most models in two distinct ways.&nbsp; First, it focused on the teacher&rsquo;s social-emotional needs with a goal of a well-balanced work-home life and the avoidance of teacher &ldquo;burn-out&rdquo;.&nbsp; Second, it turned the traditional mentoring approach around, putting the new teacher in the driver&rsquo;s seat, allowing the new teacher to ask for the specific help that he/she identified as needed rather than being told what aspects of their practice to work on. &nbsp;</p> <p>Given the non-traditional mentoring approach that was taken, the mentors involved in the program needed to undertake their own professional development to hone the skills needed for this new way of being a mentor.&nbsp;Hierarchical barriers needed to be broken down and listening skills needed to be developed.&nbsp; The nine mentors involved in the program provided 4 hours a month of one-on-one contact with the new teachers, sometimes observing classroom practice, other times helping teachers to reflect and relax over coffee.&nbsp;In addition to this personal contact, mentors maintained contact on a regular basis through calls and emails. In program evaluations over the course of three years, the new teachers commented that having this mentor was&nbsp; the most beneficial aspect of the new teacher support program.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the second year of the New Teacher Support Program, the new teachers transitioned from working with an external mentor to working with a teacher in their school. This component of the model not only helped the new teacher build social capital within their own school building but was also a financially sound method for continuing this foundational support.&nbsp; These school-based collaborators were chosen after much thought by the new teacher about what their professional, instructional and self-care needs were and who could help them the most.&nbsp; With guidance from their external mentors who met with the new teacher and the school-based collaborator in a triad during the transition, the new teachers were set on a path towards teacher leadership in their schools.</p> <p>The new teacher support program contributed to PRNP&rsquo;s overall mission of building connections between STEM educators in the Greater Philadelphia region. The 28 new teacher participants came from 7 different Institutions of Higher Education. To help the new teachers develop their professional expertise as well as build their professional social networks, PRNP hosted 11 day long professional development workshops over the course of the grant. These workshops were attended by approximately 500 participants.&nbsp;</p> <p>The most important outcome of the program was that twenty-four of the twenty-eight STEM teachers remain teaching in high need schools after the third year of the program.&nbsp; Many of the teachers participating in the program provided testimony of the impact that it had on them, but this STEM teacher sums it all up:</p> <p>&ldquo;I am very grateful to PRNP and to you for all of your support and guidance during the past 3 years. I don't think I could have been as successful, or even survived, without my mentors and colleagues that I met at PRNP events. I learned so much about building relationships, taking care of myself and how to manage a classroom. I also benefitted from connecting with other educators outside of my district which would have been very hard without being involved. I'm a completely different teacher and person from the first year teacher I was when we first started the program. &ldquo;</p> <p>After eight years of collaboration and three NFS capacity building grants, the higher education institutions in the Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership continue to &ldquo;do together what they cannot do alone&rdquo; &nbsp;to enhance the STEM teacher pipeline, supporting and developing quality teachers over the course of their teaching career.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/07/2017<br>      Modified by: Victor&nbsp;J&nbsp;Donnay</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510465885587_LearningaboutAssessmenttogether--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510465885587_LearningaboutAssessmenttogether--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cohort Meeting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510465885587_LearningaboutAssessmenttogether--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cohort Meeting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">New Teacher and Mentor learn about the Feedback Cycle together.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bonnie Hallam</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Victor&nbsp;J&nbsp;Donnay</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cohort Meeting</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510466308704_NewTeacherLeadership--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510466308704_NewTeacherLeadership--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Taking on a Leadership Role"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510466308704_NewTeacherLeadership--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Taking on a Leadership Role"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2nd year STEM teachers facilitate workshop for 1st year STEM teachers</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bonnie Hallam</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Victor&nbsp;J&nbsp;Donnay</div> <div class="imageTitle">Taking on a Leadership Role</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510467064168_Inthewhale--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510467064168_Inthewhale--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Building Social Capital"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510467064168_Inthewhale--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Building Social Capital"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">New and experienced STEM teachers explore a giant whale model made by students</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bonnie Hallam</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Victor&nbsp;J&nbsp;Donnay</div> <div class="imageTitle">Building Social Capital</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510467803120_ExpandingContentKnowledge--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510467803120_ExpandingContentKnowledge--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Expanding Content Knowledge"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439790/1439790_10321190_1510467803120_ExpandingContentKnowledge--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Expanding Content Knowledge"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">New STEM teachers explore math and sustainability at all day professional development</div> <div class="imageCredit">Herb Green</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Victor&nbsp;J&nbsp;Donnay</div> <div class="imageTitle">Expanding Content Knowledge</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
