<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to find ways to make the measurement sciences more useful to the production of intellective competence in diverse students of the STEM disciplines.  A Study Group on Diversity, Equity and Excellence in Achievement and Assessment in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education will be established to address a set of issues posed as critical to the future of assessment for education. Building on the work of the Gordon Commission on the Future of Assessment in Education, the Study Group will undertake a series of activities culminating in the production of a report to the field including conceptual analyses, knowledge syntheses findings, and recommended specifications for a program of research and development to advance STEM education through assessment for education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Study Group will consist of fifteen research scientists and scholars of pedagogical practice who are being organized to inquire into the potential of the measurement sciences to more effectively inform the teaching and learning of STEM subject matter for students whose development is challenged by the demands of diversity, equity and excellence in intellective competence. Group members are especially interested in balancing the capabilities of the measurement sciences in the assessment of developed abilities, with equal strength in the analysis, documentation and understanding of  the learning and teaching processes by which intellective competence is developed. The Group will conduct a conceptual inquiry into the interrelatedness of diversity, equity, and achievement in STEM. Special attention will be given to variance in attributions, contexts and perspectives associated with differences in life conditions, cultural experience and cultural identity. The Study Group will utilize in-person and virtual deliberations; consultative conversations; and commissioned position and review papers to generate recommendations and suggested specifications for programs of research, development and praxis designed to better inform the teaching and, especially, the learning of STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Study Group on Diversity, Equity and Excellence in Achievement and Assessment in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education    By Edmund W. Gordon, Ed.D.   Introduction This investigation inquires into the possible relationships between assessment, teaching and learning at the beginning of the 21st century, with a view toward how the field of education should adapt to meet the needs of future generations in an era characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting demographic trends. It is a direct tie to the Gordon Commission on the Future of Assessment (2013), which was a group of educational leaders representing the fields of measurement, educational policy, psychology, and practice, which convened from 2011-2013 to consider the needs and demands of assessment for U.S. education and make recommendations for U.S. educational assessment policy.  The Gordon Commission produced a vision for assessment they deemed to be beneficial to improving U.S. education and which they understood would advance technology to improve educational measurement and student achievement. The Commission pursued its agenda by approaching the problem of assessment in education being mindful of issues of 1) human diversity, 2) variance in human characteristics, 3) equity as a privileged political value in democratic societies, and 4) the achievement of excellence in intellective competence. The Commission recognized these as an intractable set of issues that will need to be addressed in the future of assessment for education. In organizing the work of the Commission, papers were commissioned that targeted these issues.  In the reports of the Gordon Commission, the suggestion was advanced that these problems and others in the history of assessment may require that measurement science give as much emphasis to the analysis of teaching and learning processes as it has traditionally given to the measurement of developed academic ability. That is, a shift in focus may be required that values the processes by which learners progress leading to mastery, as much as it appreciates the mastery itself. In addition, especially with respect to STEM education. It is suggested that the focus on mastery be bi-focal. That is, attention to the command of the mental abilities that result from the study of the STEM disciplines deserves as much attention as subject matter mastery. Combined, these concerns from the Gordon Commission suggest that renewed attention be given to the diagnostic and formative capabilities of measurement science around concerns that relate to a) a clear definition of the nature of the mental abilities that should be the target of assessments; b) a better understanding of the pedagogical processes that contribute to the development of mental abilities; c) implications for policy and practice concerning new assessment targets and pedagogical processes.  The study reported here relates directly to the Gordon Commission work, posing the question, How can assessment be used to help us better understand disparities among groups of people in relation to STEM (academic) learning and the social divisions to which people are assigned?  In this study, we took careful effort to conceptualize assessment as an integrated, dialectical form of pedagogy that integrates the learning, teaching and assessment processes. This investigation explored how the diverse characteristics and conditions of life influence those relationships, and how the dynamic nature of developing persons, and the processes that determine and influence that development, influence the nature of the experience of that which is to be learned. We are specifically concerned with possible ways that assessment integrated with learning and teaching transactions can contribute to our better understanding of these phenomena at the same time as we improve the quality of the outcomes and focus deliberate attention to them. To these ends, this investigation surfaced several important themes related to the central question.       Last Modified: 05/30/2017       Submitted by: Edmund W Gordon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
