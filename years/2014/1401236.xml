<AbstractNarration>To date, most studies on visual signals have focused on the fixed appearances of animals and, specifically, of their color. As a result, dynamic color signals remain poorly understood from ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary standpoints. To begin to address this discrepancy, the researchers previously conducted detailed studies of the control and function of rapid color change in male veiled chameleons, Chamaeleo calyptratus. However, a broader context is required to understand the evolutionary origins of and constraints on these unusual color change signals. In this study, the researchers will conduct a comparative study of Bradypodion dwarf chameleons to investigate how and why color change signals evolved. Dwarf chameleons exhibit marked variation in color change and display behavior among species, making them ideal for testing evolutionary hypotheses about the origin and function of this rare signal type. This study seeks to determine whether color change evolved to accentuate behavioral displays (or vice versa), or arose as a signal independent of complex behaviors and evaluate potential phylogenetic constraints on color change. In addition to communicating findings in scientific journals, the researchers will partner with outreach programs at Arizona State University and the South African National Biodiversity Institute to share major research findings via customized learning activities for middle school students in Arizona and South Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To better understand whether elaborate behavioral displays evolved before, after, or concurrently with complex color change signals, the researchers will measure natural suites of intraspecific behavioral (i.e. aggressive/submissive) and color signals in 12 species of dwarf chameleons using high-definition video cameras to record staged, aggressive interactions between conspecifics in each species natural habitat. Still photos of the animals, concurrently with video, will be taken during aggressive trials and colorimetric data will be collected throughout behavioral displays and bouts of rapid color change. Felsenstein's independent contrasts and phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analysis will be used to evaluate the evolutionary relationships between multiple aspects of display colorimetrics and display behaviors, and the strength of the phylogenetic signal will be evaluated for all color and behavioral signals. Lastly, the program Mesquite will be used to reconstruct ancestral states of behavioral displays and color signals in an attempt to disentangle the order and patterns of signal elaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;The doctoral dissertation research award number 1401236, &ldquo;The Function and Evolution of Rapid Color Change as a Social Signal&rdquo;, enabled field research investigating the behavioral and color change signals of 12 species of dwarf chameleon (genus <em>Bradypodion</em>) in their native habitats across South Africa. Understanding evolutionarily novel traits, like the ability to rapidly change color to communicate, requires data from multiple species and this project enabled the collection of such data. These data will inform our understanding of the evolutionary patterns of communication efficiency and signal design, as well as improve our understanding of the processes of adaptation. In addition to the scientific value of this project, this work provided increased opportunity for the dedicated mentorship of under-represented groups as they participated in hands-on scientific experiences (5 undergraduate women, 4 of them first generation college students and 2 of them minorities). The findings from this project are also going to be incorporated into lesson plans designed to engage middle school students with high-quality scientific experiences, both in the United States and in South Africa. Additionally, during fieldwork in South Africa we had several opportunities to engage local community members, including school children, in our research and were able to provide the first hands-on experiences between many local people and their native chameleon fauna.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/10/2016<br>      Modified by: Kevin&nbsp;J&nbsp;Mcgraw</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1401236/1401236_10324616_1470869180335_DwarfChameleonDiversity--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1401236/1401236_10324616_1470869180335_DwarfChameleonDiversity--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dwarf chameleon color diversity"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1401236/1401236_10324616_1470869180335_DwarfChameleonDiversity--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dwarf chameleon color diversity"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dwarf chameleons exhibit dramatic color diversity with repeated evolution and loss of ornamental colors.
