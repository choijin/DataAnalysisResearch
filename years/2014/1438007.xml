<AbstractNarration>1438007 - Goodenough&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is the development of a new strategy for a rechargeable battery that can store energy at a price that is competitive with fossil fuels. The strategy is to develop an inexpensive thin, flexible, mechanically strong electrolyte membrane scalable at low cost to large areas that is chemically stable to temperatures above 100Â°C on contact with a metallic alkali metal. The PI plans to explore the design of a rechargeable battery using an alkali-metal anode to enhance the energy density and lower the cost of battery manufacture and management. The broad impact of this development would be the enabling of alternative strategy for the development of Li-ion or Na-ion batteries that can power an all-electric highway vehicle or provide storage for the grid of electrical energy generated by solar or wind energy at an affordable cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Present strategies for Li-ion or Na-ion batteries use an organic liquid electrolyte having a lowest-unoccupied-molecular-orbital (LUMO) energy about 1 eV below the Fermi energy EF of a Li anode, 0.7 eV below the EF of a Na anode. Formation of a passivating solidelectrolyte-interphase (SEI) layer on an alkali-metal anode surface having EF &gt; LUMO causes dendrites to form and grow across the electrolyte to the cathode on repeated charge/discharge cycles; with an organic liquid electrolyte, the resulting internal short-circuit has incendiary consequences. As a result, existing Li-ion rechargeable battery cells are fabricated in the discharged state with an anode free of an alkali metal. Nevertheless, on the initial charge, a passivating SEI layer permeable to Li+ or Na+ is formed if the anode has an EF &gt; LUMO; the Li+ or Na+ of the SEI layer is supplied by the cathode, which is an insertion compound of limited solid-solution range for Li or Na. These features limit the energy density of existing cells, which makes it difficult to develop a safe battery at an affordable cost for either powering an all-electric highway vehicle or providing storage for the grid of electrical energy generated by solar or wind energy. The PI proposes to develop composite membranes in which a solid-state component is embedded in a polymer having a LUMO &gt; EF of Li0 and/or Na0. These membranes may be designed to be either a membrane separator that blocks dendrites from an alkali-metal anode or a solid electrolyte of an all-solid-state battery. The membranes can be made at low cost with easy scale-up in size; they can be thin, flexible, and mechanically robust. The separator membranes contain a main-group oxide that blocks dendrites; the solid state component of the all-solid-state battery acts as a salt releasing the working alkali ion to the polymer component that conducts the ions in its dry state.</AbstractNarration>

A battery consists of one, several, or many identical electrochemical cells.

Electrolyte requirements are chemical and thermal stability of electrode/electrolyte interfaces, mechanical robustness of thin (&le; 30 &mu;m), large-area non-liquid electrolytes, and a high cation conductivity at 25&deg;C (&sigma;i &gt; 10-3 S cm-1 and preferably &sigma;i &gt; 10-2 S cm-1).              Several outcomes of our investigation of polymer-based solid electrolyte are summarized as follows.              Novel Polymer Electrolytes: We began by synthesizing cross-linked polyethylene polymer backbones with pendant molecules extending into the interstitial space that were free to swing, thereby allowing Li+ ions to move in an interstitial space that did not absorb an organic-liquid electrolyte. However, the Li+ conductivity &sigma;Li &gt; 10-3 S cm-1 was only achieved above 60&deg;C. Moreover, the all-polymer electrolytes did not have the required thermal stability, but they had the chemical stability for plating/stripping reversibly Li-metal anodes.              Dendrite-free Li-metal anodes: Although Li-metal anodes can be sued in a non-rechargeable cell, plating a Li-metal anode during a charge from a liquid electrolyte has led to dendrite formation, and the anode dendrites (whiskers) grow across the thin electrolyte to the cathode to create an internal short-circuit with incendiary consequences. We showed that this phenomenon occurs where the bonding of the electrode to itself is weaker than the bonding to the electrolyte. Dendrite-free plating of a Li-metal anode at a low impedance was possible with our electrolyte, so we investigated ceramic electrolytes of higher &sigma;Li that were sandwiched between thin films of our polymer-electrolyte. This configuration worked, but the resulting electrolytes were too thick.              Increasing thermal and mechanical stability: We increased the thermal stability and Li+ conductivity of our polymer electrolyte by introducing nanoparticles of the ceramic electrolyte into the polymer, but the Li+ conductivity remained too low. However, the composite polymer-ceramic electrolytes consisting of polymer-ion-ceramic could be fabricated as thin, mechanically robust electrolyte membranes.              Final success: With the advent to our laboratory of an amorphous ceramic electrolyte having a &sigma;Li &gt; 10-2 S cm-1, we have been able to use our experience with polymers to obtain a mechanically robust, thin electrolyte that meets all the criteria for an all-solid-state rechargeable cell, including a cycle life of over 10,000 cycles. The figure shows such a cell that is bent by 90&deg; lighting a red light-emitting diode (LED).       Last Modified: 11/16/2017       Submitted by: John B Goodenough]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
