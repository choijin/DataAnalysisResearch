<AbstractNarration>PI:  Peter LaFayette (University of Georgia)&lt;br/&gt;coPIs: Robert Stupar (University of Minnesota), Minviluz Stacey (University of Missouri), Thomas E. Clemente (University of Nebraska), and C. Nathan Hancock (University of South Carolina - Aiken)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soybeans provide the single greatest source of vegetable protein and oil worldwide, and uses of this important crop now range from human food to alternatives for petroleum-derived chemicals.  The goal of this project is to create molecular tools to make it easy for geneticists and breeders to identify and study the function of genes associated with desirable agronomic traits. The project will provide laboratory and field research opportunities for postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate students, including students from a predominantly undergraduate institution. In addition, yearly workshops will bring together soybean researchers from across the nation to participate in hands-on training in precision genomics and in screening plant populations to identify new traits of interest.  The resources developed by this project will advance soybean improvement, which in turn can lead to designer oils and proteins for healthier diets, industrial compounds, and biodiesel to meet a growing global demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will add to the current set of forward and reverse genetics resources available to the plant research community. A key activity will be to develop and characterize the publicly available soybean fast neutron (FN) mutagenesis population with a goal of attaining a biologically relevant amount of genomic coverage.  Concurrently, individual genes within FN deleted regions that alter traits of importance to the soybean community (e.g., yield, oil, protein, stress tolerance, and nitrogen fixation) will be mutated using CRISPER/Cas9 technology to pinpoint the genes responsible for specific phenotypes. In addition, a set of complementary, transposon-based mutagenesis populations will be made to specifically tailor gene discovery for the highly duplicated genome of soybean. TheTnt1 insertional mutagenesis population will result in traditional loss-of-function phenotypes, the Ac/Ds activation tagging population will cause gene mis-expression, and the mPing transposon will be used for both gene silencing and overexpression. These strategies are expected to result in recovery of novel phenotypes not previously observed in soybean.  Data, phenotypes, seeds and other information will be available via the project website at http://soymutants.uga.edu and at SoyBase.org.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to mutate a significant portion of the soybean genome to obtain mutants to determine the function of genes of unknown function, and mutants that could be useful in soybean breeding and genetics projects.   Because different ways to create mutations target different parts of the genome, fast neutron mutagenesis was complemented with transposons&mdash;these are genes that jump into other genes and disrupt them.  Specifically, the mPing transposon (ie, jumping gene) from rice, the Ac/Ds transposon from corn, and the Tnt1 transposon from tobacco.  The goal of the transposon work was to disrupt soybean genes.  The ensuing change in appearance or behavior of the soybean then indicates what it was the disrupted gene did.  Together this work has the overarching goal of providing a much-needed genetic resource to the soybean genetics and breeding communities.  Intellectual merit.  One goal was to use fast neutrons to generate deletions that cover 50% of the soybean genome.  Tens of thousands of fast neutron (FN) mutant lines were produced and screened.  Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) was performed to identify the deleted DNA, making it possible to identify the genes responsible for the more useful mutations.  In the case of transposon-based mutagenesis, the transposon itself serves as tag that is easy to find in the genome&mdash; and the tag is where the disrupted gene is.  The rice transposon was also modified to silence genes rather disrupting them.  Disruption does not work if genes are present in multiple copies, but silencing is not affected by the number of genes present.  Broader Impacts.  A Fast Neutron Core Collection (FNCC) of mutant lines was assembled, which consists of 422 lines with the most interesting mutations, and is available for distribution.
