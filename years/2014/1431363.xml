<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Prof. Pamela Smith, Ph.D student Pierre-Etienne Stockland will explore the development of etymological science with a focus on how the results of biological research on invasive insect populations have enhanced the state's capacity to respond to agricultural disasters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will culminate in a doctoral dissertation. Agricultural disasters have been an understudied type of natural disasters. The work will contribute to the growing interdisciplinary field of disaster studies.  The data collected from this project may be made available in the Academic Commons of Columbia University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Etienne Stockland  NSF Project Outcomes Report                 The NSF Dissertation Improvement grant helped fund one year of research in France for my doctoral dissertation, provisionally entitled "Insects, Anthropogenic Change, and Rural Environments in the Global French Enlightenment (1730-1815)."  This grant allowed me to conduct extensive archival research in Paris at the Archives Nationales de France, the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale de France, the Archives de l'Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, the Biblioth&egrave;que Centrale du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, and in departmental archives in Montpellier, Carcassonne, N&icirc;mes and Dijon.              My research has examined the myriad set of techniques that farmers, naturalists and state administrators developed over the course of the long eighteenth-century to manage the circulation of useful and harmful insects.              Normative protocols for classifying, depicting and observing insects, for instance, provided a set of "tools and techniques" for identifying and tracking useful and harmful insects across great distances. Administrative techniques for containing the movement of harmful insects such as quarantine, grain processing and fumigation developed at the intersection of science and statecraft, through the collaborative efforts of diplomats, state administrators, naturalists and chemical practitioners. The introduction of insectivorous animals into French colonies besieged by harmful insects was envisioned as strategy for restoring providential balance within environments suffering from human-induced disequilibria.              Finally, I have examined how rural environments in the south of France were reshaped by the introduction of commercially valuable insects from across the globe, such as silkworms and cochineal, as French naturalists, administrators and agricultural improvers sought to exploit the potential of these minute creatures for the purposes of agrarian and commercial improvement.              I have presented findings from this NSF-funded research at two conferences. In August 2014, I presented a paper presenting preliminary results of my research in Leuven, Belgium at the conference "Knowledge Networks in Rural Europe since 1700." In September 2015, I presented research findings at the European Rural History Organization's annual conference in Girona, Spain. I have also published or have had accepted for publication, four peer-reviewed articles in History and Technology, Archives of Natural History, Annales Historiques de la R&eacute;volution Fran&ccedil;aise and an edited volume that is forthcoming from Brepols.
