<AbstractNarration>As we enter what has been referred to as the Age of Big Data, experts speculate about the implications of shifting scientific paradigms and knowledge practices. This project explores the valuation of data and how new models of intelligibility and tools for making data coherent are being made and tested. This research, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirical fieldwork, examines specifically how astronomical data are produced, managed, and circulated.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Katheryn Detwiler, under the supervision of Dr. Hugh Raffles of the New School University, will explore how resources for optimal astronomical data collection are established, how massive datasets are produced and managed in practice, and the effects of these data as they circulate. The research will principally take place in the Atacama Desert, which hosts nearly two thirds of the world's infrastructure for astronomical observation. The researcher will detail the regulation of light and radio wave pollution in the desert and, at one of the Atacama's largest observatories, will inquire into the everyday work of transforming light waves into data. The project follows these data as they circulate to far-flung datacenters, valuable for the astronomical knowledge they generate and also as Big Data, a proving ground for new techniques of data management and interpretation. This study has two broad aims: 1) to develop an understanding of the contemporary Atacama Desert as a site of techno-scientific innovation; 2) to provide a detailed account of how narratives associated with the Age of Big Data relate to the ways actors conceptualize and work with massive data in lived, material practice. It proposes to study massive data through ethnographic methods analyzing the specific relations from which data emerge and those that data forge. The research will draw from the social study of science and technology, media and communication theory, the anthropology of value, and ethnographies of infrastructure and material networks. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would help contribute to understanding and improving upon how scientific data is disseminated to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Atacama Desert in northern Chile&mdash;the planetÆs most arid non-polar desert&mdash;contains more than half the worldÆs infrastructure for astronomical data collection. As Chilean filmmaker Patricio Guzm&aacute;n comments in his 2010 documentary, Nostalgia for the Light, "science fell in love with the Chilean sky." This doctoral research explores the historical emergence and multiple effects of the Chilean sky, fashioned as a resource for massive quantities of astronomical data. Working at the intersections of political ecology, media studies, and the ethnography of science and technology, the project details how the Chilean sky is enacted as a natural, media-rich ecology&mdash;awash with pristine data in the form of cosmic light&mdash;and is simultaneously produced as a technical environment to be measured, shaped, and optimized via the regulation of light pollution. The principal goal of this grant period was to conduct long-term ethnographic research on the production of the Chilean sky as a scientific resource and on the conditions and consequences of massive data production in ChileÆs Atacama Desert, leading to the completion of a dissertation.  The objectives of this research period were to ask: 1) What institutions, actors, and forms of expertise are invested in the cultivation of the Chilean sky as a natural&mdash;and national&mdash;resource, how is this work practically enacted, and what forms of value does this resource generate? 2) What are the concrete infrastructures and practices that facilitate the transformation of analog light waves into digital data at ChileÆs observatories and the movement of these data through and beyond the Atacama? How do observatory scientists&mdash;technicians, engineers, astronomers, and computational, software, and network specialists&mdash;describe the changing everyday work of astronomy in relation to the so-called Age of Big Data and its associated narratives of paradigmatic shift? 3) What is the information contained in the light waves from which astronomical data are derived and what does the process of translating them back into this information involve? What challenges of organization, access, retrievability, or interpretation arise, and what structures and tools are being newly invented to manage these proliferating data and confront these challenges?   Fieldwork was conducted in Atacama communities, scientific observatories, illumination design laboratories, and with scientists from a Chilean center for supercomputing, light pollution regulators, and state officials who manage the Chilean sky for science. The results of this research confirm that the production of the Chilean sky as a resource for astronomical data is a complex and concrete socio-technical process, shaped not only by the historical development of astronomical science and technologies but also by the evolution of Chilean and international politics over the past half-century. ChileÆs pristine sky is today seen by astronomers as vulnerable to the effects of light pollution and it is thus entangled with other forms of extractive industry in the Atacama, most significantly open-pit copper mining. Regulating light pollution through the transformation of desert illumination and communication infrastructures brings Atacama communities and industries into regular interaction with the scientific observatories in complex and uneven ways.  This study contributes to multidisciplinary thinking about resources, data, and value, about the "Age" of Big Data, innovations and transformations in astronomical science, and Chile's Atacama Desert. Though astronomical science has a potentially profound impact on ecological and ethical life, it is commonly seen as an abstract or speculative enterprise, remote from everyday human concerns. This study facilitates greater public understanding of astronomy as a practice, as a discipline in flux, and as a field that is more grounded in social life&mdash;in communities and ecologies&...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
