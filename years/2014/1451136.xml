<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to provide travel support for ten U.S. based junior researchers to attend the Workshop on Mathematical Biology and Nonlinear Analysis, which will be held at the Coral Gables campus of the University of Miami, December 19-21, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will focus on the applications of mathematical methods for studying nonlinear equations that model biological processes, especially in ecology, epidemiology, and evolutionary theory. The conference will provide opportunities for junior researchers to interact with leading researchers in these areas. The workshop will feature plenary lectures by leading scientists and will hold special topic sessions where researchers will present their ideas and results. One of the aims of the conference is to broaden the education and stimulate the research of junior researchers and those from underrepresented groups. NSF funding is vital in achieving this goal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to provide travel support to young researchers, that is, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, so they could attend the Workshop on Mathematical Biology and Nonlinear Analysis that was held at the University of Miami, December 19-21, 2014.  The purpose of the Workshop was to bring together researchers to exchange information about mathematical modeling of biological systems and processes and the mathematical methods from nonlinear analysis that are used to analyze the models. The funds provided travel support for ten young researchers.  At the Workshop there were 5 plenary talks of 50 minutes each and 48 invited talks of 25 minutes each.  The plenary speakers were William Fagan (University of Maryland and National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)), Suzanne Lenhart (University of Tenessee, Knoxville and National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS)), Simon Levin (Princeton), Paul Rabinowitz (University of Wisconsin, Madison), and Hal Smith (Arizona State University).  All of them are highly distinguished senior scientists. Professors Levin and Rabinowitz are members of the U. S. National Academy of Sciences.   The plenary and invited talks covered current research on a wide range of topics in mathematical biology and nonlinear analysis.  The exchange of information helped to advance research in those areas by the participants in general.  In particular, it provided the young researchers supported by the award opportunities to advance their research by hearing  about the current state of the art from top experts.  Approximately one third of the talks at the Workshop were related to epidemiology.  Exchanging information and advancing research in that area can improve our understanding of disease systems and hence  suggest strategies and improve decision making in public health.  Some of the other talks were related to topics in ecology which could be relvant to addressing issues of global change, sustainability, and biological invasions.  The Workshop contributed to the development of the scientific workforce by providing scientific information and networking opportunities to young researchers.  Out of a total of 79 registered participants in the Workshop,  31 were young researchers.  Among the 10 young researchers supported by the award, 5 were female, 2 were African American, and 1 was Hispanic.  (Some of them belonged to more than one of those categories.)
