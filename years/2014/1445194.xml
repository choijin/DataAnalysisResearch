<AbstractNarration>The project investigates how citizens formulate attitudes and make political choices when confronted with political upheaval. The study centers around understanding how Ukraine's citizens make election choices for president in the context of four institutional crises: (1) the weakening of ordinary channels of representation and the associated rise in protest activity and revolution; (2) the challenge that has been posed to Ukrainian national identity, territorial integrity, and statehood; (3) the forced choice between "Europe" and "Russia"; and (4) the failure or subversion of existing state institutions. To address these questions, a nationally representative panel survey will be carried out by Ukraine's premier survey agency, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS). The panel will consist of two waves, the first conducted prior to the May 25, 2014 presidential election and the second conducted immediately after it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the project are connected with its use of a panel survey to investigate questions related to protest and revolution, vote choice, and identity. The panel design will enable researchers directly to study patterns of change in individuals' dispositions during this highly uncertain period, to address issues in vote choice by measuring many dispositions both before and after a vote, and to study how voters choose strategically due to dynamics in the campaign and election. The study will also include set of embedded experiments, taking advantage of the opportunity to randomly divide the sample and ask different versions of the same question to the different resulting subsamples. This feature is particularly important in studying support for ultranationalist parties/candidates, the ability of external actors like Russia to shape Ukrainian preferences, and the impact of potent historical symbolism on attitudes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project are especially connected with its implications for foreign policy. Ukraine's crisis represents the most serious threat to European stability since the end of the wars in former Yugoslavia back in the 1990s, with some fearing it could spread to countries that are now in the EU and NATO. By shedding unique light on the public opinion dimensions of this crisis, especially by studying patterns of change at the individual level over time, the project will contribute vital information for American policymakers seeking to understand the crisis and develop better policy as well as for Ukrainians themselves.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The investigators worked with a leading Ukrainian survey research organization to conduct a nationally representative poll of 2,015 adult citizens of Ukraine (minus the Crimean peninsula) during May 16-24, 2014--right before the first presidential election after the February 2014 Euromaidan Revolution. This survey collected data on Ukrainians' perceptions of the country's post-revolution crisis as well as other views relevant to the upcoming election. The research team reinterviewed 1,406 of these same people again shortly after the presidential election, June 24 - July 13, 2014, to see how people actually voted and to take a new measure of their views and opinions in light of the ongoing crsis. A third and final wave of this "panel" survey was conducted during November 29 - December 28, 2014, after Ukraine's first post-revolution parliamentary election, successfully interviewing 1,373 of the original respondents to gather information on their voting paterns and more information on their views as the crisis continued through the end of the year. During the grant period, three of the investigators traveled to Ukraine, including eastern and western Ukraine as well as Kyiv, to observe the situation there first-hand and obtain information that would help in analyzing the survey results. The investigators have since that time prepared a series of papers and reports on the findings, presenting them in a number of forums in the US and elsewhere. One policy memo has been published in the PONARS Eurasia Policy Memo series and another piece published in a Washington Post blog using the fidings. Other papers are being prepared for submission to scholarly journals, taking into account feedback and suggestions obtained from prior presentations. Still other papers are planned for the year or two ahead.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/28/2015<br>      Modified by: Henry&nbsp;Hale</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
