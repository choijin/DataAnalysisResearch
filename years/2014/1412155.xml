<AbstractNarration>Much of modern astrophysics involves the interaction of electromagnetic radiation (light) with diffuse clouds of gas around stars, in galaxies and in the spaces between them.  The radiation interacts with the atoms in the gas, heats the gas and sometimes ionizes and excites the atoms.  The gas then emits light which, in turn, interacts with the gas.  The detailed physical processes involved in these interactions are enormously complex and vary with the gas' temperature, density and chemical abundance.  Understanding these processes and their interplay with the radiation allows astrophysicists to deduce the physical conditions in the gas clouds and the characteristics of the source of the radiation.  Dr. Ferland is one of the world's experts in the study of the interplay of light and ionized gas and for thirty years he has been developing an open-source, publicly-available computer simulation tool called "Cloudy."  Cloudy is used by hundreds of astronomers and astrophysicists in studies of diverse regions from star-forming regions to the light-emitting regions surrounding and excited by the supermassive black holes at the centers of active galaxies (Active Galactic Nuclei or AGN) and quasars.  Cloudy has been used in the training and research of several generations of students and young researchers. This award will support a major upgrade of the Cloudy code that will improve its performance and range of applicability.  The upgrade will potentially allow it to be used in simulations of gas in dense plasmas such as star-forming regions and will allow better calculation of the emission of light from gas near the heart of quasars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a time of unprecedented discovery in understanding the central regions of Active Galactic Nuclei and Starburst galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum. Reverberation mapping of the Broad Lined Region, using optical H I recombination lines at low redshift, and collisionally excited lines at high redshift, have led to catalogs of supermassive black hole masses. These in turn make possible investigations of key questions such as the evolution of black hole mass, the role of AGN feedback, and the interplay between the evolution of the black hole and surrounding galaxy. The Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) makes it possible to routinely study radio recombination lines from both AGN and Starburst galaxies, probing sources of ionizing radiation in dust-shrouded regions. ALMA can further probe molecular emission from both star-forming regions and the AGN molecular torus. This project will develop the theoretical tools needed to understand these emission-line observations and incorporate them into Cloudy, which has been designed to solve these plasma, chemistry, radiation transport, and dynamics problems simultaneously and self consistently, building from the foundation of individual atomic and molecular processes. The advances to be undertaken are motivated by recent discussions with the dense plasma / magnetic fusion communities. Methods and data they have developed will dramatically improve the numerical simulations at surprisingly low cost. These significantly improved simulations will be applied to models of the BLR, star-forming regions,and to associated molecular regions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  The goal of this project is to develop the tools needed to understand the message in astronomical spectra.  The essential problem, which touches nearly all of astrophysical spectroscopy, is that the gas has too low a density for thermodynamic properties to apply.  Rather, the ionization or chemical state, the internal level populations of atoms and molecules, the emission and heating due to grains, and the observed spectrum, are set by a host of microphysical processes in these highly non-equilibrium environments.  These atomic and chemical processes introduce a complexity to theoretical spectroscopy that is not present in dynamics or gravitational problems.   Cloudy has been designed to solve these plasma, chemistry, radiation transport, and dynamics problems simultaneously and self consistently, building from the foundation of individual atomic and molecular processes.  It is an ab initio calculation of the gas properties and its spectrum.  The full spectrum, with many thousands of observables, results from the specification of the radiation field and such cloud properties as the composition, density, and column density.  Cloudy correctly recovers all thermodynamic limits over an extremely wide range of gas and radiation density, which makes it suitable for application to a very wide range of astronomical problems, extending from the intergalactic or interstellar medium to dense envelopes near supermassive black holes.   We maintain the user group where people can post questions or share experiences.  There are now roughly 300 members with about 400 posts each year.  This provides the user community the opportunity to ask questions or discuss problems.  We also make twice-yearly requests for feedback to this group.  This includes requests for new features and comments about the current implementation.  As with any code, questions arise, and problems are discovered.   This community use is possible because the code is designed to do exactly what nature does, at microscopic levels, and to be autonomous and self-aware.  Our extensive test suite exercises the code over its full range of validity every time it is changed.  Cloudy should be able to converge any simulation you set up. The code will monitor the predicted conditions to identify any problems or contradictory boundary conditions. This is a core feature of the code and represents a great deal of effort.  The code is often used to generate large grids covering much of parameter space, perhaps involving many thousands of models.  It is not feasible to hand-tune each simulation or go over individual results to verify them. This does increase the work needed to develop the code, but also makes the code very user-friendly and is a major reason for its broad use.  Broader impacts: Cloudy summer schools were held in Leiden, Belfast, Durham, Warsaw, Pune, Shangdong, and Tonantzintla with a total of roughly 300 participants.  These provide a weeklong, hands-on, environment where graduate students and postdocs could develop physical understanding and run computer models that cater to their particular research interests.    Although over thirty papers were published over the course of this project, the capstone was the 2017 release of Cloudy (Ferland, et al. 2017, Rev Mex AA 53, 385); Cloudy is one of the more widely used theory codes in astrophysics.  The source code, the atomic/molecular database needed for it to function, and its documentation, are all openly available at www.nublado.org.  This site provides access to the current stable version, development versions, and all old versions of Cloudy.  The code was downloaded well over ten thousand times over the period of the previous grant and roughly 400 papers per year now cite its documentation.  The attached figure shows the growth of the citation rate.          Last Modified: 12/02/2018       Submitted by: Gary J Ferland]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
