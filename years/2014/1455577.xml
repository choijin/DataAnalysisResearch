<AbstractNarration>The results of this project will help to reduce the uncertainties in long-term climate prediction of the global-scale surface temperature and circulation patterns. Two high school teachers with backgrounds in advanced earth science and computer science, and two high school students will engage with the team to use and analyze climate science data sets.  The scientific objectives of this project are to advance knowledge of (1) how mid latitude waves and jets are linked to tropical and high-latitude processes, and (2) how the atmospheric jet variability influences Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), jets, eddies, and jet-scale overturning circulations. For the first objective, the investigation will be focused on how poleward heat transport by atmospheric waves is influenced by tropical heating and the background state of the atmosphere. The improved knowledge of the underlying physical processes can enhance understanding of the general circulation of both the atmosphere and the Southern Ocean. In addition, this knowledge can help us to evaluate how high-latitude surface temperatures and the Southern Ocean circulation, two of the most sensitive aspects of climate variability, respond to external forcings.</AbstractNarration>

The first objective was to advance our knowledge of how weather systems in mid-latitudes, particularly the jet streams and storms, interact with weather and climate conditions in the tropics and in the Arctic.

Planetary-scale waves, whose wave length is typically greater than the earth radius, have been regarded as being unimportant for transporting heat from lower latitudes to the Arctic. However, our findings indicate that these waves are far more important than shorter weather-scale waves that have been believed to be critical in transporting heat into the Arctic.

Regarding the second objective, the findings from this NSF project show for the first time the mechanism by which the fall season mixed layer depth (MLD) in the Southern Ocean responds to the previous spring?s atmospheric SAM. The spring SAM &ndash; fall MLD relationship is a manifestation of the reemergence of interior water mass anomalies that had been established during the spring time when the SAM signal is strong.     The results from this NSF award have been disseminated through 11 peer-review journal articles, 13 conference contributed presentations, and 12 invited presentations in various universities, government labs, and conferences. This NSF award also supported three graduate students? research activities at various stages, and helped two rural high school teachers to engage in research and disseminate the learning by developing new course materials.
