<AbstractNarration>Karst aquifers are an important groundwater resource, but they are vulnerable to contamination because of fast and complex flow paths arising from subsurface caves and large fractures. The complexity of karst aquifers has for a long time imposed challenges for researchers to characterize the groundwater flow system. This project will develop a new classification method for karst springs that will guide monitoring and pollution prevention strategies.  Based on water chemistry variability in response to storms, this classification will identify different sources of water and improve water capture area delineation.  The new classification system will be tested by revisiting a well-known set of karst springs that show variations in flow paths. Educational opportunities for students and for the general public are incorporated into the project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classification will be based on the shape of hysteresis plots and changes in hysteresis plots from storm to storm.  Storm hysteresis, defined as the difference in chemical trends at the beginning versus the end of a storm, offers opportunities to identify changes over time in water movement and storage in karst networks. The project will test two hypotheses.  (1) During a storm, hysteresis occurs as the water flows through the matrix and conduits, and (2) from storm to storm, the hysteresis pattern changes as the water capture area and storage zones change.  For example, Mg:Ca ratios in spring water increase with diffusive recharge but  decrease with more focused recharge through conduits, and hysteresis plots can show the timing of each type of recharge.  Automatic samplers and data loggers will be used during storms to provide data for hysteresis plots.  In addition to Mg:Ca ratios, Sr:Ca ratios, rare earth elements, stable isotopes, and carbonate equilibria will be examined and potential flow paths will be evaluated using groundwater models.  The combination of multiple natural tracers, modeling, and capture area calculations will help quantify behavior of karst springs and karst aquifers.  Ultimately, the new classification system will improve understanding of contaminant transport in karst systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A new classification system for karst springs using storm hysteresis  Laura Toran, Temple University, Department of Earth and Environmental Science  Ellen K. Herman, Bucknell University, Department of Geology  NSF1417447  Karst aquifers are important for groundwater drinking supplies, but they are vulnerable to contamination because of fast and complex flow paths arising from their characteristic caves and conduits.   Faced with the complexity of karst aquifers, it may be tempting to say nothing is predictable. This research offers new characterization techniques to help guide monitoring and pollution prevention strategies.  The approaches were tested by revisiting a well-known set of karst springs characterized by Shuster and White (1971).  The results of this project highlight variable flow paths and recharge patterns in these springs and are applicable to additional karst spring locations.    Intellectual Merit:   This project developed new classification techniques for karst aquifers using stormwater response to show how the timing of different source waters impacts flow paths.  The monitoring techniques included automatic stormwater samplers, dye tracing, and data loggers that can monitor water quality continuously.  Analytical techniques measured chemical parameters such as major ions, CO2, Mg/Ca ratios, and stable water isotopes, along with Ca/Zr ratios and rare earth elements (REEs) which have had limited testing in karst systems.  High resolution temperature data showed variations in storm responses (not observed with historic data) among springs. Variations in CO2 concentrations and Mg/Ca ratios provided indicators of fast and slow recharge and changes in flow paths. Field-deployed sensors tested in cooperation with National Energy Technology Lab (NETL) proved practical for measuring CO2 concentrations in spring discharge, and the data in combination with nitrate concentrations revealed different recharge pathways for different springs and under varying antecedent conditions in single springs.  Overall, some springs showed similar responses from storm to storm in a variety of variables and some varied.   At two springs, Ca/Zr ratios changed in response to storm intensity and declined as calcium-rich carbonate matrix water was displaced by zirconium-rich storm recharge water.  Thus, this ion ratio is a tracer for stormwater input that is easier to track than stable isotopes. Flushing of recharged storm water resulted in an increase in total REE concentrations at both springs, with the timing and magnitude of concentration increases determined by the degree of surface connectivity of each spring.  REEs and Ca/Zr ratios provided additional and complementary techniques to better understand transient recharge and flow behaviors in karst springs.    A computer model of flow and transport using both temperature and dye tracing provided constraints on karst network geometry. Single and overly tortuous conduit models resulted in dye concentrations above those observed as dye flowed back into the conduit from the matrix. A forked conduit model diverted flow from the main conduit,  improving both dye and temperature response to storm events.  This model explored the role of conduit and matrix interaction in contaminant storage.   Ultimately, this study showed that any classification of karst springs varies depending on the parameter monitored.  The combination of multiple natural tracers, continuous data logging, long-term monitoring, and modeling are needed to interpret karst spring discharge and provide sampling schemes for source water protection.     Broader Impact:  Results of this project were presented to an annual conference for practioners and regulators who work on groundwater problems, highlighting the importance of protecting karst resources.  Partnerships were formed with the National Energy Technology Lab (NETL) and other university researchers (University of West Virginia, Wheaton College, University of Florida, and Missouri State University) to share technique development and data.  A training workshop is being developed on use of loggers that will be recorded and posted online for wide dissemination.  One Ph.D. student was trained on the project. In addition, research projects for 8 undergraduate students were developed.  The undergraduate research team included 5 females and 1 minority student (African American).
