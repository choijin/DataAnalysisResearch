<AbstractNarration>Saint Anselm College is a small, liberal arts college in Manchester, New Hampshire participating in targeted big science with partners across New Hampshire and the world. A significant challenge for small institutions is providing access to major data pathways necessary to transfer key scientific data and share major resources at the capacity  demanded by today's scientific data sets.  This project creates a new network instrument - a Science DMZ to enable scientific collaboration and data sharing. These campus networking activities provide other small colleges and universities a road map for connecting small institutions to larger institutions in the New England region, across the US, and around the world to support research, teaching and learning with students of all backgrounds. The project broadens opportunities for individual and interdisciplinary scientific research, as well as all research occurring at Saint Anselm College.  This project is the key component in elevating research collaboration to the next level of connectivity and effectiveness for the Saint Anselm College scientific research enterprise. The implementation of a 10Gbps networking infrastructure connects Saint Anselm College with other established partner research universities in New Hampshire and around the world. The completion of a Science DMZ is expected to have an immediate and transformative impact on several representative science research areas actively in need of such support such as current research in the areas of: Lidar systems and analyses of hyperspectral data, chromosome evolution, variation in spicule network morphology in dorid nudibranchs, and chemical analyses to support archaeological field work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of the project was the creation of a true Saint Anselm College Science DMZ, providing the necessary network infrastructure and segregation of network traffic to connect Saint Anselm College science researchers, at 10Gbps, to established partners at larger research Universities as well as provide the capability for future collaboration with new partners regionally, nationally and internationally.  Most Science DMZ research design examples do not take into account the challenges that small institutions have that vary from those of larger institutions.  Our project collected the major aspects of design needs for small institutions and used Saint Anselm College as a practical example of how a Science DMZ could be implemented in the small institutional environment.  Design requirements included:  A high-speed data transfer network for science traffic should be segregated from the commodity Internet data flows to provide maximum throughput of data. Bandwidth, equipment and operational costs must be sustainable after completion of grant funding. The Science DMZ should bypass security technologies or bandwidth management tools that constrain the speed of data transfer. Secondary use of Science DMZ infrastructure for selected commodity Internet traffic during times of non-use can be considered as long as Science DMZ speeds can be maintained when required by the researchers. An increase in staffing in Network Services is unsupportable for the long term. A Data Transfer Node co-located in the largest Sciences building, Goulet Science Center, is acceptable as a first step but researchers want the research labs to be connected and dual homed to facilitate transfer of data files to the DTN.  10gbps is a reasonable goal but a segregated and dedicated connection at speeds lower than 10gbps is acceptable and a marked improvement over current capability.   There was significant interest and excitement amongst the researchers at Saint Anselm College during the information sessions and follow-up conversations.  The SDMZ opened up opportunities that were out of reach for most faculty given the institution's size and resources.  There was much discussion amongst the researchers about opportunities to be cultivated.  Work began almost immediately to pursue research grant funding and establish collaborative relationships with colleagues at larger research universities.  Unfortunately, grant funding and collaborative research arcs take time to bear fruit and most are currently still being developed.  We are currently realizing the results of this new opportunity in a few sciences on campus.  Some new research has emerged at Saint Anselm College because of the presence of a SDMZ and new research opportunities are being cultivated that would not otherwise have materialized.   One of the challenges of a small college SDMZ implementation, about which we were unaware, was that of changing the research culture.  Prior to the SDMZ, moving big data sets, images, etc. from national labs and R1 universities wasn't possible and, therefore, relationships with national lab colleagues and R1 universities were not effectively cultivated.  The NCE provided a year to change the research culture and is now bearing fruit as there is more interest and some active collaborations happening now.  The project has facilitated the establishment of a regional collaboration with Saint Anselm College and the University of New Hampshire in that the infrastructure created under the grant will be maintained and improved through the collaboration and used as a model to foster additional regional partnerships.   The regional collaboration born out of this project will undoubtedly provide an improvement in the accessibility of high speed data transfer to the region with potential impacts to public knowledge.  Research interests and the expanding opportunities provided through the SDMZ has changed research behavior, practices, and policies at Saint Anselm College with the expectation that future regional collaborations will continue to expand such changes in the region.  Our hope as we disseminate the results of this research is that this model will serve as a viable model for other small institutions of higher education          Last Modified: 06/28/2018       Submitted by: Adam Albina]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
