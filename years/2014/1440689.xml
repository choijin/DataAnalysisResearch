<AbstractNarration>This project, "CC*IIE Campus Design: Network Infrastructure for Improved Science Discovery and Education", provides a robust, responsive cyber-infrastructure which enables Earlham College science faculty and undergraduate students to engage more effectively and successfully in scientific discovery and education. Earlham is upgrading the cyber-infrastructure backbone connections of its entire Science Complex from 1Gbps to 10Gbps, adding a dedicated network for science research traffic, and correspondingly upgrading its Internet connection to I-Light, the regional optical network provider for higher education institutions in Indiana, providing high-speed access to Internet2. These cyber-infrastructure improvements remove the limitations that have stifled the effective use of data and also significantly improve the transfer of large datasets and the computational research being conducted by STEM faculty using both on-campus and off-campus resources. Research initially benefiting from this project includes collection of microbial DNA from local farm fields and soils covered by glaciers in Iceland, and computational topology calculations to identify potential anti-cancer drugs and classify protein structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlham College has a long tradition of undergraduate participation in research, both collaboratively with faculty and independently, and all science departments engage students in hands-on research within specific courses in their curricula. This project expands Earlham's ability to advance undergraduate science education specifically in the more effective use of computational resources both on and off campus. It exposes a greater number of undergraduate students to scientific research and discovery through hands-on research projects with faculty and through access to scientific resources and applications available through the research and education networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to provide a robust responsive cyberinfrastructure, which would enable Earlham College science faculty and undergraduate students to more effectively engage the world in scientific discovery and education by removing the limitations around effective use of data and remote applications.  The project focused on upgrading the complete path of the prior 1G network infrastructure from the Science complex wiring closets over the campus fiber network through the Information Technology Services Data Center out to I-Light, the regional optical network provided for higher educational institutions in Indiana.  The upgrade to the 10G infrastructure was completed in September of 2015 allowing the STEM faculty and students nearly a year to utilize the new infrastructure prior to the grant ending in September 2016.  The Cyber Infrastructure improvements enabled by this project have significantly improved the transfer of large datasets and the computational research being conducted by faculty in STEM disciplines using both on-campus and off-campus resources.  This project has positioned Earlham College to expose a greater number of Earlham undergraduate students, regardless of academic major, to the exciting world of scientific discovery and education through hands on research projects with faculty, and access to scientific resources and applications available through the research and education networks.  Earlham places high value on faculty-student collaborative research. Students are therefore being exposed to cutting edge technology in the classroom to help them learn and also getting hands-on experiences working with computer simulations, DNA sequences, and advanced visualizations &ndash; skills that will help them successfully compete in the graduate environment.  The improved network infrastructure has insured that these hands-on experiences can take place without being stifled, as was the case prior to the grant.
