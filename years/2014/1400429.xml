<AbstractNarration>This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "New Mexico Analysis Seminar 2014-2016," the next meeting of which will take place April 5-6, 2014, on the campus of the University of New Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Mexico Analysis Seminar is an annual regional conference serving the US Southwest that alternates venues between the University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University. The themes of the meetings scheduled for the period covered by this award are the following: harmonic analysis and spectral theory, with principal lecturer Sasha Volberg and with a special afternoon session honoring the contributions of Cora Sadosky to the discipline and featuring talks by Jill Pipher, Sergei Treil, and Svitlana Mayboroda (2014, Albuquerque); dispersive partial differential equations, with principal lecturer Monica Visan (2015, Las Cruces); partial differential equations and harmonic analysis, with principal lecturer Chris Sogge (2016, Albuquerque). The conference format provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
