<AbstractNarration>Mental trauma following disasters, military service, accidents, domestic violence and other traumatic events is a health issue costing multiple billion of dollars per year. Beyond its direct costs, there are indirect costs including a 45-150% greater use of medical and psychiatric care. While web-based support systems have been developed these are effectively a "one-size-fits all" approach lacking the personalization of regular treatment and the engagement and effectiveness associated with a tailored regimen. This project brings together a multi-disciplinary team of leading researchers in trauma treatment, facial analysis, computer vision and machine learning to develop a scalable, adaptive person-centered approach that uses vision and sensing to improve web-based trauma treatment.  In particular, the effort measures specific personalized variables during treatment and then uses a model to adapt treatment to individuals in need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core treatment design builds on well-established social-cognitive theory, where self-efficacy and physiological response are critical elements of recovery. The project measures these as well as engagement that is critical in self-directed web-based treatment. The modeling requires advances in computer vision and facial analysis to develop individualized models that can be computed with just a standard laptop. This project is the first effort to approximate changes in self-efficacy from sensory data. The effort uses and advances machine learning and domain adaption to support this approximation as well as to support the rapid personalization of models.  Building a smart system that empowers individuals by combining sensing and learning to improve web-based treatment offers a transformative approach to this national health need for cost-effective evidence-based treatment of trauma.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, the effort measures specific personalized variables during treatment and then uses a model to adapt treatment to individuals in need.  An important component was developing new and innovative strategies for facial analysis that could elegantly decompose the face into semantic "components". To this end we explored extensions to canonical component analysis &mdash; of particular note in this regard is our novel work on "Additive Component Analysis" (CVPR 2017), and then  "Deep Component Analysis" (ECCV 2018). This work satisfied an important practical consideration of the project &mdash; that is how to obtain semantically meaningful components through the application of constraints. A byproduct of this work was a new strategy for reinterpreting modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through the lens of component analysis.
