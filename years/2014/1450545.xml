<AbstractNarration>As the results of scholarly research in data-rich sciences, the growth of non-textual data, for example, numerical data, continues to expand.  This work explores through a prototype whether alternatives can be found to large centralized repositories of non-textual data that are easy to use, universal and low cost. The idea is to be able to access non-textual information as easily and readily as documents without laborious additional work.  The automatic creation of a number of indices would provide a mechanism to facilitate indexing and retrieval, such as done by internet search giants for text.  If successful, it will be easy to post numerical data and and have it be available via standard web search engines as easily as textual information is today.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will build a system using a wide variety of data sources and objects from a range of disciplines, and then design representations that specify the characteristics of non-textual data, including numerical data.   Next they will develop enhanced indexing capabilities to handle queries in an extended search engine and procures to annotate the data by each type.  After developing a query and interaction interface for developers and pilot users, they will test the viability of the approach and the effectiveness for creating descriptive additions for various types of data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Project Outcomes Report   Award Title:  EAGER: A Method to Retrieve Non-Textual Data from Widespread Repositories  This project sought to make it as easy for people to search for numeric information as it is to search for textual information.  It developed new, automated methods of representing and searching numeric scientific information, such as tabular data in scientific publications and spreadsheets in scientific datasets.  It investigated full-text search of tabular data extracted from scientific publications; federated search of multiple scientific dataset repositories; development of several table and scientific search services; and construction of a table search dataset that can be used by other researchers.  The work was done in cooperation with Elsevier, B.V. and the Allen Institute for AI.   Five prototype search engines and services were developed.  Elsevier Science Direct Search studied how to use the ElasticSearch search engine for tabular data.  NeuroScience Table Search used query classification to map queries to templates tailored for different types of queries.  Table arXiv used inference and knowledge resources to match abstract expressions in queries (e.g., ?force?) to specific units of measurement in tables (e.g., ?N? or ?Newton?).  A federated search engine provided a single search interface to six widely-used dataset repositories.  Tables Like This used an example-based approach to developing table search queries.  Collectively, these search engines tested hypotheses about how to represent the contents of tables in conventional search engines, enable people to describe their information needs, and accurately rank tables in one or a set of search engines.   Prior to the project, there were no widely-available datasets for research on searching tables of numeric data.  This project created Table arXiv, using tables extracted from Physics papers submitted to arXiv.org, a widely-used repository of scientific papers.  The dataset contains 341,573 tables; 105 information needs with full-text queries; and relevance assessments on a 4-point scale.  The dataset is freely available; no license is required.   Effective table retrieval is accomplished using structured objects that contain different types of information that describe a table and its surrounding context at different levels of detail, and that have query-independent quality estimates.  This information is both textual (for example, from table column headings, table captions, and related text) and numerical (for example, sets of values from within the table).  Natural language queries are transformed into structured queries that contain entity or noun phrase concepts that implicitly indicate quantity types.  Query expansion from a curated ontology bridges the mismatch between quantity types implied by the query (e.g., ?force?) and units of measurement likely to be found in tables (e.g., ?Newton? or ?N?).  A numeric table prior model biases retrieval toward tables that contain numeric data.  Contrary to initial expectations, we learned that numerically-derived information (for example, about maxima and minima, data ranges and accuracies) is considerably less important in characterizing tables for table retrieval than textual information.  All this information is incorporated into a probabilistic retrieval model that can be used with several widely-available full-text search engines.  Effective question answering from tables consists of two steps:  Find a relevant table (as described above), and then find the cell(s) within the table that answer the question (expressed in natural language).  Table cells containing answers are identified using a semi-structured feature-rich model for question answering that uses tables as background knowledge.
