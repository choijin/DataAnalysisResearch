<AbstractNarration>The project will investigate the ability of insects to detect and respond to infrared light, which is a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than that of visible light. It is known from insects as diverse as honeybees, beetles and butterflies that animals have evolved diverse strategies to perceive and utilize electromagnetic waves. Organs evolved for perceiving or controlling electromagnetic waves often surpass similar man-made devices in both sophistication and efficiency. To date, most of the focus in this area of research has been on the abilities of insects to perceive shorter wavelengths of light; much less is known about how animals respond to longer wavelengths, in part because the tools to investigate this end of the spectrum have only recently become commonly available. In this research, physicists and biologists will collaborate in studying a few model systems, including the antennae of moths and specialized wing scales of butterflies, to understand how insects can perceive and utilize infrared light. Understanding and harnessing natural design concepts through "biomimicry" will deepen our knowledge of complex biological systems and inspire ideas for creating new technologies. The research will provide training opportunities in nanotechnology for graduate students in biology and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to understand the physical mechanisms underlying the ability of insects to perceive and respond to infrared light, and to obtain engineering insights that can be used to create novel infrared materials, devices and systems. Infrared signals may play a critical and underappreciated role in a wide variety of insect behaviors. This project will provide a quantitative understanding of insects' abilities to sense and respond to broadband thermal radiation and narrowband fingerprint infrared radiation by analyzing two systems: (1) Scent pads and patches on the wings of butterfly species in the hyperdiverse tribe Eumaeini (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) that show extremely broadband, close-to-unity absorptivity/emissivity, and (2) Specialized sensilla on the antennae of different moth species that are able to capture infrared light with high wavelength-specificity and efficiency. The model insects will be studied using a multidisciplinary research platform. The infrared-sensing organs will be identified using single-sensillum electrophysiological recordings and behavioral bioassays with spectrally and temporally controlled infrared stimulation. The morphology of the infrared-sensing organs will be studied using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray micro-tomography. The optical properties of the sensilla will be studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, infrared microscopy, and finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic wave simulations. High-fidelity replicas of the infrared-sensing microstructures or their scaled models will be fabricated using nano- and micro-fabrication to systematically analyze how material properties, structures and arrangement of the sensilla affect the sensitivity and wavelength-specificity of infrared detection.  Detailed studies of the mechanisms by which insects perceive and respond to infrared signals have not been carried out before, and a greater understanding of this phenomenon is likely to catalyze a new area of research for the scientific community. The project will expand our understanding of how natural selection can shape exquisitely adapted behaviors and structures.</AbstractNarration>

Key scientific contributions made with this award include: (1) Fundamental understanding of the interaction between insects and their electromagnetic environment: how natural selection shapes exquisitely adapted micro- and nano-structures on insect cuticles to enable them to better control sunlight and thermal radiation (e.g., radiative cooling of butterfly wings, Saharan silver ants, and wild silk moth cocoons). (2) Discovery of novel sensing mechanisms that enable small insects to perceive light and heat (e.g., how butterfly wings can function as a distributed sensor network for fast detection of light and thermal radiation; how certain species of butterflies can see polarized light). (3) Establishment of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary methodology (encompassing microscopy, spectroscopy, thermodynamic experiments, multiphysics modeling, full-wave simulations, lab behavior assays, and field studies) to study the interplay between small animals and electromagnetic environment. (4) Invention of high-throughput and high-yield techniques to manufacture biomimetic materials that emulate the optical and thermodynamic properties of structures discovered on insects.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong> The PI accomplished many activities of education, outreach and technology transfer under the support of this award. The program provides a comprehensive training for graduate students in optical microscopy and spectroscopy, design and implementation of behavioral assays, multiphysics modeling, full-wave simulations, and fabrication of functional biomimetic materials. Two graduate students, Cheng-Chia Tsai and Norman Nan Shi, have been supported by the award. Cheng-Chia has published a second author paper in <em>Science</em>, and has a manuscript submitted to <em>Science</em> as the first author. Norman has published a first author paper in <em>Science</em>, and has another first author paper accepted by <em>Light: Science &amp; Applications</em>. The PI has incorporated selected results from this program into the courses he teaches. To support student participation of science and technology programs in the local community, the PI served as a judge for the Tri County Science &amp; Technology Fair in 2015, and taught several classes of preschool children at Les Enfants Preschool, Fort Lee, New Jersey, about the biology of butterflies and moths in 2016 and 2017 (Fig. 1).</p> <p>The program has yielded two technological inventions (one provisional patent and one PCT patent application). The PI&rsquo;s lab developed a biomimetic radiative-cooling roof coating that is able to substantially reduce roof temperature and thus electricity usage during the summer time. The PI received a seedling from the New York State to further develop and commercialize the roofing product. The PI&rsquo;s lab also developed a biomimetic radiative cooling fabric that offers a combination of cooling mechanisms (radiative, convective and evaporative cooling) and can be used to create ultra-thin cooling apparel and building materials.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Highlights of outcomes include:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1. We discovered that the construction of the butterfly wing as well as the nanostructured wing scales lead to a highly non-uniform distribution of radiative cooling; as a result, wing regions containing living cells have the lowest temperature (Fig. 2).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2. Through a series of behavioral studies on live butterflies, we discovered that butterfly wings can function as fast and sensitive sensors of temperature and light, and that butterflies use behavioral strategies to thermoregulate their wings within a suitable range of temperatures (Fig. 3). A paper summarizing 1 and 2 has been submitted to <em>Science</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3. We discovered that an Australian lycaenid butterfly, <em>Jalmenus evagoras</em>, can detect optical polarization. Our field studies indicate that <em>J. evagoras</em> prefer depolarized blue mock &ldquo;wings&rdquo; to polarized ones. Our spectroscopic measurements show that female <em>J. evagoras</em> possesses a lesser degree of polarized wing reflection than do males.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>4. We developed a multi-spectral imaging platform to rapidly screen drawers of museum specimens of butterflies and moths under several wavelength bands of illumination (Fig. 4).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>5. We discovered radiative-cooling nanophotonic structures on the Saharan silver ants (<em>Cataglyphis bombycina</em>). This work was published in Shi, Yu <em>et al</em>. <em>Science</em> 349, 298 (2015) (Fig. 5).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>6. We developed a technique to fabricate radiative cooling coatings that emulate the Saharan silver ants. We installed a ~4,000 sqft radiative-cooling roof and demonstrated significantly reduced roof temperature in the summer of 2017 (Fig. 5).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>7. We discovered that fibers produced by a wild silk moth (<em>Argema mittrei</em>) contain a high density of nanoscale air voids and possess excellent radiative cooling properties (Fig. 6). This work was accepted for publication in <em>Light: Science &amp; Applications</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>8. We invented novel fiber pulling methods that mimic the fiber pulling mechanism of the wild silk moth.
