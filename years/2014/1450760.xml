<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to characterize aerosol particles acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleating particles (INPs) during wintertime storms along the west coast of the U.S.  Specifically the researchers will participate in CalWater-2/ACAPEX field campaign with a combination of ground measurements at Bodega Bay, CA and airborne instruments studying the Atmospheric River (AR) phenomena and the impact of aerosols on wintertime precipitation in the Sierra Mountains of California.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;These ground-based and in situ airborne measurements will improve our fundamental understanding of the role of biological and other aerosol types in enhancing or suppressing orographic precipitation over the western U.S. during winter.  A variety of instruments will be used to directly and remotely measure these aerosols.  The results should aid the cloud microphysics community through improved understanding of ice formation in clouds at temperatures warmer than -20C.  This study will be conducted in collaboration with the Department of Energy (DoE) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) during the CalWater-2 field campaign.  The ground- and ship-based data will be combined with airborne data to develop a four-dimensional view of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and Ice Nucleating Particle (INP) concentrations.  Data sets will be integrated into a description of the influences of these aerosols on winter and early spring precipitation in the Sierra Mountains of California.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the training of Ph.D. students from two universities (Colorado State University and North Carolina State University) using advanced instrumentation including confocal fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.  With the ongoing drought in the western United States this study is both timely and critical in advancing our understanding of biological and other aerosol types on wintertime precipitation in the Sierra Mountains.  As a major source region of the U.S. food supply, an improved understanding of the role of these aerosols on wintertime precipitation has broad implications on the resulting spring and summer water management policy in California.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1">Wintertime precipitation represents the majority of the annual water supply for large portions of the western U.S. To first order, clouds and precipitation are controlled by large-scale influences, namely the frequency and strengths of extratropical storms approaching from the Pacific Ocean, including those associated with tropical moisture advected in &ldquo;atmospheric rivers&rdquo; (AR). However, where precipitation forms and falls to the ground also depends in part on the particles carried into the storm, which serve as the sites on which cloud water and ice crystals first form. The nature and abundance of these &ldquo;cloud-active&rdquo; particles may exert enough of an influence on the storm development that the amount of precipitation falling in a watershed is altered, with resulting impacts on regional water resources. Our project was part of a large, multi-agency and multi-platform field study that took place in January through March of 2015, CalWater-2015 / ACAPEX. Our team measured the concentrations and compositions of cloud-active particles arriving near the surface of the west coast of California, upstream of the Sierra Nevada Mountains which were the recipients of precipitation from developing storms.</p> <p class="p1">We received a supplemental grant to this project to make similar cloud-active particle observations over the Southern Ocean in March 2016, as part of a larger Australian ship-based campaign (CAPRICORN). Low, stratus-type clouds over the Southern Ocean are remarkably persistent and tend to be composed of liquid water, despite sub-freezing temperatures. Similar to the case for AR events in California, it is hypothesized that low concentrations of cloud-active particles, especially those that can initiate ice formation at temperatures warmer than about -20 ?C, inhibit the formation of precipitation, and hence controlling water cycling and the atmospheric radiation budget over this large but poorly-observed region of the globe.</p> <p class="p1">For both studies, our focus was the characterization of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in ambient air near the surface. We employed custom-built instrumentation and technologies that are able to detect INP among the total particles present, despite a relative abundance of about one INP per million total particles or lower. We were especially interested in determining concentrations of biological particles, since these have long been implicated as major contributors to INPs active at temperatures between 0 ?C and -20 ?C. For this purpose, we used a real-time bioaerosol instrument, and collected additional aerosol samples for DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing.</p> <p class="p1">During the Calwater-2015 study period, we observed one AR event which displayed distinct differences compared to clean marine sampling periods (FIGURE 1). We also observed one event of Petaluma Gap Flow, wherein air masses from the Central Valley are channeled toward the coast to be sampled at our coastal site, permitting characterization of Central Valley pollution particles.</p> <p class="p1">Our study was focused on collecting and processing data and archiving them for later use by other groups. However, two CSU Ph.D. candidates participated in fieldwork and conducted initial analyses that were included in their dissertations. We isolated clean marine periods during the Calwater-2015 study and compared the concentrations of INPs during those times with the observations from the remote Southern Ocean (FIGURE 2). The large differences reflect differences in source strengths of marine-derived INPs. Hence, all other conditions being equal, clouds in the Southern Hemisphere would form ice and precipitate more slowly than those over Northern Hemisphere oceans. Testing of such hypotheses, along with hypotheses on the controls of precipitation in CalWater AR events, will be conducted by collaborators using appropriate modeling frameworks. Our particle data are key inputs to those studies, providing important observational constraints on the particles that are allowed to affect cloud development in the models.</p> <p class="p1">Compiling field observations around the globe, we find that distinct differences in marine INPs are consistently observed between higher latitude Northern and Southern Hemisphere ocean regions (FIGURE 3, right panel). We also discovered through such analyses that periods of production of biological INPs can occur after heavy AR rain periods (FIGURE 3, left panel). This post-precipitation INP influence was found throughout the boundary layer in aircraft data, and was correlated with the presence of certain types of biological particles measured with our real-time bioaerosol sensor.</p> <p>We completed some initial work testing methods for identifying microbial composition in clean atmospheric samples. Initial attempts at amplifying and sequencing DNA in CalWater-2015 samples by a commercial laboratory failed due to low DNA concentrations. We thus developed a successful, higher-sensitivity in-house amplification method, and modified sampling methodologies to collect larger volumes of sample. Combined with an improved DNA extraction protocol these changes allow us to distinguish day-to-day differences in biogenic influences. The experience gained from this study has proven valuable in preparing for the upcoming Southern Ocean study, SOCRATES (early 2018), which seeks to address some of the same scientific questions as CAPRICORN but in a multi-agency, multi-institutional framework.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2017<br>      Modified by: Sonia&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kreidenweis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1450760/1450760_10351069_1511831850913_Fig1_Outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1450760/1450760_10351069_1511831850913_Fig1_Outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1450760/1450760_10351069_1511831850913_Fig1_Outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Representative normalized aerosol size distributions measured at the Bodega Bay Marine Lab during CalWater-2015, for meteorological periods classified as (upper plot) clean marine background and (lower plot) atmospheric river periods.
