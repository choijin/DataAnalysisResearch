<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercialization potential of this project is the increased access and independence for power wheelchair users in employment, educational, home and community environments. This will create a paradigm shift in how society views individuals using wheelchairs from confining to liberating products. There will be a significant cost saving to wheelchair users and third party funding agencies by avoiding the purchase of secondary products such as lifts and ramps. The power wheelchair market at $1.1 billion in 2011 is anticipated to reach $3.9 billion in 2018. Added to this, the additional cost for ramps, lifts and architectural modifications to provide wheelchair access in private and public settings exceeds $20 Billion. The results of this research will set a higher standard for wheelchair manufacturers to push innovation and to test products using the ANSI/RESNA Standards even during product development. Collaboration with academic institutions, Veterans hospitals and clinicians provides an interdisciplinary experience for engineering students. Opportunities to design and commercialize exciting innovative products such as this barrier-free wheelchair has the potential to encourage K-12 students to enter STEM careers that positively impact the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. Results of the research conducted will be disseminated through scientific and technical publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to test the feasibility and commercialize a power wheelchair capable of overcoming level changes in the environment that are 3? or higher without a ramp or lift. Although there are requirements for accessibility in public environments, it is not always done. In personal homes and private environments the cost to provide these adaptations is often limited. As a result power wheelchair users lose their independence and are greatly disadvantaged when they are confronted with changes in elevation. The focus of this project is to provide a solution for this immense barrier by designing a power wheelchair base capable of independently traversing changes in elevations, while maintaining all the seating, stability and maneuverability features. This unique design incorporates a three-axle base that transfers the entire power chair from one level to the other. In addition to the ability to ascend and descend elevations, it will offer users the ability to raise the seat to reach for items at standing height and lower the seat to enable the user to reach the floor. The results from this research will provide a transformational wheelchair that can adapt to the environment.</AbstractNarration>
