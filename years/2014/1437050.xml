<AbstractNarration>Presently, the majority of transistors that power microelectronic devices are based on silicon. While there have been significant increases in speed of silicon-based microelectronic devices in recent years, the speed at which silicon-based chips can operate is limited by the material itself, and in order to make faster devices a new semiconductor material is required. Germanium is one such promising material that can enable manufacturing of faster computer chips. One critical challenge in building transistors is the need for a good electrical semiconductor and a good insulator that is compatible with that semiconductor. To make germanium-based chips work, a good electrical insulator is needed. This award is to develop and understand a new type of electrical insulator that is compatible with germanium and which can allow for manufacturing of germanium-based microelectronics. The broader impact of the research will be in continued scaling of transistors to smaller sizes that will provide faster computer processor speeds, lower power consumption, and higher data storage capacities for microelectronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines perovskites for use as dielectric oxides in germanium transistors. Perovskites are selected for their ability to bond chemically to germanium and eliminate the electrical defects that affect device performance. This work will explore how to grow crystalline perovskite oxide films on germanium that meet the many performance requirements of modern microelectronic devices. The research explores an all-chemical growth process that should be scalable, is inherently less costly, and is based on current manufacturing tool infrastructure to promote easy adoption by industry. The research explores and describes the materials chemistry and the surface chemistry associated with growing crystalline SrHfO3 and SrZrO3 on germanium using atomic layer deposition processes. The overarching objectives are to understand and describe processes that lead to the formation of crystalline oxides on Ge (001) with requisite band offsets and interface trap densities in a chemical deposition process. The intellectual merits of the work stem from the specific focus areas of the fundamental studies which are: 1) elucidating the reactions and structural changes at the Ge (001) oxide interface that seed crystalline oxide formation; 2) understanding the evolution of structure in the perovskite layer leading to a crystalline film and how the structure depends on process conditions; and 3) establishing the structure-property-function relationships in the context of a gate oxide in a field effect transistor application.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The semiconductor industry is responsible for much of the world?s extraordinary economic expansion over the past fifty years.  Continuing the pace of growth and innovation will require discovery of new materials and electronic devices that operate ever faster and consume significantly less power.  This research project worked on the discovery of crystalline oxides known as perovskites oxides and the processes to combine these different oxide films into a single layer that enables the innovative devices to operate as predicted.  Perovskite oxides can be insulators in microelectronics transistors and this device provides a means to test film properties.    Most microelectronics devices are grown on wafers of crystalline silicon that have a very specific arrangement of silicon atoms.  Future microelectronics devices are likely to be grown on germanium and the requirements for silicon hold true for germanium.  For metal oxides integrated with germanium to function properly for the innovative device the oxide atoms must be organized into a single crystal layer that exactly matches with the atoms of the germanium on which the oxide is grown.  The atoms in germanium form covalent bonds that share electrons between adjacent germanium atoms.  While the atoms in an oxide form ionic bonds based on the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged metal ions and the negatively charged oxygen ions.  Therefore, special steps are needed to transition from covalent germanium atoms to ionic metal oxide ions while also keeping all the atoms precisely where they need to be.  Intermetallic compounds that bind to germanium and to oxides, and preserve the pristine chemical and structural features of germanium are employed to enable crystal growth.  These intermetallic compounds are named Zintl compounds after the scientist who first proposed them.  The atomically-thin Zintl compounds are generated by adsorbing one-half of an atomic layer of barium or strontium atoms on germanium and heating the germanium to form BaGe2 and SrGe2.  A perovskite metal oxide, such as strontium zirconate (SrZrO3), consists of layers of positively charged strontium ions bonded to oxygen ions and positively charged zirconium ions bonded to oxygen ions.  The positive and negative charges have to balance within the crystal and alternating layers of SrO and ZrO2 form.  Once the Zintl layer is grown on germanium, the strontium or barium atoms participate in the first SrO layer that deposits as the alternating layers of SrO and ZrO2 are added to grow strontium zirconate.   The studies explored how films assemble into crystalline layers and how the growth processes introduce defects into the films and at the interface.  Atomic-scale control of thickness and composition is critical since the oxide films grown on germanium need to be around 3 to 6 nm thick.  As a reference, the average width of a human hair is around 100,000 nm.  The studies explored metal oxide film growth using metalorganic molecules that react with the crystal surface.  This chemical approach, known as atomic layer deposition, affords a scalable process for translating the fundamental results into a manufacturable process.  Chemical routes to the growth of single crystal barium titanate, strontium-hafnium titanate, and strontium zirconate were discovered on germanium.  The research established the ways by which a BaGe2 Zintl layer directs the growth and how the Zintl layer affects the electrical properties of the oxides.  The electrical device performance metrics improve on published films because of the inherent properties of single crystal oxides and minimal interface defects.
