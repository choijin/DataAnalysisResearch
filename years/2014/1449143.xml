<AbstractNarration>The problems studied in  this research project  have as common theme the qualitative study of critical points of functionals arising from geometry and of their gradient flows. More specifically the principal investigator will continue to study weak solutions to a family of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) that are the sub-Riemannian analogues of the mean curvature flow PDE, the minimal surface PDE, and the conformal n-Laplacian.  The principal investigator will also  study a geometric function theory/nonlinear PDE approach to the boundary regularity of biholomorphic mappings between strongly pseudoconvex sets and pursue the study of extremal quasiconformal mappings in space. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both in the natural sciences and in engineering it is important to study equilibrium states of complex systems. Mathematics allows to model such states as critical points of energy functionals and to study their properties by analyzing certain differential equations associated to these functionals. The properties of the solutions to these equations depend on a 'background geometry' that models such real-life features as the non-homogeneity of materials, or the presence of constraints (such as in the motion of robot arms, etc. etc. ...). One of the most ubiquitous instances of such 'background geometry' is sub-Riemannian geometry, modeling spaces where motion is possible only along a given set of directions, as in applications to complex analysis, motion of robot arms and control theory,  quantum computing, satellites, quantum mechanics and in the structural functions of the mammalian visual cortex. The PI will pursue this work together with his students as well as his collaborators.  The study of sub-Riemannian geometry has been driven since its origins by "real world" problems and the PI lectures to a wide variety of audiences from the post-graduate level to the high school level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quasiconformal mappings are mathematical objects used to describe in a quantitative way,  distortions in the shape of space, beyond those given by rigid translations and dilatations. Partial differential equations are a useful tool to study such mappings and can be used to determine how similar or how different two different models for the shape of space can be.  The outcomes for the intelectual merit component of the project include  the development of new  techniques in the study of solutions of partial differential equations and of quasiconformal mappings in the setting of sub-Riemannian geometry.  This geometry can be used, for instance, to model the motion of robot arms, or some functionalities of the visual cortex. As a result of the introduction of such new techniques the PI and his collaborators were able to shed new light on longstanding questions in the field.     The outcomes for the broader impacts component of the project include the organization of a conference where junior researchers were given the possibility to disucss their work along with more established investigators;  and the organization of a workshop aimed at providing high school teachers with examples of how high school mathematics can be used to solve real-world problems, and how it provides the foundation for several college level courses.
