<AbstractNarration>This project will determine where and when short-lived fish and long-lived mussel communities overlap (biological hotspot) and how this overlap affects the amount and spread of nutrients in two rivers. Nutrients feed aquatic plants that support riverine food webs, and it is hypothesized that animal aggregations can influence nutrient pollution. Understanding how these types of biological hotspots interact will further our knowledge of river function and provide targets for river restoration. To understand the ecology of fish and mussel hotspots in rivers, the investigators will use complementary approaches including field monitoring, experiments, and mathematical modeling. In addition, the PIs will train a post-doctoral researcher and undergraduate and graduate students as well as organize outreach workshops for K-12 teachers to develop programs associated with water quality and ecosystem services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ecological processes that occur at animal aggregations (biogeochemical hotspots) are important for ecosystem health and can help mitigate nutrient pollution. Animal aggregations create patches where processes such as energy transfer and nutrient recycling are higher than outside of patches. Long-lived freshwater mussels live buried in the sediment in localized patches that serve as stable, long-term biogeochemical hotspots. In contrast, where shorter-lived, fish occur depends on flow conditions in rivers. Fish aggregations serve as mobile, widespread, short-term biogeochemical hotspots. This project quantifies the spatial and temporal overlap and interactions between mussel and fish aggregations in rivers. A field study will quantify fish and mussel abundance under different flow conditions in two rivers to determine patch size and location. A correlative field study will quantify ecological services performed by mussel and fish aggregations under low and higher flow conditions. Mesocosm experiments will use chemical techniques to track the movement of nutrients from fish and mussel aggregates through the rest of the food web. Lastly, computer models of ecosystem dynamics will be used to scale from fish and mussel distribution and flow data generated in the small-scale field study up to the whole river scale. A workshop will train teachers in water quality activities they can use in their classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, animals frequently occur in dense aggregations. Examples include herds of deer, schools of fish, flocks of birds, and beds of mussels. Research into the effects of these aggregations on ecosystems has typically focused on a single species or animal group. In stream ecosystems, fish and mussels have the strongest animal-mediated biogeochemical and ecosystem effects. Fish schools or mussel beds can increase nutrient concentrations, alter their ratios, increase algal growth, and affect the growth of aquatic insects. These effects have been investigated separately for each group, however, in most streams, dense aggregations of fish and mussels periodically overlap. Our research explored the ecosystem and biogeochemical responses when fish and mussel aggregations overlapped.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We investigated these responses with a field survey, field experiment, and several artificial stream experiments with the help of undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. In the field, we surveyed the abundances of fish and mussel species along the Kiamichi, Little, and Glover Rivers in Oklahoma and then scaled up their abundances to estimate their impacts on nutrient concentration and stoichiometry. We found that the abundance of fish on mussel beds was driven by hydrology, and that fish biomass on mussel beds was highest when the river flows were low. During low flow periods we found the overlap had the greatest impact on the modeled ratios of nutrients in those rivers. In addition to the hydrologic aggregation of fish on mussel beds, further field experimentation manipulating the density of mussels revealed that fish were attracted to the structure of mussel shells. Because mussel beds typically occupy areas of rivers where water is always available (even during drought), mussels may provide an important underwater landmark for fish seeking refugia that won?t dry out during drought. In an experimental stream, we simulated seasonal low flows, and showed that fish survived longer in experimental streams with mussels than those without. In addition, at extreme levels of low flow ? when streams and mussel beds dry out ? we found that mussel bed die-offs can have both short- and long-term influences on the ecosystem services of rivers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Along with this work, we manipulated fish presence on mussel beds. This work extended our understanding of the food web effects of overlapping fish schools and mussel beds. Importantly, our work highlights interconnections between animal and microbial ecosystems.
