<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to the University of Southern California for the support of the NSE Education Workshop to be held in Arlington, Virginia on December 11-12, 2014.  The workshop will be under the direction of Dr. James Murday and co-funded by the NSF Directorate for Engineering and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will address the challenges/opportunities facing nanoscale science/engineering education (NSEE) worldwide, with special attention to: a) an assessment of the global NSEE efforts to see what has been working best; b) the goal of scaling up availability/usage of the best NSEE resources, c) the symbiosis among NSE, information technology, biology/medicine, and cognitive processes (U.S. BRAIN1 and European Union Brain Project initiatives2); d) the NSEE Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) opportunities engendered by the newly released U.S. Next Generation K-12 Science Standards3; e) changing needs in the workforce as nanotechnology continues its rapid market penetration; f) the need and possible mechanisms for ongoing public education and engagement with nanoscale science, engineering, and technology; and g) roles for NSEE in broadening participation in the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will address the NSE needs for all the stages of education. This integrated approach is necessary since the stages of education are all interrelated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE)&mdash;the Next Steps workshop, held 11-12 December 2014, brought together experts from various global stakeholder communities, including representatives from schools and universities, various professional communities, industry, foundations, state/local education authorities, and pertinent international efforts.  The report identified a number of key findings that address the several stages of education (K-12, Community College, four year University/College, Graduate, Continuing and Informal.   Consideration of all the recommendations led to a number of key findings that cut across the stages (the following list is not prioritized):  &bull;  Identify, develop, and evolve the NSEE workforce skillset requirements (and the education stages necessary to acquire those skills).  &bull;  Review the existing NSEE efforts to identify and disseminate best practices. (As a start, the existing web accessible K-12 teaching aides have been collated in an Appendix)  &bull;  Identify, evolve, and/or develop NSEE materials with well-defined links to appropriate standards and curricula.  Additionally, promote that material scale-up and widespread use of those materials.  &bull;  Establish a central, searchable, e-portal that identifies and provides links to vetted NSEE materials, is readily accessible, designed for intuitive use, and sustainable.  &bull;  Develop a national network of regional education hubs that effectively utilize the diverse stakeholder communities, leverage national forums, and address the challenges identified in the other recommendations.  &bull;  Establish clearly defined, nanotechnology-enabled approaches toward the solution of societal Grand Challenges in order to engage students, underrepresented populations, and general public interest.  The workshop report was published in the Journal of NanoEducation 7, 1-63 (2015).  The workshop also led to a book published by Springer, Global Perspectives of Nanoscience and Engineeering Education, Ed Kurt Winkelmann and Bharat Bhushan.  The workshop report's recommendations were supported in the National Academies report Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative, released 6 September 2016.
