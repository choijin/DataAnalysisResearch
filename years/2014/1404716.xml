<AbstractNarration>Traumatic brain injury is a diverse and complex injury that affects 1.7 million Americans annually. Survivors frequently have permanent cognitive loss, behavioral issues, and emotional disturbances that affect them throughout their life. These life-altering changes are likely caused by damage to the cells of the brain that occur in response to injury. What remains unclear is how the behavior of brain cells is influenced by the events that occur during injury. To explore the response of brain cells to traumatic brain injury the research team has developed a novel bench top crash tester. Similar in concept to the full scale crash test systems used by the automotive industry, the bench top system will be used to apply impact conditions to populations of brain cells grown in the lab. The knowledge gained from this research program could help illuminate the poorly understood cellular changes that follow traumatic brain injuries and help guide the development of new therapies. The project will have broader impacts on neuroscience, biomedical engineering, and the healthcare field. The research will be complemented by integrated educational projects at the undergraduate and high school academic levels that are designed to motivate scientific participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astrocytes are ubiquitous cells throughout brain tissue that play an essential role in neuronal survival. Yet, the mechanobiology of astrocytes, and in particular how their neuro-supportive role is affected by the mechanical stimuli that are generated during traumatic brain injury is not well understood. This research program will explore the mechanobiology of astrocytes, and investigate the hypothesis that the neuro-degenerative extracellular matrix environment produced by astrocytes following traumatic brain injury is triggered by mechanical stimuli. To explore this hypothesis, the research team will employ a custom impact bioreactor and cell culture system to (1) precisely apply traumatic brain injury mimetic impacts to populations of astrocytes in culture and (2) concentrate and collect the soluble (growth factors and cytokines) and insoluble (extracellular matrix) molecules released in response to impact loading. An improved understanding of the relationship between impact stimuli and the production of soluble and insoluble molecules will help elucidate the role astrocytes play in the neuro-degeneration processes that follow traumatic brain injury.</AbstractNarration>

Negative changes to the physical and chemical properties of brain occur following head injury. In response to injury, the brain undergoes a scarring process somewhat analogous to that which occurs in other tissue (ex. heart). Termed a "glial scar", it is generally assumed that a certain cell type called astrocytes play an important role in scar formation, but the specific contribution of astrocytes to this process is not well understood. In this study we conducted experiments designed to test the hypothesis that impact forces like those experienced ding a brain injury trigger changes to astrocyte cells that could have negative implications for brain health. We further wanted to determine if the response of astrocytes to impact is dose dependent, and in particular does repeated impact exacerbate the injury.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To run these experiments we utilized a novel cellular crash tester that allowed us to apply impact forces to astrocytes cell grown outside the body (Figure 1). The findings of these experiments support the conclusion that the production of key molecules (growth factors and structural proteins like collagen) by astrocytes is significantly altered following exposure to impact. Notably these changes are generally made worse by repeated exposure to impact. The cell signally pathways that are responsible for these changes are not clear, and our attempts to examine one potential pathway (the TRPV4 receptor) are inconclusive, but suggest other as yet unknown pathways are involved. Recently collected data by our group probing the entirety of the signaling pathways in astrocytes may reveal new insights that could help guide the future development of TBI therapeutics. This work is ongoing.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have since developed a next generation brain on chip bioreactor that will be used during ongoing studies to explore the effect of traumatic brain injury on the blood-brain-barrier. When healthy, the blood brain barrier isolates the brain from the rest of the body as a protective mechanism. But following brain injury this barrier can be disrupted. This new brain on chip tool will allow us to better understand the mechanism by which the barrier is disturbed following injury and ultimately we hope to use it to explore treatment strategies. Additional advances in the field of biomaterials were made during the course of or study. In particular we developed a method to engineer threads built from the molecules secreted by astrocytes and other important cells (Figure 2). These materials could find applications in the field of tissue engineering and 3-D printing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Graduate and Undergraduate Training:</span></strong> The University of Arkansas College of Engineering is in the middle of a period of rapid growth.&nbsp; Freshman engineering enrollment has doubled from 350 students to nearly 800 students in the last decade. While the University of Arkansas is the state?s flagship campus (28,000 students), the School of Medicine and much of the state?s biomedical research is conducted in Little Rock at the campus of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). Little Rock is a three-hour drive from Fayetteville, and because of the geographical divide, our undergraduates have limited exposure to UAMS research. As a consequence, many of our students who are interested in gaining biomedical research experience are instead finding less specific research exposure in agricultural, chemical, or biological science labs. This project has provided biomechanics and mechanobiology research exposure to both undergraduate and graduate students, who otherwise may not have any. Specifically, the research performed during this project was the basis for two 2 masters theses and 1 PhD dissertation. Additionally the project has facilitated 5 undergraduate honors projects/theses.

Approximately 75 high school students have attended the Biomedical Camp during the last four years (Figure 2). We have worked hard to create a diverse camp. Half of the students have been female and approximately a quarter of the students come from underrepresented minorities. The camp is a highlight of the project and a great example of the broader impacts created by NSF funding.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/04/2018<br>      Modified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;C&nbsp;Wolchok</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404716/1404716_10322381_1541182155511_CampImage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404716/1404716_10322381_1541182155511_CampImage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404716/1404716_10322381_1541182155511_CampImage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Biomedical Engineering Camp</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeffrey Wolchok</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;C&nbsp;Wolchok</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404716/1404716_10322381_1541202130500_CrashTesterImage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404716/1404716_10322381_1541202130500_CrashTesterImage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404716/1404716_10322381_1541202130500_CrashTesterImage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cellular Crash Tester</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeffrey Wolchok</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;C&nbsp;Wolchok</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
