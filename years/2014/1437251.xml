<AbstractNarration>Abstract Title:&lt;br/&gt; DMREF: Collaborative Research:Design of next-generation catalysts through predictive modeling and atomic-scale experiments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalysts are the materials that allow the production of critical substances that make modern life possible.  Catalytic technologies make essential contributions to many sectors of the US economy, ranging from petrochemicals processing to pollution abatement in automobiles, and many products that are taken for granted in contemporary society would not exist without these crucial processes.  Traditional strategies for the discovery of new heterogeneous catalysts have relied heavily on chemical intuition and experience accumulated over many years of industrial practice, but to develop the next generation of catalytic materials, these strategies will be inadequate. The collaborative team of Profs. Jeffrey Greeley, Volkan Ortalan, and Fabio Ribeiro of Purdue University, and Chao Wang of Johns Hopkins University, have been awarded a grant under the National Science Foundation Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) initiative to develop a new strategy. The team proposes to make accurate predictions from a combination of experiments with atomic-level resolution and modeling using large-scale computing.  Such predictive techniques have been explored for simple classes of catalytic materials, such as highly ordered metal or oxide surfaces.  However, a much broader space of potentially exciting catalysts can be accessed by exploring so-called "multifunctional" materials, which offer complex interfaces between metals and oxides. The researchers will combine unparalleled atomic-scale experimental characterization, synthesis, and reactivity measurements to both inform the computational models and test predicted catalysts to emerge from the computational analysis. The proposed program will both lay the fundamental groundwork for accelerated identification of breakthrough catalytic materials, in general, and identify practical new catalysts for reactions with CO, CO2, and H2 as feedstocks, in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single component heterogeneous catalysts are constrained by inherent limitations in catalytic rates, as exemplified by the well-known maxima in volcano plots that have been observed for many catalytic chemistries.  The limitations can, in turn, be traced to an extensive series of fundamental correlations that exist between the energetics of elementary steps and species on the sites in question.  Multifunctional catalytic structures, such as the interfaces that exist between thin oxide films and metal nanoparticles, provide a potential means of overcoming these limitations and identifying entirely new classes of catalysts.  Developing a unified design framework for such multifunctional structures will require a combination of first principles molecular modeling techniques, advanced methods to synthesize and characterize the structure of catalysts at the atomic scale, and highly accurate measurements of reaction rates on the resulting materials.  The project team will focus on model reactions, relevant to hydrogen production and methanol synthesis, which can be promoted at multifunctional interfaces.  The team will develop new molecular modeling strategies, relying primarily on ab-initio methods, to rapidly evaluate the catalytic properties of many combinations of metal/oxide interfaces for the reactions of interest.  Promising candidates to emerge from these computational screening studies will then be synthesized using techniques that permit control of the catalyst structure at the atomic level.  The catalytic and structural properties of these catalysts will be verified experimentally at atomic resolution, and the resulting information will be used to improve the predictive models and to further refine the candidate materials.  The end goal is a method of broad applicability that can be used to design breakthrough multifunctional catalytic materials for a variety of reactions of scientific and economic importance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  Catalytic technologies make essential contributions to many sectors of the modern economy, ranging from petrochemicals processing to pollution abatement in automobiles. Traditional strategies for the discovery of new catalysts have relied heavily on experience accumulated over many years of industrial practice, but to develop the next generation of catalytic materials, predictive techniques that exploit fundamental chemical and physical principles are required. This DMREF project team has developed strategies to make accurate predictions of catalyst properties using a combination of large-scale computational modeling and experiments with atomic-level resolution. These techniques have been applied to an exciting class of heterogeneous catalysts known as multifunctional materials, which are composed of complex interfaces between metals and oxides. The project has both established the fundamental principles needed to elucidate the catalytic properties of such interfaces and facilitated accelerated identification of novel multifunctional catalysts for practical catalytic processes.     One of the central catalytic chemistries of interest in this work has been the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, in which carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O) are reacted to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2).  This reaction has applications to technologies ranging from purification of fuel cell feedstocks to biomass processing, and it is known to be strongly promoted at the interfaces between metal nanoparticles and the oxide supports on which those nanoparticles are typically immobilized.  The molecular details of how this interfacial promotion occurs are largely unknown, however, and a primary goal of this project has been to deduce these fundamental principles so that the metal/oxide interface may be optimized to yield desired catalytic properties.      Early work in the project established fundamental physico-chemical principles of how CO and H2O react at metal/oxide interfaces.  This work, which focused on both Au and Pt nanoparticles immobilized on model oxide supports, established that the metal/oxide interface dramatically lowers the barrier to dissociate water, which would otherwise be the rate-limiting step in the reaction network.  This discovery, plus other results describing how CO molecules accumulate and react near the metal/oxide interfaces (Figure 1), led to the development of simple and efficient rate equations for the WGS reaction, resulting in the identification of a descriptor, the dissociative binding energy of water at the metal/oxide interface, which can characterize reactivity trends in these and similar systems.      After establishing this key reactivity concept, effort shifted to understanding how systematic variations in the metal/oxide interface could be introduced to optimize the descriptor values and the associated catalytic properties.  One strategy was to determine how adding ionic dopants to the oxide supports could tune the electronic properties of the oxides and, thereby, influence the energetics of water dissociation and related descriptors at the metal/oxide interfaces.  The discovery of these fundamental relationships allowed the team to predict how the WGS reactivity would vary as a function of the type and position of the dopants, effectively introducing a new ?tuning knob? to control the WGS reactivity.  In a related activity, the group combined calculations and experiments to show how it was possible, by completely changing the chemical formula of the support oxide, to further improve the properties of Au nanoparticles for WGS (Figure 2).  The team predicted several novel supports, composed of complex oxides containing titanium and other elements, for WGS catalysts.  Finally, these efforts were extended to a completely new class of metal/oxide interfaces, composed of extremely thin oxide layers that partially cover metal substrates, yielding a successful prediction of a new catalyst composed of vanadium oxide on platinum that shows promising WGS properties in experiments.      Intellectual Merit: This DMREF project has deepened understanding of a new class of catalytic structures, based on synergistic effects at metal/oxide interfaces, and has led to both the discovery of new physico-chemical principles that govern the properties of such interfaces and practical strategies for exploiting these principles to design improved catalysts.  The WGS reaction has been the primary application of the efforts, but the principles are quite general and will, ultimately, be extended to other catalytic reactions that are preferentially catalyzed by metal/oxide interfaces, such as methanol synthesis and related chemistries.     Broader impacts: The project has resulted in the training of nine graduate students in state-of-the-art computational and experimental research techniques, most of whom have now graduated and continued to careers in academia and industry.  In addition, the project partners have been active in outreach, hosting a hands-on summer school for area high school students in the summers of 2015-18, and further hosting multiple economically disadvantaged high school students, as well as a female undergraduate researcher from a disadvantaged area of Chicago, in their groups for summer internships from 2015-2019.  One of these interns will soon start a PhD program in chemistry. The partners have also engaged in a comprehensive program of scientific demonstrations at local middle and high schools in their respective cities.
