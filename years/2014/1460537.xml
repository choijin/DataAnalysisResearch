<AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics at Seattle University will host the Seattle University Mathematics Early Research (SUMmER) REU site.  Ten students will participate in an eight-week summer research program each year.  The students will work in groups of five on one of two major research projects each summer.  Each research group will be led by a pair of mentors who will meet regularly with the students to provide guidance and feedback. The SUMmER program will encourage non-traditional, early career students to consider majors and careers in STEM fields.  The research projects will not require significant course experience so that research opportunities are made available to students from community colleges and primarily undergraduate institutions.  The diverse body of student participants will be reflected in the faculty leadership as well. In addition to having experienced faculty researchers from Seattle University and Pacific Lutheran University, groups will be led by instructors from local community colleges and high schools.  Each project will be led by two mentors in a team consisting of a less experienced research mentor and a more experienced mentor.  As such, this program will have the added benefit of training less experienced mentors to lead research groups at their home institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this REU is to empower student researchers who do not have access to research at their home institutions by providing a community of support that will stretch beyond the eight-week duration of the summer program.  Students will investigate original research problems in the areas of Combinatorics, Graph Theory, Knot Theory, or Geometry.  In addition to developing their technical mathematical skills, students will gain experience in presenting their work through both oral and written communication.  They will give regular presentations to the group to share their research progress, and the research mentors will support students as they prepare to present their work at conferences or at their home institutions after the REU program has ended.  Both research and communication skills will be invaluable to the participants as they become part of the mathematical community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From 2015-18, the Seattle University Mathematics Early Research (SUMmER) REU provided opportunities for undergraduate students to experience mathematical research for the first time.  Each year, ten students were supported by the grant for an eight-week summer research experience.  A key mission of the program was to broaden participation of student research in mathematics.  Of the students funded by the grant, 53% were women, 30% came from two-year colleges, and 30% were minority students.  Students performed research in Combinatorics, Geometry, Knot Theory, and Number Theory over the lifetime of the grant.  Their work has resulted in ten papers that have been published or accepted for publication in journals, including The AKCE Journal of Graphs and Combinatorics, The American Mathematical Monthly, Fibonacci Quarterly, The Journal of Knot Theory and its Ramifications, Math Horizons, Mathematics Magazine, The Pi Mu Epsilon Journal, and The Rose-Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Journal.  Each research group was led by a pair of mentors who met regularly with students to guide their research.  In addition to mentors from Seattle University, faculty from Bellevue College, Clover Park High School, Pacific Lutheran University, and the University of Washington - Tacoma led projects over the lifetime of the grant.  The mentors held weekly professional development meetings amongst themselves to help cultivate more impactful research opportunities across the Pacific Northwest that lasted beyond the REU.  The research groups gave weekly progress reports to their peers to help improve their public speaking skills. At the end of each summer, program participants took part in a joint symposium with a nearby REU at the University of Washington - Bothell, so that the students would have further opportunities to share their work.  After their summer experiences, students presented their work at regional and national conferences across the country, including the Northwest Undergraduate Mathematics Symposium, sectional meetings of the Mathematical Association of America, and the national Joint Mathematics Meetings.
