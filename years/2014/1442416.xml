<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to understand different mechanisms of integrating engineering content and standards into K-12 classrooms.  The project will use a mixed methods design incorporating multiple case studies and data sources to elucidate the strategies teachers use and the obstacles they encounter in addressing engineering standards in the K-12 classroom.  The project seeks to provide theoretical understanding of various methods of integrating engineering content into classrooms by working closely with teachers in custom-designed teaching laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project are to understand  various ways of integrating STEM content into K-12 classrooms and thus potentially broaden the pipeline into college STEM programs and STEM careers.  As more states integrate engineering into K-12 content and standards, this study which will elucidate effective means to support this integration has potentially broad impact.  The projects rigorous focus on a diverse cross-section of schools may help to make the results broadly generalizable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Overview: The project, PECASE: Implementing K-12 Engineering Standards through STEM Integration, was the Early Faculty Career Award for Dr. Tamara J. Moore. The goal of this project was to understand engineering integration in K-12 schools through a STEM Integration research paradigm. The project focused primarily on how K-12 standards, curriculum, teachers, and schools implement engineering in STEM integration learning environments. The project had two main threads of research related to this purpose: The Framework for Quality K-12 Engineering Education and the PictureSTEM curricula. The Framework for Quality K-12 Engineering Education was created to meet the growing need for a clear definition of quality K-12 engineering education. It was the result of research focused on understanding and identifying the ways in which teachers and schools were implementing engineering and engineering design in their classrooms. The framework was designed to be used as a tool for evaluating the degree to which academic standards, curricula, and teaching practices address the important components of a quality K-12 engineering education. The research from this thread included a design study on the development of the framework and an assessment of the engineering contained in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and state-level academic standards for all 50 states. Additionally, this framework could be used to inform the development and structure of future K-12 engineering education initiatives and related standards.  The PictureSTEM curricula (http://www.pictureSTEM.org) include an instructional unit at each grade level, K-2, which employs engineering and literary contexts to integrate science, technology, mathematics, and computational thinking content instruction in meaningful and significant ways. These transformative new models for STEM+C (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computational thinking) learning use picture books and an engineering design challenge to provide students with authentic, contextual activities that engage learners in specific science, mathematics, and computational thinking content while integrating across traditional disciplinary boundaries. These units have been classroom tested and research has been published and is ongoing regarding student learning and teacher implementation in the classroom. Intellectual Merit: This project advances pedagogical understanding about how to teach, assess, and evaluate STEM+C in an interdisciplinary manner and how to translate these evidence-based research findings into broad classroom practice through the framework and through curricular units. By researching the implementation of K-12 engineering standards, this project added to the theoretical basis for student learning in STEM integration environments. Through this award, Dr. Moore continued to develop her expertise in curriculum development and teaching STEM to underserved audiences. She was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2012 based on this work.

The research results from this project, the framework, and the PictureSTEM curricula each serve to inform practitioners, administrators, researchers, and policy makers who implement engineering standards.
