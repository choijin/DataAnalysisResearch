<AbstractNarration>In order to remain vital, the American economy must compete globally, attract investment, and create jobs.  This project will address the shortage of qualified STEM technicians and professionals in the nation's workforce by increasing the number of well prepared graduates with an Associate of Science degree with a focus on biology, chemistry, or mathematics or an Associate of Applied Science in engineering from Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College (A-B Tech).   The project will amass multiple stakeholders including faculty members and collaborators from public schools, 4-year institutions, and industry to serve a minimum of 134 academically talented and financially needy students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the project is to bolster student persistence and achievement through support services (co-advising, case management, tutoring, mentoring, and internships) and academic enrichment activities (seminars, service learning, college tours, and industry visits).   A secondary goal is to develop a viable and reproducible model for joint high school, community college, and university pathway efforts to address an increasing labor shortage of well prepared STEM technicians and professionals.  Formative evaluation will focus on student participation in student support services and engagement in enrichment activities (surveys and focus groups).  Summative data collection will focus on student persistence and completion information (mid-term and final grades, re-enrollment, and goal completion).  Dissemination of results will be achieved through presentations at the NC Community College Student Development Personnel Association and NC Community College System Office State-wide conferences and through the institution's AB-Tech Education Journal.</AbstractNarration>
