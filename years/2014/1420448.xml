<AbstractNarration>This broadening participation research project will contribute to foundational knowledge about how middle school students with learning disabilities can better learn science as they learn to create educational computer games. This research will contribute to the need to determine how to better educate these students studying science in our country.  There are approximately 2.5 million school-age children with learning disabilities in our nation's schools.  There is a pressing need to ensure that these students graduate high school as science literate individuals who can contribute to society, pursue college education, and advance in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) careers.  Gaining a better understanding of how students with learning disabilities learn science while creating educational games has the potential to lead to further basic and applied research which may ultimately improve how these students learn science and how teachers can improve their instructional practices to help students better learn science content and skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project leaders at George Mason University will investigate the effort attributions, self-efficacy and self-regulation processes of middle school students with learning disabilities in the areas of science learning and educational game creation.  Students with learning disabilities typically attribute their failures and successes in learning to factors that are external to them, rather than to their own efforts.  Using social cognitive theory as the grounding for their work, the researchers will conduct an exploratory study to examine two primary research questions: 1) How do student effort attributions for learning relate to their perceptions of self-efficacy for serious educational game creation and mastery of science content?  2)  Does intervention result in increased effort attributions that correspond with increased self-efficacy for both serious educational game creation and science learning?   During the first phase of this project students will participate in science learning and educational game creation activities.  During the second phase the first research question will be explored with a group of students to gain preliminary data.  During the final phase the second research question will be studied to gather information about the potential for future research about interventions affecting science learning.  At the completion of the exploratory study, it is anticipated that results will inform future basic and applied educational research about students learning to self-regulate their science learning in the context of educational game generation.   The results of this work are expected to be shared with education researchers and the public in professional publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Self-regulation is important for learning because it is the process that an individual uses to control one?s behaviors, emotions and thoughts in order to achieve a personal goal.  Students with learning disabilities are typically less able to self-regulate their learning and tend to have faulty beliefs about why they are or are not successful with learning tasks.  For this reason, this project?s exploration of the self-regulated learning characteristics of students with learning disabilities during a motivating learning activity--creating their own educational computer games, provided important insights into how and why self-regulation breaks down, how this affects learning, and where self-regulation supports may be most needed for students who struggle to learn.   Prominent theories of self-regulation indicate that student beliefs about their capability to succeed with a learning task (called self-efficacy) and their explanations for their performance (called attributions) play a role in continued self-regulation efforts.  Project findings suggest that there is a relationship between the attributions that students with learning disabilities make for their performance and their self-efficacy for learning, but only under specific conditions. The role of this relationship seems to diminish when (a) their self-efficacy beliefs showed they were overly confident about how well they were performing (called poor calibration), or (b) they believed successful performance was not worth the effort required to attain it.  Further, findings suggest that students who had accurate perceptions of their ability and who were generally positive (classified by researchers as optimists and realists) achieved better outcomes than students who had negative views of their proficiency (classified by researchers as pessimists).  Students who were optimists or realists created high-quality games; however, realists were more productive than optimists, creating games with twice the amount of content.  In other words, self-efficacy beliefs that varied based on novelty and/or difficulty of specific tasks corresponded to greater overall productivity.  Because content area classes often require long-term projects that inherently comprise numerous tasks that change over time, this finding has important implications.  These insights into unique characteristics of students with learning disabilities were revealed because in each year of the project, the explicitness of instruction in game design principles was increased to address the learning needs of participating students. By the final year of the project, we employed a self-regulated learning instructional approach to the initial game design model (that was initially conceptualized as a constructivist approach-- where students constructed their own learning). This increased explicitness was designed to mitigate any language processing issues of students and ensure that they understood the design process before beginning to self-regulate creation of their own games.  The result was an integrated series of lessons that created space for modelling, guided practice, and independent practice of both game design (emphasizing the integration of science content) and self-regulated learning strategies (specifically goal setting, self-evaluation and healthy attributions) prior to students beginning to create their own games.  Collective findings suggest that these self-regulated learning components better supported the targeted learners as evidenced by student games that were markedly better designed with more evidence of application of science concepts than during the previous years of the project. Although not the primary focus of the research, evidence emerged that computer game development contributed to STEM career exploration of participating students with learning disabilities.  This is an important finding because persons with disabilities are underrepresented in STEM fields.  We conjecture that conceptualizing and creating individualized computer games in group environments with peers may have encouraged students who believed they lacked the aptitude to pursue a STEM career.  Collective findings showed that science learning was not present to the extent that would justify the science class time needed to create the games; however, game development could be ideal as after-school or extracurricular options that allow a non-judgmental, low-risk learning space that fosters interest in STEM.  The project also had an impact on the development of human resources through research skills development of university students who collaborated on the project.  Doctoral students who worked on the project participated in numerous professional development opportunities to help them grow as researchers, including research ethics, data collection and management, and data analysis. They also gained a wide range of experience in all areas of the research process from conceptualization to dissemination of findings.  In addition, doctoral students had the opportunity to mentor undergraduates who participated on the project through REU funding.  Doctoral students and undergraduate students were carefully matched and activities were supported by the principal investigator on the project. Doctoral students reported that these mentoring opportunities helped them to grow as scholars.  All doctoral students who worked on the project are currently making contributions to their respective disciplines of science, special education, or educational psychology.  In addition, all funded REU students successfully completed their undergraduate degrees and are employed in STEM fields or are pursuing advanced educational degrees.
