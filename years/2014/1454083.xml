<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award funds the research activities of Professor Jared Kaplan at Johns Hopkins University.  Strikingly diverse topics in physics, ranging from the study of magnets to the dynamics of the strong force to the mysteries of quantum gravity, have been unified within a single framework: Conformal Field Theory (CFT).  Roughly speaking, CFTs are quantum theories that combine special relativity with scale invariance, or invariance under the uniform stretching of space and time.  The research funded by this award will use foundational principles to study CFTs and apply these discoveries to phenomenology, quantum gravity, and black hole physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By applying the bottom-up methodology of effective field theory (EFT)and the CFT Bootstrap to the study of holography, the PI will uncover the robust features of quantum gravity.  He will expand on nascent programs characterizing general holographic dualities in terms of bulk EFT, and universal long-distance Anti de-Sitter (AdS) physics in terms of the large spin CFT bootstrap.  He will adapt his expertise from the study of scattering amplitudes and the bootstrap to make previously intractable computations simple.  The relationship between CFT and canonical gravity in AdS will be investigated to develop a deeper understanding of the emergence of bulk dynamics.   New discoveries will also have significant payoffs for phenomenological models and for the broader understanding of Quantum Field Theory (QFT).  The study of EFT in AdS has motivated new techniques for the solution of approximately conformal QFTs, and these methods will be deployed in order to study theories of relevance to phenomenology and condensed matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific goals are to understand the space of well-defined local quantum theories of gravity in AdS, to perform new non-perturbative studies of physically interesting CFTs, to study the robustness of black hole thermality and the CFT data that encode non-thermal corrections, and to build concrete connections between the holographic CFT and older descriptions of canonical quantum gravity, such as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, in order to understand the interior of black holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  With help and input from students, the PI will develop his materials on the "AdS/CFT from the Bottom-Up" into&lt;br/&gt;extensive published course notes.  The PI will also develop footage leftover from the documentary "Particle Fever" into short films for the education of high school students and the general public.  This will provide the public and STEM teachers with&lt;br/&gt;pedagogical videos that convey the excitement and complexity of the scientific enterprise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       We have more experience with gravity than with any of the other fundamental forces.  But even though physicists have been studying gravity for hundreds of years, it remains a source of mystery.  Gravity is an extraordinarily weak force that is nearly impossible to study directly on the quantum level.  We can’t take a reductionist approach to gravity, like we do with the other fundamental particles and forces.  We can’t learn much about gravity using particle accelerators.    However, black holes provide a clue to studying quantum gravity.  The principles of black hole thermodynamics require that entropy is not proportional to the volume of a black hole, but to the area of its event horizon.  If black holes are described in terms of areas instead of volumes, it suggests that we should think about laws of physics in terms of areas as well.  Stunningly, this means that a theory of everything should play out in fewer spacetime dimensions!  This is the principle of holography, which has been central to the research sponsored by this grant.    My work has addressed several questions about holography and black holes:   Intuitively, it seems very obvious that the world is not two-dimensional -- after all, we certainly do not live on the surface of a table or a sheet of paper!  So how does our usual three-dimensional world emerge as an approximation from a two-dimensional description?  How can holography be consistent with the other known laws of physics?    Our work has shown how the interactions of different particles and fields, such as those that we see in the standard model of particle physics, can in fact be derived or "reconstructed" from a lower-dimensional theory.   How general is holography?  Is it a very special feature of string theory, or a more robust principle, analogous to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics?  Our work has shown that holography is an extremely general idea, and that the idea that a three-dimensional world can emerge from a two-dimensional theory isn’t as shocking as it may first appear.  We’ve argued that many features of holography are quite universal, and only depend on symmetry principles and quantum mechanical consistency.   What happens to matter and information that falls into a black hole?  To understand black holes, we need a quantum theory that goes beyond Einstein’s General Relativity.  Holography provides a hint, but to understand black holes directly we must "decode the hologram".  Our work has shown how to perform this decoding, with unprecedented precision -- all prior work made certain approximations that we were able to bypass.  This made it possible for us to precisely characterize how spacetime itself can "break down" due to strong quantum gravitational effects and high energies.      With support from this grant, we have also produced three short films on quantum gravity, cosmology, and the laws of physics:  "Why is Gravity Different?", "Did the Universe have to be the way it is?", and "How the Big Bang Governs the Texture of the Universe".  These will be available for viewing by the general public.  I have also delivered public lectures on fundamental physics, which can be found on various scientific and video hosting websites.
