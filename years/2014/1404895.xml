<AbstractNarration>The Bridger Formation (~49 Ma) in southwestern Wyoming is ideally situated for examining paleobotanical and climate changes in the Eocene.  While this formation has played an important role in the understanding of extinct mammals and reptiles, the abundant fossil plants have been largely overlooked, despite their potential for documenting the environment.  The Bridger fossil flora provides the opportunity for unusually complete reconstruction of the original flora, because it preserves all plant organs including leaves, wood, flowers, fruits, seeds, and pollen.  The fossilized plants will be examined to assess the species composition, paleoclimate, and paleoecology with a combination of botanical, paleontological, and geological approaches.  These results will be compared to other Eocene floras from the greater Rocky Mountains and west coast of North America.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;     This work is important because the Bridger flora likely has many species that evolved and contributed to the modern vegetation of western North America.  In addition, this work will document vegetational changes in response to climate shifts.  Research results will be presented at upcoming conferences and published in appropriate journals in addition to engaging the greater public with a free lecture in Wyoming near the field site.  A website will also be created for regular field and lab updates.  Co-PI Allen will design a small, temporary exhibit showcasing the Bridger flora for display at the Florida Museum of Natural History and will continue to serve there as a volunteer interpretive guide.  Allen will also mentor an undergraduate to provide him/her an opportunity to gain real research experience.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examined a fossil flora from the Blue Rim area of southwestern Wyoming. This lower Eocene deposit (~49 Ma) in the Bridger Formation preserves all plant organs including fossil leaves, wood, and reproductive structures. The Bridger Formation is well-known for its vertebrate fossils, especially a diverse assemblage of mammals, but this research was the first thorough look at the fossil plants. Each floral organ was examined and sorted into morphotypes (generally equivalent to species). The leaves included at least 69 dicotyledonous angiosperm (flowering plants) morphotypes; a few of the leaf taxa are shared with the regional flora (e.g., Green River), but others are new or previously unrecognized species. One of the most abundant leaf fossils found at Blue Rim is the climbing fern <em>Lygodium kaulfussi. </em>The most common angiosperm leaf taxa included <em>Populus cinnamomoides </em>(related to living poplars) and <em>&ldquo;Serjania&rdquo; rara </em>(in the Sapindaceae or soapberry family). More than 30 flower, fruit, and seed morphotypes are also preserved at Blue Rim. Some of these have been matched to a corresponding leaf type. An extinct species of date palm, <em>Phoenix windmillis, &shy;</em>was recognized based on flowers with <em>in situ </em>pollen. At least 19 angiosperm families are represented at Blue Rim including Anacardiaceae (sumac family), Salicaceae (willow family), Platanaceae (sycamore family), and Fabaceae (legume family). The wood is the least diverse macrofossil with only seven types including a single specimen of Pinaceae (pine family). Conifers are otherwise absent in the macroflora. However, conifers are present in the dispersed palynoflora (pollen and spores), indicating that they existed in the regional flora even if they were not growing locally at Blue Rim 49 million years ago. In the latest Early Eocene, the Blue Rim area included a diverse forest of trees, vines, lianas, and understory plants.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>The leaf fossils were used to estimate the climate conditions at Blue Rim in the latest Early Eocene. The results suggested that mean annual temperature ranged from 13-20 &deg;C (55-68 &deg;F; across three stratigraphic horizons), whereas estimates for mean annual precipitation varied from 130 to 200 cm (~51-79 in). These estimates, in combination with the taxonomic composition (e.g., palms) of the flora, suggested warm temperate to subtropical conditions. This is similar to areas in southern China and Madagascar today.
