<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this project are the identification and pursuit of emerging areas of applied analysis, motivated by contemporary issues in imaging and materials science at the core of advances in high-end technology and of national scientific importance.  The two main topics of the project are&lt;br/&gt;(1) the mathematical study of modern semiconductors and nano structures, of pivotal importance in microelectric and optoelectronic technologies, such as reflective or anti-reflective coatings for optics, the fabrication of layers of insulators and semiconductors for integrated circuits, quantum well lasers, and&lt;br/&gt;(2) the analytical investigation of image segmentation and inpainting and recolorization for color images, fundamental to the advance of computer vision, medical imaging, film restoration, and scanning probe microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;Postdocs and graduate students are trained in the course of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Common features of the projects include the treatment of energies that involve terms of different dimensionality.  These often exhibit a large range of length and time scales, higher order derivatives, and discontinuous underlying fields.  Such features prevent the use of well understood functional analytic frameworks, they escape traditional mathematical theories, and they require state-of-the-art techniques, creative ideas, and the introduction of innovative mathematical tools.  The investigator and her collaborators use new and recently developed methods and a deep articulation of ideas in the calculus of variations, geometric measure theory, and nonlinear partial differential equations, to address problems that include in topic (1) epitaxy and the formation of quantum dots, the onset and propagation of dislocations, homogenization of composite materials, and in topic (2) signal denoising and detexturing, dejittering, inpainting, and recolorization.  These topics offer new opportunities for the integration of applied analysis in research and in the education of advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, thus allowing for the training of a new generation of applied analysts at the forefront of contemporary mathematics as it interfaces with materials and imaging sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview. The objectives of this project were twofold: 1) the identification of emerging areas of applied analysis, using tools from the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory, directed to interdisciplinary challenges at the interface of mathematics with materials and imaging sciences; and 2) the training of a new generation of applied analysts at the forefront of contemporary mathematics, well prepared to respond to mathematical opportunities in those areas of research.  Intellectual Merit. The two main themes of this proposal were: 1) Variational Problems in Materials Science; and 2) Variational Problems in Imaging Science. Common features prevent the use of well understood functional analytic frameworks, they escape traditional mathematical theories, and require state-of-the-art techniques, and the introduction of innovative mathematical tools.  Highlighted contributions to 1) include:  Epitaxy: We proved that nucleation of dislocations is a mode of strain relief for sufficiently thick films, and that dislocations migrate to the film/substrate interface and the film surface relaxes towards a planar-like morphology.  The study of motion of curved dislocations in 3D showed that in core-radius, cut-off regularized simplified elasticity, the force on a dislocation curve by the negative gradient of the elastic energy asymptotically approaches the mean curvature of the curve as the cutoff radius converges to zero. The methods developed are a blueprint for the more physical setting of linearized isotropic elasticity.  Homogenization and Pattern Formation: Domain formation was studied in membranes near the onset of instability. The analytical results indicate that, within a sufficiently strong interspecies surface tension and a large enough sample size, raft microdomains are not formed.  Homogenization and Phase Transitions: The integral representation of the limit energy of a family a nonlocal second order Cahn-Hilliard-type singularly perturbed family of functions was identified. The kernels considered include those leading Gagliardo fractional seminorms for gradients.  A representation formula was obtained in the context of the gradient theory for fluid-fluid phase transitions with small scale heterogeneities. This lead to the first homogenization result of the ?planar metric problem?, which searches for the large-scale behavior of the distance function to planes in a periodic Riemannian metric.  Homogenization and Relaxation: Relaxation of functionals when the admissible fields satisfy first order linear systems of PDEs constrains, were obtained. The homogenized energy density was identified when the energy densities oscillate periodically.  The global method for relaxation in the framework of the space of special functions of bounded Hessian, BH, was introduced, extending to second order derivatives the tools introduced previously by the PI and her collaborators for first order energies. This method was applied to second order (defect) structured deformations.  The homogenization of quasicrystalline functionals was obtained. They serve as inspiration for understanding symmetry, connecting a number of distinct fields of mathematics.  Regularity: Regularity results were obtained for solutions of an optimal design problem involving quasiconvex bulk energy densities and surface energies.  Highlighted contributions to 2) include:  Recolorization: A variational model for imaging denoising was proposed, combining Meyer's ?u+v? decomposition with a chromaticity-brightness framework. The novel techniques used are likely applicable to other functionals with linear growth defined for maps taking values on certain compact manifolds with boundary.   The study of a variational model for the reconstruction of damaged color images was undertaken, in particular in the case where only finitely many colors were admissible for the reconstructed image.  Learning Training Schemes: The Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation scheme with weighted underlying metric was investigated. The identification of its asymptotic limit plays a crucial role in machine learning training schemes in image denoising.  A bilevel training scheme was used to provide a unified approach to standard regularizers. Optimal parameters and regularizers were identified via machine learning schemes, and the existence of a solution for any given set of training imaging data was proved.  Broader Impact. This project has the potential to impact on neighboring disciplines through collaborative research (over 30 collaborators from Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, UK, US), through lectures and special courses (over 42), and via publications (over 20).  The impact on the workforce derives from the postdoctoral training and Ph.D. supervision that were at the core of the PI's activities. Five Ph.D. students were (partially) supported under this grant, resulting in 3 graduations with placements at Edge Case Research, Squarespace, First Medical Center of Chinese People?s Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing (China), with a fourth upcoming graduation in May 2021, and the fifth expected for May 2022. Two postdocs were funded by this grant, the first for three full years (currently on tenure track at Radboud University (The Netherlands)), and the second for two years (currently applying to a tenure track position).
