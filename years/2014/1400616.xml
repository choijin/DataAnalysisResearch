<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2014. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Natalie J. Nannas is "Engineering a Synthetic Centromere for Artificial Chromosome Segregation in Maize" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Georgia and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. R. Kelly Dawe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing world population demands new technologies for crop improvement and production. Introducing a few transgenes into agricultural plants have helped combat pests and increase yields, but traits necessary to meet future demands will likely require large sets of genes not easily introduced by current methods. Synthetic centromeres make artificial chromosomes a viable strategy for introducing whole genetic pathways without disrupting the native plant genome and efficiently segregating all traits together. Training objectives include plant genetics and genomics, and plant molecular and cellular biology. Broader impacts include increasing undergraduate minority participation in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) through collaboration with the Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP). A workshop series will be created on finding summer research and funding opportunities, applying and interviewing for graduate school and medical school, and exploring STEM career options. Recruitment programming will be developed for the University of Georgia's Freshmen Orientation and Fall Activities Fair, including an advising seminar on offered science majors and recommended introductory courses. A tutoring, mentoring, and study group network will be established through LSAMP and will be available to support students in STEM courses. Undergraduate students interested in research will be encouraged to participate directly in this work; students will be trained and mentored while conducting their own independent projects related to the synthetic centromere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artificial chromosomes are an emerging strategy to stack transgenes, but due to epigenetic complications, these constructs lack reliable centromeres, DNA elements on which kinetochores assemble and direct accurate segregation of chromosomes through cell division. This project aims to engineer a "synthetic centromere" capable of autonomously segregating an artificial chromosome in the agriculturally important plant, maize. A synthetic centromere will be created by artificially localizing kinetochore proteins to a specific genetic location; kinetochore proteins will be fused with various DNA-binding proteins and expressed in lines that carry an array of binding sites. To assess the functionality of the synthetic centromere, a live imaging system will be developed to measure the currently unknown dynamics of chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. The synthetic centromere will be compared to natural centromeres in its ability to assemble a kinetochore, attach microtubules, correct improper attachments and segregate a chromosome.  The synthetic centromere will also be assessed for its ability to heritably mark the site of kinetochore assembly through multiple generations.</AbstractNarration>

Introducing a few transgenes into agricultural plants have helped combat pests and increase yields, but traits necessary to meet future demand will most likely require large sets of genes that cannot be easily introduced and manipulated by current methods. Artificial chromosomes are an emerging strategy to introduce and carry many transgenes within plants, they have difficulty assembling a functional kinetochore. Kinetochores are protein structures that connect chromosomes to the segregation machinery that pulls chromosomes apart in cell division. Kinetochores are built on a region of the chromosome called the centromere, but plant artificial chromosomes carrying centromere sequences do not assemble kinetochores. It is thought that epigenetic modifications are needed for to assemble a kinetochore on a centromere. I proposed to bypass these complications and engineer a synthetic centromere in the agronomically important plant, maize. To achieve this goal, I proposed the following aims: 1) establish a live imaging system to observe and assess chromosome segregation, 2) engineer a maize synthetic centromere via targeted tethering of kinetochore proteins and characterize kinetochore protein interactions, and 3) cytological and genetic characterization of the synthetic centromere construct.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>:</p> <p>Engineering a functional synthetic centromere in maize will significantly alter the landscape for genetic modification of plants. Previous attempts create artificial chromosomes have failed due to epigenetic regulation of centromere function, inability to directly assess chromosome segregation, and lack of understanding of kinetochore structure. Throughout this fellowship period, significant progress was made towards engineering a synthetic centromere. Aim 1 was successfully accomplished; I established a system to live image chromosome segregation. Previous studies could not directly measure how chromosomes were segregated, so I created a system in which chromosomes and their segregation machinery, the spindle, where fluorescently labelled and could be observed using microscopy. The protocol for imaging live cells was published and made available to others (Nannas and Dawe 2016). Using this system, we were able to image live division and characterize the dynamics of natural chromosome segregation (Nannas et al. 2016). We also discovered a novel mechanism for how chromosomes are separated (Nannas et al. 2016). This system can now be used to test artificial chromosome segregation as well as study other questions of chromosome and cell division, as we did with a known mutant (Higgins, Nannas and Dawe 2016). Aim 2 was partially completed; I investigated the interactions between known kinetochore proteins and conducted a screen to identify novel kinetochore proteins. We are following up with these results, as it will be necessary to recapitulate these interactions on a synthetic centromere. Also within Aim 2, I engineered a synthetic centromere made by tethering a specific kinetochore protein. The tethered protein did not assemble a full kinetochore, so I redesigned a new tethered protein based on studies in other systems. Aim 3 involved testing the function of the synthetic centromere; we tested a first trial but it did not assemble a full kinetochore. We are currently testing our second trial with redesigned tethered proteins and we will soon know if we have successfully engineered a synthetic centromere capable of segregating an artificial chromosome.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p>I am passionate about teaching and promoting equal access to educational opportunities for under-served groups.

I also engaged in one-on-one mentoring through LSAMP, mentoring undergraduate students both in and out of lab.

At the end of the fellowship, I fulfilled my long-term career goal by accepting a tenure-track position at a small liberal arts college.
