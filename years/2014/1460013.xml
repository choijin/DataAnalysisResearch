<AbstractNarration>During the last 30 years, the world economy has seen unprecedented economic growth in a group of 'emerging countries'. During the same time period, these countries have accumulated positive net positions in safe financial assets. This award funds research in macroeconomics that builds and analyzes a new model to investigate how the resulting increase in demand for safe assets from emerging countries affects macroeconomic stability. This includes effects on both industrialized nations and emerging countries.  The research also considers whether this change in the demand for safe assets increases the need for macroeconomic policy interventions. The project will advance science by helping us understand the role of banks in issuing liabilities and the mechanisms behind the sever employment consequences of financial crises. It will advance national prosperity by providing new insight into whether or not policy interventions are desirable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model has financial intermediaries playing a central role in the intermediation of funds from agents in excess of funds (lenders) to agents in need of funds (borrowers). In this process financial intermediaries issue liabilities and make loans. Bank liabilities are held for insurance purposes by other economic sectors; they affect individual economic decisions when these decisions involve significant risk. When the banking sector expands, agents in the nonfinancial sector hold more financial assets, are better insured, and are more willing to engage in economic activities that are individually risky but desirable in the aggregate. As a result, the economic grows.  However, there is a downside.  In the process of issuing more liabilities, the intermediation sector becomes exposed to liquidity crises. Therefore, there is a trade-off for policy between the benefits of an expanded financial system and the costs of greater financial and macroeconomic instability. The project studies the desirability of policy interventions in the presence of this trade off.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research work done during the last four years has resulted in four publications, two papers under revise and resubmit and few working papers. Before summarizing the content of the research underling these papers, I describe first the common features that link them together.  Capital market frictions are central to the analysis of these papers. The way capital market frictions affect the economy is by limiting the insurability of risks. This is different from other studies where financial frictions act primarily through the availability of credit. Another common feature (common to some of the papers produced under the funded research), is the central role played by banks. The research activity addresses theoretical and policy related questions. Some of the research activity is explicitly directed at studying some policy issues.  The main findings reached so far can be summarized as follows.  1. Banks play an important role for the performance of the macro-economy, not only through the provision of credit (the typical credit channel) but also by creating financial assets through the issuance of liabilities (bank liabilities channel). This is a new channel that has not been fully explored in the macro-finance literature prior to this research project.  2. The role of banks in the economy depends also on the degree with which they are financially interconnected. Interconnectivity is measured by the cross-ownership of bank assets (assets issued by banks and held by other banks). The study shows that, while interconnectivity mitigates the risk of an individual bank, it may lead to more risk for the whole banking sector, which ultimately increases macroeconomic instability.  3. The government could also create financial assets by issuing public debt. However, whether the financial assets created by the government have positive effects on the macroeconomy depends on the way the interest burden of public debt is financed. If financed with the most common taxes, the creation of financial assets with public debt has negative macroeconomic effects.  4.

Cross-country financial integration plays an important role in affecting the incentive of governments to default and this has important macroeconomic spillovers to other countries. Macroeconomic spillovers are key for understanding why creditor countries have an incentive to bailout defaulting countries.  5.

Finally, using the basic idea underlying the work described above, the research funded by the grant also shows that expansionary monetary policy in advanced economies could have negative consequences for emerging countries.  Intellectual merit of the results. The main findings of the research activity is to show that financial market frictions are important for explaining: (1) The emergence of fnancial crisis; (2) The cross-country (international) transmission of crises; (3) The role of banks and other financial intermeidaries in creating the conditions for financial crises and their transmission to the real economy; (4) Why governments could default on public debt even if the debt is held by residents; (5) How monetary policy in industrialized countries affect emerging economies.   Broader impact of the results. The broader impact derives from showing the importance of the financial sector for various aspects of macroeconomic performance. This calls for a greater integration of financial and macroeconomic studies. Before the 2008 crisis, there was limited dialogue and interaction between researchers in macroeconomics and in finance.
