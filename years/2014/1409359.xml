<AbstractNarration>Dust in the atmosphere has important impacts on clouds, precipitation and climate.  This is due to how the dust interacts with cloud particles and solar radiation.  One of the dustiest places on Earth is the Atlantic Ocean just west of the Sahara Desert.  A number of researchers have studied the effect of this "Saharan Air Layer" on tropical cyclones and other cloud systems.  However, research under this award will look at the issue in reverse, asking the question:  How do clouds and precipitation affect the Saharan Air Layer?  The importance of this work is the discovery of how dust is transported and redistributed by clouds and precipitation, which may have a significant impact on climate.  The removal of dust from the atmosphere through precipitation may also impact ocean fertilization.  In addition, the research will provide training opportunities for the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of the project is to study how convection impacts the temporal and spatial distributions of dust through cloud processing and transport.  The amount of dust and the impacts on the Saharan Air Layer will be assessed through a combination of regional cloud modeling, existing aircraft data sets and existing satellite data sets.  The research team poses three main scientific questions that will be addressed in this award:  1) Relative to pre-storm amounts, how much dust is removed from the atmosphere and deposited to the ocean through the action of precipitating storms?  2) Where do convective storms preferentially redistribute dust in the atmosphere, and how is the vertical distribution of dust changed by the passage of convective storms?  3) What are the potential effects of the removal and redistribution of dust on ocean fertilization, and the impacts on direct and indirect radiative effects both locally and downstream of the storm development?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project linked cloud information from modern weather satellites and state of the art dust profile information from a polar orbitting satellite to determine the amount of Saharan dust that storms across the tropical Atlantic remove from the atmosphere and loft to high altitudes.  The results show conclusively that that tropical storm systems significantly increase the amount of dust deposited in the ocean relative to clear sky conditions.  Carefully examining several case studies reveals that the passage of large, organized tropical storms and hurricanes remove up to 80% of the dust they encounter as they pass through the Saharan dust layer.  Subsequent statistical analysis of all storms observed in the four year period from 2007-2010 indicate that, on average, storms are responsible for 15% of the dust deposited into the Atlantic ocean as it passes from Africa to North America.  Since iron contained in this dust supports plankton growth, these results suggest that periods of frequent storm activity may promote periods of enhanced ocean biomass.  Dust layer height information supplied by CALIPSO lidar measurements also show that storms can lift a small, but measurable amount of dust from the main Saharan air layer to higher altitudes.  Dust was observed to be lofted as high as 12 km above sea level after the passage of a storm and storms were found to loft an average of 2% of the total dust mass in the Saharan air layer to altitudes higher than 6 km.  These dust particles may serve as surfaces on which ice crystals can form.  Ice clouds trap thermal radiation enhancing the atmospheric greenhouse effect with potentially significant impacts on the Earth's climate.  Besides furnishing a better understanding of what happens to Saharan dust after it leaves the African coast, the project supported a graduate student throughout her Master of Science degree and generated three peer-reviewed publications and several conference presentations that document the results.
