<AbstractNarration>Vitamin B12 and nitrogen are nutrients critical to phytoplankton growth. Since B12 is produced solely by bacteria, phytoplankton must acquire their B12 from bacteria. Nitrogen is used to produce the amino acid methionine and B12 is required by the enzymes that form methionine. Methionine is the precursor to the algal metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Bacteria degrade this compound to the climatically-active compound dimethylsulfide (DMS). Subsequent DMS transfer into the atmosphere is considered a significant driver of cloud formation and a possible climate feedback mechanism. DMSP can also be degraded via a secondary pathway to form methylmercaptopropionate (MMPA), which is not released to the atmosphere. Consequently, DMSP formation and the extent of DMSP degradation to DMS or MMPA are susceptible to B12 availability. Nitrogen availability influences this effect by controlling methionine production. Thus, the overarching premise for this study is that B12 availability regulates oceanic DMSP and DMS formation, and is synergistically impacted by nitrogen limitation. By providing a mechanistic understanding of relevant biogeochemical parameters this study will significantly improve the incorporation of sulfur-related microbial processes into climate models. Undergraduate students from the College of Charleston and College-partnered summer research programs will participate in the project, providing them with real-world examples and understanding of traditional biogeochemical and modern genomics-enabled research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine established biogeochemistry-based measurements with cutting-edge metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics techniques in laboratory and field studies. Culture experiments will examine the interactive effect of B12 and nitrogen availability on DMSP formation in several ecologically-relevant phytoplankton taxa. Second, the microbial degradation of DMSP and DMS in relation to B12 availability will be examined using several environmentally-important bacteria and archaea. Finally, field studies will examine the seasonal variability of B12, DMSP and DMS, and the relative importance of DMS and MMPA formation in the South Atlantic Bight. Gene and protein expression will be assessed at each level of this study to identify gene products, metabolic pathways, and cellular mechanisms underlying the interconnections between B12, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles. The results generated will have a major impact on current understanding of the role of B12 and nitrogen on the DMSP and DMS cycling, as well as the potential role of these stressors in global climate change. In addition to providing evidence for microbe-based mechanisms behind the modulation of oceanic DMS, this project will (1) furnish an explanation for "summer DMS paradox", thus having significant implications for the development of future DMS models, (2) assess the interactive impact of B12 and nitrogen availability on intracellular DMSP production and (3) provide insight as to whether B12 may play a far more critical role in modulating climate feedback mechanisms on phytoplankton productivity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project fell into two main categories:  1) the first major goal is to elucidate the impact of vitamin B12 and nitrate availability of the production of the algal osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in several model phytoplankton species using a combination of traditional biogeochemistry and molecular biology approaches along with state-of-the-art transcriptomics and metabolomics techniques.  2) the second major goal is to examine the impact of vitamin B12 and nitrate availability of the production of DMSP in mixed phytoplankton communities from two contrasting environments, namely coastal/shelf waters and oligotrophic open-ocean waters.     To address the first goal, a series of laboratory experiments was conducted to examine the short-term impact of nitrogen and vitamin B12 deprivation on DMSP formation in 3 contrasting model phytoplankton species, namely the diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana, and the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi (CCMP 374).  These species were selected because they possess differing abilities to handle nutrient limitation.  The results of the experiments revealed that short term (&lt; 96 hours) vitamin B12 deprivation had no effect on the major osmolytes and RNA transcripts examined in each of the model species.  Conversely, the analyses revealed significant changes to the major osmolytes, namely increases in intracellular DMSP, and RNA transcripts in response to nitrogen limitation over the same time period.  These findings will have important implications for our understanding of the cellular-level responses of these organisms and modelling the formation of DMSP.     To address the second goal, a series of field experiments was carried out during the expeditions in the South Atlantic Bight to examine the short-term impact (&lt; 48 hours) of nitrogen and Vitamin B12 additions on DMSP and DMS formation in natural marine microbial communities.  Surface seawater for the incubation experiments was collected at a (mid-shelf) coastal site near Gray?s Reef, Georgia USA, and at an offshore oligotrophic site in the Sargasso Sea.  Throughout the course of the field experiments, vitamin B12 had little or no effect on DMSP levels associated with particles, DMSP dissolved in the seawater or DMS in the seawater.  Since the experimental communities were not axenic, which provided a natural source of vitamin B12 for the phytoplankton component of the microbial community, they do not appear to have been B12&#8209;limited or co-limited.   In general, DMSPp concentrations increased immediately upon the addition of nitrate but appeared to be caused by increased phytoplankton biomass (Chlorophyll a )rather than increased biosynthesis of DMSP by the phytoplankton (as measured by DMSPp:Chl a ratios). Moreover, since the experiments were conducted on a relatively short time scale (2 days), the observed changes in DMSPp:Chl a ratios were unlikely to have been caused by shifts in the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton community.  The most plausible explanations are an increase in Chl a levels and a decrease in DMSP levels resulting from an alleviation of oxidative stress caused by nitrogen limitation. These findings will have important implications for the development of biogeochemical modeling of DMSP and DMS in the global sulfur cycle.     This grant has provided direct financial support, training and/or resources for 4 undergraduate students, 2 College of Charleston Honors College students and 6 graduate students:       Last Modified: 09/24/2020       Submitted by: Peter A Lee]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
