<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp; Mechanisms B program is supporting the research of Professor Etienne Garand of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Professor Garand will use cryogenic ion infrared predissociation spectroscopy to characterize reaction complexes present in catalytic water oxidation reactions.  First, a methodology will be developed to isolate catalytic reaction complexes generated under realistic electrochemical conditions as well as by controlled gas-phase reactions.  The structures of these isolated complexes will then be characterized in detail using a method based on a unique combination of mass spectrometry and vibrational predissociation spectroscopy.  Subsequent studies involving systematic variations of the catalyst structure will reveal the influence of ligand environment and metal center on the nature and electronic structure of the reaction complexes.  The active control of the solvent network in promoting processes such as proton coupled electron transfer will also be probed in detail.  The methodology developed here will allow for precise and systematic spectroscopic characterization of reactive species, providing a detailed description of the molecular level interactions involved in the water oxidation process and elucidating their relationship with the catalyst structure. Lastly, the results from these studies will also provide stringent benchmarks for theoretical methods used to understand the mechanisms of such molecular catalysts.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will improve our understanding of the mechanism of catalytic water oxidation reactions, which will help the development of more efficient water oxidation catalysts.  Water oxidation reactions play a significant role in the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy.   Professor Garand will also initiate educational projects that interweave research and teaching.  To demystify mass spectrometry for the general audiences, Professor Garand will develop demonstrations based on a mechanically rotating saddle analog of the Paul trap and a mass-selective quadrupole trap for macroscopic particles. These interactive apparati will illustrate basic concepts in mass spectrometry such as ion trapping, mass selection and collision activation. They will be integrated into a general chemistry class and distributed more broadly through online videos.  Such visual and hands-on demonstrations of the concepts of mass spectrometry will have the potential to engage the interest of the general public and undergraduate students, providing them with a deeper understanding and appreciation for the sciences behind these widely used instruments.  Professor Garand will also provide initiation to research for undergraduate students through integrated research in classes and summer internships.  Such experiences can provide the students with a well-rounded educational experience as they decide their future paths.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this grant is to characterize reaction intermediates directly relevant to the multistep catalytic reaction in which a water molecule is converted into oxygen (a water oxidation reaction).  This reaction is crucial in realizing artificial photosynthesis.  In our work, we combine the selectivity and sensitivity of mass spectrometry with the precision of infrared laser spectroscopy to isolate and characterize key reaction intermediates.              We first laid the foundation for these studies by characterizing model systems consisting of transition metals bonded to a hydroxyl group. Our results showed that the hydroxyl ligand on a metal center can serve as an in-situ probe of the metal charge state.  From these model systems, we transitioned to studying functional water oxidation catalysts and intermediates based on Ruthenium-centered complexes. For such studies, we coupled our mass spectrometer with an electrochemical flow cell to produce and capture reaction intermediates directly from the reaction solution.  These reaction complexes are characterized inside the mass spectrometer via infrared spectroscopy.              As often is the case, certain interesting species relevant to the catalytic cycle cannot be obtained directly from solution.  To experimentally access such species, we developed a new cryogenic ion trap technology.  Using this technology, we were able to prepare a critical intermediate by activating a precursor complex in the high-pressure source region and reacting the resulting species with oxygen at low temperatures inside an ion trap.  Our experimental results showed conclusively the binding structure of the oxygen molecule on the complex and highlighted notable shortcomings in the typical theoretical treatments used for studying these complexes. This cryogenic reaction trap technology developed in our lab has proven to be a very versatile approach for accessing high-energy reaction species in a well-controlled manner.  Solvent molecules can play an active role in chemical reactions and our novel cryogenic reaction trap setup offers an alternate approach for studying such effects. Using this approach, we probed solvent-effects in the first step of the catalytic water oxidation reaction.  We found that the strong interaction of the solvent leads to a weakened water O-H bond, facilitating the first oxidation step.  In contrast, the subsequent reaction step experiences comparably less assistance from solvation.  Our studies also showed, for the first time, that the efficiency of the first oxidation step can be traced to a very small solvent reorganization energy penalty.   One of the broader impacts of this project is its contributions to the formation of a highly skilled and diverse workforce.  This grant supported five Ph.D. students who recently graduated: Brett Marsh, who graduated in December 2015 and is currently a research associate at Purdue University.  Erin Duffy, who graduated in May 2017 and went on to a postdoctoral associate position at Michigan State University.  She competed for and received an honorable mention for the APS Justin Jankunas Doctoral Dissertation award in Chemical Physics.  She is currently an assistant professor at Western Washington University.  Jonathan Voss, who graduated in the summer of 2018 and is currently a postdoctoral associate at the ?cole Polytechnique F?d?rale de Lausanne.  And most recently, Glen Thurston, who graduated in the summer 2019, and Kaitlyn Fisher, who graduated in December 2019.
