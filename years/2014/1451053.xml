<AbstractNarration>A growing body of research suggests that many types of institutions and experiences contribute to science and technology learning by the public. These include the formal education system, libraries, science centers, citizen science, after school programs, television programs, film and video, newspapers, radio, books and magazines, the internet, community and health organizations, environmental organizations, and conversations with friends and family. It is also important that research about who learns and how they learn from these institutions and experiences is informed by and discussed within the communities themselves. This project focuses specifically on STEM learning in interactive science centers. It invites science center professionals from around the country to contribute to and share findings from an on-going research study designed to better understand the influence that interactive science centers have on youth and adult's long-term understanding, interest and engagement with science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pair of workshops supported by this grant will engage science center administrators, educators, exhibition and program designers, evaluators and researchers in two sets of tasks. The first workshop, held prior to the start of the larger research project, will examine and focus the research's overall goals and help frame a set of specific research questions. Although no research study can answer all important issues, the goal of the workshop is to ensure that the planned investigation attempts to address the issues and outcomes considered most critical to the broader science center community. The second workshop will occur after completion of all data collection and initial data analysis. It will engage a broad cross-section of the science center community in discussing findings, brainstormind implications and usage, and developing dissemination strategies to insure that the findings of the research reach the broader science center and policy communities. The goal of these workshops is to use the collective wisdom of dozens of active professionals from across the country to develop a suite of strategies for grounding research in practice, incorporating research results into practice as well as bringing important research findings to a broader national audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Engaging the Science Center Community in Defining and Utilizing Impact Metrics project was designed to support the development of a major research study on science center impact by involving a representative sampling of science center professionals (practitioners, researchers and evaluators) directly in the research conceptualization process.  The research effort itself, the Multi-Institutional Science Center Effect Study (MISCES) project, was funded by the Noyce Foundation and involved a multi-year, multi-city, multi-partner investigation whose research goal was to: Measure and understand how, why and for whom experiences at science centers, schools, broadcast media, print media and the internet effect current and past youth and adult interest and engagement with science.  The goal of this project was to support this research effort by involving a broad cross-section of the informal science community directly in the research planning process.  The main vehicle for accomplishing the project?s goal was the convening of two intensive workshops at critical stages in the research process &ndash; the first prior to the implementation of quantitative data collection and the second subsequent to initial analysis of quantitative findings and prior to implementation of qualitative data collection.  The direct involvement of the informal science education community in the conceptualization and design of the MISCES research, in particular the wider frame and multiple perspectives from many science centers embedded within the design, were immensely helpful to the MISCES researchers and helped to ensure that field-wide concerns and questions were included in the research design. In turn, it is anticipated that the findings that result from both the quantitative and qualitative research (results expected by the close of 2016) will more directly reflect the needs and interests of the entire field rather than merely those of the researchers and their three science center partners directly involved in the project.    Input from participants at the two workshops, the first held in Raleigh, North Carolina on October 17, 2014 and the second held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on October 16, 2015, the research team significantly affected the nature of both the quantitative and qualitative research questions posed to the public. In particular, the group strongly encouraged the research team to focus the quantitative research on more generic consequences of the visitor experience, e.g., enjoyment, wonder, engagement, rather than the specific activities a visitor may have engaged in, e.g., hands-on exhibit experiences, watching an IMAX film, participating in a class (as had been done in the International Science Center Impact Study research).   In the qualitative research the group encouraged the research team to focus on definitions of science, early positive versus early negative experiences with science and the longer term impact on science interest and participation, first and early memories science and of visiting science centers, access and barriers to access to science centers (including location, demographics, school field trips, cost of admission, etc.), varieties of ways science interest and participation manifest outside of formal education, and understanding the uniqueness and value of science centers.  By inviting professionals from across the community to review existing measures of impact and then debate the relative merits of current impact metrics and approaches, the project served to directly and meaningfully engage a wide array of science center professionals in the research process; not as passive recipients but as active partners. This process serves as a model for future informal science education researchers on how to design investigations in ways that significantly engage and enhance informal science education practice and policy. By directly involving a broad subset of the educational research and practice community in the research design process this investigation directly supported in practice, and not just in rhetoric, the ideals of collaborative research.
