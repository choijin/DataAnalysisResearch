<AbstractNarration>Organic compounds represent on average 30-70% of the fine aerosol mass in both polluted and clean areas. They contribute to the direct and indirect aerosol radiative forcing of climate via their own optical properties and their effects on clouds and precipitation. They are also pose significant environmental risks via visibility degradation, and health effects through the air that we breathe. The chemical complexity of the organic aerosol (OA) fraction of aerosols makes the representation, modeling and understanding of their properties notably challenging. A range of studies to be investigated here covers a range of topics, including: &lt;br/&gt;* the ability of organic compounds to promote (or inhibit) the growth of inorganic particulate matter with increasing relative humidity (RH),&lt;br/&gt;* the effect of RH on the partitioning of semi-volatile OA components between the gas and particulate phases, &lt;br/&gt;* the water solubility distribution of ambient OA, &lt;br/&gt;* and the systematic estimation of Henry's law constants of semi-volatile organic vapors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will involve a combination of laboratory experiments, field measurements, and mathematical modeling, with a goal of incorporating the mathematical representation of OA components into chemical transport models, designed to track and forecast OA distribution .</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organic compounds represent on average 30-70% of the fine particulate mass in both polluted and clean areas, contributing to the direct and indirect aerosol radiative forcing of climate, and posing significant environmental risks (health problems, visibility degradation, etc.). While our knowledge of the formation pathways and properties of inorganic particulate matter (PM) has improved significantly, our overall understanding of the system is often limited by our inability to describe the formation, properties, and removal of organic aerosol (OA). The interactions among the organic and inorganic aerosol components and water are yet to be elucidated.  The goal of this study has been the investigation of some of the least understood organic aerosol aspects, namely: how these organic compounds partition between the gas and particulate phases, how they dissolve in water, and how they affect the growth of ambient particles as the relative humidity increases. One of the major objectives of our work is to use the above experimental results in chemical transport models improving their ability to simulate atmospheric organic aerosol. The project involves a combination of laboratory experiments, field measurements, and mathematical modeling.  During the project we have achieved the following specific objectives:  Development      of an approach to measure the water solubility distribution of ambient OA      and application in laboratory and field studies. Investigation      of the change in solubility distribution of the OA with chemical aging. Improvement      of the existing method for the measurement of the OA volatility      distribution. Development      and testing of an approach to measure the hygroscopicity and oxygen      content of the OA as a function of its volatility. Development of a method for the measurement of the partioning of OA components between      the gas and aqueous phases.  Characterization of the hygroscopicity of cooking organic aerosol and biomass burning aerosol. Investigation of the molecular structure of nanoparticles consisting of organic molecules,      inorganic ions, and water.  Continuation of the development of simulation tools for the description of OA evolution in      the atmosphere and their evaluation against field measurements.      The most significant results of the project are:  We have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach for the measurement of the atmospheric OA water solubility distribution and the partitioning of these organic compounds between the gas and aqueous phases. We have shown that the often-used water soluble organic carbon concentration can vary by as much as a factor of two depending on the method used for its measurement. We have improved the accuracy of the ambient OA volatility distribution measurements. We have shown that the water solubility of cooking organic aerosol changes dramatically within a few hours of atmospheric processing with the particles becoming a lot more hygroscopic. We have developed an approach using molecular dynamics for the investigation of the morphology of multicomponent atmospheric nanoparticles. Our simulations suggest that the existence of at least two phases (an organic and an aqueous) under most conditions in these particles with the organics being closer to the particle surface.      Seven papers have been published in peer-reviewed journals, two have been submitted for publication, and one more is ready and should be submitted during the next month. The work has been presented in a number of international conferences (International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC), American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR), International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosols, International Aerosol Conference).  The project resources have been mainly used to support graduate students. Three PhD students and one MS student have been partially supported during the project. Two of them have completed their PhD and one has completed his MS.   This project has resulted in a significant improvement of our understanding of the interactions between atmospheric aerosol and water as well as the methodology for its mathematical description.
