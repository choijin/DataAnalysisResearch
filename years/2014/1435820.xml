<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description: The increasing demand for higher performing materials across many fields requires the development of ever more complex materials. In this project a novel materials discovery methodology will be developed based on advances in combinatorial computational thermodynamics and experimental techniques. Bulk metallic glasses will be taken as example materials because of their technological potential - they can be considered high-strength metals that can be formed like plastics - and their suitability for the development of a general methodology. Many alloys - on the order of thousands - will be synthesized and characterized simultaneously. The ability of these alloys to be deformed, a property that correlates with the glass forming ability, will be measured experimentally. The crystalline phases competing with the glassy phase will also be characterized. These crystalline phases will be compared with atomic modeling results considering the energy of many possible crystalline phases. Since direct modeling of the glass forming ability is not possible from first principles, correlations will be established between the experimental glass forming ability and the competing crystalline phases from atomic modeling. The development of such a methodology and correlation through this research will accelerate the pace of discovery and deployment of advanced materials. Specifically for bulk metallic glasses, the potential development of technologically relevant alloys, particularly those that are based on Cu or Al can be expected to have a lasting impact on society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This objective will be realized through an integrated approach of combinatorial ab-initio simulations, combinatorial synthesis of sputtered composition spreads, and high-throughput characterization methods. To massively parallel synthesize complex alloy systems comprising ~1,000 alloys, this research uses combinatorial magnetron sputtering. Compositional libraries will be characterized using specific high-throughput methods for measuring liquidus temperature, formability, thermal, and structural properties. Within such an approach a vast amount of experimental and computational data will be generated, which will be data-mined to identify correlations. Rather than trying to directly simulate glass formation, the strategy will be to integrate experiments and computations to understand which structural and energetic aspects of the liquid and competing crystalline state best correlate with glass forming ability. Identifying correlations is a key aspect of the research and these correlations will be used to search for new glass forming compositions through combined computational and experimental means.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Synthesized by rapidly quenching a molten alloy, metallic glasses are alloys with a random structure, much like a frozen liquid.&nbsp; This is different from conventional alloys, which show long-range, crystalline order.&nbsp; Because of this special structure, metallic glasses have a unique combination of superb mechanical properties and excellent processability. For example, Vitreloy, a class of zirconium-based bulk metallic glass (BMG), has a tensile strength almost twice that of high-grade titanium and can be formed into complex shapes like thermoplastics.&nbsp; These properties make Vitreloy an ideal material for sports equipment, such as tennis rackets and golf clubs, and raise interest for the use in areas such as microelectromechanical systems, jewelry and data storage. Understanding and predicting the formation of multi-component BMGs is crucial for fully exploiting their exceptional properties. As part of this project, we have 1) studied crystallization behavior in Cu<sub>50</sub>Zr<sub>50</sub> metallic glass thin films, 2) developed fast screening methods for good BMG formers based on resistance and nanocalorimetry measurements and 3) developed a spectral descriptor for BMGs based on the thermodynamics of competing the crystalline phases.</p> <p>The crystallization kinetics of Cu<sub>50</sub>Zr<sub>50 </sub>metallic glass thin films were investigated using nanocalorimetry [<strong>Figure 1</strong>]. The crystallization process is growth-controlled during heating and nucleation-controlled during cooling, resulting in different critical heating and cooling rates to suppress crystallization. Measurements over a wide range of scanning rates (13 K/s to 21,000 K/s) reveal that crystallization does not follow Arrhenius kinetics upon heating. Instead, the behavior on heating is well described by a fragility based model of growth-controlled kinetics that takes into account the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relationship [<strong>Figure 2</strong>]. Upon cooling, the quench rate required to suppress crystallization of the melt is much higher than for bulk samples. This reduced asymmetry in critical heating and cooling rates compared to bulk materials suggests that crystallization of the thin-film metallic glass is controlled by heterogeneous nucleation.</p> <p>Multiple approaches were pursued to perform rapid screening for good glass formers in a large number of candidates. One approach relies on high-throughput nanocalorimetry experiments. For example, we have shown that the evaluation of GFA through nanocalorimetry measurements on composition spreads is consistent with the critical size measurements obtained from wedge casting [<strong>Figure 3</strong>]. Another approach is based on the development of a sensor array to measure the resistance of thin-film composition spreads. Resistance maps of the Cu-Zr-Al metallic glass systems indicates a positive correlation between the ratio of the as-deposited and annealed resistances and the reduced glass transition temperature [<strong>Figure 4</strong>].</p> <p>We have also proposed a descriptor based on the heuristics that structural and energetic &lsquo;confusion&rsquo; obstructs crystalline growth, and demonstrate its validity by experiments on multiple alloy systems. If a particular alloy composition exhibits many structurally different stable and metastable crystal phases, which have similar energies, these phases will compete against each other during solidification, disrupting and frustrating the nucleation and crystallization processes, ultimately leading to an amorphous structure [<strong>Figure 5</strong>]. A robust model has been developed for predicting glass formation ability based on the geometrical and energetic features of crystalline phases calculated ab initio in the AFLOW framework (<a href="http://www.aflowlib.org/">http://www.aflowlib.org/</a>), which is an open database [<strong>Figure 6</strong>]. Our findings indicate that the formation of metallic glass phases could be much more common than currently thought, with more than 17% of binary alloy systems potential glass formers. Our approach pinpoints favorable compositions and demonstrates that smart descriptors, based solely on alloy properties available in online repositories, offer the sought-after key for accelerated discovery of metallic glasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Joost&nbsp;J&nbsp;Vlassak</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1435820/1435820_10333203_1509041167838_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1435820/1435820_10333203_1509041167838_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="thin-film nanocalorimetry"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1435820/1435820_10333203_1509041167838_figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="thin-film nanocalorimetry"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1 (a) Schematic diagram of sputter deposition of Cu50Zr50 metallic glass films.
