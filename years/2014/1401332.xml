<AbstractNarration>NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology intersects with other scientific disciplines, in this case with mathematics.  The Fellows are expected to lead the nation's scientific workforce of the future.  This fellowship to Holly Moeller supports research and training on metabolic flexibility and marine ecosystem function.  The host institution is the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Matthew D. Johnson and Michael G. Neubert.  Training goals include coupling microbiological and modeling techniques. Educational and public outreach includes mentoring undergraduate and high school students at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution by including them in experimental subprojects and by continuing as a scientific writer to place environmental issues in the public eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research investigates the environmental selection pressures that produce mixotrophs - organisms that can fuel their metabolism through either autotrophy, i.e., photosynthesis, or heterotrophy, ingestion of organic matter.  Mixotrophy is widespread in aquatic microbial communities, yet remains poorly represented in ecosystem models.  The research examines, from an evolutionary perspective, how an organism maintains metabolic flexibility, rather than specializing in just one mode of nutrition, and the importance of these types of organisms to primary production, nutrient cycling, and other ecosystem functions, particularly in the ocean where climate change is likely to increase their numbers.  To test the physiological limits and competitive ability of mixotrophic marine microbes, laboratory studies are being extended to modeling broader questions of eco-evolutionary dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Holly Moeller has completed her National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology entitled "Mixotrophy and the role of metabolic flexibility in community assembly and function." During her two-year postdoc, she collaborated with biologists and mathematicians at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to study the physiology and ecology of tiny, planktonic organisms that live in the surface waters of the world?s oceans. Moeller?s research was focused on a group of these planktonic organisms that scientists call "mixotrophs" because they "mix" two very different forms of metabolism: photosynthesis (the ability to use sunlight to obtain the energy they need for growth and reproduction) and heterotrophy (the ability to get this energy from eating other living organisms). Mixotrophs are important for several reasons: First, they play an important role in the carbon cycle because they simultaneously function as primary producers (whose photosynthetic activities capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and provide food for the rest of the ecosystem) and as consumers (which eat smaller organisms, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere). Second, they affect nutrient cycling in ecosystems because they are able to eat (and obtain nutrients from) smaller organisms, which allows them to continue to grow when other photosynthetic species have run out of dissolved inorganic nutrients in the water. Third, their physiology is predicted to change as the Earth?s climate warms, becoming more heterotrophic and therefore potentially reducing the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by the ocean. As a mathematical biologist, Moeller used a combination of laboratory experiments and computer models to understand how mixotrophs make their living under different environmental conditions. In particular, her work measured the effects of light and prey availability on mixotroph population growth and persistence. For example, working with Micromonas, a widespread marine phytoplankton, and several types of its mixotrophic predator, Ochromonas, Moeller developed a laboratory model system for open ocean planktonic ecosystems that showed how Ochromonas?s survival depends on how well it competes with its prey for light. In another study, Moeller focused on mixotrophs that obtain their photosynthesis by stealing chloroplasts from their prey. Her mathematical model &mdash; validated by laboratory experiments &mdash; revealed how these species, which are omnipresent in coastal and estuarine ecosystems, can form blooms (local, rapid increases in biomass that can actually color the water) by harnessing the energy of sunlight using their stolen photosynthetic equipment. In addition to funding specific research projects, Moeller?s NSF postdoc position allowed her to spend two years at a major oceanographic research institution, receiving training from, and building collaborations with, scientists engaged in a variety of field and experimental work. This led to a number of opportunities, including both national and international travel to present her work to other scientists, local educational outreach with K-12 students, and the development of math biology lesson plans now used by the Sea Education Association onboard its teaching vessels.    Having completed her postdoctoral training, Moeller will now begin an assistant professorship as a Quantitative Ecologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she will continue to contribute to scientific research and the training of the next generation of scientists.
