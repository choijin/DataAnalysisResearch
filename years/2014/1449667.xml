<AbstractNarration>Gender bias, whether purposeful or inadvertent violates basic American principles and the goal of this project is to determine whether in one aspect of archaeology such bias exists and if so how it may be remedied. In Spring 2013, the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) created the Task Force on Gender and Rates of Research Grant Submissions because of an apparent disparity in the rates of senior (post-Ph.D.) proposal submissions by males and females to archaeology programs at both NSF and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. Although success rates of men and women to NSF over the past few years (2009-2011) were roughly equal (35% of applications submitted by women were successful, compared to 33% from men), the number of submissions from women were half that of men (270 women submitted applications over this three-year period compared to 542 men). Given the documented increase in the proportion of women in academic archaeology among early and mid-career academics, this 33% representation of women in the applicant pool seems low. Moreover, submissions for doctoral dissertation improvement grants at NSF are evenly divided between men and women. Statistics for Wenner-Gren funding note the same disparity in their post-Ph.D. funding in archaeology, though not in other anthropology sub-disciplines. Statistics for NSF funding in biological anthropology and cultural anthropology similarly show no difference in submission rates by men and women. This project will examine and integrate a variety of data sources to determine: 1) whether or not there is a real problem in research grant submissions, and 2) if it is a problem, whether there are recommendations that will address the problem(s). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses multiple sources of information, including demographic data from the American Anthropological Association and member surveys conducted by SAA; detailed data from publicly available records of funded proposals from NSF and NEH; data on funded and unfunded proposals collected by Wenner-Gren and National Geographic Society, as well as a sample of submission data from NSF; and interviews with post-PhD women in academic archaeology to determine their strategies for funding archaeological research, as well as the kinds of research they undertake. Intellectually, the project will contribute to research on women in archaeology, and more broadly, to research on women in science.  Although this project focuses on a trend that initially appears unique to archaeology, the trend may in fact reflect wider research concerns on gender disparities in science. Based on the project results, broader impacts include potential policy change recommendations to professional organizations and research funders. Women who may not have applied or have not reapplied for grant funding may feel more confident in applying/reapplying for grants, therefore expanding the pool of proposals considered for funding. The planned project website will allow wider dissemination of the research results in a user-friendly format. Finally, a series of reports and publications will be prepared to share the project findings in detail.</AbstractNarration>

Why don?t post-Ph.D. women archaeologists apply for research funding in proportion to their presence in the field? This project used multiple sources of information, including interviews with post-Ph.D. women in academic archaeology.  Disparities in research grant submissions are proportional to the number of male vs. female archaeologists in the profession, and to the number in job settings where grant writing and grant related research is encouraged. Although women are now granted more than half of all Ph.D. degrees, they are not similarly represented in professional positions. Women are more likely to be found in institutions that grant only Bachelor degrees. Women in archaeology have heavier service burdens, and possibly heavier advising burdens, particularly to female and underrepresented minority students. Interviews indicate women have heavy service burdens, but we do not have data to indicate that their burden is heavier than males, or heavier than researchers in other subdisciplines. Because archaeology is (or perceived as) more field-based than other anthropology subfields, and family responsibilities keep women from doing extensive fieldwork, fewer women apply for NSF grants. Based on submissions to NGS, which must be field based, there are no differences in applications from men and women to do fieldwork. Almost every woman we interviewed discussed problems of family responsibilities and scheduling fieldwork. Several women incorrectly thought NSF would only fund fieldwork projects. Women tend to conduct smaller projects and go to other funding sources for smaller amounts of money. NSF data indicate that the dollar amounts of successful grants are not statistically different between men and women. However, data from W-G and NGS suggest women are applying at higher rates than to NSF. Women are going to other funding sources within NSF to obtain funding, therefore lowering the numbers for Archaeology Program itself. We do not know if women are doing this at a significantly higher rate than men, but several women mentioned they had applied to alternative programs in NSF instead of NSF Archaeology. Women may perceive their research as unsuitable for NSF and more are applying for, and being funded through, other agencies such as NEH. Our interview data suggest that this statement is true for some. NEH funding of female PIs has increased at the same time that NSF applications have decreased. In a few cases, women?s perceptions of NSF may not match the reality of what the agency will consider and fund. Women?s reactions to negative reviews are different from men?s and have resulted in their feeling discouraged from resubmission. If true, this trend may be compounded by the current trend for proposals to not be funded during the first round within NSF Archaeology. We do not have the data to compare the reactions of women and men to negative reviews, but interviews suggest that negative reviews do have an effect on women?s reapplications.
