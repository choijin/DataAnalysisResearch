<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for 18 participants from U.S. institutions in the 2014 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences Summer School in Probability to be held at the University of British Columbia from June 2-27, 2014. The School provides an opportunity for advanced U.S. Ph.D. students and recent graduates to interact directly with top researchers in the field. The participants will learn current techniques in the most significant areas of probability theory, including noise stability, random walks on random fractals, stochastic models of evolution, phase transitions for random constraint satisfaction problems, correlated Gaussian fields, and branching random walks. It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences Summer School in Probability will be an excellent opportunity for Ph.D. students and junior researchers to learn some of the most significant modern probability theory from the top experts in the field and to interact with them directly. The junior participants are often current and future academic faculty, able to spread the knowledge of the modern techniques further in the research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;School website: www.math.ubc.ca/Links/ssprob14/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  The PIMS Summer School in Probability took place at the University of British Columbia from June 2-27, 2014. Over 85 registrants attended two 4-week courses by two main instrfuctors. There were 3 mini-courses. There were also 25 contributed lectures given by the participants.     The two main 4-week courses were given by Elchanan Mossel and Asaf Nachmias. Each lecturer gave a 90 minute lecture on MTThF.  The courses were supplemented by weekly tutorials.  In addition there were 3 mini-courses given by Alison Etheridge, Alan Sly and Ofer Zeitouni given in the afternoons. Each speaker gave three one-hour lectures. There were also 25 contributed lectures given by the participants in the afternoon. Wednesdays were free but many participants went on organized outings for hikes and sight-seeing.  These outings were an integral part of the school as students, lecturers, postdocs and faculty get to know each other and discuss the courses and their own research.     Intellectual merit  The participants had a chance to learn about the most exciting developments in several key areas of modern probability, including "Influences and noise stability in product space", "Random Walks and random fractals", "Stochastic models of evolution", "Phase transitions for random constraint satisfaction" and "Log correlated Gaussian fields and branching random walks".  Broader impacts  The summer school provided training and networking oportunities, mostly for graduate students, including many women.
