<AbstractNarration>This research visit will initiate a new collaboration between the P.I., Dr. John Berry, at Florida International University, and counterparts at laboratories in the Netherlands and Germany.  Their goal is to develop cutting-edge techniques - based on principles of magnetic resonance, and the zebrafish as an aquatic animal model - for investigation of environmental toxicants, and specifically toxic metabolites derived from marine and freshwater "harmful algal bloom" (HAB) species.  Aquatic animals, as "model systems," are fundamental tools to understanding environmental toxicants.  Of these, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as an important toxicological model for use in a wide range of relevant toxic compounds in the environment, including those associated with HABs.  Magnetic resonance (MR) utilizes the inherent "magnetic spin" of atomic nuclei to selectively distinguish molecules of interest. When applied to living systems, MR is capable of high-resolution imaging as well as probing the uptake, fate and metabolism of molecules.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The laboratory of the international partner, Dr. A. Alia, jointly housed at the University of Leiden, in the Netherlands, and at Leipzig University, in Germany, has recently developed MR imaging and spectroscopy techniques that are capable of visualization/imaging and quantifying metabolites in the zebrafish, including embryo, larval and adult stages.  Accordingly, the plans for initiating this research will require obtaining initial data demonstrating the use of MR to investigate uptake, localization, and metabolism of several relevant HAB toxins in the zebrafish model.  Finally, although this research planning visit by the P.I. and one U.S. graduate student will focus specifically on investigation of HAB toxins in the zebrafish system, the techniques to be jointly developed in the future have the potential to be transformative in the field of environmental toxicology, and if successful, the proposed approach may be applied to a wide range of environmental contaminants, such as industrial pollutants, oil spills, or toxic metals.</AbstractNarration>

In this research, conducted as part of the NSF Catalyzing New International Collaborations (CNIC) program, the project investigators partnered with researchers at the University of Leipzig (Germany) and Leiden University (The Netherlands), who have recently developed NMR-based tools for imaging and spectroscopy (i.e., chemical analysis) in the zebrafish embryo as a vertebrate animal model system.  Ongoing research of the U.S. project investigators focuses on toxins from marine and freshwater algae, and particularly the cyanobacteria (or "blue-green algae"), as increasingly widespread contaminants of aquatic systems.  And, as part of this research, the zebrafish embryo model has been previously employed to study the teratogenicity (i.e., developmental toxicity) of these toxic compounds.  Collaborative research conducted under the CNIC award, therefore, specifically explored novel applications of these state-of-the-art NMR-based approaches for imaging and spectroscopic measurement of algal toxins in the zebrafish embryo as it relates to uptake, distribution and pathways of toxicity.  By generating isotopically labeled versions of these toxic metabolites - specifically biosynthesized by algal cultures - the use of carbon-13 (13C)-labeled toxins, in particular, for measurement of uptake into, and imaging of distribution within, exposed zebrafish embryos was explored.  Moreover, the use of a method known as high-resolution magic angle spin (HRMAS) NMR was investigated with respect to the effects of toxins on metabolite profiles (or so-called metabolomics) of intact, exposed zebrafish embryos.  This latter approach was demonstrated to be a very effective method to reproducibly measure the effects of toxins on specific, relevant metabolites in the developing embryo, and moreover, enabled the generation of working models (i.e., hypotheses) regarding pathways of toxicity.  Specific examples, in this regard, included a "proof-of-principle" study which utilized HRMAS NMR to elucidate changes in the metabolites (Figure 1) of embryos exposed to polymethoxyalkenes (PMAs) as an emerging, and apparently widespread, group of teratogenic metabolites from cyanobacteria, as well as ecologically related green algae.  Using this approach a model of the toxicity of the PMAs was developed (Figure 2). This approach was further used to investigate a neurotoxic amino acid, beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), which, as a reportedly widespread metabolite from cyanobacteria, has been increasingly linked to neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Alzheimer?s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).  This study, likewise, provided previously inaccessible insight to the toxicity of this potentially important environmental toxicant.  These, and other studies, conducted as part of the project have, therefore, highlighted the transformative potential of NMR-based techniques to understanding these toxins, and indeed, a wide range of environmental toxicants, as well as other toxicologically and/or pharmacologically relevant compounds (e.g., drugs).
