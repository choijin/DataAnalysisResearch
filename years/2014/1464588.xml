<AbstractNarration>The global electrical energy consumption is rising rapidly and there is a demand to double the power capacity within the next 15-20 years. The production, distribution and use of energy should be as efficient as possible. Power management technologies are widely used in many electronics and energy systems including wireless mobile devices, notepads, PC and laptops, photovoltaic and power systems, bio-sensors, automobiles, hydro power, biomass, geothermal, solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, wind power, etc. These applications and distributed energy resources require a new integrated power electronic technology.  The Power One IC center is a network of academic and industry leaders who aim to develop an integrated power and energy management for these applications. The center is a multi-university NSF I/UCRC that is led by Arizona State University (ASU) in partnership with The University of Colorado at Boulder (CU-Boulder), The Ohio State University (OSU), and Dartmouth College (DC). The power management (PM) block is a critical component of any electronics, and energy systems. This block acts in the same way as the heart which controls and regulates the flow of blood to various body part. The PM system task is to efficiently regulate, control, and convert energy to assure efficient delivery of energy to various components of the system. Most of the existing system use external bulky discrete devices for power management. The objective of this center is to develop fully integrated power management within the system to develop fully autonomous and integrated systems on a chip.  Power One will address issues ranging from system level power management, to circuits, devices, materials, and Integrated Circuits. The center will develop innovative research combined with educational components to address energy management. Creating this new knowledge will advance the next generation of  fully autonomous systems with power and energy management as an integrated part of the system. These cutting-edge power management solutions will make a significant impact in the efficiency and cost of all portable electronics, cellular wireless systems, computers, multi-media, lighting, renewable energy, electronic vehicles, etc. Power Management IC (PMIC) is at the heart of this technological revolution and is the key component to every electronic system in our modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrated circuits have revolutionized computing, communication, and information technology, which, in turn, have enabled new economic and social paradigms that have improved standards of living, access to information, and productivity. However, energy management and efficient energy control and conversion has become major bottlenecks that limit the ongoing scaling of size, performance, cost, and battery life. A solution to the power-management bottleneck is within reach, but requires a comprehensive system effort that ties together a diverse group of stakeholders and researchers from systems, to Integrated System, IC, electronics, and materials. The Power One IC center will target a range of innovations that leverage emerging systems, high-density power management circuits and components, next generation devices, and new classes of power electronic circuits that can fundamentally shift the tradeoffs among efficiency, size, and cost. Through Power One IC's world-class research and education, along with leading edge industrial partners and graduate students, we are working together across the spectrum to develop an integrated autonomous system with energy and power management on a chip. The results of the center research will impact renewable energy, PV and solar energy, efficient inverters and power/voltage converters, efficient management and use of energy in portable electronics and computers, as well as remote sensors and bioelectronics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded a planning meeting in Tempe, AZ, for a proposed Power One IC Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC).  The meeting, held July 30-31st in Tempe, Arizona, was highly successful, with strong industry enthusiasm from over 50 industry attendees, as well as an enthusiastic response from additional potential industrial partners who were unable to attend.   Ultimately, a full proposal for an I/UCRC was not recommended, due to perceived potential for overlap with other existing I/UCRCs.  Nonetheless, the meeting had significant benefits.  In terms of intellectual merit, the four university partners (Arizona State University (ASU), The University of Colorado at Boulder (CU-Boulder), The Ohio State University (OSU), and Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth developed 19 specific research project proposals, and presented them to the prospective industry partners.  Feedback from industry helped refine ideas, many of which are now being pursued under other funding.   In terms of broader impacts, the meeting served as an opportunity for industry to learn about cutting-edge pre-publication research, and for networking among industry, university researchers, and graduate students.  Four Dartmouth MS and PhD students attended the meeting, giving them early exposure to industry research priorities and interests and research activity at other universities, as well as giving them networking opportunities.
