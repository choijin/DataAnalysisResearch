<AbstractNarration>University of Detroit-Mercy (UDM), a predominantly undergraduate institution, will break down barriers to STEM women faculty's advancement through its ADVANCE IT-Catalyst award. ADVANCE IT-Catalyst awards are designed to help academic institutions collect the data needed to understand where to most effectively put their efforts to make them more supportive places to work. UDM is currently changing to an institution that engages students in active science, engineering and math research, a move that puts pressure on faculty to increase their research capacity. Prior study by the ADVANCE team at UDM revealed challenges common to all faculty during this transition and challenges unique to STEM women. Women may be isolated as the only women in a STEM department; they appear to have less access to information networks, experience uncertain application of family-friendly policies, and a higher turnover rate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADVANCE IT-Catalyst team will promote a partnership between UDM faculty and administrators to further study the needs of UDM STEM women faculty and to develop strategies to address STEM women faculty's unique challenges as well as challenges common to all faculty. The team will collect data on faculty demographic characteristics, including factors distinguishing to UDM, such as length of commute to work for faculty. They will conduct a climate study and follow up with focus groups of faculty to explore potential solutions. They will develop a standard method to measure workload among faculty that has the potential to become a standard for academic institutions interested in a fair distribution of the workload, thus having a broad impact on the STEM enterprise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ADVANCE&shy;-IT CATALYST: Transform Detroit Mercy!, NSF Award #1409118  The major goals of this project were  To conduct an in-depth organizational self-assessment aimed at evaluating the current workplace climate at the University of Detroit Mercy (DETROIT MERCY). To identify the needs of STEM women faculty at DETROIT MERCY to best inform future efforts and implementation strategies focused on positive institutional changes.   To develop and advance knowledge of critical issues faced by STEM women in a Predominantly Undergraduate Institution (PUI).   In order to achieve these goals many activities were undertaken during the grant period (2014-2017).   The Workplace Experience Survey was created and administrated to all full time faculty. With a response rate of 38%, comprehensive data were collected and analyzed.  Then focus groups were conducted with STEM women faculty on specific issues identified from the survey to gain a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the workplace issues.   Data analysis and qualitative study of the survey results and focus groups revealed that one of the primary hurdles in career advancement is the lack of understanding of and confidence in the promotion and tenure policies and procedures. The project team met with the University Promotion and Tenure committee to share these findings with them.  In response, the Promotion and Tenure committee presented a session, "How to Prepare Your Dossier", at the university faculty development event.  Additionally, to compliment discussions in the College of Engineering about major revisions to the college level Promotion and Tenure guidelines, Dr. Karinna Vernaza was invited to campus to give talks entitled "Boyer?s Model of Scholarship" and "Promotion and Tenure Processes at Predominately Undergraduate Institutions."  Dr. Vernaza is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Associate Dean of the College of Engineering and Business at Gannon University. These sessions sparked additional conversation and helped gain momentum for organizational change.  Data analysis on the Workplace Experience Survey also found that female faculty members reported higher levels of concerns with Work-Life balance issues. The project team, along with another psychology faculty member with expertise in the area, conducted a session at the University faculty development event on strategies for handling Work-Life balance issues.  Outcomes from the grant include three posters (some of which were presented at multiple venues), a website, and a research paper (in progress).  The first poster was ``An Assessment of the Challenges of STEM Women Faculty in an Urban Predominantly Undergraduate University'' was presented at AWIS?s (Association of Women in Science) national convention in May, 2015 in Washington, DC.  It was also presented at Math Fest in August 2015, in Washington, DC.   The second poster was entitled "Faculty Views of Tenure Policy: An Empirical Investigation." It was presented in May, 2016 to the AWIS ADVANCE workshop in Washington, DC.  The third poster entitled "Social Support as a Buffer against Work-Interference-with-Family (WIF)", was presented at the Association for Psychological Science in May, 2016 in Chicago, IL.  The research paper which is currently in progress has the same working title as the third poster and will be submitted to an organizational psychology journal.  The project has also disseminated information through a public website:  http://blogs.udmercy.edu/advance/.  The grant also had some important outcomes which may not be easily measured quantitatively. Most notably, a cultural and climate change at Detroit Mercy has occurred. For example, following the team?s work-life balance session at the faculty development event, there has been an increase in the number of sessions focusing on the "soft skills" needed to successfully navigate an academic career. There is also an increase in discussion of and specific contractual items in the most recent, faculty union contract regarding work-life balance issues (e.g. maternity leave, parental care leave, and promotion and tenure clock extension policies).

Overall, the cultural shift of increased conversations, including faculty development sessions, about issues which disproportionately affect women is already beginning to lead to changes in policies. Thus it is expected that the effects of this grant will extend far into the future.          Last Modified: 10/23/2017       Submitted by: Xiaohui Zhong]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
