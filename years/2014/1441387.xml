<AbstractNarration>Abstract of proposal # 1135303: &lt;br/&gt;The 2011 NSF Minority Faculty Development Workshop (MFDW): Engineering Enterprise and innovation, will be the sixth in a series that began in 2001 with funding under the Engineering Directorate. The PI proposes to organize two and a half day workshop at Georgia Tech University. The PI and the university have previous experience in organizing such conferences. This workshop will bring together women and underrepresented minority early and mid career engineering faculty where they have the opportunity to network, learn and discuss their personal experiences and challenges to collaborate with industry. The workshop will provide opportunities  for professional development and better understanding of research innovation and translation. Participants will share and develop ideas for projects which are geared towards the development of products and services for commercialization. Also, the workshop will provide a model for an institutionalized minority faculty development program with an emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship that includes mechanisms for assessment and relevant follow up activities. In addition, the workshop will address strategic goals of the National Science Foundation and critical needs of the nation, related to enhance global competiveness and improve the national economy.</AbstractNarration>

It was organized by Dr. Gilda Barabino, Executive Director of the National Institute for Faculty Equity, and designed to provide participants with opportunities for professional development and the chance to gain a better understanding of research innovation and translation.&nbsp; The workshop was unique in its first time offering of tailored and integrated training on innovation, entrepreneurship and professional development to underrepresented minority faculty, a largely untapped pool of entrepreneurial talent. &nbsp;Participants were drawn from U.S. four-year institutions and represented the spectrum of engineering disciplines. &nbsp;70 underrepresented aspiring, new and mid-career faculty participated in a series of informational and interactive sessions over a 2 &frac12; day period.&nbsp; The workshop was preceded by a combined welcome reception and juried poster session, the National Faculty Collaborative Poster Competition. Three organizational sections comprised the workshop: 1) day 1 was devoted to progression toward tenure and post-tenure and funding opportunities to support research and education, 2) day 2 was devoted to education and training on innovation and entrepreneurship and 3) day 3 was devoted to cross-cutting skills to support career innovation, work-life balance and branding for career advancement. Consistent with the goals of the overall project, a follow on workshop tailored for women of color in engineering was designed and implemented. The Workshop on Leadership, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Women of Color in Academic Engineering, convened by Dr. Barabino was held in New York, June 25-26, 2015. Participants were drawn from U.S. four-year institutions and represented the spectrum of engineering disciplines. &nbsp;20 underrepresented minority women took advantage of a mini-conference on innovation and entrepreneurship designed to gain knowledge of entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial mindset and how to apply these principles toward the development of personal, professional and institutional strategies for career advancement. Both workshops provided a venue conducive to building community and access to knowledgeable experts that fostered the career development and success of the underrepresented minority participants who attended. As the PI disseminates this work through technical presentations and outreach activities, aspiring engineers will be impacted. In particular, the PI serves as a role model for women and minorities nationally and internationally. She has represented the United States in several NSF-funded initiatives including the Indo-US Indo-US Roundtable on Advancing Women Faculty in STEM held in New Delhi, India and the Global Engineering Deans Council Summit held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Faculty of color represent an alarmingly small, untapped and underserved population in the academic ranks within engineering. This project serves unmet needs by increasing the numbers and career success of underrepresented faculty and broadening their participation in academic leadership. Success in this area positively impacts efforts towards diversifying engineering, which will lead to an improved economy and national competitiveness. By providing opportunities for professional development for underrepresented faculty, a stronger faculty cadre will be developed and the talent pool will be broadened. A further benefit of the project is the building of a community of underrepresented faculty in engineering. Ultimately, these benefits impact how engineering disciplines are shaped.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/27/2015<br>      Modified by: Gilda&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barabino</p> </div> <div clas...]]></DRECONTENT>
