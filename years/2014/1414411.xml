<AbstractNarration>Fundamental properties of certain electromagneticwaves in plasmas are investigated. These waves, specifically known as whistler modes, are very important in space plasmas and in plasma processing and propulsion. They have not yet been studied in plasmas immersed in highly nonuniform magnetic fields that change within one wavelength or less. The waves are excited and measured in a large laboratory plasma with local magnetic fields produced by strong permanent magnets and current-carrying coils. Wave propagation, wave refraction and reflection, standing waves and nonlinear effects are obtained from detailed measurements of three vector components of the wave magnetic field in three dimensional space and time. The findings are expected to produce a new understanding of wave effects in space plasmas and to improve industrial plasma sources for plasma processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, whistler wave propagation will be studied near magnetic X- and O-type null points, magnetic neutral sheets and dipole fields with high mirror ratios. Such geometries are often found in space and laboratory plasmas, but there is little knowledge about the wave properties in a regime where the spatial changes of the magnetic field are comparable to the wavelength. Under those circumstances, different group and phase velocities are possible and complicate the wave propagation. The experiments produce complete data sets that provide valuable insight for the understanding of whistler-mediated reconnection, whistler eigenmodes on closed field lines, and whistler wave reflection at the lower hybrid frequency layer as well as whistler modes near lunar crustal magnetic fields, whistlers in small toroidal plasmas, and in helicon and magnetron discharges. Thus, the research will open up unexplored areas in plasma physics with broad relevance.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Experimental research on the basic physics of whistler wave excitation and propagation has been performed. The background magnetic field ranged from uniform to highly nonuniform. The latter case is particularly novel. The research started with the investigation of wave excitation from antennas. Magnetic loops can excite waves with the topology of vortices and waves called helicons which rotate in addition to translating along the ambient field. The rotation produces an angular momentum which can be as important as the straight propagation. For example the wave can exert a torque on plasma electrons, analogous to the force on electrons exerted as a radiation pressure. These wave-particle interactions can transfer energy from waves to electrons or create instabilities if electrons have excess energy. Helicon waves can have different rotation rates, quantized as azimuthal eigenmodes. They can also be quantized radially if waves are reflected by radial boundaries of thin plasma columns.&nbsp; Without boundaries the wave phase can propagate oblique to the ambient magnetic field but the energy flow is highly field aligned which keeps the helicon beam nearly collimated.<br /><br />When the magnetic field is curved the helicon mode tries to follow the curved field lines. Due to the conservation of angular momentum the wave both rotates and precesses around the guide magnetic field.&nbsp; On circular field lines the waves from both sides of an antenna collide and interfere which produces complicated near-zone wave fields. From the near zone secondary waves are excited which propagate across the ambient field. These whistler wave packets have a circular polarization perpendicular to the ambient field. The waves also carry angular momentum. Their topology differs from the traditional field-aligned helicon modes. <br /><br />When the ambient magnetic field exhibits a null point (such as in reconnection geometries) the wave is absorbed near the null point but continues to propagate around it on the separatrix and on open field lines. When the ambient magnetic field forms a mirror configuration the incident whistler mode is reflected. The reflection arises from the strong gradient in the refractive index which depends on the magnetic field. Counter propagating incident and reflected waves cause interference. At the nodes the perpendicular field components cancel while the parallel field component remains finite. The result is a linear polarization of whistler modes. <br /><br />In a controlled laboratory experiment we have developed&nbsp; wave diagnostics with full three-dimensional space and time resolution. Only then it is possible to obtain the current density and to prove that whistlers have force free fields and that field lines are always writhed or twisted, which is in addition to the helical lines of helicons.<br /><br />By expanding the basic knowledge of waves and antennas we have also found some new results of practical importance. Whistler modes can be excited by electric dipole antennas or magnetic loop antennas. We have compared the radiation efficiency of both and found that the radiated power of a loop antenna is three orders of magnitude larger than the electric dipole. This is important for efficient wave excitation in space plasmas. <br /><br />The observation of helicon modes in unbounded plasma should also have an impact on the helicon mode theory. A radial boundary is not needed to produce a phase rotation. In our case the radial wave profile of the helicon beam is imposed by the antenna vacuum field, not by a boundary. The circular polarization rotates the wave field. From this insight one can predict that any circularly polarized wave packet of limited transverse size is a generalized&nbsp; helicon mode.<br /><br />Finally, from the measured single loop wave field one can superimpose the fields from two or more identical antennas. This is extended to antenna arrays. Approximate plane waves can be excited by large arrays. Phase shifting the array elements can produce radially, axially and azimuthally imposed wave propagation.&nbsp; These findings may be useful to design antennas for applications in space and laboratory plasmas.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/13/2018<br>      Modified by: Reiner&nbsp;L&nbsp;Stenzel</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1414411/1414411_10326718_1528926200374_3DHeliconLines--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1414411/1414411_10326718_1528926200374_3DHeliconLines--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Measured helicon mode"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1414411/1414411_10326718_1528926200374_3DHeliconLines--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Measured helicon mode"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Measured phase surface and field lines of a helicon mode.
