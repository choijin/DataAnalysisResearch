<AbstractNarration>The project proposes to build new datasets to study how school quality and accessibility interacted with occupational and geographic mobility in the early twentieth-century U.S.  The context for the study entails both the "high school movement" and the transition from farming to service and manufacturing activities.  Both movements were important events in the economic development of the United States, but their interplay at the household and individual-level is not very well documented.  In particular, the responses of families to the high school movement and the implications of those responses for the children's long-run outcomes and for regional economic development are just starting to come into better focus.  The proposed project will develop new micro-level evidence to better understand these issues in the South, a relatively poor region at the time, which subsequently narrowed the gaps in education and economic development relative to the rest of the U.S.  The project seeks to answer the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;1) How did variation in high-school access and high-school quality affect the future earnings and occupational choice of southern students?  2) How did the expansion of southern high schools affect migration patterns?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main activity under the grant entails collecting a highly detailed dataset from recently discovered records in the Tennessee State Archives.  High school principals were required to fill out detailed reports on their schools.  Above and beyond common indicators such as the student-teacher ratio and length of the school year, these reports contain information on the faculty's education and the subjects that were taught at the school; information on school construction and the types of classrooms (e.g., labs); information on the library (if one existed); and information about the age and progression of students through grades.  Taken together, this information allows a much richer characterization of school quality than normally available to researchers.  There are sizable differences in high schools across locations in Tennessee in the mid-1920s, even after controlling for observable economic and demographic characteristics of the locations.  Consequently, children from observationally similar backgrounds faced quite different schooling environments, especially when looking beyond the 8th grade level.  This variation provides a basis for studying how people responded to the changing educational environment and for studying the long-run implications for those students as observed later in life at the time of the 1940 Census.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported doctoral dissertation research.  In particular, it supported a large scale data collection project in which the Ph.D. student digitized archival information on high schools in the 1920s and 1930s.  This information is held in the Tennessee State Archives.  The period under study is during the "high school movement," a time when high schools diffused rapidly throughout the United States and when high school attendance and graduation became the norm for American teenagers.  For perspective, in 1910 only about 10 percent of American teens graduated from high school.  By 1950, more than half graduated from high school.  The rapid increase in educational attainment had significant implications for the skills and "human capital" of the American labor force.  And because it occurred in the US long before it did in other countries, the high school movement ensured that the US had a relatively highly skilled and highly productive labor force throughout the twentieth century.  Yet there is much we do not know about how students and families responded to the diffusion of high schools and the increased access to educational opportunities.  There is also much to be learned about the long-run implications for students' labor market outcomes, such as their occupational choices and migration decisions.     The student's dissertation will study information on the high school movement at the "micro level," meaning that he located reports from high school principals that described each school's location, physical characteristics, courses offered, teaching staff, student enrollment, and more.  He can combine this school-specific information with other data from the U.S. Census of Population to shed light on several of the issues mentioned above, such as responses to school access and implications for occupational choices and migration.  The school-level reports also include information about the teachers' training, pay, and courses taught, which will allow some new insights into the operation of local labor markets.  The data collection phase of the student's dissertation is now complete.  He is currently conducting statistical analyses, organizing the results, and writing the dissertation.
