<AbstractNarration>The award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Noncommutative Geometry Festival" that will be held April 30-May 3, 2014, on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main scientific goals of this conference are to highlight the most significant recent advances in noncommutative geometry, to jumpstart promising new research directions, and to immerse graduate students and postdocs in the most current research in the field. The program, which includes talks by most of the major figures in the area, provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://www.math.tamu.edu/~xie/NCGF14/</AbstractNarration>
