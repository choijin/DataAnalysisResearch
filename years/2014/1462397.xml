<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in sensor and robotics technology have led to large networks of coordinated mobile platforms that can perform automatic sensing, mapping, learning, and control tasks. While the remote tasks can be controlled by the ground center via long-range communication links, the links are expensive and suffer long delays.  This project develops computational methods that will significant improve the ability for the remote agents to coordinate locally with one another for tasks such as recognize and navigate around obstacles, reconstruct signals, and learn new control policies from a large amount of multi-modal sensor data, all done with little or no communication to a center. The proposed approach is radically different from the current state of the art. It also includes educational components such as courses, seminars, and initiatives for under-represented minority and women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is a set of novel algorithms for a variety of computing problems in multi-agent networks, for problems involving extremely large-scale distributed datasets and high complexity objectives, and with greater accuracy at rates that are provably faster than existing methods. Very promising preliminary results have been obtained. The proposed project includes (a) a new approach to integrate multi-agent coordination with problems arising in optimization, game theory, control, and learning, into systems of equations, inclusions, or variational inequalities; (b) novel operator splitting methods that lead to decentralized numerical solutions of these systems, which scale to new levels of size, complexity, and diversity; (c) stochastic approximation techniques to deal with the imminent "distributed data deluge", along with accelerations techniques based on variance reduction, importance sampling, and asynchronous parallelization; and (d) a set of open-source software products for optimization, control, and learning problems with dynamic and large-scale data, along with a comprehensive evaluation plan. The contributions of the project is a unified framework in parts (a) and (b) above, which enable the decentralized numerical solutions at new levels of speed, complexity, diversity, and resilience. In order to achieve the goals, substantial resources will be devoted to both mathematical research and engineering challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today, large problems are often divided into smaller ones, so they can be fit into many computers and solved at the same time. One approach to achieve this is decentralized computing, which uses largely many computers located at different places and connected through wired or wireless networks. Many technologies and operations such delivery, evacuation, surveillance, agriculture, disaster recovery, and energy generation are decentralized in nature. Their computation, even if not large scale, is best implemented in the same decentralized manner.   Shifting from one computer, or a cluster of computers concentrated at one location, to distributed computers poses great challenges on algorithms. Not only an algorithm must enable multiple computers to run in parallel, but it must also survive limited coordinations among the computers when a central authority is far away or even does not exist. Adding to the challenges are that the computers may different powers and that communication links have different speeds and latencies. Therefore, it is nontrivial to develop algorithms from decentralized computing even from simple and classic problems.  This project has developed underlying mathematics that make it easy to develop efficient algorithms for decentralized computing. Because there are multiple goals in decentralized computing such as minimizing functions, solving equations, pursuing a consensus across the network, and reducing coordinations among the agents, the common literature tends to develop algorithms to solve one of them each time and then integrate different algorithms. We take a different approach, which has been demonstrated to be more effective. Our approach is to develop models in which achieving one or multiple goals amounts to ensuring the models to have the corresponding structures. For example, pursuing a consensus across the network corresponds to the linear system Wx = x, where the matrix W describes the connection of the network. Once models are built, deriving algorithms is relatively standard and easier, and the developed algorithms have become the state-of-the-arts.  Out of the above approach, the developed algorithms have accomplished several tasks: minimizing a combination of smooth and nonsmooth objective functions across many agents in the work, reaching consensus over the network, and allowing the agents to have different computing powers and to compute with the information they have received, though the up-to-date information is still being communicated to them over the network. We also ended up with algorithms that can solve nonconvex optimization problems. These algorithms are tested on both synthetic and real-world problems, and their performance compares favorably with the prior art.  The underlying mathematics, analysis, and numerical methods extend beyond decentralized computing, also leading to breakthroughs at parallel, distributed, asynchronous computing in general.   The results of this project include a series of papers published in top-tier peer-reviewed journals, open source software codes, as well as course slides and tutorials for education. Several students received financial supports and completed tasks in the project. While others are still working on the Ph.D.s, two have successfully defended and became data scientists. The PI and his group received a research medal and two best (student) paper awards.          Last Modified: 09/02/2017       Submitted by: Wotao Yin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
