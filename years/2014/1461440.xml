<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award will examine how major political and economic changes affect the ways in which ordinary people speak, imagine the future, and navigate moral decision making in their daily lives. During the last three decades, liberal models of democracy and neoliberal economic reforms, based on American political and economic doctrines, have brought about fundamental transformations in many countries of the global South. New emphases on democratic aspirations, transparency, entrepreneurialism, and human rights have been incorporated into political cultures formerly grounded in social hierarchy, secrecy, and fatalism. Understanding the role that key concepts of American political culture have in the transformations occurring in the emergent countries of the global South is critical for fostering geopolitical communication and stability through the development of programs and policies based on a deeper knowledge of culturally specific dimensions of moral and political reasoning. However, such understanding can only be acquired through attention to the micro-processes of daily life at the level of individuals and communities. Therefore, anthropologists who study the local-level effects of these major national shifts often take advantage of the natural experiment provided by the fact that once-isolated populations are now increasingly exposed for the first time to Western models of the goal-oriented political actor driven by rational choices, a situation that highlights the mechanisms involved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this research, linguistic anthropologist Dr. Aurora Donzelli (Sarah Lawrence College) will travel to the Toraja highlands of Sulawesi, Indonesia. This is an appropriate site for pursuing these questions because not only is Indonesia the world's second-fastest growing economy, it has also, since 1998, transitioned quickly from having highly centralized system of state-led development to a decentralized system based on market capitalism. As a result of this watershed transformation, the relatively remote Toraja have been confronted with a new rhetoric of democratic aspirations, a new world of actual goods and imaginable consumptions, and a new social legitimacy of personal ambition. The researcher will gather data on this complex transition from a moral regime centered on the social expectation that personal wants should remain hidden and unexpressed to a new acceptance of the public expression of individual ambition. To document the collision between these different moralities, she will conduct careful analysis of the linguistic and semiotic resources employed in two apparently unrelated domains of human sociality: the public sphere of political speechmaking and ritual exchange and the private domain of domestic interaction. Because the investigator first studied the Toraja over a decade ago, she has baseline data that will enable her to  undertake a longitudinal study of changes in their linguistic and moral practices that have resulted from national economic and political transformation. Findings from this research will provide material for comparative analyses of moral and linguistic transformations in the wake of social and political reform and will further the understanding of the linguistic, social, and cultural dynamics that support institutional transformations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, Indonesia has been the stage of a radical program of administrative decentralization and neoliberal reforms. During this three-year-long research project, linguistic anthropologist Aurora Donzelli (from Sarah Lawrence College) explored how these institutional transformations have affect the ways in which ordinary people speak, imagine the future, and navigate the moral decisions they make in their daily lives.   Drawing on fieldwork conducted in the Toraja highlands of Sulawesi and on data she had collected in the same region in the early 2000s, Donzelli analyzed the new genres of speech and affect display that have emerged as a consequence of the watershed transformation of Indonesia?s political economy and administration. The research has resulted in a book entitled "Methods of Desire: Language, Morality, and Affect in Neoliberal Indonesia" (forthcoming with University of Hawaii Press), which describes how, in the ReformasiEra begun after the end of Suharto?s regime, a nascent rhetoric of democratic aspirations and future possibilities and emerging worlds of actual goods and imaginable consumptions are giving new social legitimacy to personal desires and aspirations.   Drawing on data she collected both in the public arena of political and ritual speechmaking and in the private realm of domestic interaction, Donzelli argues that a largely overlooked aspect of the Reformasi Era concerns the transition from a moral regime centered on the expectation that desires should remain hidden to a new emphasis on the public expression of individual aspirations. This cultural transformation is to a large extent produced through the spreading of new discursive genres and textual artifacts. The data collected show how customer satisfaction surveys, training sessions, electoral mission statements,and fundraising auctions, and the diffusion of new textual artifacts such as checklists, flowcharts, and workflow diagrams are producing forms of citizenship, political participation, and moral agency that contrast with the longstanding epistemologies of secrecy typical of local styles of knowledge and power. Donzelli?s longitudinal ethnographic study examines how these foreign protocols are being received, absorbed, and readapted in a peripheral community of the Indonesian archipelago.   The book describes how the growing influence of transnational agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank has produced novel genres of speech and new cultural grammars of desire congruent with a neoliberal interpretation of the social order. Contrary to the idioms of melancholic longing and acquiescent nostalgia that have historically structured social relations in the Toraja highlands, the emergence of democratic hopes and the unprecedented availability of actual and imaginable commodities conjure a new social legitimacy of personal desires,saturating the local public discourse with an innovative spirit of cheerful eagerness and hopeful willingness. Customer satisfaction surveys produce new forms of citizenship by reconfiguring the individual as a bundle of desires that can be asserted, measured, and fulfilled, in contrast to the culturally deep-rooted reticence toward the expression of personal preferences. Electoral mission statements reform previous strategies of self-presentation by political candidates based on a theatrics of understatement and on the deployment of spokespersons, by introducing a novel model of willful and proactive political agency.
