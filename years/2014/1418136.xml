<AbstractNarration>Understanding evolution is fundamental to understanding contemporary biology, but many students do not understand the core ideas of evolutionary theory.  Students misinterpret phylogenetic trees, they misunderstand fundamental concepts of common ancestry, and they have a poor grasp of evolutionary time.  This project will address widespread misunderstandings related to evolution by developing and testing a new high school curriculum unit and assessment measures focusing on biological evolution.  The University of Utah Genetic Science Learning Center and the American Association for the Advancement of Science are collaborating to develop a curriculum unit that models integration of the three dimensions of the Next Generation Science Standards: disciplinary core ideas, science practices, and crosscutting concepts.  The new curriculum will also integrate Common Core Mathematics standards on reasoning abstractly and quantitatively, and an English Language Arts standard for writing arguments focused on discipline-specific content.  This project builds on a previously funded NSF project that developed and tested six prototype lessons on natural selection.  In classroom enactments the lessons showed preliminary promise for significantly increasing student understanding of natural selection and decreasing their misconceptions about natural selection and statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research and development project is based on the hypothesis that students will better understand the disciplinary core ideas about biological evolution when curriculum materials and instruction have certain identified features and when professional development experiences prepare teachers to use those materials and instructional practices.  The research questions and research plan are designed to test this hypothesis using a randomized controlled trial design that allows for iterative rounds of refinement.  The study will engage 20 teachers of grades 9-10 biology from across the U.S. who teach a diversity of students.  To conduct the research, the project will develop measures of student understanding and a measure of teacher content knowledge.  A measure of evidence-based evolution argumentation will also be developed for use with teachers and students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Evolution: DNA and the Unity of Life</em>&nbsp;is an eight-week, comprehensive curriculum unit for high school biology courses that sharply illuminates the underlying role of genetics in evolution by maintaining a conceptual connection to DNA and heredity throughout. Through paper-based and interactive multimedia lessons, the unit aligns with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) by engaging students in questioning, using models, identifying patterns, analyzing skill-level appropriate data from published scientific studies, and constructing evidence-based arguments.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The unit's lessons are organized into five modules - Shared Biochemistry, Common Ancestry, Heredity, Natural Selection, and Speciation. Each module is structured around a guiding question. The modules can be used individually or together in sequence. When used in their entirety and in the suggested sequence, the modules establish an understanding of DNA as a blueprint for all living things, and how it underlies variations in traits that are acted upon by natural selection leading to the diversity of life. A scaffolded claims-evidence-reasoning framework is integrated into the unit to incrementally build skill in constructing arguments from evidence over the course of the module sequence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The effectiveness of the unit for student learning was evaluated using a randomized control trial (RCT) design. Thirty-eight teachers of grade 9 or 10 biology from 23 states who teach in various types of locations (urban, suburban and rural) and whose students represent a diversity of demographics (race/ethnicity and socio-economic status) were recruited to participate in the evaluation; all teachers are in NGSS-adopting schools/districts/states. The teachers were randomly assigned to teach the new Evolution unit or their usual evolution unit. Participating students were randomly assigned to take one of four online test forms before studying evolution and a different test form at the end of their evolution unit. The assessment items had been rigorously developed through several rounds of testing with students across the US; the tests included (a) multiple-choice items and (b) writing items that asked them to construct arguments from evidence. Only data from students who completed both the before and after tests were included in the data analysis (new unit = 1,165 students; usual unit = 1,104 students).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We found a significant difference in learning gains (pre-test to post-test) between the two groups of students, with students in the group that used the new unit having higher gains (mean=0.99, SD=1.03) than students in the group that used their teacher?s usual unit (mean=0.44, SD=0.93). We also found a significant difference (<em>p &lt; .05)</em> between the two groups when we looked only at the post-test. These results indicate that students who used the new unit gained a higher level of understanding of evolution concepts than those in the usual-unit group.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All teachers were asked to submit daily online reports about the lessons they taught. We used these reports to understand and compare the critical features of the new and usual units. Nine lesson reports were randomly selected for each teacher. The largest differences between the two groups were in the frequency of large and small group discussions; these occurred in about 90 percent of the lessons for teachers using the new unit and 60 percent of the lessons for the usual units (<em>p</em> &lt; .0001). We also found significant differences (p &lt; .01-.0001) in the frequency that students engaged in the following activities, with students who used the new unit doing them more often: work with bar graphs and line graphs, analyze or interpret data, use technology (use computers or online lessons, view a video), and make arguments using evidence. This evidence suggests that the new unit provides more opportunities for student-centered, active learning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Evolution: DNA and the Unity of Life</em> is freely available online.
