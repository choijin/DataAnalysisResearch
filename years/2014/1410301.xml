<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Summary: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past several decades micro-devices and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have found uses as ink jet printers, accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, and digital light projectors and have become a multi-billion dollar industry. This study is motivated by the fact that a broader spectrum of MEMS materials would offer a wider range of functionality and fuel a greatly expanded assortment of MEMS applications.  Elevated temperature MEMS devices are of particular interest in: aviation, automotive, power generation, sub-sea drilling, and chemical processing industries in which MEMS sensing and guidance in harsh environments would provide enhanced feedback and control. Metal MEMS alloys that offer: high density, electrical and thermal conductivity, strength, ductility and toughness; low cost; and fabrication routes for complex geometries would be especially attractive for these applications.  But, highly engineered metallic alloys that can be sculpted with submicron resolution are currently not in the suite of available MEMS materials.  For this reason, an interdisciplinary team from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and General Electric Global Research (GEGR) has been formed to undertaking a collaborative program to develop Metal MEMS alloys for use as high temperature MEMS sensors and micro-switches.  Extended internships at GEGR will provide students with an invaluable perspective on systems level materials integration.  Participation in the SABES outreach program (an NSF-sponsored partnership between JHU and Baltimore City Public Schools) also provides the PI and his students with the chance to pay it forward by giving Baltimore elementary school students a unique perspective on STEM activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;An interdisciplinary team from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and General Electric Global Research (GEGR)is undertaking a collaborative program to develop metal MEMS alloys for high temperature MEMS sensors and micro-switches. The motivation for this collaboration lies in the desire to expand the MEMS material set beyond silicon to metallic alloys that can be deposited and shaped on the micro-scale and offer an attractive balance of properties: electrical and thermal conductivity, high density, low thermal expansion, strength, ductility, and toughness. The intellectual challenges to be addressed include the establishment of a science-based protocol for developing metal MEMS alloys that possess requisite physical and mechanical properties and can be used in extreme environments, e.g. temperatures of 300-500ÂºC for operational lifetimes exceeding one year. Candidate single- and multi-phase alloys have been identified and are being used to improve scientific understanding in five areas:  (i) techniques for processing and shaping metallic alloys at the micro-scale, (ii) alloy design for dimensional stability, (iii) unique microstructure-mechanical property pathways and relations in alloys deposited far-from-equilibrium, (iv) thermal and mechanical drivers for microstructural evolution, and (v) integration of metal MEMS alloys into commercial applications. Fundamental processing-structure-properties studies at JHU have been designed to provide a foundation for concurrent GEGR efforts on the development of next-generation MEMS switches and sensors. Extended internships at GEGR are planned and will provide the visiting graduate student with an invaluable perspective on systems level materials integration. Moreover, participation in the SABES program (an established NSF-sponsored partnership between JHU and Baltimore City Public Schools) provides the PI and his students the chance to give Baltimore elementary school students a unique perspective on STEM research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>An interdisciplinary team of researchers from Johns Hopkins University and General Electric Global Research collaborated to develop metal alloys that can be used for high temperature microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and switches. To date, the structural element of MEMS devices has been limited to a relatively small subset of materials and dominated by silicon. However, future applications will require high temperature materials with a robust balance of properties (e.g. high strength, electrical conductivity, dimensional stability and microscale manufacturability) and such materials are not currently available. The current study was motivated by the realization that the development of technologies to facilitate the deposition and micro-fabrication of metal MEMS devices hold great promise and will be required to realize what is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). This quest for MEMS materials with a balance of physical and mechanical properties led us to the synthesis of multi-component Ni alloy films.</p> <p>Single-phase solid solution nickel-molybdenum-tungsten (NiMoW) films&nbsp;were fabricated via high-power, direct current sputter deposition. Thecomposition was nominally 85 atomic percent Ni with a combinatorial balance of Mo and W. Characterization revealed ultrahigh strengths exceeding 3.5 GPa, exceptional thermal-mechanical stability and high electrical conductivity due to the presence of highly parallel nanotwins and stacking faults. High temperature heat-treatments can be used to tailor the mechanical response and obtain perfect elastic-plastic deformation behavior with very good strength and tensile ductility.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dimensional stability of layered structures requires matching the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the various layers. Si and glass, commonly used substrates for MEMS devices, have a lower CTE than Ni, but we were able to reduce the CTE of the alloy films with the addition of Mo and W. The CTE of the NiMoW films is significantly lower than pure Ni and point to our ability to tailor the CTE for various applications. One Mo-rich alloy is especially promising as it possesses a temperature independent CTE that that is very close to commercial glass substrates. Elucidating the effect of chemistry on the underlying nanostructure and properties enabled down selection of the most promising alloys.</p> <p>Armed with a novel and very promising new metal MEMS material, we undertook the steps necessary to show that we could manufacture simple MEMS devices, e.g. micro-cantilever beams, with appropriate dimensional control and reliability from room temperature through 400?C. Commercial sputtering chambers were used to fabricate NiMoW films and to demonstrate a wide processing window for future metal MEMS. Freestanding nanotwinned NiMoW micro-cantilever beams were micro-fabricated using traditional techniques in a class 100 cleanroom at the Singh Center for Nanotechnology. The shape (curvature) and deflection of the micro-cantilevers were measured with interferometry at GEGR, which was used to measure and control residual stresses as a function of processing parameters, position on the wafer and thermal cycling. Micro-cantilever arrays showed outstanding dimensional stability from ambient temperature through 400?C. Overall deflection ranged from tens of nanometers for the smallest cantilever up to a few micrometers for intermediate length beams.</p> <p>The broader impact of this project afforded us significant outreach activities with members of the Baltimore community that are not usually exposed to research. Professor Hemker and his research team participated in an outreach program, SABES (STEM Achievement in Baltimore Elementary Schools), as afterschool mentors. SABES is a partnership between JHU and NSF designed to promote the value of engineering to students in grades 3-5 in Baltimore City public schools. More specifically, the program is designed to enhance the students? knowledge of STEM directly related to their community. The Hemker team served as mentors and role models to the students at multiple elementary schools over the years to provide supplemental science support to both the students and the head facilitator. The Hemker team continues participation in this program as building relationships with young students at such an impressionable age can positively impact their interest and future in STEM related fields. Additionally, this NSF-GOALI contributed to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and the development of micro-scale mechanical testing and characterization tools. Micro-cantilever fabrication was carried out in part at the Singh Center for Nanotechnology as part of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure Program, which is supported by the NSF
