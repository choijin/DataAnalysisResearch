<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of  the 20 US participants to attend the "School  on Geometry and Dynamics" to be held from March 31-April 4, 2014, in Luminy/Marseille, France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school, which is hosted by the Centre International de Rencontres Math√©matiques (CIRM) in Luminy/Marseille, France, will be organized by international organizing and scientific committees. The PI and co-PI are on the organizing committee.  The lecturers are leading researchers in this field and have been chosen for their record of mentoring and nurturing young talent. The members of the organizing and scientific committees will participate as mentors to the young participants, and a small number of carefully picked additional senior participants will do the same. The schedule centers around five 3-hour courses and is designed to leave ample time for one-on-one interactions. The environment at CIRM is ideally suited for concentrated activity and maximal interaction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A diverse group of doctoral and postdoctoral students in the broad mathematical discipline of dynamical systems were enabled to participate in a 1-week school at the Centre International de Rencontres Math&eacute;matiques in southern France that   imparted a working knowledge of modern methods and ideas in the discipline through lectures, question-and-answer sessions and informal interaction across generations established relations with other areas of inquiry in modern mathematics connected them to peers across continents built their professional network to include senior mentors in Europe and the US developed their communication skills by providing a supportive environment for poster presentations, shorter lectures and informal exchanges provided exemplars, inspiration, and opportunity for honing skills in collaborative research  engendered progress on ongoing collaborative research projects    Strong financial support from the French host institution resulted in having residual funds available to support a similar school at the University of Houston in the summer of 2015 which had similar outcomes.   A discrete additional outcome is that for several of the lectures in this school as well as the lectures in a similar Fall 2013 school at the same institute, expanded lecture notes will be published in a single volume to make these insights more broadly available in the future.
