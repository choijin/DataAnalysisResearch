<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research award supports fundamental research on vibratory tissue cutting mechanics to improve needle insertion placement accuracy inside the body for cancer treatment and other medical procedures. This research will determine how vibrational tissue cutting force is related to vibrational parameters and needle cutting edge geometry with both fixed geometry and utilizing the novel concept of compliant tool geometry.  Vibratory tissue cutting mechanics will be investigated with a precision needle positioning machine that vibrates needles of varying compliant needle tip geometries. This research will also investigate how laser micro machining and multi-axis wire electrical discharge machining can be employed to produce small scale intricate needle tip geometries.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will provide knowledge of vibratory tissue cutting mechanics and novel microfabrication techniques.  Knowledge of vibratory tissue cutting will bring about the development of innovative minimally invasive medical instrument designs that improve procedure efficacy, reduce patient trauma, and reduce medical cost. Microfabrication knowledge gained will lead to new laser-based micro manufacturing and multi-axis electrical discharge machining techniques. These fabrication techniques will enable the future development of microstructured medical devices that have a larger range of sizes, shapes and materials than conventional microfabrication techniques can produce. This collaborative research project between Pennsylvania State University and North Carolina State University will also positively impact engineering education at these universities and enhance cross-disciplinary research collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

High insertion force creates excess pain, difficult to capture biopsies, and can hinder the accuracy of needle based radiation cancer treatment. Learning from mosquito&rsquo;s stealth and undetected maneuver, a research project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) has been focused on exploring using vibration to assist specially designed intricate needle tip with minimum resistance for medical treatment and applications. Researchers at Penn State University and North Carolina State University have successfully designed and fabricate an intricate needle tip for medical applications. This work developed and tested the innovative concept of compliant vibratory tissue cutting, where needles are designed to be compliant and vibration applied to create perpendicular cutting force as illustrated in the figures. Through experimentation it was found that compliant vibratory tissue cutting can significantly reduce the friction force upon insertion. A non-traditional manufacturing process using multi-axis electric discharging machining has been investigated and successfully developed to overcome the challenging issues faced in fabricating the intricately designed needles. Similar to performing sculpting at the tip of a needle, this process uniquely utilizes a foil electrode with an electrode block holder to fabricate the small slit on the needle shaft for vibrational compliant needle cutting. Funded by the National Science Foundation, this research project has successfully identified a possible solution for minimizing harmful insertion force.
