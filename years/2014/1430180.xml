<AbstractNarration>This project plans to dynamically test in the field an existing two-story reinforced concrete frame building infilled with unreinforced masonry walls. The building, located in El Centro, CA, was built in the 1920s and it is typical of the construction practice in California in that era. Buildings with similar characteristics are located in regions with high seismicity such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, the Mediterranean region, and Latin America. Such buildings often have historical significance but they have proved vulnerable to earthquakes. Understanding and improving their behavior has been a challenging task for engineers. The building selected in this study has sustained damage during earthquakes of 1940, 1979, and 1987 and 2010 which have been recorded in close proximity. The building was repaired and retrofitted after the first three earthquakes; however, the damage induced during the 2010 event cannot be repaired cost-effectively considering the economy in the area. Hence, the structure is scheduled to be demolished. This provides a unique opportunity to test a real life building using mobile shakers. The testing will be incremental and it is expected to bring the building on the verge of collapse. The unique experimental data from the field will enhance our understanding of the complex behavior of these structures and their failure mechanisms, and it will be useful for future analytical, as well as laboratory shake-table studies since it will provide benchmark data for researchers and practitioners involved with earthquake engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed research is to develop a framework for the reliable assessment of damage in existing reinforced concrete frames infilled with masonry walls. The data obtained from field testing will be used to validate finite element models and damage identification techniques. The combination of the two tools will allow the derivation of a damage index that can be used to identify the state of a structure prior or after an extreme event. Emphasis will be  given in modeling the three-dimensional behavior of the structure including the out-of-plane behavior of the infill walls. Moreover, simplified models will be developed and validated with the results of the detailed analytical models. The building that will be the focal point of this experimental and analytical study was selected because it has sustained considerable damage due to four historical earthquakes that have been recorded in close proximity. The data obtained from the forced vibrations of the building will be also used for the validation of the analytical tools. In summary, the proposed research includes full-scale tests that will push a damaged structure further into the nonlinear behavior; finite element models to capture the in- and out-of-plane interactions between the infills and the bounding frame; validation of the model with data obtained from the tests, as well as validation with data from previous earthquakes; and development and validation of a system and damage identification techniques for the quantification of damage in a real structure.</AbstractNarration>

The four major outcomes are discussed in more detail in the following sections. &nbsp;</p> <ol> </ol> <p><strong></strong><strong>1. Tests of Actual Buildings</strong></p> <ol> </ol> <p>The buildings shown in Figure 1 were tested using mobile shakers owned and operated by UCLA. The data obtained from the tests is used to validate (1) refined finite element models that are being developed to simulate the nonlinear behavior and the frame-infill interaction, and (2) system and damage identification techniques which can identify the location of damage and provide a measure of it.</p> <p>The goal of the tests was to understand the system-level dynamic response of the structures at different levels of excitation and examine the influence of the excitation direction, amplitude and frequency on the linear and nonlinear structural response. The first test-structure was a ten-story RC building deteriorated due to the severe winters of the upstate New York. The second structure, a two-story RC infilled building damaged due to four major earthquakes in the southern California. In both cases, damage was introduced to the buildings during the testing sequence, while the building in El Centro was further damaged by the mobile shaker which was able to push the structure into its nonlinear regime of response. Such structures can exhibit significant nonlinearity at relatively low drift ratios due to the activation of cracks in the infills and frame members. The tests provided insight as to how this affects the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the structure drastically enhancing our understanding of the seismic performance of actual RC structures. In fact, the frequencies dropped drastically while the deformed shape of the structure followed the linear mode shapes estimated at ambient level excitations.

The framework is based on an extensive parametric study investigating the influence of geometric, material, and design parameters on the load-transfer mechanism using a detailed finite element model. This procedure, validated with data from physically-tested structures, has been recently adopted by ASCE 41-17. A computationally efficient approach was proposed to simulate the seismic performance of these structures. The proposed framework utilizes the aforementioned analytical framework to calibrate diagonal struts used to simulate the effect of the masonry panels. This framework has been applied successfully to simulate the performance of laboratory specimens, the two test structures of Figure 1, and actual buildings instrumented with an array of accelerometers during two reconnaissance trips to Nepal. Their dynamic properties were obtained from ambient vibration recordings and are used to validate the numerical models, as shown in Figure 2. This method has been recently enhanced by the development and validation of a nonlinear material law to simulate the hysteretic behavior of infilled frames. The material law, implemented in OpenSEES can simulate the evolution of strength and stiffness as a function of the induced damage. The model is validated with components tested in the lab and the tested buildings.</p> <ol> </ol> <p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Graduate and Undergraduate Research and Education</strong></p> <ol> </ol> <p>This project has had a significant impact on the education of students at the University at Buffalo, Tufts University, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
