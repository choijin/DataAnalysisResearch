<AbstractNarration>Current parental control software does not provide parents and kids with the one tool they desperately want and need ? a method for halting cyber-aggression in progress, rather than reporting the event after it occurs. Although most cyberbullying and cyber-predation acts occur over an extended period of time, current programs can only detect acts based on keywords in text; they don?t offer tools to actually stop the abuse and they don?t capture context. Concern about cyberbullying and cyber-predation among parents and authorities has led to a booming parental control software market and to the passage of anti-cyberbullying laws in many states. The proposed innovation offers better recognition of cyber-abuse and as well as response capabilities; thereby providing a more dynamic, interactive, and empowering resource for youths and their parents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team has developed machine learning algorithms that are able to detect approximately 80% of cyberbullying communication, and 84% of predatory conversation. These algorithms were developed using data that was collected and labeled for research purposes. The algorithms need to be adapted for real-time communication, as well as continuously updated as additional data become available. The theoretical model for victim response is in development. The model identifies the type, context and severity of bullying or predation, along with categories of potential responses from which victims can choose. The team has completed the proof-of-concept and is ready to move forward with the development of a software prototype.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most frequently deployed rite of passage for youths when joining a social group is the ability to tease and be teased, to use slang appropriately, and to know the latest Netspeak. Unfortunately, youths use this same language online to bully and sexually harass others.  Concern about cyberbullying and cyberpredation among parents and authorities has led to a booming parental control software market and to the passage of anti-cyberbullying laws in many states. Unfortunately, youths continue to be victimized by bullies and sex offenders online. Most cybervictims survive these encounters, but they don?t emerge unscathed and are frequently unprepared to defend themselves against future attacks.     The intellectual merits of this project included a detailed analysis of the market for this software and face-to-face discussions with potential consumers and licensees. These activities resulted in the development of a software prototype to showcase the capabilities of our technology to provide dynamic language recognition and effective responses for victims.  The market research and customer interviews also determined that there was little demand for a consumer product.  Instead there was great interest in educational resources, community support, and building cybersafety into social media technologies that are designed for use by children ages 10-16.     The broader impacts of our project included the an increased understanding of the current state of the parental control software marketplace, the development of entrepreneurial capabilities at a small liberal arts college, and the development of a community forum (http://www.bullycenter.com) that is designed to develop community support for victims of cyberbullying, as well as their parents, teachers, and other concerned individuals and organizations.
