<AbstractNarration>Questions in number theory abound, some going back to the ancients.  While deceptively simple to state, they can be exceedingly difficult to solve.  In contrast, in topology (a subject that explores the part of geometry that is insensitive to perturbation) it can be difficult to state problems, but there are numerous established techniques for solving them.  It is the purpose of this proposal to use techniques in topology to solve long-standing open problems in number theory, and to use results in number theory to establish new and interesting projects in topology.  The central themes are that topology provides an incredibly flexible tool for doing computations of objects of importance in number theory, and that number theory provides very interesting examples of objects useful to topologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this proposal aims to establish number-theoretic conjectures of Malle and others in the setting of function fields using computations of the homology of Hurwitz spaces of branched covers.  We will further develop invariants of Lefschetz fibrations using this machinery.  In the opposite direction, we will use the arithmetic of etale cohomology to re-imagine the theory of p-compact groups as a form of arithmetic geometry.  These techniques should, for instance, lead to a further development of the representation theory of these objects.  Lastly, we will pursue computations in stable homotopy theory using arithmetic and geometric techniques via the chromatic homotopy theory program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "Homotopy theory and arithmetic: a dialogue" was intended as an exploration of the interrelationships between questions in number theory and techniques in geometry and topology.  In that regard, it was a success.  The PI and his collaborators have established new techniques for addressing distributional questions in arithmetic using new methods in topology.  While the PI's work has focused on distribution of class groups and Galois groups (symmetries of number systems), his postgraduate students have carried some of this research forward on the subject of elliptic curves (higher dimensional geometric objects central to much of modern number theory).  Additionally, the PI and his collaborators have established some new results exploring the geometric and topological content of a part of mathematical physics known as T-duality.  Their work has extended the known research in this area to a very large class of settings, and highlights the role of certain objects (Eilenberg-MacLane spaces) -- important in topology and category theory -- in physics.  This work has in turn lead to a better understanding of important conjectures concerning the topological content of certain algebraic invariants, known as K-theory.  Finally, the broader impacts of this proposal have been extensive, involving mentoring of research projects of undergraduate, PhD, and postgraduate scholars within the framework of the project.
