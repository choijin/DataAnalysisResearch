<AbstractNarration>The project develops and tests novel compressive sensing and sensor locating techniques that are adaptable to a myriad of different mobile robot designs while operable on today's wireless communication infrastructures. Unique in-situ laboratory and field experiments provide tangible results to scientists and other stakeholders that can be leveraged to advance these systems into future real-world hazard management scenarios. The research team develops new technological approaches that results in mobilizing more intelligent, automated "eyes and ears on the ground." Outreach efforts include: (i) integration of the activities with practitioners; (ii) Seminars/webcasts to audiences like environmental engineers and first responders; (iii) Annual technology day camps to attract middle-schoolers from under-represented groups to engineering; (iv) Demonstrations to local K-12 institutions; (v) Inclusion of the project themes to the regular curricula; and (vi) International collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project introduces Robotics 2.0; a framework that targets autonomous robots that are co-workers and co-protectors, adapting to and working with humans. The research team develops a Cyber-Control Network (CCN) to allow multiple fixed and mobile robotic environmental sensing and measurements to adapt quickly to the changing environment by dynamically linking sub-networks of actuation, sensing, and control together. The design of such CCN ControlWare, and compressive sensing architectures, could be adapted to other large-scale problems beyond disaster response, mitigation, and management, such as power grid monitoring and reconfiguration, or regional urban traffic operations to respond to traffic congestion and incidents. The robotic sensing platforms do not require a-priori knowledge of the hazardous and dynamically changing environments they are monitoring. The Robotics 2.0 framework allows to swiftly respond, to prepare, and to manage various types of disasters.</AbstractNarration>
