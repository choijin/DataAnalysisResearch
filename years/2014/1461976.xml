<AbstractNarration>The Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program has provided unique opportunities to stimulate and encourage the development of an infrastructure for collaboration between minority serving institutions and Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers that broadens participation and enhances diversity in materials research and education. This year marks the 10-year anniversary of the PREM program and an opportunity to showcase the science of PREM students (past and current) and discuss the lessons learned and successes of the program.  Towards these goals, the Materials Research Society (MRS) will host a two-day event during the Fall 2014 conference in Boston that will expand the professional development and networking program for PREM undergraduate students launched at its Fall 2013 Meeting.  As a result of this award 56 students from PREM institutions will attend the MRS meeting, receive mentoring advice from established materials scientists and present their research results in a MRS poster session.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 2015 MRS Fall Meeting:   MRS held a mentoring "open house" meeting where both graduate and undergraduate students from PREM, Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and MRS University Chapters were invited to come and learn about the MRS Mentoring program.  During the lunch, they learned about "The Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Relationship" and were given a complimentary copy of Alaina Levine?s book, "Networking for Nerds". They also received a complimentary career counseling session.   Other activities during the week included a student mixer where they were able to meet with other students from around the world, including representatives from MRS University Chapters, career development sessions, and a breakfast program entitled, "Off the Beaten Path:  Path-Making in the STEM Landscape".    24 students attended.  38% were from MSI?s, and 58% were Women in STEM.  2016 MRS Spring Meeting:  MRS once again invited undergraduate PREM students as well as URM students from MRS University Chapters to attend a Spring Meeting program similar to the programs held at the 2013 Fall  and 2014 Fall MRS Meetings including professional development, a poster competition, and a mentoring lunch.  Speaker, Alaina Levine, covered the topics of "Public Speaking and Communications" and "Poster Presentation Success."  For the poster competition, the students were judged on their poster presentation skills. The judges took into account how well they were able to communicate their science not only through their poster design but also verbally and through body language. The top three posters were selected and recognized. The students? agenda was expanded this year to include sessions on sustainability, social styles, social media for science communication, how to market themselves, and innovation.  Additionally, the students were matched with graduate student or postdoc mentors during a mentoring lunch program where the topic of Identifying and Seizing Value from Conference Participation was presented.  The mentees and mentors were encouraged to plan their schedules for the week so that they could attend some of the sessions together and make the most of their time at the MRS Meeting.  Mentors also "coached" mentees on their poster presentation skills to help prepare them for the competition.       Last Modified: 10/31/2016       Submitted by: J.
