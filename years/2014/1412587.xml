<AbstractNarration>For over 100 years, the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO; a cooperative professional-amateur organization) has been a model for citizen science, allowing amateur astronomers to participate in scientific discovery and providing material help for hands-on science education.  They are creating an invaluable resource for both the professional and amateur astronomer communities: a catalog containing accurate positions and brightnesses of over 100,00 bright stars through 5 or more photometric filters.  This catalog will enable a host of astronomical studies ranging from near-earth objects to gamma-ray bursts.  Tools will be provided for amateur astronomers, educators, and students to discover and categorize new variable stars. Advanced amateurs and summer students are participating in compiling this unique resource for observational astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey (APASS) will cover the entire sky and provide accurate, absolutely calibrated magnitudes through 5 bandpasses for all stars in the magnitude 7th to 17th magnitude range.  No comparable product exists or is contemplated in the near future.  Using private funds, the AAVSO has purchased off-the-shelf hardware and has been compiling observations of the entire sky in both hemispheres. NSF support will enable them to complete the all sky survey, make important improvements to the data quality and applicability, and create tools to use the final public release of the database.  The proposers present a 2-year plan to complete 100% sky coverage and improve the quality of the final data products.  Improvements include extending to brighter sources and to include more photometric bands.  This catalog will be of immeasurable value to the astronomical community by providing accurately-calibrated standard stars in every field on the sky, without the need to separately observe calibration fields or establish a magnitude reference scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Three decades ago, observational astronomy was revolutionized by the publication of dense catalogs of star positions.  Astronomers could now locate objects on old photographs or on new digital images by measuring their positions relative to known objects in the field of view.  Asteroid orbits were easier to obtain, and spacecraft could be navigated.  The enormous time sink of all-sky astrometric calibration was removed.  The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) has a similar need, as their goal is to provide accurate measures of the brightnesses of stars anywhere in the sky.  The AAVSO All-Sky Photometric Survey (APASS) was created and supported by NSF to accomplish the same thing for photometry, as accomplished for astrometry decades ago  - a dense mesh of well-calibrated stars across the entire sky.  With such a catalog of calibrated stars, accurate brightness measurements of known variable stars, new novae, even the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave events of neutron-star megers, can be made.  The APASS survey uses a northern (New Mexico) and a southern (CTIO) telescope system, where each system has twin 20cm astrographic telescopes on a single mount.  These systems surveyed the sky in 10-square-degree chunks, tiled to cover the entire sky.  Then, a second set were taken with center-to-corner offset in order to ensure the corners in the original set were given equal status.  Eight filters are used:  Johnson B and V for comparison with archival research, as well as current variable-star work; Sloan u',g',r',i'; and PanSTARRS z_s and Y.  Together, these cover the entire spectral range of the CCD sensors, with exposures for a given field done nearly simultaneously.  Angular resolution is about 2.6arcsec, with photometric accuracy around 0.02mag and astrometric accuracy around 0.15arcsec for well-exposed objects.  A short-exposure set covers stars from 7th to 12th magnitude; a long-exposure set covers stars from 10th to 17th magnitude.  Together, they bridge from the Tycho2 photometric catalog to the deeper SDSS and PanSTARRS catalogs.  In addition to the mean-magnitude catalog (which is available on the AAVSO website and VizieR), an epoch-photometry database (EPD), which contains all 4 billion time-tagged individual brightness estimates, can be queried from the AAVSO site.  The EPD measures can also be incorporated in the Light Curve Generator (which plots all measures from the AAVSO International Database for a specified object), and can be analyzed by the VStar tool.  The means catalog is used by the AAVSO Sequence Team to generate comparison star sequences around variable stars, as requested by members and researchers.  We will continue to improve the APASS survey with internal funding, through additional observations of marginal regions and improved calibration, to make it even more useful to the community.
