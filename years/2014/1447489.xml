<AbstractNarration>The six-year higher-education graduation rate has been around 59% for over 15 years; less than half of college graduates finish within 4 years. This has high human, economic and societal costs. The National Research Council has identified a critical need to develop innovative approaches to improve student retention, graduation, and workforce-preparedness. The objective of this project is to develop new computational methods to analyze large and diverse types of education and learning data to help (a) discover successful academic pathways for students; (b) improve pedagogy for instructors; and (c) enhance student persistence and retention for institutions. The project outcomes are designed to help students select courses that fit their needs, capabilities, and learning styles, and are likely to lead to (faster) graduation; help instructors to better meet student needs; and give advisors and institutions the analytics needed to improve retention and persistence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will produce new dynamical system modeling, collaborative filtering, and multi-task learning methods. Modeling the evolution of a student's knowledge using a dynamical state-space system is a key innovation; the proposed research will develop novel collaborative system identification and collaborative Kalman filtering techniques for grade prediction. Technical innovations include supervised learning approaches for evolving datasets, such as linear and non-linear multi-task learning and collaborative multi-regression models with controlled grouping of the latent variables. These innovations will coalesce into three pilot applications: DegreePlanner for students, CourseInsights for instructors, and StudentWatch for academic advisors.</AbstractNarration>

In particular college students? academic history, including high school grade-point averages, SAT scores, and college grades were incorporated  to develop new artificial intelligence based learning algorithms to help students make more personalized course selections.  In the future,  research outcomes from this project could lead to the transitioning educational technologies that could help students: - Identify the best courses for their career goals. - Pinpoint the best sequence of classes towards better learning and workforce readiness. - Plan their schedules and workloads based on how many hours of study a week each course would require. - Determine which topics they should review from previous classes to be successful in upcoming courses. - Decide which instructors and courses are best suited for their learning style. The project involved a collaborative effort from a team of multi-disciplinary researchers in computer science, higher education organization, information sciences and university administrators including the registrar, student advising services and institutional reporting. In particular, the project led to the publication of books that document the opportunities of data analytics in higher education and provided various use cases.
