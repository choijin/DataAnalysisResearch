<AbstractNarration>With this award,  the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Norito Takenaka of the University of Miami to develop asymmetric organocatalytic methods for carbon-carbon bond forming reactions including ketimine allylation and crotylation, periselective nitroalkene Diels-Alder reactions, and Claisen rearrangements.  These asymmetric reactions will be promoted by chiral Lewis base catalysts or Br√∏nsted acid catalysts, which are based on previously unexplored 1-azahelicenes.  Studies emphasizing understanding helicene-derived catalyst structures, reactivity and selectivity will also be undertaken to enhance mechanistic understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the rigorous training of undergraduate and graduate students in modern asymmetric synthesis, and broadening participation through the inclusion of researchers at the University of Miami from groups that have historically been underrepresented in sciences. The scientific broader impacts include the development of a fundamentally new class of chiral catalysts with advantages in efficiency, economy, and environmental friendliness over stoichiometric chiral reagents.  Such advances are expected to benefit the basic synthetic research community, as well as the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries that rely upon methods to access enantio-enriched small organic molecules.  The ease of handling these bench-stable catalysts adds to their likely impact upon industrial and academic science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drug therapy is among the most successful and reliable treatments for various health problems. However, it is impeded by limitations in chemists? ability to make the absolutely "correct" drug molecule in a timely and cost-effective manner.  Chemical synthesis is an area of chemistry dedicated to the preparation of organic molecules with defined three-dimensional structure (molecular shape), and is of paramount importance to the drug discovery and development because the function of a drug is determined by its overall shape.  The aims of this grant were directed at the development of new synthetic methods by exploiting previously unexplored molecules called azahelicenes as catalysts.  Such azahelicene-derived catalysts were found highly effective for a range of mechanistically unrelated chemical reactions, demonstrating their general utilities as tools for chemical synthesis. The synthetic methods developed in this project would allow chemists to take readily available materials and convert them to value-added compounds that are critical for the preparation of precious medicinally active agents and thus will not only accelerate the drug discovery and development but also lower the cost of prescription drugs.  The intellectual merit of this work includes new fundamental findings on the structure and functions of new helical-shaped catalysts, and new principles of catalyst design and chemical reactivity. This research provided structurally unique catalytic scaffolds with potential to impact a broad range of synthetic methodologies.  The broader impacts of this work includes new methodology advances for the selective synthesis of organic compounds that are critical to successful development of efficacious new therapeutics, and thus are clearly beneficial to the society in this regard. Furthermore, this project had several important features; (1) new catalysts, which can be used on other important reactions besides the ones that were studied by us, and thus are expected to have a broad impact on other scientists interested in accomplishing the above goals, (2) bench-stable (i.e., easy to handle) catalysts which made this study an appropriate independent project for undergraduate students and beginning graduate students. Overall, this work provided excellent training in asymmetric catalysis research for students at all levels, experience that will prepare them well for independent research careers, either in industry or academia.
