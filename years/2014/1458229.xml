<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the Archbold Biological Station (ABS), an internationally recognized not-for-profit biological field station in central Florida, to preserve and secure a unique, irreplaceable record of life in the Florida Scrub habitat of the Lake Wales Ridge, one of the Nation's most imperiled ecosystems.  The project targets approximately 270,000 specimens including arthropods plants, mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles.  Specimens will be digitized and imaged to increase online access to information about this unique collection from the Florida Scrub and surrounding environs.  Activities proposed will enhance advances in the biological sciences, promote benefits to conservation, and increase educational outreach.  For example, by offering more opportunities for use of the collection to inform research projects and other forms of student engagement, ABS's programs for students will be strengthened.  Furthermore, information about the collection will be shared during workshops with regional land managers and ABS will increase access to teaching specimens and exhibits for K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow Archbold Biological Station to curate and digitize its diverse collection.  This digitization effort will improve data accessibility to researchers and educators. A major focus of this project will be the arthropod collection (specifically the ants, scrub endemics, insect-flower visitors and dead wood insects) but other taxonomic groups will also be secured. Partnering with iDigBio will enable ABS to effectively database, image and migrate specimen data to the Internet.  Symbiota-linked portals will augment the ABS website, providing an excellent example of what a regional field station collection can achieve.  By posting the collection data online, ABS will make available a virtually complete biodiversity record and rich ecological data, enabling studies of biodiversity in ways that would be difficult to otherwise replicate. This increase in accessibility will also benefit educators and the conservation community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Archbold Biological Station (Archbold) is an internationally recognized not-for-profit biological field station in central Florida dedicated to long-term ecological research. Since 1941, as part of its science, education and conservation mission Archbold has built a diverse, multi-taxon, specimen-based collection used by staff scientists and multiple investigators from around the world. The Archbold Collection has a regional emphasis on central Florida and most importantly encompasses a unique, irreplaceable record of life in the Florida scrub habitat of the Lake Wales Ridge LWR including threatened, endangered and non-native species. This CSBR award enabled advances in the biological sciences, promoted benefits to conservation, increased educational outreach, and furthered Archbold's commitment to the secure long-term management of the collection.</p> <p>Intellectual merit. A major goal of this award was to database the collection and make it available online, building a holdings list for the multiple taxa. A total of 44,091 specimen records (approximately 27% of specimens) representing 11,566 species, were digitized, databased and posted online. These included: 34,720 arthropod specimens representing 9,326 species (Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network SCAN); 4,795 plant specimens representing 1,559 species (North America Network of Small Herbaria), 198 fish specimens representing 45 species; 2,507 herptile specimens representing 108 species; 1,474 bird specimens representing 491 species, and 397 mammals representing 37 (Consortium of Small Vertebrate Collections CSVColl). About 20% of the specimens (8,144) have images associated with the specimen record (2,534 arthropods, 4,782 plants, 198 fishes, 58 herptiles, and 572 birds). All these records will eventually be ingested by iDigBio and GBIF and to date they have ingested the Archbold plants and 34,720 arthropods. Archbold's arthropod collection is particularly rich, comprised of 16 orders of insects and the arachnids. Most insect species are beetles (40%), flies (11%), and bees, wasps and ants (28%). An extremely rich record of arthropod biodiversity, 5,812 species and 19,044 specimens, are reported from the 5,200-acre Archbold Biological Station location, likely one of the largest specimen-based collections and species lists known from any single location in North America.</p> <p>Archbold collection users now have excellent access via Symbiota-linked portals to specimen-level data for any number of potential analyses and studies. Downloads during the period of this award included 181,579 arthropod records and 72,561 plant records from iDigBio, indicating use has started and will accelerate in future years. Research projects targeted towards specific subsets of the databased collection are underway. Researchers are using the relational Flower Visitor records for networking analysis (10,868 records, 902 species) of the many insects:many plants database and a publication is in preparation on the 3,627 records, 97 species of the Lake Wales Ridge rare endemics dataset. During the period of the award 55 publications were published drawing from specimens in the Archbold collection. These publications did not necessarily stem directly from the award but indicate the extent to which the digitized collection is being used to support science. During the award 143 visiting researchers spent 1,700 days using the collection: the cataloging and re-organization of the collection enhanced the efficiency and quality of their visits. The acquisition of 7 full Cornell cabinets and associated drawers and trays and the donation of 4 additional full cabinets facilitated this complete re-organization of the arthropod collection, improving access and providing room for future growth.</p> <p>Broader Impacts: Increasing access to the Archbold Collection has enhanced its conservation value as a critical repository for species of the globally threatened Florida scrub, including some of the rarest species in N. America. Improvements to the collection were shared during two workshops with regional land managers (11 state and federal agencies and non-profits), which provided training for accessing collections on-line and collections management.</p> <p>From an education perspective over years of this award twelve 6-10 month resident research internships were supported, or partially supported, largely in the arthropod collection.
