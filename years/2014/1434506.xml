<AbstractNarration>Fatigue of materials is an important engineering science topic since it is one of the predominant causes of mechanical failure observed in applications ranging from aerospace to automotive, marine and industrial fields. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge to understand fatigue damage incubation, initiation and evolution. Of particular interest in this research is the case of magnesium since its alloys have properties that could lead to significant advances in weight reduction and energy savings.  Therefore, results of this research are expected to benefit the U.S. economy and society as it has the potential to improve the use of this very light metal alloys. The broader impact of this research targets the participation of academically underrepresented groups in STEM research and training. Specifically, students in the Community College of Philadelphia, which is the largest public institution in the city with a predominantly minority-based population, will be selected to conduct research with the investigators' group leveraging a comprehensive outreach plan focusing on the use of multiscale mechanics and simulation-based engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research approach supported by this award is based on the use of multiscale experimental mechanics coupled with physics-based computational modeling.  Specifically, the problem of identifying reliable precursors to fatigue damage is addressed by performing experiments at a scale at which grain level information is important and is linked to mechanical fields such as deformation, as well as to microstructural parameters and their evolution including twinning-detwinning, dislocation activity, cracking and their interactions. Experimental measurements at the grain scale will include full field optical as well as acoustic nondestructive datasets, which can be directly correlated with the mechanical behavior and similar nondestructive measurements made at the macroscale. Such experimental information could provide a microstructure-sensitive explanation of macroscopically observed fatigue behavior effects including plastic anisotropy, tension-compression asymmetry and deformation banding. The experimental information will be also used to form novel computational procedures capable to model fatigue-induced changes in the material microstructure. Specifically, molecular dynamics will be used to study twin nucleation and thickening at the single crystal level. Furthermore, crystal plasticity simulations will be used to simulate spatially resolved twins and their interactions with slip systems and grain boundaries to validate observations made in magnesium polycrystals. Furthermore, crystal plasticity and continuum phase field models will be used to model experimentally observed and fatigue-induced localized strain formations which are related to damage initiation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Year 3-09/01/2017-08/31/2018     [Major Activities]  There are three fundamental questions in this award:  1.What is the role of twinning/detwinning in fatigue damage initiation?  2.How does surface morphology evolution influence fatigue damage initiation?  3.How can physics-based modeling effectively use experimental fatigue observations?  With partial funding provided by this award, the research team: a) successfully procured and installed the GATAN MTEST2000 in Year 1 of this grant; b) successfully performed monotonic loading focusing on microstructural effects of Magnesium fatigue while in Year 2 and c) successfully extended this approach to cyclic loading in Year 3. The key innovation in this Year was the direct observation of twinning activity during one complete cycle of loading of polycrystalline Mg AZ31. This activity was also correlated with strain measurements so that the relationship between spatially varying twin activity and strain evolution during cyclic loading. Such measurements were reported for the first time to the PI?s knowledge and contribute to questions 1-2 above. With respect to the 3rd fundamental question above, the PI has combined experimental information with plasticity modeling to capture the mechanistic effects of strain localization on damage initiation in Mg alloys.  In Year 4 emphasis has been placed on two issues: a) the examination of dislocation substructures that should be taken into account when modeling hexagonal metal alloy deformation and b) the extension of the simulation framework developed in Year 3 into cases where gradient terms could be incorporated into the model so that the length scale of strain localizations that appear due to twinning are captured.  [Specific Objectives]  Based on the time schedule and work plan of this research project the following tasks were targeted in Year 3:  Task #1: Mechanical Testing: SEM scale experiments of cyclic loading (tension-compression) were conducted using Mg AZ31 specimens in accordance with the technical plan proposed. The testing procedure was successful and allowed the recording of hysteretic and anisotropic stress-strain curves as expected for this type of alloy. Testing of single crystals at the laboratory scale was also performed which complemented the specimen level monotonic and cyclic tests.  Task#2: In situ and multimodal NDE: The experimental mechanics approach in Task #1 was complemented by Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) consisting of optical DIC measurements combined with acoustic monitoring, as well with both in situ and ex situ surface characterization using EBSD measurements. The coupling between in situ mechanical testing and in situ NDE and EBSD measurements originally suggested was successful. This type of coupling occurs for the first time to the PI?s best knowledge and was a fundamental step to achieve the goals of this award.  Task #3: Identification of Measurable Microstructural Parameters: Strain localization measurements in cyclic loading experiments and their relationship with twinning activity was targeted in Year 4. Specifically, the effect of such spatially varying strains in microscopic plasticity of Mg AZ31 specimens was investigated. The results obtained provide decisive evidence that such strain localizations are directly associated with twinning activity. In addition, the combination of the available datasets demonstrated that some of the extracted AE features can also be used to track microstructural evolution during cyclic loading of Mg specimens. Both of these conclusions, reinforce the hypothesis made in this award that twinning activity and the associated texture changes are measurable microstructural parameters that can be used both for monitoring of the overall fatigue behavior as well as inputs to computational modeling.  Task #4: Definition of a Novel Fatigue Mechanics Framework: Our overall objective in this task is to use the information generated in tasks 1-3 in a microstructure-properties-behavior mechanics framework by numerically simulating strain localizations in Mg alloys and connecting it to macroscopically observed plasticity effects, e.g. sigmoidal type stress-strain behavior and anisotropic hardening. To this aim, a novel computational method using user-defined subroutines in a Finite Element approach was developed. This computational approach was successful during monotonic loading to demonstrate that strain localizations can be used as an indicator of localized changes associated with effects in the bulk response. In Year 4 the experimental and computational results from the previous years were used to specifically track a mathematical derivation based on continuum thermodynamics and plasticity theory to formulate descriptions that result in length scale descriptions for such strain localizations.  Task #8: Constitutive Modeling of Strain Localizations: Efforts were made to use the definition of length scales in a plasticity framework to create mathematical formulations using the Finite Element method that could include such strain localizations and therefore validate the experimental observations in this program that relate plastic instabilities with microstructural changes caused by deformation twinning.
