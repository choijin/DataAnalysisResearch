<AbstractNarration>The years between childhood and adulthood are universally recognized as a stage in normal human development. But despite the fact that scientists know that adolescence is understood and experienced differently in different cultures and societies, most studies of adolescents have taken place in Western societies. Therefore, much remains unknown about this significant period of human development. For this reason, anthropologists have recently directed increased attention to studying adolescents cross-culturally. This particular award is to a research team who ask a particularly important and timely question about the adolescent years: what are the effects of growing up in a violent environment? Unfortunately, violence is part of the daily reality for many adolescents around the world, including many in the United States. Examining the effects of violence on the adolescent years in a non-Western context will allow social scientists and policy makers to differentiate between effects that are local and cultural, and those that are universal, which is essential for developing effective strategies for buffering the effects of violence on adolescents wherever they might live. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team is comprised of cultural anthropologist Dr. Bilinda S. Straight (Western Michigan University) and biological anthropologist Dr. Ivy L. Pike (University of Arizona).  The research will be carried out in a conflict-ridden pastoralist zone of East Africa where the researchers have previously collected comparative, longitudinal data on 215 households in pastoralist communities that vary by their exposure to violence. The researchers will build on that data with a sample of 660 young people. They will (1) examine the daily movements of adolescent girls and boys (ages 10-19) between settlement and pasture, cattle camp, and other activity sites; (2) monitor energy expenditure with fitness tracking devices and activity recall combined with nutritional assessments using anthropometry and dietary recall; (3) measure adolescent psychosocial stress through multiple bio-markers, validated assessment instruments, and intensive ethnographic interviews; and (4) elicit the choices, explanations, and emotions of adolescent boys and girls in the context of their varied daily experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Young people in Africa are at a higher risk for death than in any other region. Africa&rsquo;s pastoralist young people face even tougher odds, with reduced access to clinics, hospitals, and potable water.&nbsp; In addition, many of the world&rsquo;s armed conflicts are concentrated in pastoralist zones across the Sahelian region, the Horn, and East Africa. Within Kenya, pastoralist communities experience considerable political and economic marginalization as they struggle to maintain the only sustainable subsistence livelihood these semi-arid regions can support.&nbsp; Related to this, chronic small wars, climate change-exacerbated drought, and poverty levels well below Kenya&rsquo;s national average contribute to considerable suffering and stress. Scholars in health, medicine, and social science have increasingly turned their attention to the importance of adolescent health as an indicator of life-long well-being, particularly for the world&rsquo;s poorest, but data remain scarce, particularly for African pastoralist adolescents who are vulnerable yet elusive due to their daily mobility. &nbsp;Using a comparative approach, this project examined adolescent boys and girls (ages 10-19 years) a) as they traveled between pasture, school, markets, and home; b) examined emotional and physical health using biomarkers and interviews; c) created the opportunity for young people to describe and document their daily lives with intensive interviews and photography.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;While data analyses are still ongoing, several interesting findings have emerged in the early stages of analysis.&nbsp; First, based on pedometer and accelerometer (wrist-worn distance trackers) the team found that pastoralist young people walk further, on average, than any other community recorded.&nbsp; Indeed, we have pedometer readings that average fifty-five miles in a 48-hour period!&nbsp;Second, these long distances go a long way toward explaining the notoriously low body mass index levels reported for pastoralist communities, but adolescent pastoralists more specifically.&nbsp; Third, in the first round of data collection we gave young people cameras to document their daily lives.&nbsp; The photos they returned richly document a connection to place, animals, and the importance of friends and families.&nbsp; In addition, the second round of photographers were bolder in their efforts with even more photos of friends, family, and animals.&nbsp; &nbsp;Interestingly, few of the photographers worked alone but rather preferred to work in teams, making it clear that for the teenagers in these communities, multiple voices telling an agreed upon story was a more comfortable approach.&nbsp; Finally, our intensive interviews revealed important nuances of pastoralist teens daily lives.&nbsp; For example, one young man was particularly interested in breeding drought-resistant goats that were desired for their tasty meat.&nbsp; In one field site, the 13-15 year old teenage girls refused to share their hopes for the future but in interviews with the 18 year old girls, the young women talked about the trouble with being married so young (it is rare to be unmarried at the age of 17).&nbsp; There is much to glean about teenagers&rsquo; daily experiences from these rich interviews.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;Training U.S. and Kenyan students has been central to the mission of this project.&nbsp; Working with our Kenyan collaborator, Dr. Owuor Olungah, we trained five University of Nairobi students in field methods and biomarker techniques.&nbsp; One of these Kenyan students accompanied the team for every field season and was accepted into an MA program in the U.S.&nbsp; A Kenyan nurse who just completed her MPH degree in the US joined the team to assist us with biomarker collection in 2016.&nbsp; A master's student from the University of Arizona submitted and received a Research Experience for Graduate Students Supplement (REG).&nbsp; In addition, we had one undergraduate student join the team to conduct a participatory video project.&nbsp; We trained two undergraduate students from the local communities to learn new research methods and to gain experience as community facillitators.&nbsp; One of the students completed a degree in community nursing and the other one just completed his degree in statistics.&nbsp; Our team of Kenyan research assistants, all from vulnerable pastoralist communities, will gain additional work skills and training, especially computer based and digital technology training.&nbsp; Finally, two minority undergraduate students from the University of Arizona were trained in data entry, data cleaning, and in lab methods to prepare for the analysis of the biomarkers.&nbsp;</p> <p>We returned the data to the communities for approval and solicited the communities advice for how best to share our results.&nbsp; The community suggested we take our final report to the District Commissioner but also share our findings with the local health clinics, tasks we completed in March of 2018.&nbsp; For the proposed project we will work with local NGOs to develop a nutritional outreach program.&nbsp; Finally, summary findings will be delivered to the World Food Program / USAID Food For Peace teams who are monitoring food security in the pastoralist zones of northern Kenya.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Ivy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Pike</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430790/1430790_10328180_1543778654037_IMG_0108--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430790/1430790_10328180_1543778654037_IMG_0108--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dance Moves"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430790/1430790_10328180_1543778654037_IMG_0108--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dance Moves"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Practicing "elevated" dancing skills</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lokibet</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ivy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Pike</div> <div class="imageTitle">Dance Moves</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430790/1430790_10328180_1543779665788_IMG_0284--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430790/1430790_10328180_1543779665788_IMG_0284--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Photovoice Training"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430790/1430790_10328180_1543779665788_IMG_0284--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Photovoice Training"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Young Pokot teenager trains others how to use cameras for photovoice project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Akimet</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ivy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Pike</div> <div class="imageTitle">Photovoice Training</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430790/1430790_10328180_1543781235545_howwestarttheday--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430790/1430790_10328180_1543781235545_howwestarttheday--rgov-800width.jpg" title="homestead herd"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430790/1430790_10328180_1543781235545_howwestarttheday--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="homestead herd"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We start our day with the herds</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kanyakera</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ivy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Pike</div> <div class="imageTitle">homestead herd</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
