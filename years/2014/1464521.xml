<AbstractNarration>The global electrical energy consumption is rising rapidly and there is a demand to double the power capacity within the next 15-20 years. The production, distribution and use of energy should be as efficient as possible. Power management technologies are widely used in many electronics and energy systems including wireless mobile devices, notepads, PC and laptops, photovoltaic and power systems, bio-sensors, automobiles, hydro power, biomass, geothermal, solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, wind power, etc. These applications and distributed energy resources require a new integrated power electronic technology.  The Power One IC center is a network of academic and industry leaders who aim to develop an integrated power and energy management for these applications. The center is a multi-university NSF I/UCRC that is led by Arizona State University (ASU) in partnership with The University of Colorado at Boulder (CU-Boulder), The Ohio State University (OSU), and Dartmouth College (DC). The power management (PM) block is a critical component of any electronics, and energy systems. This block acts in the same way as the heart which controls and regulates the flow of blood to various body part. The PM system task is to efficiently regulate, control, and convert energy to assure efficient delivery of energy to various components of the system. Most of the existing system use external bulky discrete devices for power management. The objective of this center is to develop fully integrated power management within the system to develop fully autonomous and integrated systems on a chip.  Power One will address issues ranging from system level power management, to circuits, devices, materials, and Integrated Circuits. The center will develop innovative research combined with educational components to address energy management. Creating this new knowledge will advance the next generation of  fully autonomous systems with power and energy management as an integrated part of the system. These cutting-edge power management solutions will make a significant impact in the efficiency and cost of all portable electronics, cellular wireless systems, computers, multi-media, lighting, renewable energy, electronic vehicles, etc. Power Management IC (PMIC) is at the heart of this technological revolution and is the key component to every electronic system in our modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrated circuits have revolutionized computing, communication, and information technology, which, in turn, have enabled new economic and social paradigms that have improved standards of living, access to information, and productivity. However, energy management and efficient energy control and conversion has become major bottlenecks that limit the ongoing scaling of size, performance, cost, and battery life. A solution to the power-management bottleneck is within reach, but requires a comprehensive system effort that ties together a diverse group of stakeholders and researchers from systems, to Integrated System, IC, electronics, and materials. The Power One IC center will target a range of innovations that leverage emerging systems, high-density power management circuits and components, next generation devices, and new classes of power electronic circuits that can fundamentally shift the tradeoffs among efficiency, size, and cost. Through Power One IC's world-class research and education, along with leading edge industrial partners and graduate students, we are working together across the spectrum to develop an integrated autonomous system with energy and power management on a chip. The results of the center research will impact renewable energy, PV and solar energy, efficient inverters and power/voltage converters, efficient management and use of energy in portable electronics and computers, as well as remote sensors and bioelectronics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ After a successful meeting and positive feedback, the Power One site directors were notified of a possible center overlap.  While this concern had been raised prior to the award of the planning grant, the issue arose again.   The site directors were requested to reach out to current centers MIST and CEHMS to discuss this possible overlap.  The directors of MIST and CEHMS were to report back to NSF their findings from the discussions.  With the discussions completed and the reports sent to NSF, the Power One site directors were notified by NSF that if they decide to move forward with a full proposal, questions might be raised by reviewers and the panel with regards to the research focus overlap, member overlap and Power OneÃ†s long term sustainability given the up-front imposed limitation the center might be forced to make in order to justify a standalone center not in conflict with the existing ones, particularly MIST.  The decision to submit a proposal was left to the site directors, but with the strong advisory given, the site directors felt a proposal with NSF was not in the best interest of the industry members and researchers who seriously see Power One as a viable center.
