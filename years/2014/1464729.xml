<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism B Program is supporting Professor Joseph P. Dinnocenzo at the University of Rochester to investigate the selective formation of highly reactive aryl radicals under mild conditions. The mechanistic insight gained from these studies can provide the knowledge necessary to rationally utilize the chemistry in synthesis and in the design of new materials. In addition, research on newly discovered cationic exciplexes and exciplexes that exhibit dual emissions will provide knowledge on these novel excited state intermediates. Research to better understand the fundamental photophysical properties these exciplexes intermediates will provide valuable knowledge for the design of efficient photoinduced electron transfer reactions and for potential use in sensing applications.  Student co-workers will learn to carry out chemical syntheis and to conduct mechanistic studies in photochemistry. including a range of less traditional techniques (fluorometry, transient absorption spectroscopy, time-correlated single photon counting, electrochemistry, and modern computational methods). Thus, students trained with NSF support will be well prepared to tackle a variety of multidisciplinary problems in their professional, scientific careers.This project will also benefit undergraduate students through the NSF REU summer program at the University of Rochester with particular attention paid to recruiting students from groups traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work in the Dinnocenzo laboratory has revealed that aryltrialkylstannane cation radicals undergo nucleophile-assisted fragmentation reactions in which less stable aryl radicals are often formed in preference to more stable alkyl radicals  - an seemingly contrathermodynamic result. This selectivity is unprecedented in ion radical chemistry. Proposed research will test the generality of these remarkable results by exploring the fragmentation reactions of aryltrialkyl-germane and -silane cation radicals through the combined use of synthesis, steady-state photooxidation experiments, and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. In addition, two types of novel, charge-transfer exciplex intermediates recently discovered in the Dinnocenzo laboratory will be investigated. One type of exciplex is formed by reaction of cationic, excited state acceptors with neutral donors, which leads to the formation of emissive cationic exciplexes that are without precedent. Research objectives include determining the electronic nature of the exciplexes (e.g. electronic coupling matrix elements) through theoretical fitting of the radiative lifetimes of the exciplexes (determined by time-correlated single photon counting) and their fluorescence spectra, exploring the generality of cationic exciplexes, and measuring some of their photophysical properties. A related project will investigate examples uncovered in the PI's lab where two exciplex emissions are observed from a single acceptor and donor. Preliminary results indicate dramatically different solvent reorganization energies for the two types of exciplexes. Proposed research will determine the electronic properties of the exciplexes and explore their generality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major project goals was to explore the novel fragmentations of aryltrialkylorgano-germane, and &#8209;silane cation radicals in the presence of nucleophiles and to elucidate the mechanism(s) for the reactions.  Research results demonstrated that these cation radicals undergo nucleophile-assisted fragmentation reactions in which less stable aryl radicals are often formed in preference to more stable alkyl radicals &ndash; a selectivity that is unprecedented in ion radical chemistry and one that may prove useful in generating highly reactive radicals for use in small molecule and polymer synthesis.  A second major goal was to explore a new class of charge-transfer exciplex intermediates recently discovered in the PI's laboratory formed from reaction of cationic, excited state acceptors with neutral donors. This chemistry leads to the formation of emissive cationic exciplexes that are without precedent. The cationic exciplexes have been characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy and their lifetimes measured by a state-of-the-art time-correlated single photon counting apparatus constructed with funds from the grant.  The spectroscopic and kinetic properties of the exciplexes were analyzed by using a standard theoretical model to determine key electronic parameters.  Chief among these is the electronic coupling matrix element H12between the pure charge transfer and the locally excited states.  Unexpectedly, we found that H12is actually larger for the cationic exciplexes than for the conventional exciplexes, despite the absence of coulombic stabilization in the cationic exciplexes. We also discovered that the cationic exciplexes have the exciting feature that they can be easily detected in water.  Among other things, this provides opportunities for new sensing applications in biological systems.  The grant has provided research training for two graduate students and several undergraduate students from the University of Guam.  In addition, a supplement to the grant provided a summer research opportunity for a chemistry faculty from the University of Guam.
