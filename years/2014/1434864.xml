<AbstractNarration>The Lagrangian drift associated with ocean surface waves, known as Stokes Drift, plays an important role in the ocean surface boundary layer dynamics and in particular the small-scale (nominally a few kilometers) diffusion of passive tracers. Thus it is important for the break-up and dispersion of oil spills or sewage outflow, and transport of material in the upper ocean and near the coast in general. Considerable theoretical advances have been made over the last few decades, but the lack of direct observations hampers progress on the role of Stokes Drift in material transport in the upper ocean. The collection of new observations and development of theoretical and numerical models will advance the current understanding of these dynamics in realistic wave conditions in both the open ocean and the coastal environment. The nonlinear Lagrangian theory and sea surface kinematics simulations developed in this project will provide a general framework for the analysis and interpretation of measurements of surface-following moored buoys, drifters, and remote sensing systems. The findings from this study will provide a framework towards understanding and predicting wave-driven material transport processes, including the break-up of surface slicks and transport of larvae, and will contribute to more effective disaster mitigation and coastal ecology protection programs. The development of small, low-power, inexpensive drifters with satellite communication and sustainable energy sources, which can resolve both surface waves and surface drift fluctuations, is an important step toward more ambitious, global applications. Large arrays of these types of instruments can be used to monitor ocean waves, surf zone motions, mean surface currents, and surface temperature and salinity. A post-doctoral fellow will be trained in both observational and modeling techniques in the upper ocean and summer undergraduate interns will be exposed to the research process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lagrangian near-surface drift of ocean surface waves (Stokes Drift) is still poorly understood and no direct measurements have been reported. In particular, very little is known about random fluctuations in the Stokes Drift that are believed to be important to upper ocean diffusion processes. Detailed observations of the fluctuating surface drift in the upper ocean due to surface waves will be obtained, building on the investigators' recent development of small, wave-resolving drifters. Approximately 25 drifters will be deployed in homogeneous, open ocean conditions and in a more complex coastal environment with variable depth and currents, to observe the near surface kinematics and particle dispersion. To interpret the drifter data and develop a better understanding of the effects of nonlinearity and directional spreading on the surface drift and diffusion statistics, a Lagrangian theory for the surface kinematics in a random wave field will be developed. The theory will be extended to include random, small-scale medium variations (e.g. bottom topography and ambient currents), and augmented with direct numerical integration of the surface momentum balance to simulate more complex conditions with strong nonlinearity and/or rapid medium variations. Then, observations will be compared to theory and numerical simulations, and the relative contribution of Stokes Drift fluctuations to the observed particle diffusion will be evaluated to gain a better understanding of the role of waves in material transport and diffusion, both offshore and near the coast.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ocean surface waves play a dominant role in the dynamics of the upper ocean and the near-shore environment.  Accurate models of the kinematics and hydrodynamic forces induced by waves are critical for many societal needs, including the mitigation of beach erosion, marine recreational safety (e.g swimming, surfing and boating), the prediction of the mixing and dispersion of pollutants and the break-up of oil spills, and the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data.  In this project we believe we have developed a better understanding and an improved model of the wave orbital motion near the sea surface and the associated surface drift.  We expect that these results can be used in a variety of applications to improve predictions of ocean surface wave conditions and associated environmental hazards.  The prediction of wave motion near the sea surface is complicated by the moving surface boundary.  Heuristic conventional methods that estimate wave crest velocities based on extrapolation from the mean sea surface yield reasonable results for narrow-band swell conditions, but break down in broad-band wind-sea conditions.  We developed a new consistent approximation for the wave-induced velocity field based on weakly nonlinear, second-order wave theory and using a boundary-fitted coordinate system (i.e. ?sigma?or s-coordinates). Comparison to a numerical model valid for highly nonlinear waves shows that the new approximation yields greatly improved estimates of wave crest kinematics in random seas.   Whereas the dominant wave motion is orbital in nature, owing to nonlinearity the orbital trajectories do not close, causing a mean drift known as "Stokes drift".  This phenomenon is believed to be important in upper ocean mixing, and has been the subject of many studies. We used second-order wave theory to examine in more detail the properties of Stokes drift in a natural random sea state.  This analysis revealed large fluctuations in the Stokes drift with typical time scales of a few minutes.  Drifting buoy observations confirm the existence of large Stokes drift fluctuations, in agreement with the theory.
