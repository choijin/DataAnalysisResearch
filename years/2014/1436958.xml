<AbstractNarration>In this project, a group of investigators participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will measure profiles of actinium-227, a naturally-occurring radioisotope that can be used as a tracer of oceanic water movement, in the Arctic Ocean. In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. The isotope measured as part of this study, actinium-227, has a 22 year half-life, making it well-suited as a tracer of mixing and solute transport in the Arctic Ocean. This study will involve educational opportunities in scientific research for high school and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantifying the biogeochemical dynamics of the deep sea is necessary to understand the ocean carbon cycle. Despite having a half-life that is well suited for the study of both vertical and lateral transport in the deep ocean, few actinium-227 measurements have been made in the deep sea. Recent advances in instrumentation facilitate this analysis, and the synergy provided by the GEOTRACES program will provide an ideal opportunity to obtain additional data that will serve two purposes. The measurements of actinium-227 from this study will aid in defining the rates of boundary exchange, particularly when combined with estimates based on radium-228 (measured as part of a separate award) and will be useful for deducing the transport and the dynamics of other solutes measured by GEOTRACES in deep waters. By using multiple tracers with different half-lives, the separate roles of these processes may be distinguished, allowing a more complete understanding of the dynamics of solute behaviors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  227Ac is a naturally-occurring radioactive isotope with a 22 year half-life.  Its distribution may serve as a clock for defining the rates of mixing and sediment-water exchange in the ocean.  The rates that are calculated based on 227Ac may be applied to other solutes, including nutrients and metals that are important to ecosystem dynamics. This proposal requested funding to measure 227Ac profiles on the GEOTRACES Arctic transect, a section extending from Dutch Harbor, through the Bering Sea and across the Western Basin to near the North Pole.  Scientific Merit:  Despite having a half-life that is well suited for the study of both vertical and lateral transport in the deep ocean, few 227Ac measurements have been made in the deep sea, with only one profile measured in the Arctic.  Recent advances in instrumentation have facilitated this analysis, and the synergy provided by the GEOTRACES program provides an ideal opportunity to obtain additional data. Prior to this cruise, model calculations indicated that Arctic sediments should supply actinium at a rate that would provide a clear signal of the input and mixing.  Bioturbation, the mixing activities of bottom-dwelling organisms, was expected to enhance this input.  Results from our study indicated very different dynamics.  Shallow water Arctic sediments must be characterized by a high biotubation rate, sufficient to create a measurable signal in surface waters. However, the analytical uncertainty in surface waters is sufficiently large that it obscures concentration gradients in the surface water, limiting its value for finding mixing rates in this part of the water column.  In deep waters, there is only a very modest input of actinium from the bottom sediments, indicating that bioturbation in these deeper water sediments must be minimal. The low rate of bioturbation undoubtedly reflects the low productivity in the surface waters, limiting the food supply for bottom-dwelling organisms.  Profiles of actinium in the water column indicate that horizontal transport in the deep Arctic appears to be at least as important as vertical transport in governing actinium distribution.  In addition to the Arctic work, an opportunity to participate in a cruise of opportunity to the North Pacific allowed new insights to be developed into the dynamics of actinium and silicic acid in these deep waters.  Silic acid is an essential nutrient for diatom growth, a phytoplankton group that plays a key role in the dynamics of the ocean carbon system.  Broader Impacts:  Quantifying the biogeochemical dynamics of the deep sea is necessary to understand the ocean carbon cycle.  Defining these dynamics requires knowledge of boundary exchanges and water column transport patterns and rates.  Dynamics for actinium can be applied to interpret concentration fields of other, biogeochemically important solutes. While the water column actinium signals were less pronounced than expected, they provide evidence that benthic activity in shallow waters is very high, and it is extremely low in deep waters. This observation provides a benchmark for present-day behavior that may be compared to future behavior as a rapidly-changing Arctic evolves.  This project also provided training for 3 students who are now pursuing careers in Earth and Ocean Science.  Analytical refinements in the Radecc technique developed under this funding will be useful for future analyses of radium and actinium isotopes in other settings, including other deep sea basins and possibly groundwater hydrology.
