<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for  CoPI Hunter Snyder, who is a research associate at the Arctic Studies Center, to travel to Greenland to do pre-Dissertation Improvement Grant proposal consultation with local scholars and community members.   In addition, the CoPI would do a proof of concept for his Photovoices methodology in Greenland by engaging in trial video education and production training with local community youth.   The eventual topic for the video is how the Inuit balance between traditional hunting and fishing and prospective work in the newly developing mining industry.  Building on over 4,000 years of Inuit storytelling, and the CoPI?s expertise in video production and ethnography, the researcher hopes to collaborate with Greenlanders to capture and analyze their knowledge about changing livelihoods, the lived experience of varying types of labor, and the local meaning of social and environmental change through visual media.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[For decades, film and media technology have been used to engage indigenous peoples and/or source communities in anthropological concerns while also proposing to provide media literacy and a salient voice to the outside world. Prominent examples range from Worth and AdairÆs project with Navajo from the 1960Æs, Terry TurnerÆs efforts to introduce video cameras to Kayapo amid unrest over resource claims to Arctic-focused projects (Elder, 1995) and more subtle and explicitly interdependent arrangements between respondents and anthropologists found in the work of John L. JacksonÆs Jr Ethnographic Filmflam. And while Inuit engage in a wide variety of film and video production from home-movie to the international cinema marketplace, anthropologists seem to have skipped over Greenland when it comes to teaching film and video production as a means of understanding Inuit lived experiences, especially those related to livelihoods such as hunting and fishing.     I traveled to Nuuk, Greenland for three months to determine why or how indigenous video production with the aid of education may be possible and of value to source communities and my larger research concerns related to indigenous livelihoods. Within the first few days, it became clear that an agenda of teaching video production would be irrelevant. The experienced fishers and hunters I spent my days working with were already media-savvy.

These men (and they are all men) did not need any training to tell visual stories or in order to provide moving images of their livelihoods.

When we say images produced from projects that introduce cameras and have contact with ethnographers are in some ways not able to be called indigenous video productions, we perpetuate the assumption that the worldÆs indigenous peoples are actually distanced from other forms of cultural production and technology, and furthermore, when we mediate the process of indigenous image-making, we act against the methods set forth by our visually-oriented forefathers.

In Nuuk, the fishers and hunters I met neither needed nor wanted the training and were already engaged in their own ways of producing and sharing moving images about their livelihoods. Even if my presence could be interpreted as a hindrance by both the discipline and the local community, it was not, because how the fishers and hunters decided to involve me began by showing and sharing their images with me, and by having me fish and hunt with them and for us to film each other, together.
