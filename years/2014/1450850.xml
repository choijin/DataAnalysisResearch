<AbstractNarration>The ability to rapidly visualize hard tissues (e.g., bone, dentine, enamel) in three dimensions has been one of the most important advancements for researchers, medical doctors, and scientific educators in the last half-century. However, comparable advancements in soft-tissue imaging have yet to be fully realized due to the inherently low X-ray absorption of non-mineralized tissues. The use of Lugol's iodine (I2KI) solution as a contrast agent for the rapid visualization of soft-tissue anatomy using X-ray CT and micro-CT (&amp;#956CT) imaging is a potentially transformative new tool for the field of vertebrate morphology. The project goal is to create a generalized protocol for iodine-enhanced (i-e) &amp;#956CT imaging that will allow any morphologist to create high-quality, 3-D images of soft tissues from nearly any species of vertebrate. The i-e &amp;#956CT  research also has the potential for broad-based educational applications through the development of 3-D, high-definition anatomical atlases. In addition to evolutionary and organismal biology curricula, such materials could readily augment anatomy and physiology coursework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will encompass three phases of research. In Phase I, the researchers will test the effects of specimen preservation and staining. Next, a subset of specimens from Phase I will be used in Phase II to test the effects of various &amp;#956CT scanning parameters. Finally, in Phase III we will test novel protocols for (a) removing iodine from previously stained specimens and (b) expanding  the current size limits on staining and imaging of larger specimens. Taken together, this research aims to address the current gaps in our knowledge limiting the broad application of i-e &amp;#956CT, while also examining potential new research directions that could further expand its utility for the biological sciences at large.  Results from the studies will be disseminated through workshops, peer-reviewed publications, and presentations at scientific meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Advancements in imaging technologies have drastically improved our ability to see, study, and digitally share the complex internal anatomy of organisms. The recent adoption of contrast agents for the X-ray imaging of non-human animal specimens, as in the new technique of &ldquo;diceCT&rdquo; (a convenient acronym for &ldquo;diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography&rdquo;), is beginning to offer previously unattainable insights into the fine-scale 3D arrangement of the muscles, glands, visceral organs, fat, and nerves of animals&mdash;all without having to cut them open. This advance has the potential to establish large pipelines for the study of the evolution and development of soft (and hard) tissues in three dimensions, at high resolutions, and across at least a 10,000-fold range in specimen sizes. However, because of the numerous steps involved in producing these images, a bewilderingly complex array of variables has conspired to make consistent and favorable results elusive. Thus, the overarching goal of this project has been to systematically document and analyze the effects of specimen preparation (i.e., chemical fixation and storage), iodine staining, and numerous micro-CT scanning parameters on diceCT imaging quality. In so doing, we have generated the largest diceCT dataset assembled to date. Based on statistical analyses of these data, we have developed recommendations for best practices that will allow other researchers to integrate this powerful new imaging technique into their existing research programs. These include maximizing contrast by staining specimens at relatively low iodine concentrations for relatively long periods of time, and optimizing certain key micro-CT-scanner settings to consistently image subtle aspects of animal soft tissues, like the many functionally important and structurally complex features hidden deep within the brain. We likewise evaluated the longevity and reversibility of the iodine-based contrast stain, to determine the safety of using diceCT protocols for the imaging of important museum specimens held in major natural history collections around the world. Indeed, scientists now use software programs capable of creating 3D virtual models of real-world structures, and our findings facilitate a more direct pathway from raw CT scans of animal specimens to such detailed digital models. As a result, this potentially transformative new research tool will lead to high-fidelity computer avatars of real-world anatomy with the potential to become 3D printable models or augmented- and virtual-reality objects in classrooms, within digital apps, and as important components of scientific publications.</p> <p>As part of our project goals, we have worked to expand the community of scientists who are incorporating diceCT imaging into their research. By offering training opportunities for students and established scientists, we have helped to increase the number of diceCT users several fold. Our online presence at diceCT.com and on social media has allowed us to promote the scientific findings of the diceCT community as well as answer the questions of new users in real time. We have hosted meetings that have helped us address the specific needs of particular scientific communities. As diceCT has matured, individual labs have also helped to make advances that improve the science for everyone. Our broader community efforts have focused on this network effect by engaging scientists directly with our findings and assisting junior scientists establish new diceCT labs. As a result, our common research consortium now spans five continents, studying questions about muscle biology, genetic diseases, brain anatomy, paleontology, and taxonomy, among others. The broad appeal of the technique and its application to myriad issues in the biomedical, developmental, and evolutionary sciences has helped accelerate its maturation and utility, and the statistical analysis at the heart of our study has provided an important means of directing that success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/31/2018<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gignac</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1450850/1450850_10347332_1522535357410_diceCT_Alligator_head--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1450850/1450850_10347332_1522535357410_diceCT_Alligator_head--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Head of a juvenile American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) visualized through diceCT imaging"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1450850/1450850_10347332_1522535357410_diceCT_Alligator_head--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Head of a juvenile American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) visualized through diceCT imaging"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Horizontal slices taken through the eyes (left), nasal passages (middle), and palate (right).
