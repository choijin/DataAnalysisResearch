<AbstractNarration>Increasingly, academic institutions across the country are employing Broader Impacts Specialists (BISs) to help Principal Investigators address the NSF Broader Impacts (BI) criterion.  The Intellectual Merit of this proposal is a workshop for BISs to discuss how to better design BI activities.  The goal is to establish the framework for a community of practice, that is, the enculturation of training of BISs, the advocacy and the evaluation of BIS-designed activities and the support of the BIS community.  The 2014 Broader Impacts Infrastructure Summit seeks engagement between the NSF and the BIS community, sharing of best practices, and proposes organizing a national network of BISs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the summit are an increased understanding of the BI criterion and how BISs, especially those at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and within EPSCoR jurisdictions, can create better BI activities and increased engagement by researchers.  Activities in the workshop will highlight the contributions BISs and will include participants from HBCUs, MISs and EPSCoR jurisdictions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Overview  All proposals submitted to the National Science Foundation are evaluated on their intellectual merit (benefits to science) and their broader impacts (benefits to society).  Since 2010, NSF has placed a renewed emphasis on the broader impacts criterion, leading to the rise of broader impact professionals who support researchers at the institutional level with the design, implementation, and evaluation of broader impacts activities.  As a result, a need was identified to bring BI professionals together to share resources.  The first Broader Impacts Infrastructure Summit, hosted by the University of Missouri in 2013, began the discussion that led to the founding of a national BI community of practice.  Building on the success of the first Summit, a second Broader Impacts Infrastructure Summit was held in 2014 in Arlington, Virginia, followed by a third Summit in Madison, Wisconsin in 2015.  Approximately 250 participants were involved over two years.  Highlights of the 2014 Summit were the keynote addresses by NSF Director Dr. France C&oacute;rdova and then Chief Executive Officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and Executive Publisher of the journal Science Dr. Alan Leshner, and the opening session by Dr. Nancy Cantor, Chancellor of Rutgers-Newark and Dr. Freeman Hrabowski, President of the University of Maryland-Baltimore County.  Highlights of the 2015 Summit were the keynote address by Dr. Pramod Khargonekar and a video message from Dr. Wanda Ward, both of NSF.  The goals of the Summit were to increase collaboration among broader impacts professionals, enhance broader impacts scholarship, and influence policy regarding broader impacts.  Intellectual Merit  The main outcome of the Summit has been the creation of a network of broader impacts professionals supported by a NSF Research Coordination Network award&mdash;The National Alliance for Broader Impacts (NABI).  NABI is a national network of individuals and organizations working together to build institutional capacity, advance broader impacts, and demonstrate the societal benefits of research. The goal of NABI is to create a community of practice that fosters the development of sustainable and scalable institutional capacity and engagement in broader impacts activity. This goal will be accomplished through the achievement of the following four objectives:  Identify and      curate promising models, practices, and evaluation methods for the BI      community; Expand      engagement in and support the development of high-quality BI activities by      educating current and future faculty and researchers on effective BI      practices; Develop the      human resources necessary for sustained growth and increased diversity of      the BI community; and Promote      cross-institutional collaboration on and dissemination of BI programs,      practices, models, materials, and resources.   Since 2014, membership in NABI has grown from approximately 40 members to more than 450 from 150 institutions.  Broader Impacts  A broader impact of the Summits was increased participation in the national community by representatives from EPSCoR jurisdictions.  In 2014, of the registered participants, 29 were from EPSCoR jurisdictions&mdash;including several EPSCoR state offices. In 2015, there were 118 total registrants, and nearly one-third of the total Summit registration was comprised of EPSCoR state attendees. Fourteen EPSCoR states were represented, with a total of 37 EPSCoR registrants.  In addition, more graduate students are participating in the Summit, which will improve their ability to address the BI criterion as faculty members and/or provide them with an alternative career path in BI support.
