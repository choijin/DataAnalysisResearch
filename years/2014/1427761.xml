<AbstractNarration>Technical description &lt;br/&gt;Despite several decades of calls for improved international data sharing and environmental observations, measurements of critical environmental data remain unavailable in many parts of the world, especially in developing nations due to the lack of data collection, quality control, and bureaucratic obstacles. Reliable local environmental data are essential for identifying environmental trends and formulating appropriate policy responses. This proposal focuses on a synthesis of traditional and emerging observation techniques to address data scarcity in the Arkavathy Watershed, Karnataka as a case study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a new international collaboration among the University of California, Berkeley (UBC), the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE), Bangalore to generate novel environmental data collection techniques for application in data scarce regions. It will bring together researchers with expertise in environmental science in India, robotics and remote sensing to pilot an observation system linking field measurements, robotics and satellite remote sensing. There will also be a workshop at ATREE to formulate next steps including conceptualizing future proposals for submission to Indian funding agencies and to NSF?s Geospatial Sciences and Robotics programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of data collection and synthesis&lt;br/&gt;approaches that address fundamental environmental data gaps within the context of developing nations. It will evaluate the feasibility of achieving three key design goals for novel data collection systems: spatial and temporal extension of observations, low cost reproducible measurements, and ensuring researcher safety. It will identify key methodological challenges associated with fusion of multiple data types for consistent interpretation of environmental observations, as well as specific challenges associated with independent methods. It will provide cross-fertilization of research expertise across groups in three institutions: hydrology and remote sensing at UBC, low-cost sensors and mobile sensor platforms at UIUC, and water sustainability, citizen science and development projects at ATREE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader description &lt;br/&gt;By building on existing research foci held by ATREE, UIUC and UCB, the researchers will ensure that the initial collection of pilot data is linked to larger project goals, and to policy formation in south India. They will work with ATREE to ensure that collected data are shared through their project portal and the India Water Data Portal. The proposed collaborative research will directly support two PhD students by offering them the opportunity to develop meaningful working relationships with international partners and contribute to their doctoral research. The proposed research will also support the research goals of four junior faculty: three in the United States and one in India.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project brought robotics, remote sensing, environmental science and citizen science experts from three institutions &ndash; University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, University of California, Berkeley, and the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE, Bangalore, India) together to identify new ways to obtain environmental data in rapidly-changing and poorly monitored areas.   The Arkavathy watershed, which surrounds the city of Bangalore in southern India, provided a test bed for our ideas.  We used a 40-year satellite record and ground-based observations of a network of 1700 rainwater-harvesting reservoirs, paired with UAV ("drone") borne observations of the bathymetry (shape) of these reservoirs, to reconstruct a spatial history of hydrologic change in the watershed. We demonstrated that the drone based observations were accurate to within 30cm, and enabled detailed relationships to be made between water storage volumes and the surface areas that can be observed in the satellite record.  We trialed the use of robotic boats for water sampling in urban lakes, demonstrating its feasibility.   A second major component of the project was to hold a workshop that would not only catalyze collaboration between UIUC, UCB and ATREE, but also leverage the considerable pool of technical talent and environmental activism in Bangalore to identify "real time" solutions to environmental data needs that could be achieved by bringing together innovators in sensing, data management and environmental science.  In June 2015 we ran a workshop at ATREE focusing on the opportunities associated with linking citizen science, robotics, remote sensing and environmental studies.  21 attendees, including 2 participants from UC Berkeley, 2 from UIUC, 5 ATREE representatives, 3 participants from IISc, and representatives from IBM, Microsoft, and local companies / citizen groups Caddisfly, Takshila Institution, Chenna Kesava Trust, Synthesis Winding Technologies, Datacycle, Biome Environmental Solutions, Yuktix and Arghyam attended.  The morning of the workshop was devoted to presentations and familiarizing attendees with the products, solutions and data needs of the other groups.  The afternoon of the workshop was devoted to breakout sessions in which existing solutions were merged to address specific research and data requirements identified as priorities by ATREE.  Four plausible solutions were worked-up by the participants, and at least one of these (relating to data sharing around urban lakes in Bangalore) has been implemented. All workshop attendees received a formal report on the workshop outcomes.  ATREE is actively engaged in outreach to policy makers, environmental citizens groups, the Bangalore research community and watershed leaders.  Relevant results from the project have been communicated to these groups, and have received media coverage in the Bangalore press.  A publication derived from this collaboration also received the European Geophysical Union?s Jim Dooge Award for the best paper published in Hydrology and Earth System Science in 2015.  Finally, the project contributed to the training of two graduate students from the US, and approximately 10 from ATREE.
