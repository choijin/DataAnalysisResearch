<AbstractNarration>The PI and her team will take atmospheric chemistry techniques that they previously used to model planets in our solar system, and apply them to the study of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs (objects with masses between that of stars and planets) and exoplanets (planets outside of our solar system). These objects all have in common that they are low enough temperature (T &lt; 2600 K) to undergo molecular gas- and cloud-chemistry.  One focus of this project will be on the effects that chemical compositions different from the Sun have on the atmospheric chemistry of these objects. They will also investigate the deuterium chemistry to help define the planet-star boundary.  The team will develop a web-based platform for the thermodynamic data resulting from these studies, which is relevant to scientists in astronomy, planetary science, geochemistry, chemical engineering, materials science as well as industry. They will train and mentor a graduate student and undergraduate students in research, including those majoring in computer science through a cross-campus intitiative.  Scientific results will be integrated into new and revised textbooks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will accomplish this by carrying out thermochemical and kinetic computations to study gas and condensate speciation at different metallicities and varying C/O ratios and to identify possible chemical metallicity indicators.  They will then apply results from the computations to hot irradiated gas giant exoplanets, and M&amp;L dwarfs and subdwarfs.  They will also work with collaborators to expand models of photometric and spectroscopic signatures of clouds and metallicity effects. The deuterium (D) chemistry work will be done by deriving the thermodynamic and rate data for D/H exchange reactions, expanding the existing computational schemes; running the computations and analyzing the results for the most abundant and/or spectroscopically active D-bearing gases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the past four years we used chemical equilibrium calculations to model the atmospheric chemistry of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. Extrasolar planets are planets orbiting other stars and we are interested in gas giant extrasolar planets (EGPs) like Jupiter and Saturn and also in rocky extrasolar planets like Earth and the other rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars) in our solar system. Brown dwarfs are massive objects &ndash; mainly hydrogen and helium &ndash; that got hot enough to "burn" deuterium (the stable heavy isotope of hydrogen) via thermonuclear reactions, but did not get hot enough to "burn" hydrogen itself. They are intermediate between Jupiter and our Sun in their mass, which is why they could burn deuterium but not hydrogen. Most of their emitted "light" is in the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum.  The purpose of our chemical equilibrium modeling is to predict the abundances of gases that are potentially observable by Earth-based and Earth-orbital telescopic observations. For example, gases such as water vapor (H2O), ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) that absorb in the IR region of the spectrum, but our models consider many more gases that are potentially observable. For example, CO2, CO, CH4, NH3, SO2, and H2S are important because their abundances vary with the oxidation state of a planetary atmosphere &ndash; is the atmosphere O2 &ndash; rich like Earth or H2 &ndash; rich like Jupiter. (Neither oxygen O2 or hydrogen H2 are easily seen telescopically, hence the need for the other gases.)  In other cases we model the abundance of alkali halide gases &ndash; like gaseous salt NaCl &ndash; because these are diagnostic of conditions in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs.  The results of our work are reported in scientific papers that are available for free from the reprint page of our website (solarsystem.wustl.edu).
