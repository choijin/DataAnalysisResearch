<AbstractNarration>Solving polynomial systems is a fundamental problem in mathematics with applications to various fields of science and engineering. The free and open source software PHCpack applies symbolic-numeric and polyhedral methods to solve polynomial systems. As a new interface to PHCpack written in the Python scripting language, phcpy improves the functionality of PHCpack. The implementation on parallel computers to compensate for the cost overhead of multi-precision arithmetic will enable scientists and engineers to solve larger systems faster and more accurately. A web server developed with phcpy will give anyone with an internet connection access to the developed software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solvers in PHCpack apply homotopy continuation methods, blending symbolic-numeric with polyhedral algorithms. Numerical approximations to solutions are computed with Newton's method. Solutions are approximated symbolically by Puiseux series, which originate at initial forms defined by the Newton polytopes of the polynomials in the system. The design of phcpy gives a flexible interactive scripting interface, without sacrificing efficiency as compiled code in PHCpack is executed. The package phcpy will provide the tools for a scalable compute server to serve requests submitted to the web server. Multithreaded implementations on multicore processors accelerated by graphics processing units compensate for the cost overhead of double double and quad double arithmetic.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project addressed three disruptive trends in computational science. Younger scientists increasingly use the framework scripting language Python. With tablets replacing many personal computers, the rise of cloud computing makes that many new users expect access to software through web interfaces and that remote computers not only run the software but also manage their data. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) accelerate computations at a low cost, but require a complete overhaul of existing codes.  Consistent with the three disruptive trends, listed above, the project resulted in three major outcomes:  (1) The package phcpy offers a Python interface to the software PHCpack.  A paper on phcpy was published in the proceedings of the 18-th Python in Science Conference (SciPy 2019).  (2) The developed web interface is available at www.phcpack.org, at a server running JupyterHub.  (3) A software library to track solution paths on GPUs is available at github, via the github.com/janverschelde/PHCpack.  The results were published in the proceedings of PASCO 2015 and HPCC 2015.  To illustrate that the developed software is applied in science,  mathematics, and engineering, we mention three recent publications in  the literature:  (1) Hythem Sidky, Jonathan K. Whitmer, and Dhagash Mehta: "Reliable mixture critical point computation using polynomial homotopy continuation" AIChE Journal.  Thermodynamics and Molecular-Scale Phenomena, 2016. doi:10.1002/aic.15319  (2) Evangelos Bartzos, Ioannis Emiris, Jan Legersky, and Elias Tsigaridas: "On the maximal number of real embeddings of spatial minimally rigid graphs", In the Proceedings of the 2018 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC 2018), pages 55-62, ACM 2018.  The first two papers report on computations with phcpy, while the third paper reports on results obtained with a computation running on 16 threads.
