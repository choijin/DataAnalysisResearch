<AbstractNarration>In diverse contexts of the ancient and modern worlds, the study of culture contact has proven critical to understanding political trajectories and the emergence of ethnic and class identity. To reconstruct how these phenomena developed, scholars have increasingly looked to archaeology as a methodology capable of exploring the long-term impact of culture contact on ethnic groupings and social inequality in early societies. The archaeological project described here had been designed to study one of these contexts: a Preclassic (1000 BC - AD 250) borderland center from the time of Mesoamerica's early urban settlements. The site was located on the cultural frontier between the emergent Maya and Olmec civilizations. By demonstrating how different social classes in this frontier center variably adapted some customs from their neighbors while combining and developing unique practices of their own, the researchers will demonstrate how borderland groups can flexibly integrate foreign practices through time as they work to maintain and improve their social position. This research is relevant to ongoing studies of both historic and modern-day identity and will help improve understanding of frontier contexts today.  The fieldwork will be conducted by Jeffrey Dobereiner, a Harvard University graduate student, and will provide data for his doctoral dissertation. Thus it will further his education as a scientist. Because of close collaboration with Mexican students the project will strengthen long term scientific ties between the US and Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a frontier community between several emergent Preclassic cultures, the decisions made by these borderland residents provide a critical data set from which to explore how non-local connectivity affected different parts of ancient Mesoamerican society in different ways. Throughout the site, unique architecture, burials and ceramics that draw upon several separate cultural identity groups have been found, alongside a wide range of sources for imported goods such as marine shell and obsidian. While this evidence indicates that site residents articulated with varied cultural currents of Preclassic Mesoamerica while maintaining their own independent identity, the mechanism of this independence is unclear. Through field research in households at diverse social levels, the researchers will explore whether elites or commoners were the primary actors controlling how and when these foreign practices were adopted, rejected, and modified. This project at Rancho BÃºfalo, Chiapas, Mexico will use field work, laboratory analysis and chemical techniques to demonstrate who was mediating these variable adaptations, and in which social strata foreign customs first arrived. By reconstructing how the people of this region variably integrated these customs to negotiate their tenuous social position, the final results will provide a case-study in research on culture contact and frontier peoples more broadly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This archaeological project studied the nature of ethnogenesis on one the earliest cultural frontiers in Mesoamerica: the Preclassic (1000 BC - AD 250) borderland between the traditionally defined Maya and Olmec civilizations.  Work focused on Rancho B&uacute;falo, Chiapas, Mexico, a five hectare Preclassic site center along the Middle Usumacinta River that was largely abandoned before the Classic period (AD 250 &ndash; 800).  Through four field seasons of excavation and mapping, a semester-long ceramic analysis project, and chemical provenance analysis of obsidian recovered from the site, it became possible to reconstruct how the site residents negotiated their local identity by integrating and modifying traditions from multiple regions, manifesting in material culture including architecture and ceramics.  The unique finds at the site draw attention to heterogeneity in constituent groups of nascent complex societies, and raise questions about the frequent assumption that variation within their membership is muted by social incorporation.  In terms of intellectual merit, particularly impactful discoveries include a Middle Preclassic pottery-sherd with incised designs that share similarities with emergent scribal traditions of Southern Mesoamerica, both Isthmian and Mayan.  Interpreting such an object from the space between the traditional heartlands of the Maya and Mixe-Zoque, and from a comparative small site like Rancho B&uacute;falo, has produced provocative insights about the nature of social hierarchy and circumscribed knowledge in Preclassic Southern Mesoamerica.  This was complemented by architectural data, which through time shows the active responses of Rancho B&uacute;faloÃs residents to broader trends in extra-local material traditions of the Middle and Late Preclassic, including their never adopting an "E-Group" structure, and their use of a region-specific 30 degree east-of-north orientation which persisted into Classic Period centers like Piedras Negras, Guatemala and Yaxchilan, Chiapas.  In terms of broader impacts, these results speak to the diverse contexts of the ancient and modern worlds where study of borderlands, frontiers, and ethnic negotiation has proven critical to understanding the interplay of identity and regional political trajectories.  Work at Rancho B&uacute;falo has demonstrated that, even in the earliest phase of sedentism and social complexity, similar processes to modern borderlands were playing out in peopleÃs negotiation and manipulation of material culture.   Locally, the projectÃs outreach to communities increased interest in heritage preservation, and tempered the looting that had been occurring at nearby sites.  Community members and participants were trained to see the value of archaeological context for understanding the past.  The project also strengthened institutional ties between Mexican entities including the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog&iacute;a e Historia, Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Yucat&aacute;n, and Universidad de Ciencias y Artes de Chiapas and the US researchers and institutions involved with the project.
