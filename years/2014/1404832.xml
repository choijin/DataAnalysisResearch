<AbstractNarration>CBET-1404826/1404832&lt;br/&gt;Sinno/Kevrikidis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluid flows containing complex particles that interact with each other and with vessel walls are a central feature of an enormous range of biological, chemical, and physical processes, and the potential scientific and technological impact of having access to predictive computer models is difficult to overstate.  Consequently, improvements in computer simulations for aggregating particulate flows have been actively sought for many years, and to date have been driven largely by increased availability of computer power coupled with advances in mathematical algorithms and techniques.  As this trend continues, computational modeling is increasingly blessed (and cursed) by the "big data" streams generated by high resolution experimental measurements and/or by detailed computational simulations.  In particular, the meaningful comparison of computational outputs and experimental measurements, both of which are large, complex, and statistically noisy, has emerged as a key challenge.  As a result, models often capture many qualitative phenomena correctly but their predictive ability, and hence their usefulness to industry and manufacturing, becomes increasingly hard to establish and exploit.  The proposed work seeks to close this gap by implementing, extending and exploiting a broad (and evolving) set of novel data mining techniques that enable new ways of linking tailored experiments to smartly designed simulations and back to model building. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multifaceted approach will be pursued to interrogate and use data jointly from a multiscale/multi-element model and two particulate-flow experimental systems.  The experimental systems include a "target" system (platelets in blood), whose predictive description is ultimately sought, and a "model" system (DNA-functionalized colloids in water), which will be used to develop methods and help interpret the more complicated target.  Both systems are defined by "complex" particles that exhibit time-dependent adhesivity leading to transiently evolving aggregates at a specified location on the vessel surface.  Modern data mining techniques will be exploited and extended to process the native, high-dimensional data generated by these three sources to discover low-dimensional statistical measures that enable meaningful merging/comparisons of data streams from different sources and runs.  Ultimately, the project deliverables are (i) a better understanding of the physical, chemical and biological mechanisms operating in these complex systems, (ii) data-enhanced and data-validated engineering models, and (iii) experimental design rules for complex, multi-parameter systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dealing with complex dynamical systems comprised of many degrees of freedom  (e.g. many molecules in a molecular dynamics simulation, many particles in a particle-laden flow, many interacting interconnected elements in a neural network or on the power grid) poses formidable challenges to a modeler, since one is not interested in the detailed state of each of these ?microscopic? degrees of freedom, but rather in the macroscopic, system level observations/statistics (e.g the overall volume fraction or momentum field).  The purpose of this research has been to link traditional engineering modeling with modern data mining/manifold learning techniques that discover low-dimensional, simpler, effective statistical measures of these detailed computations/experimental measurements. These ?effective variables? both allow the meaningful comparison of simulations and experiments at the macroscopic, engineering level, but can also be used to accelerate the detailed, high-fidelity, microscopic engineering computations.  This link between data driven machine learning tools and traditional engineering modeling/scientific computation can be done in a systematic way, that gives rise to hybrid simulation codes ? part detailed simulation, part data mining of the simulation results to extract local effective models and design the ?next? detailed simulation runs. It is interesting, however, that the effective, reduced variables discovered by data mining locally may not have an obvious physical meaning; this appears to lead towards a type of modeling where there is less direct physical understanding of mechanisms, and more understanding of the data mining algorithms processing the data to find good variables, and the operations on these variables. This poses interesting problems  of physical explainability of the predictions/analysis results from the hybrid simulations ? it will, we expect, become increasingly important to be able to map physical variables to observables discovered in data-driven ways and vice versa.  In this work we were able to use data mining/manifold learning techniques (in particular, diffusion maps and various extensions/modifications of them, like the ones based on the so-called Mahalanobis metric) to find good coarse-grained observables for data arising from detailed engineering simulations (interacting particles, interacting network units, interacting discretization points for large scale flow PDE discretizations).
