<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate how environmental factors and wildlife management programs affect infectious disease spread in species that move large distances. The researchers will evaluate populations of pumas in the Florida Everglades, Colorado?s Front Range and Western Slope, and Southern California. The results will be applicable to other wide-ranging species, such as large herbivores, other carnivores, and even humans. Working with partners in state and Federal agencies, the investigators will determine how the spread of disease is affected by management actions such as hunting and relocation of animals; how future disease outbreaks might spread through vulnerable populations; and how they might be controlled via vaccination, development of quarantine buffer zones, or other means. The project also includes outreach efforts to educate the public about conservation issues, and engage students in relevant studies in disease ecology. This project will involve students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will evaluate how the interaction between landscape structure and management interventions affect disease spread in populations of wide-ranging apex predators (Puma concolor). Using an exceptional database and corresponding set of biological samples, and an experienced collaborative team, the research will trace the spread of two apathogenic (i.e. non-pathogenic), contact-dependent retroviral agents in geographically distinct puma populations under three different management regimes: (a) supplementation and recovery of the highly endangered Florida panther, (b) large-scale manipulative harvest experiments of a rural Colorado puma population, and (c) steady-state management of urban puma populations in the Colorado Front Range and Southern California. A landscape genomics approach will inform advanced network models to determine the relative importance of landscape structure and management actions on host connectivity, demography, and, ultimately, disease dynamics. These apathogenic transmission models will be tested with empirical data from a recent virulent outbreak of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) in Florida Panthers. The model will be used to predict disease spread of virulent agents using models based on apathogenic agents, and to inform management programs to control disease outbreaks. This integrated approach provides a basis for utilizing complex molecular and geospatial tools to advance models to predict and mitigate virulent disease outbreaks for wide-ranging species in complex landscapes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major goals of this project, initiated in June 2014, relate to the overarching question, "How do landscape structure and management interventions interact to influence disease spread in heterogeneous landscapes?" In Aim 1, we evaluated the importance of landscape structure and management actions on host connectivity, population demography, and, ultimately, disease dynamics in puma in multiple study areas in the United States, including Florida, Colorado, and California. In Aim 2, we developed models using apathogenic (non-disease causing) contact-dependent infections to predict disease spread of virulent pathogens and inform management programs to control disease outbreaks.&nbsp;</p> <p>The outcomes of this award related to this specific topic are numerous, and include the following important findings:</p> <ul> <li>Puma are susceptible to multiple <strong>pathogens</strong> originating in smaller felid species, an example of pathogen spillover (transmission between species). Puma were infected with Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) from bobcats, and Feline Foamy Virus (FFV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) from domestic cats. Each of these viruses has different spillover dynamics and disease outcomes for pumas. Because spillover occurred in multiple different ecosystems, we believe the differences in disease outcomes are primarily related to interactions between the virus and the puma host and are less influenced by ecological variables. However, our results suggest that top predators are at increased risk of spillover because of contact that occurs during predation.</li> <li>Understanding disease transmission in puma under different <strong>management </strong>regimes. For example, introduction of pumas from Texas to increase genetic diversity in endangered Florida panthers resulted in the introduction of new strains of FIV and FFV. In Colorado, cessation of puma hunting increased the role of males in virus transmission, increased viral population growth rate, and altered virus evolutionary dynamics.&nbsp; </li> <li>Understanding disease transmission in felids on different<strong> landscapes</strong>. Our results demonstrate that both natural and human-made landscape features influenced puma and bobcat populations and disease spread. For example, in Colorado, host relatedness was an important predictor of transmission dynamics and viral spread was slower in puma populations adjacent to urban areas. We also showed that transmission of apathogenic agents provides invaluable insight into drivers of transmission prior to outbreaks of more serious diseases. Predictions of pathogen transmission dynamics based on apathogenic viruses performed at least as well as simpler transmission models and offered the advantage of identifying the underlying drivers of transmission relevant to management. Our innovative approach offers an opportunity to proactively design disease control strategies in at-risk animal and human populations. More broadly, our findings suggest that the study of parasites can inform wildlife conservation.</li> <li>The landscape plays an important role in felid <strong>population connectivity and gene flow</strong>. Our comprehensive genomic analysis of 278 bobcats and 407 pumas in three different ecosystems revealed that landscape features influencing gene flow varied across sites. Where major highways and urban development were present, these formed significant barriers to gene flow in all populations studied. However, degree of urbanization appears to affect which landscape features were most important to maintaining gene flow. In less urbanized areas, vegetation cover had a positive effect on gene flow in both puma and bobcats. In highly urbanized environments, riparian areas along rivers and streams were important facilitators of gene flow in bobcats and pumas, and puma gene flow was higher in open space. We also found that host gene flow was generally more restricted than pathogen spread.</li> <li>Advances in <strong>analytical approaches</strong> for studying wildlife disease. These included innovative landscape genetic, phylogenetic, and ecological phylodynamic approaches for integrating environmental and genetic data from hosts and pathogens to understand drivers of disease transmission and spread. We also developed novel network, agent-based, and spatial models to simulate and predict spread of infectious agents in various environmental contexts.</li> </ul> <p>We had significant broader impacts beyond the specific topics of study, including:</p> <ul> <li>We trained a total of eight undergraduate, six      veterinary, and eight PhD students, and seven postdocs over the course of      the grant, obtained many additional grants to supplement NSF-funded      studies, and produced a total of 104 peer-reviewed articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>We devised and implemented a variety of      educational outreach initiatives, including a wildlife remote camera K-12      outreach program, providing research experience opportunities for K-12      teachers, and a "Serious Video Game" to introduce students to concepts      such as wildlife connectivity and disease transmission.&nbsp;</li> <li>Our team supported a "Genomics of Wildlife      Disease Workshop" in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. We trained nearly 100      early career wildlife researchers from across the world in emerging      genomic technologies.&nbsp;</li> <li>Our team was defined as an exemplary case      study in an analysis of successful Team Science.&nbsp;</li> <li>Two DVM-PhD students supported by this project      were awarded top graduate award by Wildlife Disease Association; four of      the co-PIs were awarded Fellowships to visit University of Tasmania.</li> </ul><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/18/2021<br>      Modified by: Sue&nbsp;Vandewoude</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1413925/1413925_10310249_1629333852312_Mountain_retreat_2018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1413925/1413925_10310249_1629333852312_Mountain_retreat_2018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="PIs, postdocs, students (graduate, veterinary, and undergraduate), and collaborators at the 2018 team retreat."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1413925/1413925_10310249_1629333852312_Mountain_retreat_2018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="PIs, postdocs, students (graduate, veterinary, and undergraduate), and collaborators at the 2018 team retreat."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Annual 2-day team retreats were held in 2015-19 that included review of progress, guest speakers, and planning for the subsequent grant year.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sue VandeWoude</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sue&nbsp;Vandewoude</div> <div class="imageTitle">PIs, postdocs, students (graduate, veterinary, and undergraduate), and collaborators at the 2018 team retreat.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1413925/1413925_10310249_1629332032013_Kozakiewicz_2020_EvolApps_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1413925/1413925_10310249_1629332032013_Kozakiewicz_2020_EvolApps_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="FIVLru exhibits phylogeographic structure with respect to bobcat host populations, with divergence dates reflecting decreasing connectivity as urbanization around Los Angeles has increased."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1413925/1413925_10310249_1629332032013_Kozakiewicz_2020_EvolApps_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="FIVLru exhibits phylogeographic structure with respect to bobcat host populations, with divergence dates reflecting decreasing connectivity as urbanization around Los Angeles has increased."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tip label colours indicate the host population from which a given sample was collected and branch colours indicate reconstructed ancestral host populations.

For example, introduction of pumas from Texas to increase genetic diversity in endangered Florida panthers resulted in the introduction of new strains of FIV and FFV. In Colorado, cessation of puma hunting increased the role of males in virus transmission, increased viral population growth rate, and altered virus evolutionary dynamics.   Understanding disease transmission in felids on different landscapes. Our results demonstrate that both natural and human-made landscape features influenced puma and bobcat populations and disease spread. For example, in Colorado, host relatedness was an important predictor of transmission dynamics and viral spread was slower in puma populations adjacent to urban areas. We also showed that transmission of apathogenic agents provides invaluable insight into drivers of transmission prior to outbreaks of more serious diseases. Predictions of pathogen transmission dynamics based on apathogenic viruses performed at least as well as simpler transmission models and offered the advantage of identifying the underlying drivers of transmission relevant to management. Our innovative approach offers an opportunity to proactively design disease control strategies in at-risk animal and human populations. More broadly, our findings suggest that the study of parasites can inform wildlife conservation. The landscape plays an important role in felid population connectivity and gene flow. Our comprehensive genomic analysis of 278 bobcats and 407 pumas in three different ecosystems revealed that landscape features influencing gene flow varied across sites. Where major highways and urban development were present, these formed significant barriers to gene flow in all populations studied. However, degree of urbanization appears to affect which landscape features were most important to maintaining gene flow. In less urbanized areas, vegetation cover had a positive effect on gene flow in both puma and bobcats. In highly urbanized environments, riparian areas along rivers and streams were important facilitators of gene flow in bobcats and pumas, and puma gene flow was higher in open space. We also found that host gene flow was generally more restricted than pathogen spread. Advances in analytical approaches for studying wildlife disease. These included innovative landscape genetic, phylogenetic, and ecological phylodynamic approaches for integrating environmental and genetic data from hosts and pathogens to understand drivers of disease transmission and spread. We also developed novel network, agent-based, and spatial models to simulate and predict spread of infectious agents in various environmental contexts.   We had significant broader impacts beyond the specific topics of study, including:  We trained a total of eight undergraduate, six      veterinary, and eight PhD students, and seven postdocs over the course of      the grant, obtained many additional grants to supplement NSF-funded      studies, and produced a total of 104 peer-reviewed articles.   We devised and implemented a variety of      educational outreach initiatives, including a wildlife remote camera K-12      outreach program, providing research experience opportunities for K-12      teachers, and a "Serious Video Game" to introduce students to concepts      such as wildlife connectivity and disease transmission.  Our team supported a "Genomics of Wildlife      Disease Workshop" in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. We trained nearly 100      early career wildlife researchers from across the world in emerging      genomic technologies.  Our team was defined as an exemplary case      study in an analysis of successful Team Science.  Two DVM-PhD students supported by this project      were awarded top graduate award by Wildlife Disease Association; four of      the co-PIs were awarded Fellowships to visit University of Tasmania.
