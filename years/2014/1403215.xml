<AbstractNarration>Prior to recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies, scientists could never have imagined the vast microbial diversity associated with each individual plant and animal. Rather than individual discrete organisms, all higher organisms are home to diverse consortia of microscopic bacteria and fungi, called microbes. From our mouths to plants' leaves, unique communities of microorganisms play important roles in higher organisms'ability to function. This research focuses on understanding the mechanisms driving the community structure of the fungi associated with the leaves of plants (foliar endophytes) and beneficial fungi associated with the roots of trees (ectomycorrhizal fungi). This research has broad ranging societal impacts by uncovering fungal diversity that can be helpful to improving tree health, ecosystem stability, and resilience to climate change. One of the focal trees in this study, the white bark pine, is a foundation species central to ecosystem function in subalpine environments. White bark pine trees are highly threatened by a combination of blister rust, mountain pine beetles, and climate change. Foliar endophytes are known to improve the resistance of trees to both disease and temperature fluctuations caused by climate change. Thus, uncovering the diversity of foliar endophytes associated with these trees has the potential to lead to beneficial treatments for this endangered tree species. In addition, this project also has strong educational and outreach components. Students involved in the proposed work will gain experience with fieldwork and cutting edge DNA sequencing methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite being incredibly important drivers of plant community composition and ecosystem function, little is known about the basic biology or patterns of diversity of these fungi. This project applies cutting edge next generation sequencing technologies to isolated pine trees located in Yosemite National Park to answer important questions about the community structure, diversity, and basic biology of these fungi. Here a simple host-island setting is used to test for the effect of dispersal distance, host type, environment (host physiology, soil chemistry &amp; season), on community structure in two host-dependent guilds of fungi. The main aim of this proposal is to compare the relative effects of niche versus dispersal assembly in two functional guilds of host-associated fungi.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This reward supported part of the doctoral dissertation study on the environmental drivers of ectomycorrhizal and foliar endophytic fungi associated with isolated tree islands in Yosemite National Park. We found exciting results indicating that the theory of island biogeography predicts the number of species associated with&nbsp;<em>Pinus albicaulis,</em>&nbsp;the endangered white bark pine. These results were published in a paper entitled "The theory of island biogeography applies to ectomycorrhizal fungi in subalpine tree "islands at a fine scale" in&nbsp;<em>Ecosphere.&nbsp;</em>A UC Berkeley undergraduate and a PhD student from UC Merced were included as co-authors. These results are important as the white bark pine is a highly endangered plant and understanding the factors affecting the symbiotic fungi associated with them may be critical to their survival. Moreover, analyze of soil nutrients showed that pH is the major driver of fungal diversity at the local scale. These results were unexpected and are transformative for the field of fungal ecology given that the paradigm in microbial ecology had been that bacteria and plant communities were driven by pH but fungi were not. We now know that plants, bacteria, and fungi are driven by a universal environmental factor, soil pH. These results are now in review at&nbsp;<em>Ecology Letters</em>. We are still in the process of analyzing the sequence data for the endophytic fungi, but this part of the research resulted in a collaboration with Professor Betsy Arnold at University of Arizona, who now has a culture collection of the foliar endophytic fungi from the pine needles in these tree islands.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This award had a very positive impact on the career of co-PI, Dr. Sydney Glassman.&nbsp; She was recently offered a tenure track assistant professor position at UC Riverside in the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology. Her publication record and her proven track record of obtaining NSF funding from this grant were critical in making her competitive for the job. Dr. Glassman will continue analyzing and publishing the foliar endophytic fungi data in her first year as an assistant professor at UC Riverside. The results of this research have been disseminated in numerous public seminars. In fact, Glassman has given 7 invited seminars disseminating the results of this data in numerous locations including invited seminars at UCLA, UC Riverside, University of Michigan, Washington State University Vancouver, two universities in Uppsala, Sweden, and at a seminar at the Mycological Society of America. In addition, she has given four invited talks to the public at local mycological societies in northern California on the results of the research, and presented the results of her research at the Symbiosis meeting in Yosemite National Park. Several collaborations resulted from this award - one with an established Professor at University of Arizona, who is helping with the culturing of the foliar endophytes and one with a researcher at UC Merced, who cored and dated the trees in Gaylor Lake Basin.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/13/2017<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;D&nbsp;Bruns</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1403215/1403215_10305293_1497048561078_treeislandsgaylor--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1403215/1403215_10305293_1497048561078_treeislandsgaylor--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Gaylor lake basin tree islands"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1403215/1403215_10305293_1497048561078_treeislandsgaylor--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Gaylor lake basin tree islands"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image of field site Gaylor Lake Basin in Yosemite National Park, California.
