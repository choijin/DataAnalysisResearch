<AbstractNarration>The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) is undertaking an exploratory capacity building project to plan a multi-year Best Practice research effort focused on institutional models and strategies for integrating STEM workforce development and graduate education. The project will provide a better understanding of what skills deficiencies employers identify in STEM graduate students, what structures are or are not in place to meet those needs, what learning environments are effective, and how investments can be directed and leveraged to enhance STEM workforce preparation. The effort will fill a knowledge gap for graduate degree holders through in-depth input of industry leaders into the research design of the proposed follow-on research plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive evidence-based research study that will identify the characteristics of institutional models and strategies that effectively align professional development training with degree requirements and career outcomes. The primary tasks consist of a CGS member survey, a synthesis/framework paper, a workshop of key stakeholders, and a culminating publication that will include project results, a framework for future action, and a compendium of existing model programs. These activities will involve different types of institutions throughout the U.S. and industry leaders from multiple STEM employment sectors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  Today?s STEM graduate students are tomorrow?s problem solvers in areas ranging from energy and water management to public health, national security, and global conflict resolution. While many US-trained PhDs and master?s pursue faculty teaching and research careers at US colleges and universities, the majority of STEM graduate students will make their contributions to the American economy and society in careers outside traditional academic faculty research positions, e.g., in industry, government, and non-profits. Yet today?s graduate students receive little or no explicit preparation for those skills beyond academic research skills valued by these employers. The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) project, "Graduate Students and the STEM Workforce" (NSF #1413827) resulted in an action plan to enhance professional development for the variety of career pathways U.S. graduate students pursue. This exploratory, capacity building project achieved this by identifying promising practices, common challenges and solutions, and recommendations for possible next steps toward coordinating improvements to the professional development of STEM graduate students, including PhDs, master?s, and postdoctorates.     The project consisted of four activities: 1) a survey of graduate deans, STEM faculty, and staff responsible for professional development programming; 2) in-depth interviews with senior leaders responsible for supervising and hiring STEM PhDs and master?s; 3) a workshop convening employers from multiple sectors of the advanced STEM workforce, federal funders, graduate deans, experts, and recent PhDs to advance the conversation about promising models; and 4) a publication of project results along with a companion compendium of university professional development programs designed to inform U.S. university policy and practice.     University Survey  Among the 857 valid survey responses from graduate deans, college deans, faculty, and staff at 226 CGS member institutions, the majority (62%) indicated that their institutions and/or graduate programs offer some type of formal professional development program for graduate students in research degree programs to obtain skills beyond core academic research skills.

These include: entrepreneurship (23%), technology commercialization (15%), data science (11%), governance, risk and compliance (11%), and science policy (8%).     Industry Interviews and Workshop  Employers called for graduate programs to provide more skills training and internships, while maintaining the depth of high quality research that is the hallmark of U.S. graduate research degrees. Specifically, they called for more: international, intercultural, and interdisciplinary teamwork; project management; communication; and data science skills. Workshop participants identified ways graduate schools, faculty, and federal funders can work together to integrate student professional development experiences from day one of a student?s program to completion of the degree.     Intellectual Merit   A better understanding of needs, resources, skills, and structures is critical if professional development is to become an effective and integral part of advanced STEM academic training at the master?s and PhD levels. While there is growing data on industry perceptions of skills deficiencies in today?s STEM workers with 2- and 4-year degrees, similar data about those with graduate degrees is lacking; and while most studies report on the views of talent recruiters and/or CEO?s, a better understanding of the views of those with direct supervisory responsibility for recent STEM PhDs and masters, which is more valuable at the graduate level, is needed.
