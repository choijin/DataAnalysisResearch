<AbstractNarration>Despite advances in knowledge of brain function, the relationship between brain evolution and ecological diversity remains poorly known. A prominent example is that of birds. Taking to the air enabled the dinosaurian ancestors of birds to exploit a range of ecological niches that now underlie the remarkable modern diversity of the group (approximately 10,000 living species). A significant part of this evolutionary success may have stemmed from the development of a relatively large brain, which has been considered necessary for coordinating the various, nuanced components of powered flight. This study complements the NSF BRAIN initiative by using a cross-disciplinary approach to understand the complex neurological evolution of birds and their dinosaurian relatives. To that end, an array of new techniques and new applications of existing technologies are employed to document the major changes in the brain associated with the origin of powered flight. This study also will establish a model of brain expansion complementing that already available for mammals. The outcome will be an unprecedented database of avian brain anatomy that includes not only imagery of morphological systems but also their relation to data generated through brain function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relationship between neuroanatomical, cognitive and behavioral evolution remains poorly understood, especially in deep time and across the vertebrate tree of life. This study addresses this relationship using a cross-disciplinary investigation of the evolutionary link between the large brain of living birds and the morphological changes that mark the transition from cursorial (running) dinosaur to flying bird. Initial steps use innovative imaging methods and novel staining techniques to generate the first data on what areas of the brain birds use while flying, and how this activity differs from that of other behaviors. These data will serve as a framework for a broad analysis of encephalization (increasing head size) within living birds and along the lineage where avian flight originated. Shared landmarks will be used to subdivide the endocranial cavity into functionally relevant partitions that allow testing for volumetric size changes between individual neural structures, including those most active during flight. This study also will use geometric morphometrics (anatomical comparisons) to assess covariation between neuroanatomical partitions and thus the presence of functionally and/or evolutionarily integrated regions of the brain. In short, the proposed study will generate data on how birds use their brain and apply those data to better understand the ancient relationship between brain evolution and the origin of the highly derived avian body plan.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>The relationship between neuroanatomical, cognitive, and behavioral evolution is poorly understood, especially in deep time and across major phylogenetic transitions. In part this is due to a paucity of understanding about the diversity and evolution of non-mammalian neuroanatomical systems. However, recent advancements in neurological imaging tools have greatly improved our ability to see and study neuroanatomical variation, particularly in non-model organisms. The overarching goal of this project has been to systematically document and analyze anatomical and behavioral variation in the brains of extant birds and harness integrative approaches that quantify major transformations in the avian brain associated with the origin of powered flight. We have achieved this goal using four major approaches: (1) First, we documented the how birds use their brains during flight via positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study brain activity across a range of sedentary, active, and volant behaviors. (2) Next, we paired PET-based brain activity maps with 3D anatomical data of bird brains derived from diffusible iodine-based contrast enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) in order to associate brain activity with specific nuclei and networks across brain regions. These data informed which structures of the avian brain&mdash;including those that determine brain size and shape&mdash;are critical to flight functions. (3) We reconstructed digital, 3D "casts" of the endocranial cavities ("endocast") of birds and their non-avian dinosaur ancestors to study how brain size and shape changed across the dinosaur-bird transition that coincided with the evolutionary emergence of avian flight. (4) This transformations series allowed us to statistically test for differences between relative brain size and shape using geometric morphometric techniques, providing an opportunity to evaluate hypotheses about the timing and temp of brain expansion across avian history. Overall, we sampled more than 300 non-avian theropod dinosaur taxa, extinct bird taxa, and extant bird taxa to fulfill our goal. Our approached allowed us to develop 3D atlases of bird brains and identify diffuse networks of activity related to flight, centered around the dorsal hyperpallium, entopallium, and cerebellum, which are thought to control and/or coordinate somatosensory, visual, and motor information on the wing. These pointed to structures present in endocasts, like the wulst and velecula, that provided anatomical signal for the "flight-ready brain" during the evolution of birds. Analysis of these endocast features across 175 million years of evolution show that (1) the wulst (and, presumably, related neural circuitry) is present in maniraptoran dinosaurs, implying that it evolved in the absence of or prior to the origin of flight, and (2) there is not a significant allometric trend between body size and endocast/brain shape across theropod dinosaur evolution. Instead, early rates of brain-size evolution were high but stabilized across the dinosaur-bird transition, resulting in seven grades of encephalization that spanned from basal theropods through living passerine birds. Our findings show that modern crows and parrots achieved among the largest relative brain sizes in the vertebrate world, but through different evolutionary mechanisms.
