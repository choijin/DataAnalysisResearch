<AbstractNarration>Mr. Jason W. Henning is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Chicago. The fellow will investigate signatures of inflation in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the afterglow light from the big bang. Cosmic inflation is a theorized period of rapid expansion in the earliest moments of the universe. It generates features in the polarization of the CMB that are contaminated by other polarization sources. To accurately measure these features and learn more about inflation, these other sources of polarization must be well-characterized and removed from the observations. Mr. Henning will develop techniques for characterizing contaminants, and will also contribute to design and testing efforts to construct a new camera designed specifically to measure CMB polarization with high resolution and fidelity. Furthermore, to demonstrate that research is an exciting and engaging enterprise, Mr. Henning will design new content for several outreach venues providing an insider's look into scientific research. Through interactive displays, live talks, and real-time social media, he will provide access to how research takes place while it's happening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primordial B-modes are expected to be imprinted in the CMB by gravitational waves generated during inflation. This primordial signal, however, is contaminated by lensing B-modes difficult to measure and remove by low-resolution experiments. Mr. Henning will focus attention on two high-resolution CMB polarization experiments probing primordial B-modes in order to constrain inflation. He will lead a campaign of detector characterization and design efforts for the upcoming SPT-3G experiment. He will also extend and develop techniques to analyze datasets from the SPT-POL and SPT-3G experiments at large angular scales, which will include methods for polarized foreground removal and de-lensing in particular, a unique ability made possible by high-resolution experiments. For outreach education, Mr. Henning will expand several successful programs by generating new content with the goal of providing a window into research. He will contribute to new Adler Planetarium exhibits about microwave detection technologies and the South Pole Telescope and lead audiences through them during live Astronomy Conversations. He will also integrate SPT data into the WorldWide Telescope and create a guided tour of data analysis. Finally, Mr. Henning will organize and generate content for several social media outlets to relay the everyday activities of current research to the public in real-time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to develop analysis tools and techniques that would extend the use of ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements made by large-aperture/high-resolution millimeter-wave telescopes to larger angular scales on the sky.  Overlap between high- and low-resolution CMB data sets enables delensing, a technique that can clean data, which are being used to search for evidence of cosmic inflation, of a contaminating foreground signal that is otherwise too bright to see through.  Finding evidence of cosmic inflation would not only teach us about the origins of the universe, but could shed light on a period of ongoing inflation and the ultimate fate of the universe.  Furthermore, work under this project would contribute to the deployment of a new microwave-sensitive camera in the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G), which over the course of several years will produce extremely sensitive maps of the CMB in three frequencies, or colors.  These maps would then be used to test the current paradigms of cosmology, looking for confirmations of current theories or, better yet, hints at new physics.  The project also aimed to develop content for several existing outreach programs, which serve the public over a range of ages from grade school to post-retirement.  Over the life of the project, and in addition to several refereed articles, the following outcomes were achieved in part by efforts funded through this award:   1) A new high-resolution data set of CMB measurements from the SPTpol experiment that spans both large and small angular scales on the sky.  Derivative data products are free to use by the scientific community.  Analysis techniques learned through reducing this data set will improve the quality and fidelity of future projects. 2) Deployment of the SPT-3G camera in the South Pole Telescope with 10 times the number of detectors present in the SPTpol experiment 3) Development of new outreach content for preschool students, high school students, graduate students, senior citizens, and the general public, disseminated through a series of public talks, interactive sessions in Chicago?s Adler Planetarium, and summer schools 4) Maps of the SPTpol data set were made available to the general public through WorldWide Telescope.   Results of research have been disseminated to the wider scientific community through data archival sites, peer-reviewed journals and proceedings, several national and international workshops and conferences, as well as invited seminars.
