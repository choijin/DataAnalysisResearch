<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Dustin Ross is "Geometry and Physics Related to Virtual Curve Counting." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Michigan, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Yongbin Ruan.</AbstractNarration>
