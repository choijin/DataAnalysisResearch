<AbstractNarration>One of social science's greatest theoretical puzzles is "What factors lead individuals to join together collectively to protect a public good, when all face temptations to free-ride, shirk, or otherwise act opportunistically?"  We examine this question in a study of poor, rural, indigenous communities to understand how they overcome socioeconomic and geographic barriers to launch new forms of social movements relying on Western science and international collaboration.  In contrast to arguments that environmental issues concern only the relatively affluent, we argue that immediate threats to community livelihoods may provide material incentives for poor communities to come together to mitigate environmental impacts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project evaluates determinants of collective action at the individual, community, and transnational levels using survey research, interviews, and archival research .  Understanding changes in indigenous movement strategies - from confrontation to cooperation with government authorities and scientists - should help communities and policymakers better cope with environmental threats.  The project will also help us understand how indigenous leaders draw attention to scarcities they face, while using the climate change frame to help pressure international organizations and governments regarding one of the most vital issues of our time.  Indeed, this project explains how small and apparently powerless groups largely outside of the Western system of justice can leverage judicial institutions to challenge powerful global energy interests.  Finally, the project will train graduate students, help scientists launch a social science component to environmental studies, and disseminate findings among academics and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Todd Eisenstadt (American University) and Karleen West (State University of New York - Geneseo) have published two journal articles based on their National Science Foundation-funded study, and just received a contract from the Oxford University Press for their forthcoming book "Who Speaks for Nature? Indigenous Movements, Public Opinion and the Petro-State in Ecuador."  Their work was published this year in the Journal of Comparative Politics ("Environmentalism in a Climate-Vulnerable State:  Rainforests, Oil, and Political Attitudes Along Ecuador?s Extractive Frontier") in January (49:1, 231-251) and Global Environmental Politics ("Indigenous Belief Systems, Science, and Resource Extraction:  Climate Change Attitudes in Ecuador and the Global South") in February (17:1, 40-57).  It was also recognized in a "Research Note" in Nature Climate Change in April 2017 (7, 236).    Our research discredits the importance of economic structures and post-material conditions in generating environmental concern in developing areas, finding that other factors are more important, including: 1) physical proximity to environmental degradation such as from mining and oil operations and 2) the level of vulnerability to ecosystem variance given an individual?s dependence upon the ecosystem for their livelihood. Furthermore, we find that environmental concerns, when they occur, may be mitigated by the expectation of economic benefit.     In addition, on the basis of one-on-one interviews with indigenous leaders in Ecuador, we argue that both traditional beliefs and Western science inform citizen views of climate change. We discuss the implications of these findings, arguing that rather than competing with science, the Kichwa-based cosmovision complements Western scientific efforts to combat climate change. We also find that proximity to oil extraction is an important determinant of belief in climate change in Ecuador, suggesting that conceptualizations of vulnerability should be tailored to the particular experiences of individuals.
