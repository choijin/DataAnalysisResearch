<AbstractNarration>The Minority Affairs Committee (MAC) of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) will offer a workshop in 2014 to mentor early career scientists who are trained in areas supported by the NSF in the fields of biology, biophysics, biochemistry and molecular biology. The workshop will provide grant writing skills and other mentoring for ~30 new investigators and postdoctoral scholars who are under-represented minorities in STEM or work at minority-serving institution. The workshop will provide training and mentorship from successful scientists who are themselves minorities, work at minority serving institutions, or have an established record of broadening participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to broaden participation in STEM related NSF-funded high-quality, outcome-oriented research. Completion of the 2014 workshop will enable Assistant Professors and postdoctoral scientists, particularly those from populations that are underrepresented in the sciences to obtain critical feedback in the development of more competitive NSF proposals. Successfully securing extramural funding is critical to sustaining a career in academia. When coupled with the disparate number of underrepresented minority faculty who are extra-murally funded, this workshop will have a profound impact on fostering the diversification of the scientific workforce. Success will be assessed by tracking the submissions and funding outcomes of proposals to the NSF by the mentees.  The assessment process will identify best practices to seed the development of a multi-year grant writing and mentoring workshop series. A web-based platform will enable dissemination of these best practices to the larger scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In August 2010, ASBMB/MAC secured funding from the National Science Foundation to host a workshop designed to identify the barriers faced by underrepresented minority scientists when submitting or resubmitting grant proposals, renewing awards, and when managing federally funded projects. Based on the findings, ASBMB/MAC produced a white paper detailing their findings that essentially identified a significant need for mentoring.   To further the goals of the ASBMB/MAC NSF award, ASBMB/MAC used the remaining funds to sponsor a Grant-writing and Mentoring Workshop for early career faculty in June 2013, and again in 2014.   The workshop paired assistant professors that are in their first four-years of a tenure-track position with ASBMB members (mentors) that have been successful in obtaining federal funding. The format of the workshop included presentations from NSF and NIH program officers, a mock grant review panel, as well as presentations on strategies for crafting a strong research proposal and targeting applications to the appropriate funding agency and mechanism. Arguably the most valuable aspect of the workshop was that each attendee was required to present the background, hypothesis, aims, preliminary data, and experimental approach of a potential research proposal to mentors and their peers, and received real time feedback.    Another strong component of the workshop was the diverse cohort of mentees. Our strategy was to leverage the diverse makeup of the ASBMB MAC and target minority faculty and faculty at minority-serving institutions, as well as non-minority participants at research-intensive institutions and primarily undergraduate institutions. A survey of the participants found that the workshop was an overwhelmingly positive experience. Seventy percent felt that the feedback received about their research objectives was likely to improve their grant writing skills, and 80% found the interaction with the mentors valuable. Significantly 75% of the participants that had attended a grant writing workshop in the past felt that the ASBMB workshop was more informative and helpful.   Given the success of this workshop, the ASBMB MAC successfully secured $50,000 for a second offering in June 2014 that has now become an annual offering. 30 participants per year were invited and more than 30% of them were either URM investigators or investigators from MSIs.  Since 2013, the MAC has served more than 120 early career investigators using this intrusive, hands-on mentoring approach.    Two members of the 2013 cohort have garnered NIH Innovator Awards, one has an award from NSF exceeding $3M, and several are awaiting funding decisions but have received very favorable reviews. 50% of the URM faculty that attended the 2013, 2014, and 2015 grant-writing workshop have successfully secured federal funding.   We continue to monitor the progress of both cohorts quarterly, not only for funding success, but also for other metrics of a successful career in academia.
