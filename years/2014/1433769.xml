<AbstractNarration>To address the needs of the US to increase the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) workforce with enhanced preparation and a diverse population of prepared secondary students, this strategies ITEST project will strengthen the current regional partnerships in place between secondary schools, the University of Cincinnati's Instructional Technology (IT) and STEM education programs, and local industries. This collaboration will develop layered programs for cohorts of secondary students, including those typically under-represented in ICT careers and in-service and pre-service secondary STEM teachers. The participants will engage in a range of ICT experiences beginning with fundamental ICT exposure coursework through selective accelerated courses and internships. This effort will incorporate university-based learning experiences, school-based learning experiences, and industry-based experiences for the students and educators.  The project will also develop an innovative network and cloud-based virtual  lab infrastructure for resource sharing across a multi-faceted system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will add to the research in the area of ICT focused on mechanisms for expanding student participation; understanding the sets of experiences that support student competency and persistence into ICT careers; and broadening the demographics of students in ICT programs and careers. The research responds to the need to understand how students with different levels of academic success and support consider ICT career pathways. This can serve to develop better support systems to expand the ICT workforce. Finally, the research will document how regional networks can be leveraged to form a coherent effort, rather than a diversity of individual efforts with the similar but potentially divergent goals. The research/evaluation questions are: (1) What is the impact of students' previous academic preparation on understanding of ICT careers and workforce choices? (2) How does a student's previous academic preparation influence the student's success in engaging in design-based ICT learning activities? (3) Which activities are most engaging for students typically underrepresented in ICT careers and programs? and (4) In what ways do the partners, parents, and industry interact to form a comprehensive network in support of ICT career pathways for students?</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Designed-based Information Technology Learning Experience (DITLE) project is an education project supporting K-12 students and teachers to learn fundamental IT skills through after-school club, summer camp, internship, and teacher training and certificate programs. The project admitted more than 200 high school students into four 3-week long summer camps. 180 students went through all camp activities and received a certification of completion. Students also received college credits when they passed a follow-up test. Students and teachers are from six Cincinnati Public High Schools with a&nbsp;high percentage of low-income and minority students. Female is significantly underrepresented in the field of computing. The project attracted 80 female students to the summer camps. The project was expanded to more partner schools in the last two years. Those who passed a camp follow-up test have received a letter indicating that they will receive advanced standing for the 3 credit hour course IT1050: The Fundamentals of Information Technology when they are a matriculated University of Cincinnati student. In the 2015 camp, 25 students passed a&nbsp; test proving competency, in the 2016 camp, 40 students proved competency by completing projects and in the 2017 camp, 50 students and in 2018, 36 students proved competency by completing projects. Three IT faculty members, four pre-service teachers,&nbsp;and thirteen undergraduate IT students facilitated teaching and led student team projects each year. The pre-service teachers may continue working with these students in the fall through the after-school programs. These pre-service teachers are graduate students from UC&rsquo;s School of Education. They plan to teach STEM classes in these high schools after graduation.&nbsp;</p> <p>The summer camp curriculum has been revised and modified through the project years to adopt a competency-based design. The curriculum emphasizes personalized or small group hands-on activities and interpersonal communication skill preparation. The curriculum has been well documented and adoption-ready through UC&rsquo;s remote laboratory that is currently supporting partner high schools and community colleges.</p> <p>The project team conducted a comprehensive study on the student data collected each year. The results were published in education conferences and journals. A project evaluation report is attached to each annual report. In 2017-2018 academic year, the project was promoted to more high schools in the region through several public events. Social network channels are established to connect the stake holders of the project. The industry partners actively served as mentors, keynote speakers, and project collaborators. We also received two industry donations in the format of full-scholarship to support female minority high school students to get into UC&rsquo;s IT program. With the industry support, School of IT will continue the DITLE camp after the NSF support ends in fall 2018 and make the DITLE summer camp an annual event thereafter. The DITLE project enabled the School of IT to outreach to a broader range of K-12 schools in the region and attracted funding from both public and private sectors. &nbsp;To incorporate the camp with a newly established Early College Program which allows high school students to complete college freshman year IT courses at high schools, the DITLE camp will serve to provide an IT exposure experience for students who are interested in enrolling in the Early College Program. In fall 2018, the School already signed agreements with more than 50 high schools in Ohio for the Early College Program. The expanded high school collaboration efforts will make DITLE an even more successful project after the NSF support ends.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2018<br>
