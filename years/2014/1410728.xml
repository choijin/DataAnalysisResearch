<AbstractNarration>Galaxy clusters are the most overdense environments in the universe. As such, they constitute an extreme laboratory for studying the physical processes that govern cosmological mass assembly and the formation and evolution of galaxies. This award will enable a pioneering study of galaxy clusters when the universe was approximately 3 billion years old, using valuable legacy datasets and new observations that harness the power of ground-based telescopes (e.g., the Gemini and Keck Observatories) together with space-based facilities (e.g., the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By emphasizing the close connections between observations and theory, this work will provide a cornerstone for understanding how galaxies in rich clusters assemble their stars. It will also provide critical tests of cosmological structure formation models, and give fresh insights into how inflows and outflows of gas vary with environment in the distant universe. Ultimately, this research will lead to a better understanding of when, where, and how star formation is quenched in cluster galaxies as they evolve into the passive galaxies that dominate clusters in the nearby universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator and her team will also conduct two pilot programs aimed at increasing diversity in the science fields. First, the team will produce an original video series, entitled "I Am Science," which seeks to inspire students by sharing the personal stories of scientists from all backgrounds. Second, they will integrate "I Am Science" into the curriculum of the Expanding Your Horizons program at Texas A&amp;M, in order to bring these inspiring stories to 6th to 8th grade girls.</AbstractNarration>

By obtaining deep new observations of galaxies when the Universe was only about 4 billion years old, we test whether galaxy environment already plays a role at this early epoch.  The NSF project established the ZFIRE survey which couples valuable legacy datasets with new data to target some of the most distant galaxy clusters yet discovered.  By measuring galaxy properties and comparing to current cosmological structure formation models, the ZFIRE survey provides new insight into the interplay between galaxies and their large scale environment.  With the NSF support, the ZFIRE survey has published results in 13 peer-reviewed papers in high impact journals and presented results in more than 50 international talks.  We definitively establish that large scale environment does not yet play a major role in transforming galaxies at redshifts of z~2.  We show this through a series of analyses using empirical scaling relations that combine galaxy kinematics, metallicities, star formation rates, and ionization conditions as well as the fraction of galaxies in pairs.  Most of the publications were led by graduate students and the ZFIRE observations make up a significant component of 6 PhD theses.  Six undergrad researchers also received training in the ZFIRE survey with five going on to graduate school.  The students involved in the ZFIRE survey obtained essential training and professional development skills as well as confidence to achieve their highest aspirations.
