<AbstractNarration>The investigators will make measurements of nearby dwarf galaxies and compare them with theoretical simulations to constrain the nature of Dark Matter in the universe.  Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and engagement of  under-represented groups toward careers in science.  Visualizations of dark matter simulations will be created for public outreach.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program aims to measure chemical and dynamical structure of stars within the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal satellites and compare the measurements to simulations, in order to infer the spatial distribution of dark matter in the least luminous galaxies. The observational results will be compared directly to a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that resolve actual observables - stellar positions, velocities, metallicities, and ages.  The generation of mock observational catalogs from simulations will allow dark matter and galaxy formation models to be compared to data directly in terms of observables.  The wider ranging goal of this project is to test the standard cold dark matter cosmological model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The nature of dark matter has perplexed astronomers for nearly a century.  While observations now clearly indicate that most of the material in the Universe emits and reflects no light, that invisibility allows only indirect observations to determine what the dark matter is made of.  Computer simulations show that different theoretical candidates for the dark matter particle result in different predictions for the internal structure of dark matter within the 'halos' that support luminous galaxies.  By measuring the positions and motions of stars within galaxies, astronomers can infer the amount and spatial distribution of dark matter and compare to predictions, thereby distinguishing amongst particle models.    There have been two longstanding problems with this approach.  First, the predictions derived from simulations often neglect the astrophysical processes of galaxy formation within dark matter halos, which may mask the effects of dark matter particle physics in determining the structure of those halos.  Second, the measurement of halo structure from astronomical observations requires statistical inference that is difficult to test in realistic situations.    This project combined the expertise of observational and theoretical astronomers to tackle both of these problems.  New simulations were executed in order to examine directly the effects of galaxy formation on dark matter halo structure.  These simulations were then used directly to test methods for inferring the structure of dark matter halos from observations.    Key results are the following: 1) the astrophysical processes of galaxy formation -- specifically the explosions of supernovae -- can deposit sufficient energy in the dark matter that mass migrates outward, lowering the central density of halos.  2) These processes become inefficient in the smallest and least massive dwarf galaxies, such that the structure of dwarf galaxy dark matter halos is determined primarily by the nature of the dark matter particle.  3) New statistical methodologies were developed, tested, and demonstrated to provide reliable inferences about the dark matter halos in dwarf galaxies.  4) Application of these new methods to real dwarf galaxy data show that existing data are compatible with predictions based on the standard hypothesis that the dark matter is 'cold' (i.e., consists of slow-moving particles) and interacts only via the gravitational force.  The central question -- Do We Need Something Beyond Cold Dark Matter -- is answered: 'Not yet'.             Last Modified: 11/22/2018       Submitted by: Matthew G Walker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
