<AbstractNarration>1446280 &lt;br/&gt;Voigt, Christopher A.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for the inaugural 'Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution and Design (SEED) Conference 2014' to be held in Los Angeles, Manhatten Beach Marriott Conference Center, CA, July 14-17, 2014. SEED 2014 will be the first in an annual series of meetings held to bring researchers from industry and academia in the area of Synthetic Biology. The SEED series will provide leadership in the development of the field of synthetic biology and will serve to broaden the participants in the field by appealing to broad sectors in industry and providing a means for young investigators and those outside of the field to participate. Proceedings will be published each year in the journal ACS Synthetic Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of CBET and by the Synthetic and Systems Biology Program of MCB.</AbstractNarration>
