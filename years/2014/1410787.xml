<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to North Carolina Central University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The goal of the project is develop  a new Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieval approach that addresses outstanding challenges of remote sensing applications to air particulate matter (PM2.5). Particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5), which are generated by all types of combustion activities and certain industrial processes, are referred to as "fine" particles and are believed to pose a great health risks. Because of their small size, fine particles can lodge deeply into the lungs. This project will also enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students at North Carolina Central University.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a new methodology for retrieving Aerosol Optical Depth at a 1 kilometer resolution suitable for the aerosol microphysical environments and land surface types in North Carolina. This project seeks to allow better characterization of spatial and temporal variations in spectral Aerosol Optical Depth and thus improve the understanding of aerosol optical properties including estimation of the single scattering albedo and the asymmetry parameter. The specific objectives are to investigate the spectral characteristics of aerosols in urban areas; to develop a regression model to estimate PM2.5 using ground AOD measurements; and to develop a new method to retrieve AOD from satellite data at a 1 kilometer resolution.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Previous studies presented a high potential of utilizing MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth(AOD) data to map PM2.5 at a regional scale. However, this approach is often challenged by the lack of strong correlation between ground PM2.5 concentration and AOD value from MODIS imagery. The objectives of this project were to derive optical parameters of urban aerosols and to develop a new AOD retrieval approach using MODIS imagery in order to help improve AOD-PM2.5 correlations in North Carolina. In this project, both spatial and temporal variations in spectral AOD in the study area were characterized and local aerosol optical parameters including single scattering albedo(SSA) and asymmetry parameter(g) were derived. Also, a new AOD retrieval approach that employs local optical parameters was developed to derive new AOD at 1-km resolution from MODIS L 1B data. The use of local aerosol optical parameters enabled better estimation of AOD values from MODIS imagery. Significant progress was made in understanding optical properties of urban aerosols and the improvement in AOD-PM2.5 correlations was achieved through the development of new AOD retrieval approach. Seasonal AOD maps of North Carolina were also generated to present AOD distribution spatially. This new AOD retrieval approach can be extended to develop a robust model to estimate PM2.5 in other states in the U.S. Moreover, this project trained two graduate students and five undergraduate students to acquire skills in quantitative analysis and image processing through data collection and analysis. This is in turn better prepared minority students with excellent skills and increased their competitiveness for the 21st century job market. It facilitated the process of increasing the number of minority students who will pursue degrees in STEM related fields.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/27/2019<br>      Modified by: Zhiming&nbsp;Yang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410787/1410787_10314353_1569611381614_DerivedSSAandg--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410787/1410787_10314353_1569611381614_DerivedSSAandg--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Derived SSA and g"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410787/1410787_10314353_1569611381614_DerivedSSAandg--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Derived SSA and g"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Derived Single Scatter Albedo (SSA) and Asymmetry Parameter (g) in Durham, NC</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andre Jones and Zhiming Yang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhiming&nbsp;Yang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Derived SSA and g</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410787/1410787_10314353_1569611457630_MapofAODinSpring2017inNC--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410787/1410787_10314353_1569611457630_MapofAODinSpring2017inNC--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Map of AOD in spring 2017 in NC"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410787/1410787_10314353_1569611457630_MapofAODinSpring2017inNC--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Map of AOD in spring 2017 in NC"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map of AOD in spring 2017 in NC</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andre Jones and Zhiming Yang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhiming&nbsp;Yang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Map of AOD in spring 2017 in NC</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
