<AbstractNarration>This award supports US-based participants in the Young Topologists Meeting (YTM) 2014 held at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark from Monday, June 30th to Friday, July 4th, 2014.  This international meeting will bring together junior researchers in the mathematical fields of algebraic and geometric topology, and provide an opportunity for them to speak publicly about their research and to learn about recent developments by their future colleagues.  Mini-courses will give broader introductions to two important subjects in the field, as seen through the eyes of more experienced researchers.  The conference provides opportunities for networking, for meeting future research colleagues, and for forming research collaborations.  Previous instances of the YTM have had mostly participants based at European institutions; support from this award will enhance opportunities for international collaboration by allowing more significant participation of US-based junior researchers. The diverse atmosphere at the conference and among the speakers and participants will also encourage people from underrepresented groups to pursue research careers in topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The YTM is an annual event, alternating between Copenhagen and Lausanne, Switzerland, organized mainly by graduate students and postdocs.  The meeting will consist mainly of talks given by junior topologists, in addition to two mini-course lecture series given by distinguished senior researchers.  The lecture series this year will be given by Jacob Lurie (Harvard University, US), who will speak about Tamagawa numbers via algebraic topology, and Lars Hesselholt (Nagoya University, Japan and University of Copenhagen, Denmark), who will speak about trace methods in algebraic K-theory.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funds provided by this award have been used to support the participation of the PI and 20 PhD students and postdocs in the conference "Young Topologists Meeting 2014" in Copenhagen, Denmark.  A smaller amount was used to support the participation of 2 additional PhD students in the follow-up conference "Young Topologists Meeting 2015" in Lausanne, Switzerland.  The conference featured two plenary speakers who were senior researchers, Jacob Lurie (Harvard) and Lars Hesselholt (Nagoya/Copenhagen).  Each gave a lecture series on a topic of their expertise: Hesselholt on "Topological Hochschild Homology", and Lurie on "Tamagawa Numbers via Nonabelian Poincare Duality".  The conference also had 33 contributed talks by junior participants (PhD students and postdocs).  These talks were selected by the organizing committee and were an important part of the event: one of the goals of the conference was to give junior participants an opportunity to present their research to their peers and future collaborators.  Of these contributed talks, 11 were supported by the NSF grant, and it was widely percieved by the organizing committee that the support of the grant greatly increased the overall quality of the conference.  A small amount of funds were left from the 2014 conference, and was used to support the participation of 2 PhD students at the conference "Young Topologists Meeting 2015".
