<AbstractNarration>The ability to express scientific ideas in both written and oral form is an important 21st century skill.   Teachers, employers, and college faculty lament the inability of many high school graduates to write clearly.  This deficit in writing is due in part because teachers do not have the time to provide appropriate, timely feedback to students on their writing. This project would help teachers help students achieve these skills through automating an effective feedback process, in ways that are customized to particular disciplines and local classroom needs, particularly in high needs districts.  The project will contribute to knowledge about how students learn to write and how computer assisted systems can support this learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and test three tools:  1) Teaching resources organized as developmental trajectories for teachers to use (e.g. from more simple to more complex; with diagnostics and strategies for addressing particular challenges); 2) A teacher dashboard that uses Artificial Intelligence tools to provide timely formative assessment to teachers by highlighting problem areas in their students' writing and peer reviews; and 3) An online teacher resource exchange to rapidly grow the set of appropriate assignments that can be used with this approach, critically filtered by student performance metrics.  The project builds on a current system called SWoRD, which supports student peer reviewing in many disciplines within and beyond science.  Working with six lead teachers and larger set of pilot teachers, the project  will develop a trajectory of effective writing assignments in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.  In year three, there will be a summative evaluation with 90 teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Writing is critically important to all disciplines including science, both as a way to communicate outcomes and information, but also as part of the learning process. But it receives very little attention in high school science instruction, in part because high school teachers do not know how to effectively teach science writing and in part because they have too high a workload to assign and evaluate writing assignments on a regular basis. We leveraged online peer assessment as a pedagogically effective and time efficient approach for adding writing instruction into high school science. We created a library of short science writing assignments, along with student-friendly evaluation rubrics. Students were able to provide highly reliable and helpful comments to each other with these rubrics. We created a tool, called the Shared Assignment Library, that allows teachers to publish and search new or adapted writing assignments, and the objects in the library are searchable by classroom data (how reliably the students could judge each other and how helpful their comments were). K-12 teachers and university faculty throughout the world and across disciplines are now sharing assignments using this tool. We also created a method for automatically evaluating the nature and depth of revisions that students made in argumentative essays from one draft to the next, along with a tool for students and teachers to visualize the types of revisions that were made. Finally, we found that although science teachers care more about both the correctness of factual information and arguments in the essay than the coherence and understandability of the text that is produced, students are generally not comfortable in commenting on correctness, and instead tend to focus on coherence and understandability even when rubrics direct them to correctness. This same pattern also occurred for students writing text analysis essays in an English class.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Christian&nbsp;D&nbsp;Schunn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
