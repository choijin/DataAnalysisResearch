<AbstractNarration>The study of extreme environments, especially those that are similar to conditions thought to be prevalent on early Earth, provide insights not only into how life ekes out an existence in the most hostile places on our planet today, but how it might have done so long ago, perhaps at the dawn of life.  This work will examine life in such an extreme environment.  It is a serpentinization site where liquids emerge from the Earth at very high pH, very low redox potential, with almost no organics to eat, and virtually no oxygen or other things to respire: one of the most challenging environments on Earth.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies of two geochemically-different highly-alkaline groundwater sources revealed genomically and phylogentically unusual organisms and microbial isolates having highly-adapted physiological and genomic features to the serpentinizing environments. Here the PIs will expand their previous studies studies, focusing on questions related to the geochemical and microbial metabolic interactions occurring at this site: e.g., 1) how do each of the major microbial groups/players cope with the stringent geochemistry of The Cedars, 2) how do these microbes interact with one another to sustain the taxonomically stable communities of The Cedars serpentinizing environments, and, 3) how do the microbial activities potentially contribute to the occurring geochemical transformations? To answer these questions the PIs will test a number of conceptual, strategic and metabolic hypotheses, using several approaches, including: 1) a combination of advanced microscopic observations to visualize the localization of each organism, 2) stable-isotope probing to identify organisms that utilize a given carbon substrate, 3) stimulus-induced metatranscriptomics to illustrate the gene responses to the specific geochemical compounds (conditions), 4) metaproteomics to obtain the in situ protein profiles, and 5) detailed metabolic capabilities of isolated strains that are abundantly observed in terrestrial serpentinizing sites on Earth. Successful integration of results from these five strategies is expected to produce a functional interaction-model between geochemical factors and microbial metabolic activities in a relatively simple microbial community, functioning under extreme environmental conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Cedars were found to have two very different types of alkaline springs, one fed by shallow water, and the other fed from a deep water source.  While chemically nearly identical, and shallow and deep water springs had very different microbial communities, with the deep water-fed springs being composed of many candidate phyla.  Binned genomes were established for all major members, and revealed that taxa from the deep-fed springs had extremely small genomes, often lacking in genes coding for key biosynthetic pathways or metabolic abilities, and having uniformly small genomes.  The shallow-fed springs, in contrast contained "familiar" taxa, generally complete metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, and larger genomes.  Of note was the unusual distribution of ATP synthase genes in the deep-fed community.  While all but one of the OTUs in the community were bacteria, there were no bacterial (F-type) ATPase genes in the metagenome, and all bacterial binned genomes had either no ATPase genes, or the archael (A-type) ATPase genes.  This is an unprecedented result, and one for which there is at present no explanation for.  In the shallow-fed springs, the distribution of ATPase genes was as expected: all bacteria had F-type genes, and the archaea had A-type genes.  During the course of this work, we were successful in getting the numerically dominant taxon in cultivation, important because it is the dominant taxon in nearly every other serpentinization site in which bacteria have been studied.  This was a hydrogen-utilizing beta proteobacteria, which we called Serpentinomonas.  Of note is that it is inhibited by Na+ and has a requirement for Ca++ -- the nature of this requirement is now under study.  These strains grow autotrophically with hydrogen as the energy source, and solid CaCO3 as the sole carbon source.  Using electrochemical techniques, we also were able to isolate respiratory alkaliphiles from The Cedars springs that were capable of growth using poised electrons as their electron acceptors.  All these results indicate that the populations in the alkaline springs of The Cedars contain a great many unusual microbes that have adapted to survival and growth in one of the most challenging environments on our planet.
