<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, the research groups of Professors John Arnold and Robert Bergman of University of California, Berkeley are working toward developing new reagents containing inexpensive and earth-abundant early transition metals that are capable of cleaving strong bonds. Ideally, this research will lead to development of catalysts for removal of fluorine and chlorine from environmentally dangerous halogenated organic wastes, such as CFCs, selective functionalization of chemical feedstocks to produce high-valued organic products, and synthesis of new inorganic polymers and materials. The most immediate broader impacts of the work described in this proposal relate to the training of skilled synthetic chemists and the fact that a more complete understanding of fundamental reaction steps that occur at transition metal sites is important in a wide range of industrially important chemical conversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development of new niobium systems supported by imido and &amp;#946;-diketiminate and related ligands. This project is split into two major parts. The first involves reactivity and mechanistic studies of low-valent niobium systems toward developing reagents for activation and functionalization of C-F, C-Cl, and C-O bonds. The second involves synthesis of a series of bis(imido) complexes that are reactive across a niobium-nitrogen multiple bond, and investigation of their reactivity toward cycloaddition of unsaturated substrates and 1,2-addition of C-H and E-H (E = H, B, Al, Si, N, P, O, S) bonds. Target compounds will be characterized using 1D and 2D 1H, 13C, and other heteronuclear NMR techniques, X-ray crystallography, FT-IR (Fourier transform infra-red) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and other characterization techniques. Additionally, DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations will be used to gain electronic structure and mechanistic insights.</AbstractNarration>

The transition metals can be separated into two categories based on the reaction pathways that complexes containing these metals tend to follow: the early and the late transition metals. The boundary line between these two groups runs vertically down the center of the d-block of the periodic table, with metals in groups 3&ndash;5 typically being labeled "early" and those in groups 8&ndash;12 referred to as "late." The metals in groups 6 and 7 tend to fall between these two hard distinctions and are sometimes referred to as the "mid" transition metals. The late transition metals are able to exist in a wide variety of readily accessible oxidation states and easily undergo ligand dissociation/association processes; as such, complexes containing these metals are often found as catalysts, including in our bodies (examples include the binding and release of oxygen by iron in blood cells and the breaking of chemical bonds by cobalt during metabolism).     In stark contrast to their late-metal congeners, the early transition metals possess relatively high-energy valence d-orbitals; often, complexes containing these metals are found in d0 oxidation states with no valence electrons available to engage in redox chemistry. As such, these transition metal complexes tend form very strong bonds to ligands and engage in redox-neutral (no change in oxidation state) bond making and breaking processes, with &sigma;-bond metathesis being the prime example.
