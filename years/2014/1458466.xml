<AbstractNarration>Extracting biological knowledge from complex datasets such as those now being compiled requires integration of powerful computational tools. Recent developments in computational biology as well as rich new data sources provide novel opportunities for integrating massive amounts of biological data. This perfect storm of new data and advanced data acquisition, management, and integration afford the unique opportunity to drive the discovery of new, complex patterns in biology. The project will leverage NSF's considerable investment in biodiversity tools provided by Open Tree of Life (the framework for the project), Lifemapper (which handles geospatial data), iDigBio (data from~1 billion museum specimens that carry locality data and their ecological information), and Arbor (computer tools that permit new analyses from the sources noted). It will create much needed computational connections among these tools. It will then build upon these new linkages and tools, enabling novel research in biodiversity. These linkages will provide researchers the opportunity to rapidly synthesize datasets and use them to address diverse evolutionary questions. The tools and infrastructure the project will build will connect species relationships with species distribution models, climate projections, genes and traits. The project will transform future studies of biodiversity; it will provide a global integration of powerful tools that will permit new data-driven discovery in "next generation" biodiversity science. It will provide interdisciplinary post-doc and graduate student training in bioinformatics, use of digitized specimen data, and complex analyses (e.g. ecological analyses), preparing the biodiversity scientists of the future. The project will recruit underrepresented students and women and develop an undergrad course that will help train students with the integrative skills (field biology to computational biology) needed in the workforce. We will further develop this module for wider classroom use. We will introduce an annual week-long course at University of Florida (UF) for students and post-docs on the use of the resources developed. With education specialists at UF, the project will produce video materials and a coordinated display for general audiences on the importance of digitized specimen data, and their utility for studies of climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a computational framework linking diverse data (trees of species relationships, morphology, ecology, fossils, geography, and climate) across research tools used by the biological community, including Open Tree of Life, which will serve as the framework to which all other biological data - traits, genes, genomes, and especially specimens - will be linked, as well as Lifemapper, iDigBio, and Arbor. Use of the large, hyper-diverse plant group Saxifragales will provide precisely what is needed to drive the development of these tools--a comprehensive dataset that covers morphology, ecology, geography, fossils, and climate provides a test case for refining the tools the project will develop and their integration. The project will: 1. Facilitate new synergistic research of broad utility at the interface of phylogenetics, ecology, evolutionary biology, biogeography and biodiversity science, enabling scientists to address novel questions relating phenotypic and ecological biodiversity, spatial and temporal variation, community assembly, and diversification across landscapes and through time. 2. Increase visibility and accessibility of iDigBio, Open Tree of Life, Arbor, and Lifemapper resources by linking them together and making them available through multiple access points (e.g., pre-existing tools associated with Arbor and Lifemapper) in a variety of appropriate formats. 3. Develop a complete, multifaceted species-level dataset for a large clade (Saxifragales), which will not only fill in this branch on the ToL, but will produce a resource of great utility for the scientific community to explore. 4. Demonstrate the utility of iDigBio, Open Tree, Lifemapper, and Arbor resources with a comprehensive analysis using near complete sampling of Saxifragales, for which we will add the following data layers: DNA sequences, morphology, fossils, ontologies, geospatial and environmental data, digitized voucher specimens, and link to the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). The project will: 1) provide interdisciplinary post-doc and graduate student training in bioinformatics, large-scale phylogeny reconstruction, use of digitized specimen data, and complex post-tree analyses (e.g. niche modeling, niche diversification), preparing the integrative biodiversity scientists of the future; 2) recruit underrepresented students and women; 3) developed an undergrad course that uses field collection, herbarium specimens, digitized data (iDigBio), and niche modeling (with climate change; 4) introduce an annual week-long course (UF) for students and post-docs on the use of the resources produced; 5) produce video materials and a coordinated display for general audiences on the importance of digitized specimen data, their utility for modeling niche evolution through time and implications for climate change. The project will provide a platform that will enable other researchers to take the same integrated approach in other groups. It will also establish web links to EOL and 1) build species pages; 2) place morphological and other trait data on TraitBank, making these widely available; 3) work with EOL and iNaturalist to engage citizen scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the evolution of the diversity of life on earth is a fundamental goal of the biological sciences. Nevertheless, this is a difficult task that requires the use of many different data sources and analytical techniques that reflect the diversity of data types. Also, many biological processes result in heterogeneity in these data. The diversification of species across ecosystems and through time is not uniform but varies due to many processes. Geographic ranges of species vary through time due to landuse changes, climate change, and other factors. Finally, data, whether it is genetic or geographic, are not available for all species and for many species there are few publicly available specimens.     The primary goal of this project was to four fold: 1) to facilitate new synergistic research of broad utility at the interface of phylogenetics, ecology, evolutionary biology, biogeography, and biodiversity science, enabling scientists to address novel questions relating phenotypic and ecological biodiversity, spatial and temporal variation, community assembly, and diversification across landscapes and through time; 2) Increase visibility and accessibility of iDigBio, Lifemapper, Open Tree of Life and Arbor Project data and computational resources by linking them together and making them available through multiple access points in a variety of appropriate formats; 3) Develop a complete, multifaceted species-level data set for a large plant clade--Saxifragales--which will not only fill in this branch on the Tree of Life (TOL) but also produce a resource of great utility for the scientific community to explore; 4) Demonstrate the utility of iDigBio, Lifemapper, and Open Tree resources with a comprehensive analysis using near-complete sampling of Saxifragales, for which we will add the following data layers: DNA sequences, morphology, fossils, ontologies, geospatial and environmental data, digitized voucher specimens, and link to the Encyclopedia of Life.     This project has successfully developed connections between specimen resources, geographic data, and phylogenetic information. In successfully developing these connections, we have facilitated several studies during the life of the grant but also made possible countless more that will be conducted long after the end of the grant. Some of these connections are for existing resources such as iDigBio and Lifemapper and some are new such as our newly dated Open Tree of Life phylogeny and angiosperm phylogeny constructed from GenBank and Open Tree. The development of these new resources required new methods and software developed as part of this grant.    Consequently, in using these techniques we have showed several broad patterns of evolution across angiosperms. In particular, we have demonstrated increased diversification rates across flowering plants as well as the limitations of the currently available data. We have also developed hypotheses for the community assembly of plants in North America, a project that has generated significant future developments and work. Finally, we have constructed the largest plant phylogeny using public data and integrated the Open Tree of Life taxonomy into this tree. This resource has now been used as a data resource for several additional projects within and outside of the grant personnel.    This project has had diverse broader impacts. In total nine research articles have been published in several journals with diverse audiences with several more to be completed as a result of the software development. Additionally, several new methods and techniques were developed that will serve a broad biodiversity analytics community. These have resulted in or contributed to five public code repositories. Numerous personnel were trained in research techniques during the project including three graduate students and two postdocs at the University of Michigan and several others at participating institutions. Finally, the project has led to the establishment of collaborations between researchers across the US and around the world among diverse types of institutions from large universities to botanical gardens and museums.
