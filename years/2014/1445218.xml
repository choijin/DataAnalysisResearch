<AbstractNarration>This award supports a small workshop to be held in Zhaigansk, Sakha Republic, Russia, in August 2014 as part of the Network or Indigenous Knowledge (NIK). NIK is a project by the Yukon River Intertribal Watershed Council that is building a global network of watershed users, managers, scientists, community scholars and knowledge holders on the Yukon in both Alaska and Canada, the Amazon, and the Nile. This workshop would introduce NIK to the Yakut and Evenk people of Siberia in order to bring the Lena River Basin, one of the 3 rivers in Siberia that contributes fresh water to the Arctic Ocean and is the largest river whose watershed is entirely in Russia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lena River It is the 11th longest river in the world and has the 9th largest watershed that provides fresh water to the Arctic Ocean.    NIK scientists are providing a mechanism by which global watersheds can be monitored year round by local people, something not possible by field scientists, most who can only visit their research sites in the summer season for a few weeks.  NIK will train local people in scientific methodologies for monitoring the health and production of the Lena River Watershed.  Local monitoring will provide data on the health and production of one of the worlds largest watersheds, information critical to understanding the Arctic Ocean ecosystem and how it is changing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Yukon to Yakutia  Report to National Science Foundation  The "Yukon to Yakutia" workshops sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Trust for Mutual understanding as well as private funding from Jon Waterhouse were a smashing success! Departing for Russia in     2014 at the very height of tensions between Russia and the U.S. over the Crimea and Ukraine (mostly media driven) would seem the epitome of madness. But, when weÃ†re talking about Indigenous People and their world-wide desire to connect, assist one another, and help humankind the "madness" is inspiring!  Each Team member, departing from their home bases, Anchorage, Alaska, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, and Woods Hole, Massachusetts met in New York for final prep and the flight to Moscow, Russia.  Arriving in Moscow they immediately set about the round of logistic, Indigenous and government meetings related to the workshops. Meetings were held with RAIPON Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North. http://raipon.info/  These meetings were attended by all of the top officials from RAIPON and representatives from the Russian DUMA (Gosudarstvennaya Duma). The meetings were very comprehensive and the Russian officials were most welcoming. They commented on the fact that we were coming to Russia while others were leaving. They loved the concept of the Indigenous workshops and connection between the groups and offered their full support.    They also let us know that they would be reporting back to the full Duma and seek their support for the work.

The meetings with the Russian Permafrost Institute led to an agreement to create a Memorandum of Understanding for future cooperation.

Ms. MarshallÃ†s interviews sought and found the deeper, more human element of Native Knowledge that will contribute to the overall network.  Ekaterina Bulygina, Jody Inkster and Jon Waterhouse gave presentations to schools and community gatherings as well as trainings in modern scientific water quality data collection techniques. They provided 120 hours of water quality collection equipment trainings t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
