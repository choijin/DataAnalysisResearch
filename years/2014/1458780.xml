<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the Capitol Technology University will award scholarships to 26 incoming high-need, academically-talented transfer students in an online bachelor's degree program in cybersecurity.  The goal of Cyber Transfer Student Program (CTSP) will be to facilitate degree completion in two years for over 70% of program participants.  Recruitment will focus on place-bound community college graduates whose college attendance options are limited.  By enabling participants to complete a bachelor's degree at a distance, CTSP will increase the number of cybersecurity professionals in the workforce.  Many will be minorities and first-generation college students who might not otherwise complete a bachelor's degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capitol faculty and staff will provide pre-matriculation counseling to help potential transfers maximize credit transfer.  Academic and student support services for the three cohorts will include an honors seminar, faculty-led activities, and a multi-faceted mentoring and advising program.  Online student support services and extracurricular experiences, combined with synchronous online curricular delivery and scholarship support, will provide a supportive and engaging environment for students while removing the distractions of financial need. Ongoing assessment of progress towards project goals will help contribute to the knowledge base regarding the role efforts such as this play in improving STEM degree attainment of financially disadvantaged students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cyber Transfer Scholars Program   Intellectual Merit&mdash; Capitol Technology University’s (formerly Capitol College) previous S-STEM grants for freshmen and sophomores demonstrated that cohort classes, extracurricular projects with faculty, and student mentors contributed significantly to student bonding, academic engagement, and retention. This project modified and enhanced those retention practices to provide a supportive environment for transfer students, including many who will be studying online, while removing the distractions of financial need.  Broader Impacts&mdash; By helping community college graduates transfer to Capitol and study full-time for a bachelor’s degree, this program will increase the number of STEM graduates entering the workforce. Many will be minorities and first-generation college students who might not otherwise complete a bachelor’s degree.  Key components - The program included Pre-matriculation counseling (optional)&mdash;Community college students interested in the Cyber Transfer Program had the opportunity to meet with Capitol Tech staff to discuss the transfer process and how to select courses that will transfer to the IA program.   Transfer orientation&mdash;Each cohort participated in a customized online orientation program prior to the start of the Junior year.  Honors Seminar and other shared classes&mdash;Each cohort enrolled in a single section of an IA Honors Seminar, and students took other IA classes together whenever possible.  Faculty-led cohort activities&mdash;Cohorts attended group meetings that include interaction with faculty and activities designed to enrich and broaden their STEM experiences.  Cyber Lab activities&mdash;Students were encouraged to take part in extracurricular activities in the Cyber Lab, including mock cyber battles and practice for regional cyber competitions.

The stated persistence goal was to increase the graduation rate after two years of study from 33 percent to 70 percent.  52% of the students have graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and 4% continue to pursue their degree at Capitol Tech, 4% are completing course work to transfer to Capitol Tech with an anticipated completion of May 2021.
