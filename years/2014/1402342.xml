<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the use of flash memory as the foundation for multi-tiered storage systems. Digital content (e.g., text, image, sound, video, etc.) has experienced explosive growth. Internet media providers (e.g., Facebook, Flicker, YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, etc.) are facing huge I/O demand for delivering content. And, due to the increasing video traffic on the web, backend storage servers not only need increased storage capacity but also increased storage bandwidth to serve the web clients in a timely manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hard disk drives (HDDs) have advanced in capacity per dollar while main memory (in the form of DRAM) has advanced in speed per dollar. Recently, flash memory technology has been getting attention from industry due to its significant cost decrease. Flash-based Solid-State Drives (SSDs) are now at the price point where they can bridge the capacity-speed gap between HDDs and DRAM. In addition, energy consumption of flash memory is far less than the two traditional storage technologies. This project proposes that multi-tiered storage architecture is a compelling vehicle to optimize capacity, speed, and energy consumption of storage by exploiting the advantages of all three technologies &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storage devices make up nearly 40% of the energy consumption of a typical data center -- consequently, storage servers should not only have high capacity and deliver high performance, but also be energy efficient. From an environmental perspective, it is extremely important to devise solutions that can reduce the carbon footprint of data centers. A multi-tiered, web storage system that uses flash memory for caching is a promising solution for performance, capacity, and energy efficiency. This project's technology presents an opportunity for CDN providers and web service providers to optimize the performance and energy efficiency of their storage systems. While the primary customers of this technology will be corporations that run a large number of web servers, there is an environmental benefit from the carbon emission reduction of the data centers run by such big web corporations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Today over 90% of the web data traffic is video.  The data traffic is mostly generated from stored video assets from content producers such as Netflix and the like.  The video assets are stored in data centers and streamed on-demand to client devices.   Adaptive HTTP streaming is the dominant technology used for responding to client requests for such video assets hitting the data centers that host the Content Distribution networks (CDNs).  Response time for serving client requests is crucial to ensure that the end-user has jitter-free continuous video watching experience.   The architecture of the storage servers at such data centers that host these video assets is a critical component to assure good response time for client requests.  Due to the enormity of the video assets and the continued growth of video content in data centers, there is a need to reduce both the capital expenditure and the energy consumption of the storage servers while assuring good response times. Flashboost is a flash SSD caching software solution that guarantees consistent read latency from SSDs for serving static web contents. For a given storage throughput, Flashboost reduces the capital expenditure at least 30% and reduces energy consumption by 35% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Through the I-corps program, we have identified two customer segments for our technology. The first one is storage box manufacturers such as StorTrends, Quantum, and Coraid; and the second one is media companies such as TBS, CNN, and Disney. Storage box manufacturers have shown great interest in incorporating our technology both to penetrate new market verticals and to get a competitive edge. Further, we have identified that media companies such as CNN are facing a pain-point due to the inconsistent write throughput of SSDs for use in video streaming. Thus, through our I-corps discovery process we have identified these two important customer segments. To solve these two customer segments? pain-points, we decided to build a web server plug-in software that stores and serves frequently accessed static web contents (such as texts, images, videos, etc) in SSDs. Apache web server is the market leading web server solution (40% market share), therefore, we built a plug-in module for the Apache web server. We hired Gustavo Hidalgo, a GT undergrad student, to develop an initial version of the software on January - April 2015, and Pankaj Mistry, a GT Master?s level graduate student, to finish the implementation January - April 2016. We have completed implementing a prototype Apache plug-in software. Integration testing and debugging is scheduled before making it public. We are planning to make it public in 2017. Our solution reduces energy consumption of memory and storage devices by 35% attributed to the low energy consumption of the flash-based SSDs without sacrificing performance. When our solution is deployed in commercial web servers, it has the potential to have direct impact in saving energy and reducing carbon emission of data centers.
