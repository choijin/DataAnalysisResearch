<AbstractNarration>This award supports the dissertation research of an Alaska Native PhD student.   Using anthropological methods of ethnographic interviews, open-ended surveys, and archival research, the project will examine the intersection between the formal legal definitions of hunting and fishing rights among the Aleuts of Alaska and local traditional knowledge of these rights.   This research will contribute to a discussion of the relationship between knowledge and power in the context of resource management and control in Alaska. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are its contributions to the training of the CoPI, a Phd Candidate and an Alaska Native woman, thus increasing the representation of this highly underrepresented group in the social sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this award included the education of a female Indigenous scholar, and opportunities for sharing at findings the community, regional, national and international meeting levels. This dissertation contributed to the discourse about Indigenous knowledge in policy and natural resource management. It also discussed the dynamics and the workload associated with serving on boards in small Alaskan communities.   The central question of this dissertation was, "What do Aleut people know about the laws that directly affect their access to local resources?" The complex details of hunting and fishing regulations coupled with legislation that dictates access to natural resources played a key role in Aleut leadersâ€™ ability to understand, disseminate, and protect these rights. Such policies include clauses that regulate who can and cannot participate based on blood quantum, which can be problematic for future generations of Aleut people as they marry and have children with people from outside the region. Further, with the abolishment of aboriginal title to lands and hunting and fishing rights in Alaska, understanding who owns the land and resources and how they are governed is imperative to Aleut people. This dissertation used participant observation, critical case studies, key informant interviews, and a survey of Aleut leaders in the Eastern Aleutians to illustrate the ways in which Aleut people know and understand their environment and the ways they address natural resource management issues. It further demonstrated the way these issues are being addressed and learned about in two Eastern Aleutian communities.
