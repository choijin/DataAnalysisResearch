<AbstractNarration>This award supports research in establishing a design methodology for 3D printed active composites.  In these materials constituents interact such that an object made of the composite alters its shape upon an external stimulus, such as a temperature change. With a 3D printing process composites with complex internal layouts can be manufactured. The composite is printed as an initially flat sheet which takes on a 3D shape after thermo-mechanical treatment, and deforms into yet another 3D shape upon activation. 3D printed active composites open the door for new solutions to a broad class of engineering problems in healthcare, biomedical, aerospace, and automotive applications. For example, active composites would enable novel soft surgical robots whose initial shape is suited for insertion into the human body and which are then deployed into a desired shape to assist a surgical procedure. Currently there exist no tools for systematically designing these composites. This research involves several disciplines, including mathematics, mechanics, and computer science. This setting will provide a stimulating environment for students who will participate in this project and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research. Outreach activities will bring the excitement of 3D printing into K-12 classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active composite consists of glassy polymers embedded in an elastomeric matrix. The temperature dependence of the mechanical properties of glassy polymers creates a shape polymer effect. The properties of the polymer phases depend on complex processing conditions during 3D printing. The constitutive response will be described as temperature-dependent and anisotropic nonlinear viscoelastic. Experiments on the thermomechanical response will support the constitutive model development. The design methodology will integrate the nonlinear material models into a multi-material topology optimization approach. The location and shape of glassy polymer inclusions as well as parameters defining the programming loads will be optimized simultaneously. Consequently, the composite assumes a set of target shapes due to thermo-mechanical treatment and upon activation. The geometry of the material interfaces will be described by a level set method. The response of the printed composite objects will be predicted by a generalized formulation of the extended finite element method. To account for manufacturing constraints, such as limitations in printer resolution, constraints for controlling the minimum feature size in 3D material layouts will be developed. The optimization problem will be solved by a gradient-based algorithm, computing the gradients of objective and design constrains by the adjoint method. Experiments will be employed for validation of the design methodology.</AbstractNarration>

First, this project gained the knowledge of the thermomechanical and shape memory behaviors of 3D printed materials by inkjet printing technology and how these properties depend on the printing parameters. These understanding led to the development of a new material model that could predict the thermomechanical and shape memory behaviors of printed parts. Second, based on the fundamental understandings, novel structures that can undergo sequential folding or multiple shape changes were demonstrated. In this method, 3D printed materials with different glass transition temperatures were used as hinges to control the sequence and to illustrate the design principles of engineering origami structures with complicated folding patterns. Third, based on the new material model, 3D printed active composite sheet can fold into more complicated origami structures. This greatly broadened the shape-shifting capability of printed active composites. Fourth, a new 4D printing method or direct 4D printing method where a 3D printed part can shift its shape upon heating was discovered. Fundamental understanding assisted by the model developed was obtained and was used to design new 4D printing structures. Fifth, liquid crystal elastomers, which can undergo reversible contraction/expansion under temperature changes, were used together the 3D printed structures to create electrically controlled shape-shifting structures. This also led the application of a 3D printed crawling robot. Lastly, a new method of 3D printing for liquid crystal elastomer, which previously could not be fabricated by 3D printing, was developed and was used to demonstrate several shape-shifting structures. This new method greatly expanded the design space for active materials and structures.</p> <p>The fundamental understandings and the new methods developed in this project are applicable for 3D printing new smart structures that can shift their shapes upon external stimuli, such as temperature, electrical current. These shape-shifting smart structures show promising potentials for the use in aerospace deployable structures, unmanned air vehicles, and biomedical devices, as these structures can have one shape for delivery and another shape for functioning. However, broad applications of shape-shifting smart structures are limited by the lack of fabrication tools and available materials as these structures typically require complicated spatial arrangements of different materials to achieve predictable shape-shifting. The new methods developed in this project enable the design and the utilization of 3D printing technology to fabricate structures with complicated material distributions to achieve desired shapeshifting. In such, the new methods have the potential to provide new design methods and to reduce the cost of direct-fabrication or prototype shape-shifting smart structure, thus can greatly accelerate the practical applications of these structures.
