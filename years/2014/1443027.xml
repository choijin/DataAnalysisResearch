<AbstractNarration>This project focuses upon the preservation and re-use of scientific and engineering data.  A computational platform is being developed to allow researchers to organize, preserve, and share their data in more consistent and reliable ways, to facilitate broader use by the research community and society as a whole.  The team plans to create a Modular Cyber-Platform (MCP) that would be simple and reliable enough to minimize the costs associated with maintenance, yet flexible enough to facilitate use in a large number of domains or disciplines.  The modular cyber-platform would allow communities to readily publish systematically classified datasets, permit automatic long-term curation of data, and create a cyberinfrastructure for dataset dissemination, validation (crowd vetting) and collaboration.  While the products of this project would be relevant to a range of science and engineering communities, the emphasis of the project will initially be on data related to civil infrastructure (bridges, highways, buildings, pipelines, power distribution networks).</AbstractNarration>

Large amounts of data are collected or produced, and researchers interpret these data to test their hypotheses and then publish their conclusions. For decades, printed, and later digital, reports were the only means to publish advances in research. If other investigators wanted to explore new interpretations and uses of the data or gain deeper insight into the data or methods, they would have to ask authors for the original data files. But without a lasting, reliable and systematic way to preserve and share research data, most data were not reusable, became inaccessible, or disappeared altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, funding agencies recognized that all research products (data files, algorithms, photos, drawings, measurements) are as necessary and valuable to the advance of research as published results and opinions. Research funding agencies now require data-management plans, so that data produced throughout the investigation will be preserved and made accessible to research communities after the investigation is complete.&nbsp; Most disciplines do not have a solution that offers efficient means for making their large, complex, diverse data available to the public.

Research datasets are organized by experiments, with a simple common structure linking data files with 1) descriptive information called metadata (title, source, duration, location, keywords), 2) other files (classified by type such as report, media, data), and 3) key parameters (properties, measurements, observations). Researchers associate metadata, annotations, reports, media and parameters to each experiment, ensuring consistency, clarity and ease of interpretation. Tables of parameters are defined by researchers for easy discovery and search of key experiment data otherwise hidden inside files. Researchers create their datasets in three easy steps: 1) define experiments, 2) upload file collections by experiment and by type, 3) upload spreadsheets with key parameters by experiment. Our feature-rich platform makes it easy to upload large files or large file collections, helps users annotate files, and automatically classifies files and helps assign keywords to files based on their content.&nbsp; When datasets are published for search and discovery, other researchers can launch interactive viewers that classify data files by type and use &ndash; helping them navigate, browse, search, filter, map, and explore data online before downloading for their own research.

The American Concrete Institute (ACI) uses DataHub to improve the design of reinforced concrete structures. ACI committees share datasets about structural tests of reinforced columns and walls, including information about specimen dimensions, material properties, reinforcing details, and peak capacities, as well as photographs and reports.
