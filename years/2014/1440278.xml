<AbstractNarration>While it is recognized that bone health is influenced by physical activity, it remains unclear whether it is the intensity, duration, or frequency of activity that has the most positive impact on skeletal integrity. This research investigates how the skeleton of primates (such as humans) adapts to physical activity through examination of the differential impact of diverse forms of locomotor behavior on multiple measures of bone anatomy. The integrated approach requires a study population for which the requisite behavioral, biomechanical, and bone structure data are accessible; the bone samples examined therefore come from a population of seven African primate species for which locomotor behavior and activity patterns have been under study for over 15 years, providing a unique and broad spectrum of behavioral variation from which to investigate how bones respond to different activity regimens.  Through examination of these interrelationships, the research will improve understanding of the influence of physiological activity (e.g., intensity and frequency of running) on bone structure and adaptation, and thereby identify the types of activity that influence the integrity of limb bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study combines consideration of bone quantity (size) with quality (stiffness) to calculate measures of bone structural integrity. Bone quality is determined through the technique of microindentation, a method that measures small-scale variation in bone stiffness throughout bones to permit detailed understanding of bone strength, including fracture risk. In addition, how different types of locomotor activity (walking, running, jumping) and activity levels (amount of time spent per day in locomotion) influence bone adaptation is assessed through the different perspectives of kinetics (the measurement of forces on the skeleton) and remodeling (the process by which bone repairs itself). Through this comparative and multifaceted approach, this research seeks to establish what aspects of physical activity are influential in either positively or negatively affecting bone strength.    &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The overarching intellectual merit of this study is that in determining the association between bone anatomy and locomotor behavior, the kinds of activity that can positively influence bone adaptation may be identified. Such results should find application to clinical contexts for human populations in establishing more definitive links between behavior and anatomy, and through refined assessments of bone quality that can be used as an index of bone health and function. In addition, several impacts of societal importance emerge from this research activity. These include interdisciplinary training in anthropology, engineering, and the health sciences for both undergraduate and graduate US students; inclusion of underrepresented groups in engineering and anthropological research; contributions to the conservation of threatened primate populations; and improvement of educational infrastructure at the university level across three US institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary aim of this project was to obtain detailed information on the ways primates of Ivory Coast?s Tai National Park move in their rainforest habitat.  The Tai forest is home to a diversity of primates, including a number of which are endangered, and members of our research team have been studying multiple aspects of their behavioral ecology since the early 1990s. The present proposal was designed to explore aspects of their behavior and combined them investigations of their skeletal (bony) morphology. Because our study species live sympatrically, it is possible to make direct comparisons of the ways different sized primates with varying locomotor abilities, navigate a single habitat.  We collected behavioral data on frequencies of movement patterns, the forest levels at which different behaviors occur, and the support types (e.g., trunks, branches, boughs, twigs, vines, etc.) each species prefers during activities such as travel, foraging, predator escape, etc.   These quantitative data were complemented by video recordings taken of less frequent, but equally important behaviors.  The long-term data we collected at our field site in Tai National Park provides for a deeper understanding of how our closest relatives negotiate their rainforest habitat while they acquire food, escape predators, find mates, etc.  Because many of our study species are endangered by hunting and habitat loss, our project has direct conservation benefits and our continued presence in the forest serves as a powerful deterrent to poaching.   This project is part of a larger, collaborative proposal whose goal it is to use combine the behavioral data collected in the field with detailed examination of skeletal morphology.  Over the course of three decades working in Tai, we have collected multiple skeletons from naturally deceased animals.  Because the source populations of the behavioral and morphological data are the same, we have a superb opportunity to map precisely how locomotor behavior is related to skeletal morphology.  We will continue to use both data sets to better explore how natural selection shapes the behavior and bones of our closest relatives. The results of our project inform multiple disciplines including human evolution, bone biology, primate behavior, behavioral ecology, rainforest conservation, and others.
