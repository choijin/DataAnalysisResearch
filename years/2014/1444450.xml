<AbstractNarration>This award will fund a CBMS Conference entitled "The Basic Homotopy Lemma, The Asymptotic Uniqueness Theorem, and Classification of C*-Algebras" with principal lecturer Huaxin Lin to be held at the University of Wyoming during June of 2015.  The study of operator algebras is one of the major branches of modern mathematics. It was launched by John von Neumann in 1930's with an aim of explicating quantum mechanics. The classification of at least the more well-behaved amenable C*-algebras is considered as one of the main questions at the moment in operator algebra theory. Recently this subject has been developing very rapidly, and substantial progress has been made. The main goal of this conference is to have a detailed and systematic account of this breakthrough in the classification of C*-algebras, with an emphasis on basic homotopy lemmas and asymptotic uniqueness theorems.   The conference will pull together these recent results, to get a clear picture of the current status, and to chart the possible direction of future research.  This grant will support the participation of graduate students and junior faculty members in the conference, and also foster the production of a monograph which will be used by the wider community.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The topic of the project is on the classification of C*-algebras, the basic homotopy lemmas, and the asymptotic uniqueness theorems. After the discovery of various exotic examples of AH-algebras, the program of the classification of amenable C*-algebras has been focused on the more well-behaved C*-algebras, or the class of C*-algebras which absorb the Jiang-Su algebra Z.  With the one-parameter deformation technique introduced by Winter, the classification of Z-stable C*-algebras can be reduced to the construction of a certain homotopy between two homomorphisms of the rationalized C*-algebras. The existence of such a homotopy is ensured by Lin's very recent asymptotic uniqueness theorems and basic homotopy lemmas, which have already had an impact outside classification theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ C*-algebras are algebras of Hilbert space operators, closed under the adjoint operation and the operator norm topology. Among them, thealgebras closed under the strong operator topology are called von Neumann algebras. The study of operator algebras can be said to have begun by John von Neumann in the 1930Ã†s, with the aim of understanding quantum mechanics.  Since 1990, the classification of C*-algebras has become one of the central areas in the study of C*-algebras. Using the Elliott invariant, which consists of the ordered K-group and the pairing with the trace simplex, classification theorems have been obtained for several large classes of C*-algebras.  Substantial progress has been made in the classification of C*-algebras in the last few years, and the classification theorem has recently been pushed to cover the class of all well behaved C*-algebras.

Two additional notable outcomes of this conference have been the final classification result on the C*-algebras with finite decomposition rank by Elliott, Gong, Lin and one of the organizers (ZN) and invitation of the other organizer (FJ) to visit two colleagues to work on closely related topics.
