<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports the acquisition of a laser system at Smith College, an undergraduate women's liberal arts college.  This system will enable two main developments, the first of which is the next generation of a technique called "Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA)" which is expected to significantly improve the ability of the U.S. to monitor activity at known and suspected nuclear reprocessing sites, as well as to analyze ice core samples for climate history studies.  The second development involves the measurement of several energy levels of neutral beryllium to high precision, which improves our understanding of atomic theory and helps to advance basic science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To perform trace analysis with krypton (in support of the first development described in the paragraph above), krypton atoms first need to be transferred to a metastable state for laser cooling and trapping.  The precision of most Atom Trap Trace Analysis measurements is currently limited by the methods used to produce the metastable atomic beams.  Replacing these methods with the optical source funded here will lead to significant advances such as an increase in detection efficiency, a decrease in sample size, and elimination of cross-sample contamination.  The beryllium project (the second development described in the paragraph above) aims to improve experimental measurements on several energy levels and the ionization threshold.  Currently, theoretical estimates of the energy levels have more than an order of magnitude more precision than experimental measurements.  These improved experimental results will delineate various theoretical models, test quantum electrodynamics, and help determine the nuclear charge radius of beryllium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A fundamental goal of atomic physics is to understand the complex interactions between particles that make up an atom.  The current best model for understanding how all of the components interact to give an atom its properties is known as the standard model of particle physics, which is mathematically described by quantum field theory.  This model is extremely successful, yet incomplete.  For example, the theory does not know how to think about gravity, does not include astronomical phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy, and does not explain why there is so little observable anti-matter in the universe compared to regular matter.  As such, many atomic physicists test the model in a variety of ways and systems to test its validity.  The Williams? research lab at Smith College is testing a subset of quantum field theory known as quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the neutral beryllium atom, the fourth atom on the periodic table.  Before this effort, QED had been successfully tested in the three lighter elements: hydrogen, helium, and lithium.  In 2013, Puchalski et al. (Phys. Rev. A 87, 030502(R) (2013)) used QED to calculate one of the energy levels in neutral beryllium, known as the 2s2p 1P1 state, and the energy required to remove an electron from the atom, known as the ionization threshold.  Their results were more than a factor of 10 more precise compared to the best experimental measurement, which were done in 1962.  The goal of our lab, through the support of this grant, was to measure a variety of energy levels of the beryllium atom to 1) test if our measurements match the calculations of the theorists, which would validate the current model theorists use (QED), 2) provide theorists with a benchmark to further improve the precision of their calculations, and 3) provide theorists with additional measurements to provide information for calculating properties that are computationally more difficult.    One experimental difficulty in measuring the energy of the 2s2p 1P1 state is that the laser light needed to perform the measurement is in the ultraviolet region at 235 nm.  Additionally, studying higher energy levels require 235 nm light plus an additional one or two lasers.  235 nm is a difficult wavelength for lasers to operate at, and one that cannot yet be provided by a laser diode. This NSF grant funded the acquisition of a frequency quadrupled titanium-sapphire laser to produce this light.  It also partially funded a frequency comb, a measurement device that measures the frequency of the laser to high precision.  The addition of this equipment to the Williams? lab allowed the testing of QED by measuring the absolute energy level of the 2s2p 1P1 state as well as other energy levels.  The experimental results were in agreement with the theoretical prediction confirming that 1) theorists successfully calculated this energy level in this complex system, and 2) QED did indeed accurately predict the energy of the 2s2p 1P1 state to 7 digits precision, the accuracy of the calculation.  This experimental result was 130 times more precise than the previous experimental measurement and a factor of 8 more precise than the theoretical calculation.   This result also motivated our lab to redo the measurement inside a large magnetic field to further improve the precision.  This effort is currently in preparation for publication.  At the conclusion of this grant, we have published 3 papers with 3 more papers in preparation for publication, a total of 6 papers that will acknowledge support from this grant.  The paper that tested QED was published in the prestigious journal Physical Review Letters (Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 053001 (2018)).   In addition, we have measured the energy of the 2s3d 1D2 state (in preparation for publication) and improved the known energy of two states in neutral cesium-133 (Laser Physics Letters 15, 095702 (2018)) by over a factor of 500 compared to the previous best measurement.  The research is performed at Smith College, an all undergraduate women?s college regularly ranked by U.S. News &amp; World Report as one of its top 20 liberal arts colleges and is the nation?s largest liberal arts college for women.  Over the course of this grant, over 30 young scientists gained experience working in a state-of-the-art experimental atomic physics laboratory, including six students who worked on senior thesis projects related to this project. In addition, the principal investigator gave a number of seminars, including general outreach talks, to promote both atomic physics and research done at Smith College.  All seminars and outreach talks acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Foundation.  This work is also supported under the National Science Foundation?s CAREER award: PHY-1555232.       Last Modified: 10/30/2019       Submitted by: William Williams]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
