<AbstractNarration>Representation theory, originating in the work of mathematicians such as Issai Schur and Ferdinand Frobenius at the end of the 19th century, studies how the structure of algebraic objects (such as finite groups or Lie algebras) can be captured by simpler, linear objects, in particular, matrices.  A theme common to all of the goals of this project is the use of representation theory to study geometric spaces.  Three dimensional topological quantum field theories, quantum link invariants, and vertex operators were all developed in the 1980s and 1990s using various algebraic inputs. One main objective of this project is to lift these constructions to higher dimensions through the use of algebraic structures from representation theory.  This objective is part of a program known as categorification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program of categorification was introduced by Louis Crane and Igor Frenkel.  Generally speaking, the aim is that vector spaces should be replaced by categories and actions on vector spaces should be replaced by actions of functors on categories.  The categories involved in this project are of a representation theoretic or combinatorial nature.  New category-theoretic ideas need to be developed in order to achieve the most ambitious goals of the categorification program.  Another part of this project is the application of representation-theoretic techniques to the classification problem of certain algebraic varieties equipped with a group action.  The four areas of this project are the following:  (1) categorification of the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant, (2) categorification of the Turaev-Viro invariant, (3) categorification of Lie superalgebras, and (4) understanding the multiplicative structure of the coordinate rings of affine spherical varieties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A central aim of the categorification program is to transform existing invariants of topological spaces into invariants of higher dimensional spaces.  These classical invariants often come from some algebraic structures such as representation theory of quantum groups.  One categorifies these algebraic structures by finding richer ones which have shadows of the classical structures.  Sussan made progress in several directions of the categorification program.  In a joint work he constructed a categorification of certain twisted Heisenberg algebras.  Sussan and his collaborators made other advances in this area.  Due to support from the NSF, Sussan was able to visit USC and collaborate on two projects about the trace decategorification of certain Heisenberg categories. These traces were identified with other interesting structures well known in representation theory.  NSF support also led to advances in categorical braid group actions and categorification of super algebras.  Progress was also made towards categorifying representation theory at roots of unity.  One paper in this direction began during a collaboration at a conference in Portugal.    Sussan was able to explain his work at various conferences partially using NSF funding.  This included travel to France, Belgium, Germany as well as travel within the United States to Iowa, California, and Connecticut where a lot of progress on categorification at roots of unity was made with a collaborator at Yale University.  Van Steirteghem?s part of  the project was dedicated to further developing and applying the combinatorial theory of spherical varieties. This class of algebraic varieties equipped with a group action plays an important role in symplectic geometry and in harmonic analysis. Together with collaborators, Van Steirteghem described moduli spaces of affine spherical varieties. With G. Pezzini, he also gave an algorithmic description of the main combinatorial invariant of smooth affine spherical varieties, and applied it to problems in symplectic geometry. As part of his 2016 thesis, Van Steirteghem's PhD student W. Kim implemented the algorithm (in a special case), allowing for computational experiments in algebraic and symplectic geometry.  Thanks to NSF support, Van Steirteghem visited collaborators in Germany, Greece, Italy and Boston. He presented his work at various conferences and seminars, both in the US and abroad, partially using NSF funding.  Sussan and Van Steirteghem invited mathematicians from around the world to speak in the CUNY Representation Theory Seminar and the Medgar Evers College Mathematics Colloquium.  The Colloquium is aimed at faculty but also provides students at Medgar Evers College the chance to learn and interact with mathematicians from other universities.
