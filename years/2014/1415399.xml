<AbstractNarration>The project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. Sustainability science is an emerging field that addresses the challenges of meeting human needs without harm to the environment, and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. A strong scientific workforce requires individuals educated and trained in interdisciplinary research and thinking, especially in the area of sustainability science. With the SEES Fellowship support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish herself in an independent research career related to sustainability.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the need of incorporating climate trends and projections to ensure the sustainability of long-term planning in the infrastructure sector. For infrastructure in particular (e.g., roads, bridges, culverts, and storm drainage systems), future change may shift many of these risks beyond historical and even current design standards. Modifying existing infrastructure and ensuring new construction will be adapted to future change is a central and critical concern surrounding the issues of infrastructure resiliency and sustainable infrastructure design. The proposed work will combine state-of-the-art models and tools in climate change research with engineering know-how to help design stronger and longer-lasting infrastructure for the future. Advances in both high-resolution climate modeling and implementation of climate projections in infrastructure engineering will enhance collaboration efforts within the ICNet RCN and significantly contribute towards the science of sustainable engineering under changing environmental conditions. This proposal aims to reduce the knowledge gap between climate scientists and engineers and to address specific challenges that climate change poses to infrastructure engineering. It will explore the ways in which climate information can be used to inform design standards to build better bridges and roads that will last longer in the future and require less money and energy to maintain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF-SEES Project Outcomes Report  Sustainable Infrastructure in a Changing Climate: Dismantling the Knowledge Barrier between Infrastructure Engineering and Climate Science     Since preindustrial times the average temperature of the Earth has warmed by 1?C, resulting in impacts already observed across the globe due to increases in the average temperature, prolonged heatwaves and drought, as well as changes in precipitation patterns and more frequent and extreme precipitation events. Climate models project that these trends are expected to continue and most regions in the U.S. should anticipate even further and more severe impacts due to climate change in the coming decades.   Transportation infrastructure, built to last many decades, is a vital component of the everyday lives of people. Infrastructure design depends on the climate for which it is being built in order to withstand potential extreme weather events that could affect the durability of the asset. Disruptions caused by premature failing or repairs of infrastructure built without consideration for changes in future climate will impact personal travel as well as transportation of good and services.  Many infrastructure engineers are interested in incorporating climate projections into their design process but are uncertain of how to do so. Climate scientists, on the other hand, work on generating high-resolution climate projection datasets, but not with infrastructure engineering particularly in mind.

Another outcome is the forthcoming release of a high-resolution projected dataset for tens of thousands of stations across North America as well as grids covering the entire contiguous U.S. and lower Canada for temperature and precipitation using more than 20 climate models, which is expected to be available for download in early 2020 free of charge.
