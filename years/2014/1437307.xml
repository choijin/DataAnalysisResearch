<AbstractNarration>PI: Baalousha, Mohammed&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1437307  &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of South Carolina at Columbia  &lt;br/&gt;Title: Evaluation of the Role of Size Dispersity on Nanoparticle Uptake and Ecotoxicity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of nanoparticle (NP) toxicity to the environment often come up with contradictory results. For example, nanoparticles (NPs) have demonstrable negative impact on aquatic organisms, but divergent results have been reported on the role of NP size on their toxicity. The PI and Co-PIs hypothesize that such contradictory evidence is most likely due to the heterogeneity and polydispersity of the NPs themselves. They hypothesize that polydispersity can cause incorrect measurement of NP properties and lead to an underestimation of NP dose, particularly if the toxic effects are only due to a sub-fraction of the polydisperse suspensions. The proposal will specifically investigate the effect of NP dispersity on their properties and on their toxicities, investigating such NP properties as size, dispersity, morphology, and facet exposure, and their effect in nanotoxicity. The results of this project will help improve the design of NPs by identifying features that can induce deleterious effects, and also help Understand the fate, behavior, uptake, and toxicity of NPs. Progress in this area will aid a sustainable development of nanotechnology and its benefits. Under this proposal's plan, the PIs will work directly with K-12 institutions and underrepresented minorities (URMs) in South Carolina and produce distance-learning materials for wider outreach. The PIs have a strong track record of ensuring inclusion of under-represented groups in training and outreach activities and will recruit for the PhD candidate with outreach principles in mind. The University of South Carolina has one of the highest numbers of African American students for a Carnegie One research intensive university (13%).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve their goals, the PIs must first rigorously characterize the NPs they synthesize and then correlate the various properties of the NPs with their observed toxicities. To that end, the PIs will seek to establish a reproducible protocol for the synthesis of poly- and mono-dispersed NPs and their separation into a set of monodisperse subfractions. They will then characterize the NPs (e.g., size, dispersity, morphology, facets) using a multi-method approach and quantify the uptake and toxicity of polydisperse versus monodisperse subfractions of NPs using the standardized polyhaline estuarine copepod model, Amphiascus tenuiremis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this approach, the PI and Co-PIs seek to provide a methodology that can be widely used by the scientific community for similar and other studies, as well as in other fields such as drug delivery, where NP size dispersity has been realized as an issue of confounding results in the literature.</AbstractNarration>

Synthesis and Characterization of Platinum Nanoparticles  Five monodispersed citrate- and polyvinylpyrrolidone- coated platinum nanoparticles of different sizes (8, 10, 20, 40, and 70 nm) were synthesized and characterized using a multimethod approach including dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy , atomic force microscopy, field flow fractionation, and single particle-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy.  Fate and Behavior of Platinum Nanoparticles  The size-dependent aggregation of platinum nanoparticle was investigated in monovalent and divalent electrolytes (e.g., NaNO3 and Ca(NO3)2). At the same nanoparticle mass concentration, aggregate size decreases with the increase in nanoparticle size , which can be attributed to the decreased particle number concentration and thus the decreased collision frequency between the nanoparticles with the increased particle size.   Many studies investigated the aggregation of nanoparticles at high concentrations and using bulk analytical techniques such as dynamic light scattering. In this work, we investigated the concentration-dependent aggregation of platinum nanoparticles in moderately hard water (MHW) and in synthetic seawater (SW) using single particle-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer.

Uptake of Platinum Nanoparticles estuarine amphipod, Leptocheirus plumulosus  Nanoparticle size dispersity play an important role in determining their environmental behaviors and biological effects. When estuarine amphipods, Leptocheirus plumulosus, were exposed to monodispersed platinum nanoparticles of different sizes individually, the influx and influx rate of platinum nanoparticles in Leptocheirus plumulosus increased with the decrease in platinum nanoparticle size and the elimination rate increased with the increase in nanoparticle size.

Uptake of Platinum Nanoparticles in the freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis  In the freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, the platinum influx and efflux rates increase with the increase in the nanoparticle size. The retained platinum nanoparticle concentration at the end of the elimination experiment is higher for larger nanoparticles, which might be attributed to the different uptake mechanisms of small and larger nanoparticles.

Synthesis, Characterization, Fate and Toxicity of Silver Nanoparticles  Using silver nanoparticles, we developed an easy and a rapid approach for measuring the size and dissolution of sterically stabilized silver nanoparticle in synthetic seawater by monitoring their optical properties (extinction spectra) using UV-vis spectroscopy.  In this proposal, we investigated the fate, uptake and toxicity of nanoparticles at environmentally relevant concentrations. We found that in seawater, silver nanoparticles dissolve faster and to a higher extent with the decrease in nanoparticles concentration toward environmentally relevant concentrations, indicating that all silver is likely to occur as dissolved silver in the marine environment. We also investigate the life-cycle chronic toxicity of sub-lethal exposures of polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silver nanoparticles (PVP-AgNPs) relative to dissolved Ag (AgNO3) for the estuarine meiobenthic copepod, Amphiascus tenuiremis, over a range of environmentally relevant concentrations; that is 20, 30, 45, and 75 ug-Ag.L-1. A concentration-dependent increase in mortality of larval nauplii and juvenile copepodites was observed. In both treatment types, significantly higher mortality was observed at 45 and 75 ug-Ag.L-1 than in controls. In AgNO3 exposures, fecundity declined sharply (1.8 to 7 fold) from 30 to 75 ug-Ag.L-1.
