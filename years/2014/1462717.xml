<AbstractNarration>Wear is generically defined as the loss or displacement of material during sliding contact, and is an engineering topic of great practical importance.  Material loss during service can result in reduced component performance or even catastrophic failure of a device.  Nanostructured metals, where internal structural features have dimensions in the nanometer range, are promising materials for wear-resistant coatings and engineering components because of their extremely high hardness and strength.  However, the unique nanostructure that imparts excellent strength also accumulates wear damage in unique ways.  This award supports a systematic investigation of wear loss and damage in such nanostructured metallic materials.  The research combines mechanical engineering with materials science and physics, while also utilizing a combination of cutting-edge experimental and computational techniques.  Of specific interest is the identification of the effect of operating conditions on the accumulation of wear damage.  Therefore, this project will benefit the U.S. economy by allowing for the design of better wear-resistant materials that extend product lifetime and limit wear failures.  In addition, educational and research opportunities will be created for students from diverse backgrounds, broadening participation in scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an innovative study to reveal the mechanisms of structural evolution and damage during wear of nanocrystalline metals, and to understand how these changes affect subsequent mechanical response.  Molecular dynamics simulations will first be used to explore how abrasive sliding drives grain boundary migration, grain growth, and grain boundary relaxation.  Of specific interest will be the connection between continuum predictions of stress fields, local atomic stress distributions, and structural evolution. The effects of alloy chemistry and grain boundary energy will also be probed.  These simulations will be used to guide wear experiments and inform site-specific structural characterization, in order to study the evolution of near-surface microstructure as a function of grain size, wear cycle, applied load, and sliding speed.  This data will be used to create "structural evolution maps," to improve the field's understanding of how nanocrystalline materials respond to complex deformation conditions and help in the future design of damage-resistant nanostructured materials.  The study will also quantify how the mechanical properties of the near-surface material evolve with wear damage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Concerning Intellectual Merit, this project discovered that the wear rate (how fast material is removed from a contact surface) of a nanocrystalline film is directly tied to the grain structure near the surface.  Specifically, we observed three types of damage regimes that differed by roughly an order of magnitude in their wear rate.  The lowest wear rate, which is desirable for engineering applications, occurs when the surface has developed a distinct layer of evolved grains.  The average grain size in this layer is the same if growing from a very small grain size or refining from a very coarse grain size, identifying an interesting transition in the atomic scale mechanisms for damage.  Atomistic computer models were used to supplement these experiments, adding a more nuanced description of the wear damage process.     For Broader Impacts, a comprehensive education and outreach program was developed that improve the participation of underrepresented minority students in high school and college.  High school students were reached through both individual research experiences where the PI acted as a direct mentor, but also through large scale educational workshops designed to increase interesting in materials science and nanoscale engineering.  Undergraduate students were assigned self-contained projects to give them research experience in order to prepare them for advanced study and applied engineering careers.  Finally, wear damage is extremely important for industry, meaning the findings of this study will enable large cost savings in the commercial sector.
