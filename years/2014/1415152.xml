<AbstractNarration>This project supports the participation of USA-based early career scientists and Ph.D. students at the Householder Symposium XIX on Numerical Linear Algebra, a mathematical discipline that is the basis for many computational methods in science and engineering.  The Symposium will take place on 8-13 June 2014, in Spa, Belgium.  It is the nineteenth in a series, previously called the Gatlinburg Symposia, and named after the founder Alston S. Householder, one of the pioneers in numerical linear algebra.  The Symposium is very informal, with the intermingling of early-career and established researchers a priority. Attendance is by invitation only, and each attendee is given the opportunity to present a talk or poster.  The fifteenth Householder Award for the best Ph.D. thesis in numerical linear algebra since 1 January 2011 will be awarded.  The project will ensure the attendance of well qualified Ph.D. students at US institutions, as well as early-career scientists who received their Ph.D. degree after 1 January 2011 and are currently working in the US.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium places an emphasis on broad relevance, and includes presentations on the following topics: Krylov space methods for linear systems and eigenvalue problems, computation of matrix functions, nonlinear eigenvalue problems, tensor algorithms and analysis, domain decomposition and multilevel methods, algorithms for structured matrices, randomized algorithms; as well as applications to: Optimization, differential equations, signal and image processing, control theory, electronic structure calculations, data analysis, information retrieval, and engineering.  The support of this project ensures the attendance of well qualified applied mathematics Ph.D. students from US institutions, as well as early US career scientists who received their Ph.D.'s after January 1, 2011.  Support of this group will have a positive impact on the continued strong competitiveness of the US in this crucial discipline, with its connections to a large number of scientific computing topics. Individual benefits for early career researchers who have attended a Householder Symposium include: Career advice from established researchers, enhanced visibility in the community, ideas for REU programs, and several NSF funded research projects that arose directly from collaborations established or advice received at the Householder Symposium.  Funding for participants takes into consideration participant diversity at the Symposium. More information can be found in http://sites.uclouvain.be/HHXIX/</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: The award helped to support the professional development of students and early-career researchers; to advance their access to and understanding of cutting-edge research in numerical linear algebra; and to deepen and expand their research expertise in the foundations, software development, and applications of Numerical Linear Algebra.   Broader Impacts: The award gave students and early-career researchers the opportunity to present their own work to the international Numerical Linear Algebra research community. It also broadened their understanding of the importance of Numerical Linear  Algebra as the computational basis for a myriad of other disciplines: Networks, Optimization, Data Science, Astronomy, Systems and Control Theory,  Partial Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and Mechanical Engineering, just to name a few.  Both conferences make a point to establish a welcoming and nurturing environment for students and early-career researchers.  They actively promote the interaction between junior and senior researchers during breaks and social events; and they provide a balanced mix of junior and more senior speakers in the plenary talks, the parallel sessions, and the poster presentations. In spite of a very packed schedule, poster sessions in both conferences are always very well attended and lively events.       Last Modified: 05/24/2016       Submitted by: Ilse C.F.
