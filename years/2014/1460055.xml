<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at the University of California - Los Angeles. The focus of the REU program is to convey to the student participants the full range of activities involved in the research process. The core of the program's activities consists of a 10-week research project under the supervision of a UCLA faculty member. The full gamut includes carefully defining the project in a realistic way, actually carrying out the planned research activities (a mix of data acquisition, data analysis, theoretical exploration, and final interpretations), and finally the written and oral presentation of the final results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects available to undergraduate student span the various fields represented in the department, such as plasma physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, accelerator physics, cosmic ray physics, high-energy physics, astrophysics, and biophysics. All students are required to submit a paper written in a professional format and must give a 20-minute oral and graphical presentation at the end-of-program symposium. These research experiences are supplemented by other auxiliary training such as a machine shop workshop, a physics GRE prep course, a weekly faculty seminar series, an ethics workshop, and a how-to-apply-to-graduate-school seminar.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UCLA Physics Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program provided a 10-week immersion in fundamental physics research for a total of 42 students from throughout the USA.  The students were chosen competitively based on their academic potential with an emphasis on having a broad and diverse cross-section among the participants in terms of ethnic background, age, gender, and the type of school from which they came.     The short-term outcomes for the REU participants are the amount of learning they all do; the considerable insight they gain into what it means to do research (i.e., the meaning of data and its role in testing and formulation hypotheses, practical problem solving, the importance of questioning one?s assumptions); the discovery of the excitement and personal fulfillment of doing research which likely goes a long way towards cementing the students? resolve to commit to becoming scientists; the conviction and confidence they take away from it that they can actually do research; and finally they learn important lab skills which strengthen their preparation and marketability for graduate school or even industry.     A few important factors influencing the students to want to pursue graduate studies or stay in the STEM is their interaction with graduate students in the labs.  Graduate students talk to the REU students about their own experience, give them tips and demystify the whole process for them.  Another is the strong appeal of a community of like-minded people all working for the same goal.  For the first time, students become an integral part of the scientific community and this has a strong impact on them.  Another consequence is an increased interest in the discipline.  Many students talk of how much they like the science and how interesting they find it.     A number of projects resulted in presentations at professional meetings or in research publications.  Thus, the program led to outcomes having substantial intellectual merit.  The greatest strength of the program, however, is in its broader impact.  Almost all of the participating students left the program more "turned on" to science and research than they were originally.  The long-term outcomes can best be measured by examining the trajectories of the REU students once the program is over.  In fact, of the 42 participants in the current cycle, 35 have gone or are going to graduate schools in Physics or Astrophysics, 4 are still undergraduate students in physics, and 3 are working as engineers.  Consequently, although the students were originally chosen to be those who had a strong interest and a good potential for pursuing physics, the REU clearly kept that going, and likely strengthened the students? commitment.
