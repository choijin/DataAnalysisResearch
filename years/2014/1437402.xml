<AbstractNarration>Particle Physics is the science of discovery of the fundamental constituents of matter and energy and is involved in the exploration of the Universe from the smallest to the largest scales.  A remarkable achievement of Twentieth Century Particle Physics was the development of the Standard Model that describes impressively well a broad spectrum of fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons and the interactions (the forces) among them.  But the Standard Model is incomplete and we know there is important physics that lies beyond it.  What is the evidence?  As an example, astronomical observations indicate that the known particles of the Standard Model make up only 1/6 of the total matter in the Universe.  The remainder is called "Dark Matter" because we don't see it directly.  A number of experiments are underway or in the planning stage to look for the Dark Matter, which might be one type of particle or possibly many or perhaps something else entirely.  This MRI award will allow the excellent training of young physicists from the institutions in the DarkLight consortium in accelerator science, detector and target development and utilization, measurement and analysis, and search for new evidence of new physics beyond the Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award is made to a consortium of MIT, Hampton University, Arizona State University and Temple University to develop, build and operate a first phase of the DarkLight experiment at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory.  This program addresses two of the science drivers of the recently released Report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (called P5): Dark Matter and the Search for New Particles and Interactions.  The DarkLight experiment will utilize the 1 Megawatt electron beam of the existing energy-recovering linac (ERL) at Jefferson Lab, incident at 100 MeV on a windowless hydrogen gas target, to search for evidence of electron and positron pairs which could be decay products of a massive Dark Photon called the A´ in the mass region 10 to 90 MeV. Such an A´ couples leptons (such as electrons and positrons) to dark matter, as suggested by astrophysical observations, and may explain a possible discrepancy with the Standard Model in the observed value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (the so called "g-2 anomaly").  DarkLight has the unique feature of searching for the A´ in exclusive reactions.  The phase-I realization of the DarkLight instrument will have three scientific goals: to carry out important accelerator science studies involving the interaction of the energy-recovering linac beam with the DarkLight gas target and solenoid; to carefully measure Standard Model background processes; and to carry out a first search for the A´ via detection of e+e- pairs in the mass region 30 to 70 MeV/c2 using this new experimental technique.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The DarkLight Experiment  NSF Project Outcomes Report     The DarkLight experiment received full scientific approval with an "A" rating in May 2014.   In summer 2014, the MIT, ASU, Temple U, and Hampton U consortium received funding via the NSF MRI award to carry out a phase-1 experiment at the Jefferson Laboratory Low Energy Recirculator Facility (LERF).     In the years 2014-2016, a phase-1 windowless, hydrogen gas target and magnetic spectrometer were designed and constructed.  The experiment was installed at the LERF in summer 2016 and initial commissioning took place with LERF beam.  While some technical issues requiring amelioration were identified, no major surprises were encountered.  Further, apparatus has been designed and constructed to carry out a measurement of the main physics background.  The apparatus is being calibrated at MIT at present using low energy beam.     The prototype silicon detectors have been developed at ASU and Temple U.  The charged particle tracker has been developed at Hampton U and should be ready by summer 2019.  The scientific case for the DarkLight experiment has strengthened in the last year with the realization that the couplings of a new field could vary by quark flavor.  Thus, a general fifth force can produce events in the e+e- spectrum generated in elastic electron-proton scattering at low energy.  Further, anomalous events have been reported at a mass of about 17 MeV in a nuclear decay by a Hungarian group.  DarkLight can search for these events with unprecedented sensitivity.  Design of an optimized experiment is in progress.     b. Technical papers on the gas target, detector apparatus and measurements hav ebeen submitted and are in the review process at present.     c. The MIT measurements of Moller scattering at 2.5 MeV have been completed.  A scientific paper on the results has been completed. This work formed the Ph.D. thesis of MIT graduate student Charles Epstein, who graduated in 2018.           Last Modified: 03/28/2019       Submitted by: Richard G Milner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
