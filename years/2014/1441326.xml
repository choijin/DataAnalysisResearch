<AbstractNarration>The goal of this program is to determine the relationship between supermassive black hole growth in the centers of galaxies, and the general evolution of the galaxies in which they reside.   The work will comprise a multi-disciplinary approach to this topic involving a cohesive analysis of observational data and galaxy simulations to provide the first significant constraints on the mechanisms driving black hole growth in the local universe. High spatial resolution integral field spectroscopic observations of a matched sample of Seyfert and inactive galaxies will be obtained on the world's leading near-infrared telescopes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. A number of properties will be examined down to parsec scales in the two subsamples to identify those that are unique to Seyfert galaxies and are thus likely to be associated with black hole growth. These include the distribution, kinematics, and mass of the interstellar medium, the presence of a nuclear stellar disk, and how this stellar population relates to the nuclear interstellar medium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include teacher training and participation in the University of Washington Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP). This program recruits incoming students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science and promotes astronomy as an undergraduate major by allowing them to explore the field in an enriching and supportive environment.</AbstractNarration>

This revelation has been driven by the discovery that most, if not all, galaxies harbor a BH, and that the mass of the BH is related to the global properties of the host galaxy, likely as a consequence of the co-evolution of galaxies and their BHs.

Despite the significant BH growth occurring in these galaxies, there is no observed correlation of this activity with large-scale phenomena; this indicates that the triggering mechanism of this mode of accretion, and thus its role in galaxy evolution, is hidden on smaller scales.  In this program the first comparative study of the two-dimensional molecular gas kinematics, as well as stellar kinematics, in a matched sample of Seyfert and inactive galaxies was conducted at unprecedented detail.  This program for the first time showed that there are several differences at small radii that are correlated with active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity.  Compared to the inactive galaxies, the Seyfert galaxies have (1) a more centrally concentrated nuclear stellar component, (2) nuclear stars in a more disk-like component, (3) a greater amount of molecular gas in the nuclear region, and (4) more centrally concentrated nuclear molecular gas.  These observed differences can be interpreted as evidence for Seyfert galaxies having a disk-like nuclear structure composed of a significant gas reservoir and a relatively young stellar population. This structure is undetected (and possibly does not exist) in quiescent galaxies. The presence of such a nuclear structure in Seyfert galaxies provides evidence for inflow of the surrounding interstellar medium since the nuclear stellar population requires a supply of gas from which to form. The fueling of a Seyfert AGN is thus associated with the formation of a disk-like component of gas and stars.

These exhibit chaotic central dust morphologies and have molecular structures that are counter-rotating with respect to the main gas component, which will likely lead to gas inflow in the near future.  The success of this program in demonstrating the feasibility of tracing gas motions within the central regions of AGN has prompted two follow-up surveys, each with a significantly increased sample of 40 galaxies to support now reaching statistically significant conclusions.  These surveys will include strengthening the results from this program, including investigating potential trends in primary fueling mechanism of the AGN and the local environment of the host galaxy. This project also supported two educational activities that aimed to excite a diverse population of undergraduate students ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
