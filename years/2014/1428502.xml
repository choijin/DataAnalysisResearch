<AbstractNarration>This mixed methods research is developing a clearer understanding of transfer student pathways as a means to increase engineering degree production and broaden participation in engineering careers, especially for Hispanic students. The study sites are 4 of the top 10 producers of U.S. Hispanic engineers: The University of Texas at El Paso, Texas A&amp;M University, The University of Texas at Austin, and The University of Texas-Pan American. The investigators are surveying 5,200 students in 7 cohorts who transferred to 4-year institutions. Staff at the 4 institutions are matching survey responses to GPAs and engineering degree attainment so that statistical models can link educational experiences to outcomes.  The team is also interviewing a sample of 40 engineering transfer students (50% Hispanic) about their transfer experiences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hispanics continue to be an untapped pool of prospective STEM talent in United States.  Since 2005, Hispanics have exceeded more than 20 percent of students enrolled in the K-12 education system, yet they earned only 10 percent of the engineering degrees awarded in 2007. The state of Texas has uniquely seen rapid economic (GDP) and population growth in the past few years, coupled with a high minority population, making it an important setting for studying transfer student pathways and ultimately broadening participation in engineering. By partnering with the top 4 producers of Hispanic engineers in Texas and 4 of their feeder community colleges (Austin Community College, Blinn College, El Paso Community College, and South Texas College), this project has the potential to dramatically increase the numbers of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic students earning engineering degrees through transfer mechanisms. Project advisory board members have strong professional networks for disseminating the findings to policymakers and educational practitioners who can put the findings into action.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project worked toward increasing understanding of engineering transfer students and their experiences at both sending and receiving institutions.  We developed the Engineering Transfer Student Survey and collected cross-sectional survey data from a sample of 1,070 engineering transfer students who transferred to one of four 4-year Texas institutions as new engineering students between 2007 and 2014.  Additionally, we worked with partner institutions to link survey responses to institutional records, so we can explore relationships between students? experiences and their degree progression and attainment.  We also conducted 18 semi-structured focus groups with 84 students, administrators, faculty, and staff who represented those four 4-year institutions as well as their partner community colleges, which allowed us to understand the transfer process more comprehensively.  To our knowledge, this project enabled the creation of the most comprehensive data set of Hispanic/Latino engineering transfer students ever assembled.     This study extended transfer student capital and other social capital theories to understand engineering transfer students, and Hispanic/Latino engineering transfer students in particular. The sample also allowed us to explore differences between vertical and lateral transfer students as well as differences across first generation college student status.  Some of our key findings follow:  We provide evidence illustrating the importance of disaggregating data.  Future research on engineering transfer students should seek to account for such differences, at a minimum, as opposed to considering ?transfer students? as a single block of students who share similar experiences.  All elements of the transfer student capital framework do not apply to subpopulations of transfer students in the same way.  Improved coordination across 2-year and 4-year institutions could address multiple areas in which students requested more support, including: 1) more accurate advising (pre-transfer) that is engineering discipline specific (i.e., mechanical, electrical, civil), and in some cases institution specific; 2) better aligned curriculum that allows students to take more courses at 2-year institutions that count towards engineering degrees and not only for transfer credit; and 3) access to courses at 2-year institutions that reflect the intensity of engineering courses commonly offered at 4-year institutions.   Receiving institutions could be more intentional in their efforts to create experiences (i.e., activities, events, programs, learning communities) for engineering transfer students to fast-track their integration into the institution.  Although lateral transfer students and students at more selective institutions raised credit transfer as a larger concern than others, improvements to the transfer credit process could simultaneously address cost of attendance issues ? an area of heightened concern for students who are vertical transfers, Hispanic/Latino, and/or first generation college students.  Solutions that control students? cost by adopting processes and policies that improve efficiency of transfer credit and reduce time to degree completion would yield benefits for multiple subgroups of engineering transfer students.        Over the course of the project, we published multiple journal articles and conference proceedings, gave talks at multiple venues (including engineering transfer student conferences in Texas, where our project?s results will likely have the highest impact), and built a strong community among our partner institutions. To influence policy and practice for our local partners, we produced institution-specific reports summarizing their own survey and interview data and held regional meetings to link each four-year institution with their most prominent feeder community college.  Findings from the project as well as its research design have already influenced program planning for another recently funded NSF project focused on transfer students in Virginia.     The state of Texas has uniquely seen rapid economic and population growth in the past few years, coupled with a high minority population, making it an important setting for studying transfer student pathways and ultimately broadening participation in engineering.
