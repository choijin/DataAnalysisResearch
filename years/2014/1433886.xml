<AbstractNarration>Why do some species introductions fail and some succeed?  Answers to this question are critically important to the fields of ecology, invasive species biology, ecological restoration and biological control.  While larger numbers of propagules (e.g. seeds or eggs) are known to increase colonization success, how much of this effect is due to propagule number alone or to the greater genetic diversity usually contained within larger colonizing populations remains a puzzle.  This project  will experimentally decouple genetic diversity  from propagule number to test whether genetically diverse colonizing populations are more likely to succeed than genetically depauperate ones. Using the model plant, Arabidopsis, the investigators will manipulate both genetic diversity and seed number in natural environments. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The study will significantly advance our understanding of the basic ecological principles governing colonization events and provide valuable insights for controlling weedy and invasive species.  It will also inform ecological restoration and biological control efforts, which require decisions about how many individuals and genotypes to introduce.  It will provide training for one early-career postdoctoral researcher and six undergraduate research assistants; many of the undergraduates will be recruited from underrepresented groups in the sciences.  Lastly, this project will be used in teaching modules that will be developed and implemented in partnership with a Houston public high school and then made freely available to other educators online.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project assesses the extent to which genetic diversity in colonizing populations interacts with the number of founding individuals (propagule pressure) and variation in neighbor abundances to influence colonization success in plants, using as a model invader the weedy mustard Arabidopsis thaliana.  It is designed to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of genetic diversity, testing whether these mechanisms shift in relative importance as propagule pressure increases and interspecific competition is reduced, and whether the importance of these two factors varies over time.  This work represents the first rigorous experimental test of genetic diversity effects on plant colonization dynamics in nature. This is important because although we know that founder population size is an important component of colonization success (larger populations are more likely to succeed), population genetic diversity and founder population size are normally confounded. By disentangling these two components of colonization dynamics, we anticipate valuable insights that can be applied broadly, from biological invasions to ecological restoration.     Results from an extensive seed-addition experiment in the field support the expectation that large populations are more likely to succeed than small ones, but also that increasing genetic diversity enhances colonization success only when the right set of conditions are met.  Specifically, high diversity populations outperformed low diversity populations when founder populations were the largest (and thus intraspecific densities were greatest) and when soil resources (particularly N and P) were low.  These results are consistent with the hypothesis that high-diversity populations are better able than low-diversity populations to finely partition limiting resources.  We were able to replicate these results using a complementary greenhouse experiment in which nutrients were directly manipulated, strongly suggesting that the nutrient-dependency of our genetic diversity effects on colonization success is robust to other environmental conditions or constraints.     To complement our main project, and with supplemental undergraduate research funding from NSF, we also began exploring the ecological importance of within-species genetic and functional trait variability in weedy/invasive species using giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida) as a study system.  In the greenhouse, we grew ragweed from populations located in paired agricultural and natural (riparian) habitats ranging from central Ohio to southern Minnesota and quantified morphological and phenological variability.  We found habitat-based differences in germination timing, with agricultural populations germinating later than riparian populations.  We also found that riparian populations were larger at maturity and allocated relatively less aboveground biomass to reproduction, leading to similar seed production across habitats and therefore distinct biomass allocation strategies based on these distinct habitat types.  We also found that western-most populations produced more and smaller seeds relative to eastern populations.  Because giant ragweed is thought to have expanded its range west from the Ohio River Valley region, this observation may indicate selective pressures nearer the invasion front favoring seeds that are more easily dispersed long distances and therefore adapted for rapidly colonizing new habitats.     This project provided training opportunities for fourteen undergraduate and postgraduate assistants, eleven of whom are female, and the majority of whom are planning to pursue a career in STEM disciplines.  Through mentorship and close supervision by PI Hovick and co-PI Whitney, many of these individuals have made significant progress developing into independent scientists and have contributed greatly to the scientific process, from experimental design and the development of lab protocols to data collection, experiment maintenance...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
