<AbstractNarration>Named Data Networking (NDN) is a long-term research effort that aims to redesign the underlying architecture of the Internet. This collaborative project studies NDN's impacts on social issues such as privacy, intellectual property, law enforcement, governance, and policy. It uses a cooperative research approach, in which social scientists work alongside the NDN team of networking researchers. Project outcomes will include a detailed report on critical social, cultural, and economic considerations for the design of NDN, and future network architectures more generally. Other expected outcomes include technical changes to the NDN architecture based on this set of considerations and through cross-disciplinary dialogue.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project advances Values in Design (ViD) research by investigating the distinction between values intended in the NDN core architecture and values enacted in its implementation(s). The research questions are:&lt;br/&gt;1. How will the NDN application choices reaffirm or reshape values in the NDN architecture?&lt;br/&gt;2. How do values embedded in architecture become enacted in application design and use?&lt;br/&gt;3. What social issues are bound up in NDN technical problems?&lt;br/&gt;4. How can values-in-design perspectives help solve these technical problems?&lt;br/&gt;5. What interventions and strategies encourage values conversations within the technical work of infrastructure design?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses these five research questions using qualitative methods and targeted technical interventions. Further, joint research on four technical challenges - naming, trust management, congestion management, and evaluation metrics - enable values-sensitive perspectives to directly influence new technical innovation. Attention to values issues in active, ongoing NDN research advances networking research by supporting technical innovations in these key areas that are driven by the interdisciplinary discoveries of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering potential social, policy and cultural impacts of the NDN architecture while it is still in development will shape an Internet that not only works more efficiently and provides increased reliability and trustworthiness in communication, but also fundamentally supports privacy, democracy, and equity of information access. The project's impacts will include new methods to evaluate future internet architectures (FIA). There are common challenges for FIA beyond NDN based upon both physical realities (e.g. congestion) and social values (e.g. security, privacy). This project will generate both policy and technical means to address these challenges, first for NDN, but with the potential to be adapted and adopted by other architectures. Finally, this project will further encourage socially-responsible design of emerging technologies by creating and testing better methods for engaging network architects in ViD dialogues. It facilitates the involvement of a broader range of fields in the NSF FIA program and network architecture research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project investigated the implicit and explicit values in the design of the Named Data Networking (NDN) future internet architecture, which is a leading example of Information-Centric Networking (ICN).  The NDN research effort has been supported by NSF since 2010.   The faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students from UCLA and the University of Maryland, College Park worked closely with the NDN project team to 1) survey researchers, including students, about the values inherent in NDN and emerging in its ongoing design and development, and analyze and disseminate the results; 2) interact with researchers developing applications that drive NDN research, enabling values discussions to become a key element of the design effort; and 3) jointly develop academic papers that compared the social and policy implications of IP networking with NDN networking, notably "Anticipating Policy and Social Implications of Named Data Networking" in the Communications of the ACM, December 2016.     UCLA researchers also collaborated directly on the design of NDN applications for mobile health and enterprise building automation and management, supported by the NSF FIA-NP program, as case studies for trust model, identity management, and data sharing designs in NDN.  ViD researchers contributed to application architecture design as well as to the design of graphical interfaces that exposed to the end user the new trust and dissemination approaches that NDN was enabling in these specific applications.  Focusing on how to present key aspects of the design to end users helped to distill what differed in these new applications from designs built on the contemporary IP Internet. This effort yielded several key concepts specific to the capabilities of NDN - including the design of mobile identity and data sharing managers - that were incorporated into those application designs and the implementations built by graduate students and staff researchers in the NDN project.     Both general implications of NDN and specific design impacts on applications were discussed through participation in NDN community and consortium meetings, retreats, IRTF  ICN research group meetings, and ACM ICN conferences.    Finally, this work influenced the direction that the NDN project team has taken in new research on the Internet of Things and Augmented Reality, pursuing decentralized approaches based on local (rather than global) trust assumptions and the opportunities that NDN provides for creating ecosystems of interoperable content and services rather than stovepipe "apps" from a single provider.    To achieve these results, the project successfully brought together a team of application researchers, social scientists, and  designs with network researchers and software engineers from the larger NDN project.
