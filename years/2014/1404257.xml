<AbstractNarration>Expander graphs have been a focus of study in mathematics and computer science during the last four decades. These sparse and yet highly connected graphs are of fundamental importance in building communication networks, in computer algorithms, and in the theory of error-correcting codes. The study of expander graphs has been drawing tools from deep mathematics, such as number theory, representation theory, and topology. In recent years the study of expanders also provided new problems for pure mathematicians. This interplay of mathematics and computer science has been very productive. The current proposal aims at taking the theory of expanders one step further by initiating a systematic study of high-dimensional expanders, which are simplical complexes of high dimensions having similar properties of expanders. The problems in the high-dimensional case are more difficult, but the theory we hope to develop can be expected to be powerful in applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PIs plan to consider various ways to extend the definition of expanders, e.g., via spectrum, cohomology  or  topology. Of particular interest are the Ramanujan complexes, which generalize the Ramanujan graphs. Their extremal properties (proved by methods of representation theory and number theory) together with their remarkable symmetry are expected to be useful in solving several problems. Of special importance is Gromov's topological overlapping property. It is hoped that the extremal properties of Ramanujan complexes will help resolve some problems of basic importance in the theory of error-correcting codes, as well as in other areas of computer science.</AbstractNarration>

The theory of expander graphs is one of the greatest success stories in these two areas and a source of numerous deep and unexpected connections between them. In recent years it has become apparent that most of the fundamental combinatorial constructions have very interesting higher-dimensional counterparts of great theoretical interest and substantial practical promise.  Graphs are key to essentially all current applications of the mathematical sciences to other disciplines. This is due to the great importance and abundance of systems where many objects interact in pairs: Elementary particles, biological molecules, humans, corporations etc. But very often the underlying interactions involve several parties. To properly model such a system, one must appeal to the theory of hypergraphs or simplicial complexes, about which we currently still know much less.  The project studies several aspects of high dimensional expanders. In particular, we gave a complete answer to a question of Gromov asking if such "topological high dimensional expanders" exist which are of bounded degree. We showed that such objects indeed exist and gave an explicit construction.   The proof makes a use of Ramanujan complexes which are the most beautiful high dimensional expanders.
