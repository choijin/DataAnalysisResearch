<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: Superhard materials, such as diamond, cubic boron nitride, and boron carbide (B4C) can exhibit high melting temperatures, large compression strengths, chemical inertness, and high thermal conductivity, making them of practical importance for science and engineering applications. However, they are brittle, breaking easily, a serious flaw that prevents many engineering applications. Computational approaches will be combined to develop ductile superhard materials for extended engineering applications. Initially, quantum mechanics will be used to predict the best candidates for new ductile superhard materials by analyzing a large number of cases in silico. For the best predicted materials novel experimental methods will be employed in which diamond anvil cells are twisted while applying high pressure to form the predicted phases. The properties of these materials will then be tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The goal is to advance multiscale theory, modeling, and experiment sufficiently to enable a revolutionary new approach to search for and synthesize novel nanostructured phases in the BCN system. Large plastic shear deformation will be combined with high pressure in a unique rotational diamond anvil cell (RDAC), to (a) search for new nanostructured superhard phases that cannot be obtained under pressure without plastic shear straining, (b) dramatically reduce pressure required for phase transformation pathways to new and/or known phases, and (c) stabilize these new phases for processing at ambient pressure. The focus will be on some of the most promising materials within the BCN system: superhard phases of carbon (diamond, fullerene, high-density amorphous C, nanotubes, and long-range ordered amorphous clusters), boron, cubic cBN and wurtzitic wBN, cubic cBC2N, cBC4N, high density cC3N4 (predicted to be harder than diamond but never synthesized), nanostructured composites within BCN system, and other new phases in these systems, all of which will be predicted by the atomistic simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We focused on four problems.</p> <p><strong>1. Extending quantum mechanics based theory to millions of atoms</strong>. The development of new materials for advancing technology has generally relied on numerous experiments on various compositions and various processing conditions to slowing develop improved materials. This process is slow and expensive, so it has long been the dream that computational methods starting with quantum mechanics (QM, solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation) could be used to predict new materials and their properties on the computer. The problem has been that even the smallest materials-by-design applications would involve sizes of 25 nanometers (1 millionth of an inch) on a side, which requires about 4 million atoms, whereas QM is limited to 300 atoms. We have found a solution to this problem by using ideas going back to Pauling to develop simple equations describing the atomic motions to predict the deformation and reactions of materials <em>without</em> solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, making studies of millions of atoms practical. This new method is called the ReaxFF reactive force field and has been in development for over 10 years. This opens up the possibility of <em>in silico</em> design of new materials that could help develop more efficient manufacturing processes. This approach is called multiscale-multiparadigm design, see picture. In this project, we successfully applied this ReaxFF method to two problems:</p> <ul> <li>converting graphite to diamond at modest pressure and </li> <li>making boron carbide more ductile.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Converting graphene to diamond at modest pressures</strong>. To convert graphite to diamond normally requires very high pressures, over 150.000 atmospheres. We have shown experimentally and by ReaxFF based simulation that simultaneously applying shear and pressure to graphite can transform it into diamond at just 4000 to 7000 atmospheres. The implications are two-fold:</p> <p>2a. A long time puzzle has been the numerous nanodiamonds found in the earth&rsquo;s crust. Since the pressures in the crust are far lower than 150.000 atmospheres, it has been assumed that these nanodiamonds were formed in mantel and transferred somehow to the crust. Our discovery shows that these diamonds could have been formed in the crust by the shearing actions of plate tectonics. Thus they may provide hints as to the shear pressures involved in the migrations of the continental shelfs.</p> <p>2b. Many interesting materials require very high pressure (far over 10,000 atmospheres to form). Our results suggest that applying shear and pressure simultaneously may allow much less extreme conditions for forming exotic species (e.g., forming NNO gas (laughing gas) into a high energy polymer) while increasing the stability for retaining them under ambient conditions.</p> <p><strong>3. Making ductile very hard but brittle ceramics, such as boron carbide.</strong> &nbsp;We wanted to learn why very hard and lightweight ceramics, such as boron carbide (B4C), are brittle at high impact and then to use this information to find a way to alloy B<sub>4</sub>C to make it ductile.</p> <p>3a. To calculate how materials deform and break usually requires quantum mechanics (QM, solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation), but the brittle failure of B4C requires scales of 25 nm or larger leading to at least 200,000 atoms but QM is limited to ~300 atoms. We solved this problem by developing the ReaxFF reactive field to describe the QM accurately for boron carbide and then using reactive molecular dynamics (solving Newton&rsquo;s equations) to determine what causes the brittle failure. We discovered that shear causes the (B<sub>11</sub>C) icosahedra forming the B<sub>4</sub>C structure to shatter, leading to a densification that induces tension and then spallation.</p> <p>3b based on this new understanding of the brittle failure, we discovered that new alloys including&nbsp; a small amount (14%) of Si that would be ductile, and we carried out simulations that to verify this. However, our experimental collaborators have not yet been able to synthesize these materials with sufficient Si. We are continuing to try to use the theory to find the best conditions for doing this.</p> <p><strong>4. Band gaps.</strong> A major difficulty for <em>in silico</em> design of new materials prior to experiment is predicting accurately the band gap, that is the energy to excite an electron from the highest occupied state to the lowest empty one. For example, Si crystal has a band gap of 1.1 electron volts, so visible light can excite these electrons, the basis for silicon solar cells. The problem is that the most efficient QM methods lead to very large errors in these band gaps (sometimes preddcitng that an insulator is a metal!). We showed that a simple modification of the standard methods leads to very accurate values, opening the way for <em>in silico</em> design of such systems.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/25/2017<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;A&nbsp;Goddard</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1436985/1436985_10337168_1508913090338_Multiscale-multiparadigm-Materials-by-design--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1436985/1436985_10337168_1508913090338_Multiscale-multiparadigm-Materials-by-design--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Multiscale Multiparadigm design of materials"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1436985/1436985_10337168_1508913090338_Multiscale-multiparadigm-Materials-by-design--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Multiscale Multiparadigm design of materials"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Illustration of how first principles quantum mechanics (300 atoms) can be connect designs of practical materials (microns) involving billions of atoms</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andres Jaramillo-Botero and William A.
