<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to demonstrate the outstanding but untapped potential of passive radar systems with multiple transmitters and receivers. Passive radar is a powerful approach that uses existing ambient communication signals such as radio and television broadcasts, or satellite, cellular and WiFi signals, to detect, image or classify objects and estimate their position and motion. Since passive radar uses existing communication signals it can drastically reduce cost, complexity and energy usage while being especially important in emergency settings where one needs to quickly deploy a radar. Through theoretical analysis, algorithm assessment, the project will demonstrate the tremendous performance gains obtained through moderate increases in the numbers of transmit and receive antennas for realistic radar system models. These contributions should have significant impact to signal processing, sensor networking, machine learning and radar systems research. As new statistical problems will be considered, new theory developed should provide contributions in mathematics and statistics while leading to practical algorithms and ultimately improved radar systems for air traffic control, homeland security, law enforcement (through-wall imaging), surveillance, ocean monitoring, weather monitoring, and environmental monitoring. These investigations should provide contributions relating to the performance analysis of multiple target cases in active radar, sonar, ultrasound, acoustics and other similar active and nonactive sensor technologies. It should encourage new applications for smart homes, businesses and cars.  This project will also offer ample opportunities for educating graduate students, preferably from under-represented groups, in the important cross-disciplinary areas of signal processing and energy via coordination between this research project, classes and Lehigh's Integrated Networks for Electricity (INE) initiative, which the PI is leading.  The sensing research in this project couples well with several activities within the INE initiative. Research results will also be incorporated into current and future Lehigh classes with the hope that class notes will evolve into a book and short course on networked passive radar to provide broad educational impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The optimum possible performance for realistically estimating the position and velocity vectors of objects using a passive radar with M transmit and N receive stations will be derived for the first time. Based on presented preliminary results for a simplified system model, the project is expected to demonstrate the tremendous performance gains obtained through moderate increases in MN for realistic system models. These gains have not been observed to date and should encourage a tremendous increase in research activity on passive radar technology with MN &gt; 1. These contributions should have significant impact to signal processing, sensor networking, machine learning and radar systems research.  The proposed approach will employ local/nonlocal/Bayesian/nonBayesian bounds for finite MN performance; recent convergence results for sums of dependent random variables to guide enlightening asymptotic analysis; carefully chosen models for correlated reflection coefficients, correlated noise and other important degradations; enhanced models based on electromagnetic theory;  recently developed target and clutter models; and the most promising signals of opportunities, including MIMO communication signals which show significant promise. The well-developed topics of multiuser/iterative detection and interference channels will be employed to include the degradation incurred when estimating the transmitted signals of opportunity and to account for the any components of the direct path signals that may leak into what is thought to be only the reflected signals. The impact of simultaneously employing several different types of signals of opportunity and different station placements will be uncovered.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RADAR systems are the most popular and effective way to locate objects of interest.  RADAR systems are commonly used to locate aircraft at airports for air traffic control.  Most recently built automobiles are equipped with multiple RADARs that are used to avoid hitting various objects, including other automobiles and people. Most major automobile manufacturers appear to believe that fusing RADAR data with video camera data will provide the most cost effective and reliable method to stop self-driving and human driven automobiles from hitting people. RADAR is a very important technology that greatly impacts the daily lives of all of us.  Standard active RADARs transmit an electromagnetic signal from an antenna that will bounce off an object before reception at this same antenna.  From the time between transmission and reception, we can determine how far from the antenna the object is located. The part of the RADAR that transmits this signal is by far the most complicated and expensive part of the RADAR.  This transmitter also uses our precious limited energy resources.  Passive RADAR technology provides a method to implement a RADAR without building a transmitter, but instead using existing communication signals that are already available and serving other purposes.  Passive radar could lead to considerably cheaper RADARs that could revolutionize this technology.  It would allow one to establish RADAR systems in an emergency area which already has communications signals for cellular service, radio or television.  This research project provided important new results aimed at understanding the fundamental limits on the performance of passive radar, thus answering the question: how close to the performance of active RADAR can passive RADAR with proper design achieve?  Along with attempting to answer this question, the research project also provided some specific technology that will help us achieve this ultimate performance.  To answer the question of how close can we make the performance of passive RADAR to that of active, we have produced new tight bounds on the best possible performance of passive RADAR that consider much more realistic scenarios and accurate models than any previous work. The research also showed the tremendous gains that can be achieved by using multiple existing communication signals, possibly from different communication systems (cellular and digital television for example) or from multiple base stations from a single communication system.  Large gains were also demonstrated from employing multiple dispersed receivers and even larger gains if each receiver uses a properly designed antenna array. Even larger gains were demonstrated from using the typically known structure of the communication signals.  Typically, these communication signals are composed of pulse trains employing known pulses of a certain type, but where each pulse may contain unknown binary digits in some sort of amplitude or phase modulation.  In some demonstrated cases, the passive RADAR implementation provides performance that closely approximates that of a corresponding active RADAR.    This result should encourage passive RADAR to be used in place of active RADAR.  These just described results have made recognized contributions to the RADAR and signal processing research communities as well as to companies and to the engineers building these systems.  Our bounds are invaluable to the companies and engineers building these systems.   They can employ the bounds to quickly evaluate the possible performance of a RADAR system in preliminary design evaluation without performing complicated simulations.  The scientific contributions were published in the finest scientific journals covering these topics, presented at the top conferences and at presentations to companies, universities, and to the general public.  Several plenary talks at the best conferences covering these areas were focused on the results obtained during this research project.  The material was employed to educate students in classes taught at Lehigh University and in short courses to researchers and engineers in industry.   Undergraduate and graduate students worked on this research project.  These students were trained to do research, publish scientific papers, and present their work to many different audiences inside and outside Lehigh University. The students were also trained in passive RADAR technology, a topic for which trained engineers are lacking.  The project included extensive collaborations with other universities, including international connections. These collaborations significantly enhanced the quality of the research contributions.  Research experience for undergraduate supplements enabled some outstanding undergraduate students to get the experience of being a graduate student in hope of convincing them to pursue this direction.
