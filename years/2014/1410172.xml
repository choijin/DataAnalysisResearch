<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any life form has to react to changes in its environment.  In order to do so, it has to be able to process information.  Information processing within individual cells boils down to interactions between different biomolecules that can come together in a multitude of different combinations.  In order to process information, these interactions have to be cooperative, i.e., the interactions between one set of molecules have to depend on the presence or absence of other molecules.  The PI's group will develop theoretical methods to model such cooperativity that will provide a better fundamental understanding of biological information processing and possibly the ability to engineer future biological information processing circuits.  The research will be focused on two of the most important types of biomolecules, nucleic acids and proteins, and will have two different components.  The first component will address the question of how natural structural properties of nucleic acids can generate cooperativity and how this new mechanism is used by living organisms.  The second component will be of a more technological nature and will aim at improving the utilization of protein nucleic acid interactions to measure DNA methylation, a feature of cells that is known to be affected in many diseases.  &lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the training of a new generation of researchers equipped with mathematical and biological skills that are important for the future progress in the life sciences.  This will be achieved through students' education in Biophysics Graduate Program and participation in Biophysics Seminar series at the Ohio State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop quantitative models to describe cooperativity in interactions between proteins and nucleic acids.  Such interactions are at the foundation of biological information processing as well as of biotechnological applications.  Accurate theoretical models make interpretation of today's quantitative experiments possible and allow a fundamental understanding of biological mechanisms and extraction of "hidden" parameters from measurements.  Within this context, the project consists of two parts.  The first part will address effect of RNA secondary structure on cooperativity of proteins binding and elucidate mechanism of how natural messenger RNAs implements logic operations among different protein "inputs" in post-transcriptional regulation.  The second part consists of the development of a detailed model of the interactions between several MBD2 methyl-binding domains and (methylated) DNA molecules.  These MBD2 domains are used in experiments for determining DNA methylation status in a genome-wide manner and it is anticipated that the model to be developed will improve accuracy of these DNA methylation measurements.  Such genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation are of interest since DNA methylation is known to be affected in many diseases.</AbstractNarration>

Building mathematical models of the interactions between these biomolecules allows for the proper interpretation of biochemical experiments and for a better understanding on how these interactions lead to biological functions in living cells.

RNA binding proteins can interact with an RNA molecule only if this molecule is folded into a compatible structure.  Thus, the structure of the RNA molecule matters for its interactions with RNA binding proteins.  The major outcome of our project is that we have developed a mathematical model that can predict the interaction between an RNA binding protein and any arbitrary RNA taking into account the different structures of the RNA molecule by only knowing the genomic sequence of the RNA. Since we have set up a web server at http://bioserv.mps.ohio-state.edu/RBPBind any scientist can use our model in their research.  We also have used this model to show that multiple proteins binding to the same RNA can affect each others' binding through changing the structure of the RNA, which allows more complex biological functions to be implemented in the cell.  The second sub-project concerns the determination of DNA methylation.  DNA methylation is a chemical modification of the genome that affects how the genome is read.  Since there are many diseases, in which DNA methylation is dysregulated, scientists are interested in being able to measure DNA methylation along the entire genome.  One popular approach called MethylCap-Seq consists of breaking the DNA into fragments, exposing them to beads to which methyl binding domains, i.e., protein domains that preferentially bind to methylated DNA, are attached, washing away any (presumably not methylated) DNA that does not interact with the methyl-binding domains, and counting (using high throughput sequencing) the DNAs that interacted with the methyl binding domains in the entire genome.

As part of this project we developed a mathematical model of the interactions of methyl binding domains with methylated DNA. These models now provide a connection between the percent methylation of a DNA fragment and the counts observed in MethylCap-Seq experiments and thus improve absolute quantification of DNA methylation in MethylCap-Seq experiments.  An important aspect of this project is also the development of human resources. The life sciences have become more and more quantitative over the last decades.  The ability to measure very precise quantitative information and to obtain large data sets on biological systems requires individuals trained both in the biology of the systems of interest and in the intricacies of large scale quantitative data analysis.  This project has over its lifetime involved five graduate students, one undergraduate student, and one postdoctoral researcher.  Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the project, these individuals obtained hands-on training in using quantitative approaches to solve cutting edge life sciences problems.  But also beyond the trainees directly supported by the project, many trainees in the several experimental collaborators' groups have been exposed to the more mathematical and quantitative approaches the Bundschuh group is spearheading and thus broadened their training experience.
