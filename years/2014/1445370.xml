<AbstractNarration>Much has been learned and written about the fragility of today's Internet routing architecture because of inherent limitations in traditional network routing protocols and the way they are used. Whether by accident or with malicious intent, network operators routinely  disrupt network traffic on a regional and global scale, causing both service disruptions and data privacy breaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project works towards alleviating these problems in the global network infrastructure by exploring the feasibility of a trusted routing architecture based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). This research effort will identify and overcome barriers to the design, deployment and operation of networks with secure, trusted routing information. The results of this effort will include a working example, from which network operators can learn how to ultimately create a more reliable international communications infrastructure with fewer threats to data security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The core traffic routing technologies at the heart of the world-wide IP Internet retain several long-standing, well-known weaknesses that leave the network vulnerable to service disruption by both malicious and unintentional actions. The issue of traffic hijacking is a problem with several proposed solutions that have not yet seen wide deployment. The goal of this project has been to identify the impediments to addressing the known problems with BGP route hijacking and move forward with solutions to these problems. This work focuses on the issues of BGP route hijacking and the proposed solutions found in BGPsec and the Resource Public Key Infrastructure, known as RPKI.
