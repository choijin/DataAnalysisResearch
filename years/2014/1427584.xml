<AbstractNarration>This project catalyzes a new collaboration in the area of green computing between the PI Bein of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and Dr. Hito Ito of the University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo as well as engineers at Panasonic Japan.  The collaboration focuses on applying algorithmic ideas in the area of sustainability. Power management and energy-efficient computing are ever more important, given the exponential growth in the number of information technology devices worldwide.  Japan?s Green IT Initiative has focused especially on advanced control and management enabled by IT and electronics. Japan has now a lead position in this area. One of the goals of the planning visit is to set a foundation for future collaborative research and mutual technology transfer. An important component of this project is student involvement, with the PI?s Ph.D. student participating in the planning visit to enhance professional development and enable fuller participation in follow-up research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific areas for investigations are power-down problems, speed scaling mechanisms and smart algorithms for alternative energy management and storage. Energy conservation and management involves decision making in complex situations and with incomplete information about the future. Thus, it is natural to study such problems in the framework of game theoretic and online competitive models.  The proposed new U.S.-Japanese collaboration seeks to tackle a number of difficult problems in the area of online algorithms, with great potential for impact in application areas, and along the way we expect to find general paradigms for online algorithms.  It is expected that techniques developed by the proposer such as the knowledge state method, tracklessness, and task system analysis will complement the Japanese host?s research in green computing with a focus on consumer electronics applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The existing electrical grid has been remarkably successful and reliable, which can be attributed to the modeling of load pattern on the grid to accurately predict the demand. But it is primarily an open loop system designed to support only one way dependable flow of electrical power supplied by conventional fossil, hydro and nuclear power plants. With the shift towards renewable energy sources there are new challenges in designing an effective, dependable and secure power infrastructure.

To add to this, there have been unusual weather patterns in recent years suspected by some climate scientists as related to a change in the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation. To be reliable and resilient  a smart grid has to be designed more like the internet than the traditional grid infrastructure. The project brought some of the techniques used for the internet into this realm, such as game theoric modeling and online competitive analysis, for example.  Furthermore the research focused on power-down mechanisms, which are important in the control of the smart grid as well as in a wide variety of problems, such as for on-off policies for HVAC systems or controlling electric and hybrid vehicles.   Japan has a lead position in the area of energy control mechanisms for electronics and Japan's Green IT Initiative has focused especially on advanced control and management enabled by IT and electronics; Japan has now a lead position in this area. The project has established a permanent research relationship between the the University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo as well as other Japanese institutions (Kyoto University, Saga University, Nara Institute of Science and Technology University) and the Unversity of Nevada, Las Vegas.   The PI notes that by allocating funds carefully the funds covered more activities than originally proposed. Additionally, due to the successful initial visits, the partner University sponsored two research visits with Japanese funds, one for the principal investigator and one for a Ph.D. student.
