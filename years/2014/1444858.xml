<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project is implementing a series of one day workshops at each of the three partner institutions (The University of Akron, The University of Houston, and Mississippi State University), led by the PI team with faculty from each institution.  The goal of the workshops is to increase the numbers of underrepresented engineering students who complete graduate degrees in engineering and pursue academic careers. It is expected that approximately 200 students will attend each workshop which will include discussion of the following topics: faculty careers, time management, the science of STEM teaching, culturally responsive teaching, mentoring/career coaching and graduate education. The proposed activity, if successful, will advance our knowledge of best practices in the recruitment and training of underrepresented graduate students for faculty careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is in its intent to have engineering students view the engineering faculty profession as a viable career alternative.  With the preparation provided through these workshops, the potential for success of those that choose to join the engineering faculty ranks will be strengthened through knowledge of successful practices. By exposing workshop participants to the concept of culturally responsive teaching, this project will result in engineering faculty who practice inclusive pedagogies in their classrooms.  This, in turn has the potential to impact large numbers of undergraduate students, improving their educational environment to facilitate improved learning outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of working with academic institutions seeking to enhance capability for their faculty and students, sharing learning and expanding effective practices focused on broadening participation.  Additionally, NSF values and promotes the use of inquiry-based instructional practices that improve the nation's capacity to draw in and retain students in STEM fields, including students from underrepresented groups and institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are numerous studies on the issues facing underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Across all groups, women participate at lower levels than their male counterparts. Most activities to rectify such a deficiency in STEM disciplines have focused on K-16 initiatives to address lack of preparation, inability to balance coursework and external commitments, self-efficacy, and financial limitations. However, there has been minimal focus on issues faced by female or minority graduate students or the need for effective mentoring of post-docs and new faculty in engineering to attract and retain them in academic careers.  This is alarming as one approach to increase the number of underrepresented minorities who graduate with a STEM degree is to provide mentors through all levels (i.e., undergraduate to faculty).      The main objectives of this project were to develop 1 &frac12; day workshops to be held at the University of Akron (UA), Mississippi State University (MSU) and The University of Houston (UH). The goal of these workshops at each institution was to encourage underrepresented minorities to enter graduate school and pursue academic career.  Speakers were the project investigators and faculty from each home institution.  The workshop's focus was for graduate students, post-docs, and early career tenure track faculty in engineering.  Undergraduates were also invited to participate to raise awareness about graduate school and academic career opportunities.  As such, for the undergraduates, an additional topic: Graduate school (how to apply, selecting the best program, etc.) was provided.
