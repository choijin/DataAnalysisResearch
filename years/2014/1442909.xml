<AbstractNarration>Continually increasing water demand (due to population growth) and fuel costs threaten the reliability of water and energy systems and also increase operational costs. In addition, climatic variability and long-term change increase the vulnerability of these two systems. For instance, reservoir systems primarily depend on monthly to seasonal precipitation; whereas power systems demand depend on variations in diurnal temperature over the season. Currently, both systems consider climatological averages for their short-term (0-3 months) management, which ignores uncertainty in the climate resulting in reduced hydropower (i.e., increased spill) from reservoirs and increased operational costs for power systems from excessive fuel stockpiling. While seasonal climate forecasts contain appreciable levels of skill over parts of the US in both winter and summer, the uptake of these forecasts for co-optimization of water and power systems has been limited due to lack of a framework to assimilate, visualize and communicate probabilistic forecasts into management models. The project will develop a prototype visual analytic simulation-optimization framework for better communication and visualization of probabilistic information on the decision space for improving water and power systems sustainability utilizing monthly to seasonal multimodel climate forecasts. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this poject is to develop an integrated cyber-enabled approach for improved water and energy sustainability utilizing the monthly to seasonal climate forecasts by: A. Developing a cyberinfrastructure framework using Optimus-PRIME that co-optimizes water and power system allocations by incorporating precipitation, power demand and wind power ensembles. B. Developing a visual analytic framework for interactive exploration of multi-objective decision space and interaction with the optimization engine by leveraging recent developments in visual analytics. C. Developing fine-grained and coarse-grained resource utilization strategies for targeting different parts of the computation on heterogeneous many-core/accelerator based architectures. D. Analyzing risk management strategies that include improved fuel stockpiling, scheduled plant maintenance and reservoir operational schedules to minimize operational costs utilizing the multimodel electricity demand, wind power, and streamflow forecasts available for the pilot basin. F. Performing scenario analyses that consider increased renewable energy availability -- hydropower and wind -- in the power generation mix, reduced CO2 emission scenarios under current and increased water demand potentials contingent on multimodel climate forecasts. F. Synthesizing the findings from objectives (A-F) by considering various virtual water and power system configurations that are typical across the country for generalization and broader application. The fundamental contribution of the proposal lies in developing a prototype cyberinfrastructure for improving water and power systems management utilizing climate forecasts. Using the framework, the study proposes to minimize the operational costs of these two interdependent systems by considering various scenarios for maximizing the renewable energy potential utilizing multimodel climate (precipitation, temperature and wind) forecasts. By utilizing the streamflow and power demand forecasts, a paradigm shift in water and power systems management is targeted that promotes various proactive strategies such as forward purchasing of fuels, reducing emissions and meeting target reservoir storage to ensure both systems reliability. To overcome the computational challenges arising from probabilistic forecasts, an HPC-enabled cyberinfrastructure will parallelize the computations across ensembles and provide a seamless interaction between water and power stochastic optimization models. For interactive exploration of multi-objective decision spaces in the water and power sectors, new developments in visual analytics will be employed that can lead to improved stakeholder facilitated solutions for the pilot basin and promote learning and understanding through virtual systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed research modules and findings will be incorporated into various advanced graduate courses at NCSU in the water resources and environmental engineering, computer-aided engineering and power system engineering curricula. The developed climate information based risk-management tools will also be used in the NCSU's Climate Change and Society Professional Science Master's program, which exclusively draws professionals with interdisciplinary background. The investigators will also work with the State Climate Office of NC and federal agencies, PNNL and ORNL, to implement the algorithms developed in the project for broader applications. The investigators will also develop customized podcasts and modules on climate-water-energy nexus and their significance to sustainability for high school students by collaborating with the engineering place at NCSU.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project is to improve the coordinated management of water and power systems using climate information at seasonal time scale.  As these two systems are interconnected through hydropower generation, they also heavily depend on climate &ndash; precipitation and temperature &ndash; variability, which influence the water supply availability and power demand requirement.  We summarize here the outcomes onfour research aspects below.    Reservoir Modeling and Streamflow Forecasting:  Since streamflow forecasts are represented probabilistically, we developed a multi-reservoir model, GRAPS, and a python based graphical user interface for inputting the reservoir details into GRAPS. Developed model was validated for several multi-reservoir systems namely Oros (Brazil), TVA (Tennessee), and Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (GA) River basins and provides hydropower generation forecasts from a given seasonal streamflow forecasts.

The approach was tested for optimizing monthly releases for the 28-reservoir TVA system towards maximizing hydropower considering operational rule curves. This approach is augmenting previously developed optimization approaches such as feasible sequential quadratic programming (FSQP), which supports GRAPS.    Seasonal Power Demand Forecasting:  Seasonal power demand primarily depends on temperature variability. We analyzed year-to-year residential electricity demand dependency on temperature, population and substitution effects over all the states from the coterminous US. Our analysis shows forecasting summer power demand is easier compared to the winter demand as the summer cooling load depends only on electricity, whereas the winter heating load depends on multiple power generation sources (e.g., oil and natural gas) apart from electricity.   We evaluated the potential to develop seasonal power demand forecasts purely based on climate forecasts over the Southern US. Our analysis also shows that based on GCM-based temperature can be used to develop winter power demand.    Energy System Modeling:   We successfully finalized an implementation of the energy system model (ESM), TEMOA, to perform power generation dispatch and scheduling of multiple technologies. A benchmark analysis was conducted using a unit commitment model (UCM). The modeling enhancements developed in this part are applied to analyze other systems such as the North Carolina power system considering energy storage devices.  We developed and calibrated a national, multi-region US dataset for use with TEMOA. Different analysis are emanating from this effort such as developing robust capacity expansion strategies to address uncertain future investment and fuel costs of power systems.  We developed a framework based on stochastic dual dynamic programming to establish control policies related to charging and discharging of energy storage devices. Moreover, we were able to create a procedure to optimally define storage sizing for a community with potential for solar generation.    Combined Modeling of Water and Power Systems:  Power systems typically utilize equivalent reservoir system (ERS) approach for assessing the seasonal hydropower availability. Comparison between ERS system and the cascade reservoir system (CRS) shows that the ERS performs as well as CRS for reservoirs with large storage-to-demand ratios (SDR), but underestimates the hydropower potential for smaller SDRs due to the inability to assess the hydropower potential for runoff-the-river systems. Power systems typically use UCM to support their operation, which is computationally intensive to develop seasonal management plan. Hence, we compared the performance of UCM and ESM, TEMOA, based on the seasonal uncertainty in hydropower availability.  We show ESM using an imperfect load forecast produces differences in monthly cost and generation levels that are less than 2% compared with a UCM using a perfect load forecast, but the ESM obtains optimal solutions 100 times faster than the UCM, making ESM a suitable tool for future work aimed at evaluating seasonal electricity generation under uncertainty in power demand. Given ESM is adequate to support seasonal power system management, we linked TEMOA and the multi-reservoir model, GRAPS, for co-optimizing the operation of reservoirs (28 reservoirs) and power generation (54 plants) for the TVA. Thus, we have created a computational infrastructure for conducting sequential analysis of GRAPS and TEMOA has been developed by leveraging FSQP. This computational framework co-optimizes water and energy systems to schedule and dispatch reservoir releases (to meet non-hydro demands) and energy resources (demand response resources and energy storage devices) for providing ancillary service when hydro power is not abundant to provide ancillary service for systems with significant renewable energy penetration.
