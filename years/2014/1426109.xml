<AbstractNarration>The annual ACM CCS conference is a leading international forum for computer and communications security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences.  ACM CCS is the flagship event of ACM Special Interest Group of Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC).  Its acceptance rate is around 15-20%, which makes it a highly selective conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for 20 students to attend ACM CCS and associated workshops.  Preference will be given to undergraduate students participating in the poster session, and students with papers in the conference or workshop who do not have other support.  Participation by women and underrepresented groups will also be encouraged.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       This project is to support the travel expenses of selected student attendees who presented their research work at ACM CCS which is the most prestigious research conference in the field of computer security.          We have received 80+ applications from 9 different countries (USA, Australia, Sweden, Germany, Canada, South Korea, HongKong, United Kingdom, and Greece) and 13 applications were submitted by female students.
