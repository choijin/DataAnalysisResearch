<AbstractNarration>The proposal has several interconnected elements that revolve around extending to a wider population existing efforts to improve science literacy in Native Alaskan groups, while simultaneously developing a framework for assisting Polar researchers to improve their communications skills. The twin tracks have a common goal of generally improving science literacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another goal is to increase interaction between researchers and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Sitka Sound Science Center?s project: <strong>?Ataraq:</strong> <strong>Polar Research in Coastal Communities?</strong> provided carefully crafted community engagement outlets for Polar scientists to communicate the importance of their work to rural and Alaska Native students and the general public. This project brought 82 scientists to a rural Alaska Native community over 6 years to have meaningful engagement activities through two primary outlets: Sitka Whalefest, a 24 year old symposium celebrating the marine environment through scientific lectures, community festivities, music, art and classroom instruction, and an Alaska-developed, highly successful model called Scientist in Residency Fellowship (SIRF) which brings scientists to the community for one month to participate in a variety of community engagement activities that expose rural and Alaska Natives, underrepresented the sciences, to polar research and STEM disciplines, and trains scientists how to communicate in rural Alaska.</p> <p>&nbsp;The SIRF model was extremely successful in connecting Polar researchers with students, teachers, policy makers, representatives of science agencies, Alaska Natives, community members, scientists <em>through a partnership with </em>rural, Southeast Alaskan coastal communities. . Surveys also showed that all of the 34 scientists who participated in SIRF improved their communication skills and understanding of how to work with Alaska rural communities. Sitka School District credited the SIRF program for contributing to raising state science standardized test scores among Alaska Natives and economically disadvantaged students. Student and teacher surveys of K-12 students demonstrated that SIRF was successful in exposing students to STEM disciplines and scientific thinking. The evaluations also demonstrated that SIRF has the potential to work as a model in other small rural places in Alaska. A paper about the results of SIRF is underway.</p> <p>Annual surveys of Whalefest participants demonstrates that rural students were exposed and excited about polar research and felt encouraged to pursue STEM careers. WhaleFest created new opportunities for students from the region to participate in STEM learning. It also created new opportunities for first generation and Alaska Native undergraduates to participated in spinoff programs built around the idea that a science festival can be a positive way to influence undergraduates to major in STEM fields.</p> <p>Evaluations also demonstrated the value of a field station with partnerships with universities, local schools and a variety of local entities is a excellent venue for connecting scientists to community members.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Lisa&nbsp;J&nbsp;Busch</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1433190/1433190_10332838_1604430079936_SWF15-TShobe_S9A5839--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1433190/1433190_10332838_1604430079936_SWF15-TShobe_S9A5839--rgov-800width.jpg" title="WhaleFest attendees"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1433190/1433190_10332838_1604430079936_SWF15-TShobe_S9A5839--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="WhaleFest attendees"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Alaska Native student from Mt.
