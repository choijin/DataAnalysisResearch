<AbstractNarration>This project represents a cross-disciplinary collaborative research effort on developing rigorous, closed-loop approaches for designing, simulating, and verifying medical devices.  The work will open fundamental new approaches for radically accelerating the pace of medical device innovation, especially in the sphere of cardiac-device design. Specific attention will be devoted to developing advanced formal methods-based approaches for analyzing controller designs for safety and effectiveness; and devising methods for expediting regulatory and other third-party reviews of device designs.  The project team includes members with research backgrounds in computer science, electrical engineering, biophysics, and cardiology; the PIs will use a coordinated approach that balances theoretical, experimental and practical concerns to yield results that are intended to transform the practice of device design while also facilitating the translation of new cardiac therapies into practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will lead to significant advances in the state of the art for system verification and cardiac therapies based on the use of formal methods and closed-loop control and verification.  The animating vision for the work is to enable the development of a true in silico design methodology for medical devices that can be used to speed the development of new devices and to provide greater assurance that their behaviors match designers' intentions, and to pass regulatory muster more quickly so that they can be used on patients needing their care.  The scientific work being proposed will serve this vision by providing mathematically robust techniques for analyzing and verifying the behavior of medical devices, for modeling and simulating heart dynamics, and for conducting closed-loop verification of proposed therapeutic approaches.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acceleration in medical device innovation achievable as a result of the proposed research will also have long-term and sustained societal benefits, as better diagnostic and therapeutic technologies enter into the practice of medicine more quickly.  It will also yield a collection of tools and techniques that will be applicable in the design of other types of devices.  Finally, it will contribute to the development of human resources and the further inclusion of under-represented groups via its extensive education and outreach programs, including intensive workshop experiences for undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Medical devices, such as insulin pumps and pacemakers, are safety critical, i.e. if they malfunction the patient might be harmed or even die. Thus a high degree of analysis and testing is necessary, but such activities are both difficult and expensive. Testing of pacemakers involves living hearts and real pacemakers. Analysis and testing could be greatly facilitated if done in simulation using models &ndash; of the heart as well as of the pacemaker &ndash; and testing on live hearts in clinical trials could be drastically reduced. However, to determine whether or not a device is ready for clinical trials, based on analysis and testing of simulated models, the models must be correct.  Since medical devices are systems that combine physical components (e.g. pulseox, pumps) with computational processes (e.g. decision making software), they are called Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). Many CPSs have the same properties as medical devices: they are safety critical and difficult to analyze and test.  The goals of this project are to research new methods to: 1) learn, analyze, and verify models of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) whose behaviors are not specified completely and not well-understood 2) test models of CPSs that are difficult to test using conventional testing methods and 3) specify the behavior of CPSs from the perspective of safety and security. To reach these objectives, we developed a new approach consisting of software tool-supported methods to automatically infer the actual behaviors of a CPS in the form of system invariants and state-machine models. Invariants are system observations that never change throughout the system executions. The resulting invariants and models can be analyzed and are effective in defining system behaviors, as they show conformance with and deviations from existing specifications which represent unspecified behaviors.  The approach combines dynamic and static analysis. Dynamic analysis is done by executing automatically generated test cases against the CPS and infer invariants and state-machine models from the runtime data, The invariants and models are then analyzed using data mining and automata learning techniques.

The results of our study is an extended understanding of the relationships of the different model parameters/configurations that result in different heart rates. These results would have been difficult to obtain using regular testing techniques and thus illustrate the usefulness of the new approach.  We used the new approach to address the problem of model alignment, which is the problem of configuring two models such that their behaviors can be considered "equivalent." We explored the problem of aligning two cardiac models that were implemented using two different approaches, i.e., timed automata and differential equations. The study showed that our approach can be used as a semi-automated approach to identify configurations that make the timed-automata cardiac model exhibit the same invariants (i.e., activation rate) as the differential equation heart model. Thus, the results were promising and our conclusion is that our approach can be used as a semi-automated approach for performing model alignment.  We developed a web-based tool that provides high-level overviews of the analysis results and features for drilling down on specific behaviors. The user can filter the invariants by specific properties and can visualize the relationships of the invariants as state diagrams.

MT is useful when it is difficult to specify the expected result for a certain test case. The results show that MT can detect deviations in behavior that can cause unsafe situations.  As a summary, the project has reached its goals and the resulting tool-supported methods can be used to facilitate the understanding, analysis, and testing of models of CPSs.
