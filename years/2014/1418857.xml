<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Marcus Langseth, a 235? Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic capabilities. The vessel is owned by NSF and operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University under a cooperative agreement. The Langseth is different than other vessels in the Academic Fleet in that it is a designated National Facility. It provides a unique combination of capabilities for imaging the oceans, the seafloor and the solid earth beneath the sea. It is the only vessel in the word dedicated to academic research that is capable of conducting 3D seismic surveys as well as extended offset 2D surveys. The tuned, linear source array, consisting of up to 36 air-guns, with a total capacity of 6,600 cu in is also unique asset of this vessel. &lt;br/&gt;In 2013, R/V Langseth completed 186 days, 100% of which were NSF funded. In 2014, the schedule shows 139 days, 82% (114 days) of which are NSF funded. Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt; 1) Focal Technologies 32-channel slip rings $47,952 &lt;br/&gt; 2) Geometrics 882 magnetometer $20,724 &lt;br/&gt; 3) Langseth serial/Ethernet network upgrade $35,171 &lt;br/&gt;  $103,847 &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The  2014 Ocean Instrumentation award is a competitive one that funds science equipment to vessels that carryout science projects for the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The R/V Marcus G. Langseth is a NSF owned vessel that is operated by Columbia University.  This award targeted 3 specific items for upgrade or replacement onboard the vessel.  This funding allowed us to make improvements to the  IT equipment and, specifically,  data storage and networking.  Due to the large volumes of data generated by our marine seismic projects that create acoustic images of the subseafloor, it's critical that we have the ability to move terabytes of data efficiently.  The award funded replacement of a towed Geometrics 882 magnetometer that had been lost at sea on a previous project and give us the necessary at sea redundancy.   Magnetometers allow us to look at specific geophysical properties of oceanic crust that can tell us things like the age of that portion of the seafloor.  Lastly, the award allowed us to upgrade bandwidth and capability of our slip rings which connect our towed seismic equipment to onboard cabling and laboratories.  This also provides additional channels for flexibility in case of repairs at sea are necessary.  All of this equipment provides critical improvements in our shipboard science equipment.
