<AbstractNarration>Insider attacks present an extremely serious, pervasive and costly security problem under critical domains such as national defense and financial and banking sector. Accurate insider threat detection has proved to be a very challenging problem.  This project explores detecting insider threats in a banking environment by analyzing database searches.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                   &lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the challenge by formulating and devising machine learning-based solutions to the insider attack problem on relational database management systems (RDBMS), which are ubiquitous and are highly susceptible to insider attacks. In particular, the research uses a new general model for database provenance, which captures both the data values accessed or modified by a user's activity and summarizes the computational path and the underlying relationship between those data values. The provenance model leads naturally to a way to model user activities by labeled hypergraph distributions and by a Markov network whose factors represent the data relationships. The key tradeoff being studied theoretically is between the expressivity and the complexity of the provenance model.  The research results are validated and evaluated by intimately collaborating with a large financial institution to build a prototype insider threat detection engine operating on its existing operational RDBMS.  In particular, with the help of the security team from the financial institution, the research team addresses database performance, learning scalability, and software tool development issues arising during the evaluation and deployment of the system. Research results are reported via technical papers and disseminated through conferences and journals, through a new research webpage at the UB's NSA- and DHS-certified center of excellence (CAE) in Information Assurance, and at the center's future workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project is to formulate and devise machine learning based solutions on large-scale relational database management systems to learn about user regular patterns and to detect anomalous behaviors. This project lies in the intersection of two fields that play fundamental roles in the rise of data science: relational database systems are the workhorse for storing and manipulating industrial-scale data, while statistical machine learning methods provide the tools required for extracting non-trivial and useful information from the data in an efficient way.

Intellectual contributions.  The project has resulted in a number of contributions, which can be described in terms of statistical modeling, inference algorithms and underlying theory. Another outcome of the project is the emergence of a new research area, namely in-database statistical learning, which straddles both fields of database and statistical machine learning. Project members and their research collaborators are key contributors to this burgeoning area.  In terms of statistical modeling we developed hierarchical/mixture models which are particularly suitable for capturing heterogeneous/anomalous patterns within complex, multi-level grouped settings (within-user querries patterns, and between-users patterns). We also studied and contributed to the Gaussian processes literature which provides a suitable set of tools for learning and detection of temporal and spatial changes.   A large array of contributions centers on fast and accurate learning and inference methods for the aforementioned modeling framework. We introduced geometric Dirichlet means algorithm for topic models, stochastic variational inference techniques for Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical models, which allow model fitting to be achieved with millions of high-dimensional data (e.g., millions of documents). We have extended the geometric approach to address nonparametric topic modeling suitable for topic/trend discovery. For Gaussian processes, we analyzed and extended a family of covariance estimation method known as the inversion-free algorithms and developed change point detection algorithms based on this technique.

Our methods outperform some of the best tools in the field, such as TensorFlow and variational inference, on several large scale applications.     The contributions described above have been published at a number of top venues in machine learning, statistics and database systems.   Broader impacts.  The fast and accurate geometric algorithms developed for topic modeling have the potential to help scale up topic models to very large scale data, potentially changing how this popular tool can be used in a vast ranges of data science applications (from information retrieval to computational biology to social sciences). The inversion-free algorithm for Gaussian random fields and anomaly detection may help to broaden the applicability of this important class of methods in spatial statistics.  The development of in-database machine learning represents an exciting marriage of several technical fields of databases and statistical inference.
