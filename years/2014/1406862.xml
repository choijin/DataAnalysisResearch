<AbstractNarration>Each year, billions of animals migrate long distances to track seasonal resources. In some cases, these migrations promote healthy populations by reducing levels of infectious disease. This occurs if infected animals are weeded out of the population during strenuous journeys or if migration allows animals to escape contaminated habitats for part of the year. In recent decades, some animals have stopped migrating, instead forming sedentary populations that breed year-round and leading to greater opportunities for harmful pathogens to take hold of populations. For example, all monarch butterflies in eastern North America once migrated to Mexico every fall, but some monarchs now remain year-round in the southern U.S., where they breed on exotic species of milkweed. These sedentary (non-migratory) monarchs face greater infection risk from a tiny parasite. This project examines whether these sedentary monarchs pose risks for migratory monarchs by acting as sources of infection or by causing more of them to abandon migration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important because changes in animal migration can alter infectious disease levels in wildlife and may influence the transmission of pathogens between wildlife and humans. As diverse species around the globe undergo dramatic changes in migrations, understanding the ecological consequences of these changes will be valuable for wildlife and human health. This project will engage the public to help investigate this problem. Since 2006, hundreds of volunteers across North America have sampled monarchs for parasite infection through the citizen science program Monarch Health. With the support of this grant, Monarch Health will recruit new volunteers to conduct capture-mark-recapture surveys and will produce an online video to highlight how citizen scientists enhance ecological knowledge. Finally, this project has the potential to contribute to monarch conservation by elucidating how the planting of exotic milkweeds affects monarchs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research has two goals:  (1) To determine whether sedentary populations of monarchs somehow cause migrating individuals -- particularly infected ones -- to stop migrating, and (2) to determine whether sedentary populations act as sources of infection for migratory populations. Earlier work showed that sedentary monarch populations in the southern U.S. suffer extremely high prevalence of protozoan infection. To accomplish the first goal, wild monarchs will be collected in the southern U.S. during fall migration and chemically analyzed to distinguish migratory from sedentary individuals. These data will be used to test whether infected migrants are more likely than healthy migrants to stop migrating. To accomplish the second goal, field sampling of monarchs will be done in the spring to distinguish sedentary monarchs from migratory monarchs re-colonizing the U.S. from their Mexican wintering grounds, and to quantify the extent of spatial overlap between these groups. Infections in larval monarchs at these same sites will be monitored to evaluate the potential for sedentary individuals to transmit pathogens to migratory individuals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Each year, billions of animals around the world undertake long-distance migrations to track resources or favorable climates. These seasonal journeys can have profound ecological consequences, including for infectious disease. Although some migratory animals can spread pathogens long distances, for many species, migration actually lowers infectious disease levels. This occurs when migratory animals escape from habitats where pathogens have accumulated or when infected animals die during strenuous journeys. Many migrations are now declining or shifting in response to human activities such as food supplementation, barriers to movement, and climate change. Some migratory animals have responded to environmental changes by foregoing migration altogether, and instead form sedentary populations that reside year-round in the same location. This loss of migration can lead to high rates of infection in these populations. In some cases, migrants can encounter sedentary animals during their annual journeys between breeding and wintering grounds. This leads to an important question: Do sedentary populations present a risk to migratory animals attempting to continue their journeys? This project focused on North American monarch butterflies and their protozoan parasites as a model system to ask (1) whether sedentary populations encourage fall migrants to stop migrating and (2) whether sedentary populations act as sources of pathogen infection for migrants during the spring migration.</p> <p>This grant supported field studies and laboratory analyses of wild monarchs sampled in Texas during fall and spring migration. Our study confirmed that some fall migratory monarchs encounter sedentary monarchs while <em>en route</em> to their Mexican overwintering habitat. In October-November, migratory monarchs in coastal Texas mixed with resident butterflies that breed continuously on exotic tropical milkweed plants (which unlike native milkweeds, can grow year-round). Milkweed plants are a necessary food for monarch caterpillars, and without it, breeding cannot occur. Most migrants in our study quickly traveled though sedentary locations, but a small number halted migration and remained at these sites. Moreover, migratory monarchs sampled at sedentary sites were three times more likely to be reproductive &ndash; typically associated with a non-migratory state &ndash; compared to migrants sampled at other sites (without year-round milkweed). This could occur because the sedentary sites either attracted migrating butterflies that were already reproductive (as some occasionally are) or because the sedentary sites induced reproductive development in migratory monarchs, making the butterflies unlikely to complete migration. Migrants sampled at sedentary sites also showed a higher likelihood of having protozoan parasite spores on their bodies than those sampled at sites without year-round milkweed. This is most likely because 95% of sedentary monarchs were heavily infected with the protozoan. Transfer of parasites from sedentary monarchs could expose the offspring of migrants to infection. Altogether, our results suggest that coastal sites with year-round monarch breeding, as supported by exotic milkweed, will raise infection risk for migrants&rsquo; offspring and could impede migration for a small fraction of migratory monarchs. This work suggests that native milkweeds that grow seasonally (rather than exotic milkweeds that grow year-round) could better support monarch health and migration.</p> <p>This project provided opportunities for student training as well as public engagement. Eight undergraduate students assisted with this work at the University of Georgia, University of Guelph, and University of Houston. The students supported field work, monarch rearing in the laboratory, and chemical analyses to distinguish monarchs as resident or migrant. These research experiences will help the students advance their careers in biological research and medicine. Graduate student Dara Satterfield also received valuable training that will support her future work related to migration ecology. Satterfield presented project findings at four scientific meetings and in a manuscript to be submitted to a scientific journal.</p> <p>This work on monarch butterflies engaged the public in several ways. First, field research was supported by six citizen scientists as well as a class of middle-school-age students. Satterfield worked with volunteers in San Antonio, Houston, and Port Lavaca, TX to capture, assess, and care for wild monarchs. At The Monarch School in Houston, students assisted with a capture-mark-recapture survey. Second, Satterfield and Altizer led numerous outreach events and presentations about monarch migration and health during the project. The researchers gave presentations for public audiences in Atlanta, Athens, and Savannah, GA and Houston, TX. Third, this work resulted in several products for the public, including the updated website about the citizen science project (monarchparasites.org), a video about this program created by an undergraduate student, and brochures and posters highlighting monarchs, parasites, and citizen scientists. Finally, this work resulted in recommendations to the public about how to improve monarch habitat and support monarch health by planting native milkweed species. Native milkweeds do not lead to the year-round monarch breeding and high levels of disease associated with exotic milkweeds. The researchers communicated the message to &ldquo;plant native milkweeds to keep monarchs healthy&rdquo; through social media, news articles, a webinar, and a blog post.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Dara&nbsp;A&nbsp;Satterfield</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1406862/1406862_10302391_1483053480048_migrants--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1406862/1406862_10302391_1483053480048_migrants--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Migratory monarchs on frostweed"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1406862/1406862_10302391_1483053480048_migrants--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Migratory monarchs on frostweed"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">During fall migration, most monarchs are in a non-reproductive state which allows them to conserve energy for the strenuous journey.
