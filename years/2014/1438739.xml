<AbstractNarration>Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is a critical conceptual tool for distinguishing effective from ineffective teaching, but difficulty measuring it has resulted in minimal application of the concept to enhance actual teaching practice. This project will apply computerized lexical analysis techniques to develop an efficient, valid and reliable measure of science teacher PCK - the type of teacher knowledge that bridges content knowledge and how to effectively teach the content in classrooms. This project will transform an instrument used in multiple NSF STEM projects, but which is limited by being time and resource intensive to score. Application of recent developments in lexical analysis will allow measurement of PCK to be taken to scale with rapid feedback, and will be a vital resource for STEM researchers, evaluators, PD providers, teacher educators, and teachers themselves. This collaborative research project brings together two teams with unique yet complementary expertise. BSCS researchers have experience measuring PCK in multiple federal projects, and recently led an international summit on STEM PCK. The Michigan State University Automated Analysis of Constructed Response research group is working across STEM disciplines to refine approaches to using lexical analysis for formative educational purposes. Broader impacts of this project include developing a measure that will be invaluable to multiple stakeholders in evaluating and enhancing the understandings and abilities of K-12 science teachers. Enhancing the capacity of K-12 teachers will help increase the numbers of underrepresented students who pursue STEM careers, as well as expand the STEM workforce and increase general scientific literacy.</AbstractNarration>

After initial work to explore and define the PCK construct, we focused our work on two key categories of PCK &ndash; the teacher’s ability to identify and analyze student thinking around science ideas (Student Thinking), and their ability to reveal and respond to student’s ideas (Responsive Teaching).

When comparing the computer predicted scores to expert assigned scores on the teacher responses, the model displayed an accuracy &gt; 90% and a Cohen’s kappa &gt;0.80.

For the Observation sub-score we were able to develop a model with Cohen’s kappa = 0.71; for the Reason sub-score we were able to develop a model with a low Cohen’s kappa = 0.49. This scoring model consistently underpredicted Reasoning in teacher’s responses.    This difference between model performance in Student Thinking and Responsive Teaching is likely due to differences in teacher writing about these ideas. Since we were able to build a single scoring model to detect occurrences when teachers identified Student Thinking in their responses, this may suggest that there is more common text used in these responses about student thinking, which is largely independent of the video scenario the teacher watches to develop a response.  Conversely, the difficulty for the machine learning models to "learn" how to identify ideas about Responsive Teaching and more specifically, the Reasoning sub-score, may mean these ideas are more context dependent based on the video scenario, or that ideas categorized as Reasoning are written by teachers in a variety of ways in their responses.
