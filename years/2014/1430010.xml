<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides for travel of participants of the 2014 CPS Workshop on Medical Frontiers in Research.  The workshop is bringing together multi-disciplinary experts from industry, academia, and government to discuss future CPS research challenges in this space.  The participants are expert in the foundational science, engineering, and technology underlying next-generation cyber-physical systems, particularly in the context of the application domain of medicine, including medical devices.  Through sessions on CPS research in sensing, diagnosis, and prosthetics, the attendees are defining a compelling research agenda in an area of scientific, technical, and engineering exploration that has tremendous societal impact.</AbstractNarration>

This project was closely overseen by NSF CPS Program Director Dr. David Corman, and the PI is very grateful for his support.  The workshop took place February 6-7, 2014 at the Waterview <br />Conference Center in Arlington, VA, and brought together <br />multi-disciplinary experts from industry, academia, and government to <br />discuss future CPS research challenges in this space.  The participants <br />were experts in the foundational science, engineering, and technology <br />underlying next-generation cyber-physical systems, particularly in the application domain of medicine, including medical devices.  The workshop featured three tracks: Monitoring and Diagnosis; Modeling, Verification and Trustworthiness; and Intervention, Control and Prosthetics.  Each track comprised three 20-min Invited Plenary Talks, three Short 5-min Presentations on Highlighted Whitepapers, four 7-min Breakout Report topic discussions, and one 30-min general discussion period.  With this structure in place, the workshop attendees were able to define a compelling research agenda in an area of scientific, technical, and engineering exploration with significant potential societal impact.  A key outcome of the project was the Workshop Web Site hosted at  https://cps-vo.org/group/2014MedicalCPSWkshp.  The web site contains a wide array of information about the 2014 NSF Medical CPS Workshop, including the agenda, speaker bios, presentations, registrants list, and the workshop final report.  The PIs are grateful to Frankie King, School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, for developing and managing the project web site and for her support in organizing the workshop.  Track 1: Monitoring and Diagnosis  This track focused on problems related to data collection and usage in medical CPS.  Monitoring is a two-fold problem in this field: precise information is needed, but the sheer amount of available data can often "drown out" what is needed in the given moment.  We must use CPS solutions both to improve monitoring, and use discovered data in an intelligent manner to help with diagnosis.  This track featured the following plenary talks:  Wearable Sensor Systems for Long-Term Health and Environmental Monitoring, Veena Misra, NCSU.  This talk focused on the use of nanotechnology to build a new class of sensors.  These devices push the boundaries of modern wearable technologies by cutting power costs and traditional rigidity while offering innovative new solutions in energy harvesting.  How a Wealth of Information Begets a Poverty of Attention: The Special Case of Data Overload in the ICU, J. Perren Cobb, M.D., Director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Critical Care Center.  This talk focused on arising problems in the ICU from an over-abundance of data.  Track 2: Modeling, Verification and Trustworthiness  This track focused on the problem of defining trustworthiness in  Medical CPS models and systems, and how to build models that are realistic enough that their verification results are useful.  If featured the following plenary talks.  Trustworthy Health and Wellness, David Kotz, Institute for Security, Technology, and Society, Dartmouth College.  This talk addressed the issues of authentication, privacy, trustworthy control, and accountability in a mobile-rich and cloud-rich environment.  These issues are critical in the healthcare domain, but the solutions are applicable to other domains.  Patient Safety Challenges for Medical Device Innovation, Julian Goldman, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. This talk addressed the problem of when a medical-device-related adverse event occurs, it is often difficult or impossible to identify the root cause of the failure.  A Patient-Controlled Analgesia system was used as a case study.  Track 3: Intervention, Control and Prosthetics  This track focused on robotic and networked medical solutions, preventing attacks and outbreaks through constant monitoring, as well as new, advanced prosthetics.  It featured two plenary talks.  Moving Beyond Current Approaches to a Broader View of Epilepsy Monitoring, Steven Schater, Center for Integration of Medicine &amp;  Innovative Technology.  This talk focused on in-home monitoring with video-EEG; and needs unmet by current approaches and emerging technologies to surpass them.  Implantable Networks of Wireless Nanoelectronic Devices, Pedro Irazoqui, Center for Implantable Devices, Purdue University.  This talk focused on physically distributed networks of nanoscale wireless sensors for  glaucoma IOP monitoring, seizure detection, prosthetic arm control), and heart failure warning.  Such systems require a network of implantable wireless devices, CMOS compatible nano-biosensors, packaging, and energy harvesting.   </pre><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/16/2017<br>      Modified by: Scott&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smolka</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
