<AbstractNarration>The Pacific Coast Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (PCUMC) is a one-day conference specifically for undergraduate math students in the Southern California region. The conference is held annually each spring at rotating institutions in Southern California and will be held at California Polytechnic State University at Pomona on March 9, 2013. The conference has been designed so that all sessions and keynote addresses are accessible to undergraduates and that panel discussion topics would be of particular interest to math majors and students in math-related fields. The key components of each conference are (1) student talks in all fields of mathematics, (2) panel discussions on career opportunities, summer opportunities and/or graduate programs in mathematics, and (3)lively, accessible keynote addresses by reputable professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference organizers strive to attract student participants and speakers at all levels and provide them with valuable information about professional opportunities in mathematics. By designing some of the student sessions specifically for first or second year students, the organizers hope to encourage more freshmen and sophomore math students to attend the conference and participate in the sessions. Students can present on everything from results of original research to purely expository work. The conference organizers have also been extremely successful in encouraging the participation of women and underrepresented minorities. Through participant tracking, we expect to see that the PCUMC students are positively impacted in their mathematical career trajectories, including likelihood to consider graduate school, increased participation in extracurricular mathematics opportunities and success in finding mathematical employment.  There is a national need for more well trained mathematicians, and the PCUMC is designed to play a role in encouraging bright mathematics students early to persist in and expand their mathematical studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The Pacific Coast Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (PCUMC) has been held annually for the past nine years, most recently on March 8th, 2014 at Pepperdine University.  The goals of the conference are:  To provide a forum for undergraduates at all levels to learn more about the opportunities available to math majors both during and after college. To encourage the participation of undergraduates at all levels, including freshmen and sophomores. To give students the opportunity to share undergraduate research projects and expository mathematics through student talk sessions.   The 2014 edition of the conference featured 63 student speakers in two sessions of student talks, a panel discussion on "Career Opportunities for Math Majors" and a keynote address on "How Math Drives Innovation in Google Search" given by Bill Richoux, senior statistician at Google.  In total, the 2014 conference attracted 618 participants, 526 of which were undergraduate students.  Of the participants who stated gender, 279 (46%) were female and 330 (54%) were male.  Of the participants who stated ethnicity, 171 (28%) were Latino/a or Hispanic, 22 (4%) were Black or African American, 5 (1%) were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 126 (21%) were Asian, 38 (6%) were more than one race and 21 (3%) declined to state.     The PCUMC is a one-day conference specifically for undergraduate math students in the Southern California region.  The conference has been designed so that all sessions and keynote addresses are accessible to undergraduates.  The key components of the conference, listed in order of our priorities as organizers, have been (1) student talks, (2) panel discussions on career opportunities in mathematics, and (3) entertaining, accessible keynote addresses by reputable professionals.  We strive to attract student participants and speakers at all levels, and from diverse backgrounds, and provide them with valuable information about professional opportunities in mathematics.  By designing some of our student sessions specifically for first or second year students, we hope to encourage more freshmen and sophomore math students to attend our conference and participate in the sessions.  We have also been extremely successful in encouraging the participation of women and underrepresented minorities.      The broader impact of this conference includes providing presentation and networking opportunities for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and with a variety of mathematical interests and post-baccalaureate goals.  The conference also develops future members of the mathematical community by providing mathematical role models for the participants via a diverse group of panelists and keynote speakers.  To assess how the conference has impacted students, we sent a follow-up survey to the 526 student participants roughly 8 months after the conference.  We had 112 students take the survey (21.3% response rate).  Of the respondents, 23% had previously attended PCUMC, 94% said they would attend PCUMC again and 99% indicated that they would recommend attending PCUMC to other math students.  When asked how attending PCUMC had impacted them, 78% indicated that they now want to attend another math conference while 68% said that they knew more about career options for math majors.  Finally, when asked to rate their experience at PCUMC 2014, 94% said they had a good or great experience.        The intellectual merit of this conference includes introducing undergraduates to new mathematics via the sharing of undergraduate research results during the student talks.  Moreover, the keynote speakers from academia and industry provide participants with exposure to current questions in theoretical mathematics and applications of mathematical research, respectively.  In the follow-up survey regarding the conference, 49% of respondents said "I want to take more math classes", 46% said "I am interested in preparing a talk to give at a future math conference" and 3...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
