<AbstractNarration>Flow and transport in porous media arise from a wide variety of real world problems such as oil recovery, groundwater contaminant remediation, CO2 sequestration, wildfire, magma transport through the Earth crust, and viral protein trafficking inside host cells.  All these problems have tremendous economic, environmental, medical, and social significance.  Mathematical modeling and computer simulations will provide efficient and inexpensive tools to enhance our abilities in understanding, predicting, and controlling the aforementioned problems.  Scientific challenges abound in the modeling and simulations of flow and transport, due to the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the media, multiple spatial and temporal scales, and uncertainty in these processes.  This research project aims at developing a new class of efficient and robust numerical methods for coupled flow and transport problems.  These methods will be implemented as computer software modules that can be used for a broad range of scientific computing tasks.  This project will also provide hands-on training opportunities for graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project focuses on development of novel finite element methods for solving coupled flow and transport problems in porous media.  This will be accomplished by combining the weak Galerkin (WG) and Eulerian-Lagrangian approaches.  The WG approach establishes a new type of approximations of differential operators by using degrees of freedom in element interiors as well as those on mesh skeleton.  WG finite element schemes could offer preferred features such as local conservation and symmetric positive-definite discrete linear systems.  The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach efficiently utilizes the flow information and produces small temporal truncation errors.  This enables robust long-time simulations of transport problems.  By incorporating these two approaches, the PI and collaborators will design, analyze, and implement a family of new finite element methods for solving the Darcy equation, convection-dominated transport equations, the miscible displacement problem, and two-phase flow problems.  These new methods overcome disadvantages of existing methods but maintain those well-received advantages, for example, local conservation.  Software modules (a Matlab toolbox and C++ libraries based on PETSc) will be developed to put these new methods into practical uses.  PhD students will be trained through this project to gain integrated capabilities of mathematical modeling and algorithm development for challenging real world problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project aims at developing novel mathematical methods for challening problems in modeling flow and transport in porous media, which arise from a wide variety of real world problems such as oil recovery,  groundwater contaminant remediation, CO2 sequestration, wildfire, magma  transport through the Earth crust, and viral protein trafficking inside  host cells.  All these problems have tremendous economic, environmental,  medical, and social significance.     The PI, along with collaborators and his graduate students, have developed a set of new numerical methods for the major problems in porous-medium flow and transport, e.g., the Darcy equation, two-phase models for subsurface flow, and poroelasticity.  These novel methods have proven to be robust and efficient in handling anisotropy and heterogeneity in these problems.      This project has produced  -- Ten original research papers (seven journal papers and three conference papers);  -- Two software packages: DarcyLite (in Matlab) and Darcy+ (in C++).  Both are intended for efficient numerical simulations of flow and transport in porous media.  The former emphasizes ease of use, the latter focuses on efficiency for large-scale problems.  Both packages are posted on the PI's webpage for free download..      This project has provided hands-on training opportunities to graduate students and undergraduate students.  Several students have participated in various stages: model setup, analysis of the proposed novel numerical methods, code development, and numerical simulations.  Two master theses and one Ph.D. thesis have been produced from this project.      The novel mathematical methods and open-access code modules resulted from this research project are being adopted and tested by researchers and graduate students in US and other countries, especially by those working in geosciences.  Our novel numerical methods have the potentials in providing efficient and robust computer simulations for a broad range of real world problems.
