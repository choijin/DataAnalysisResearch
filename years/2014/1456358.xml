<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to allow for more energy efficient surface treatment, more consistency in surface treatment processes, reduced scrap rates in manufacturing and more reliable bonded and coated structures.  This in turn will reduce barriers to adoption of these inherently efficient manufacturing methods.  Markets that have expressed keen interest in the proposed sensor technology include automotive OEM?s and their suppliers, major airframers and their suppliers, and manufacturers of general purpose surface treatment equipment.  Other major markets include manufacturers of medical devices, consumer and industrial electronics, and food packaging.  The theoretical and practical knowledge gained through this work will advance the ability to apply these principles to create robust surface free energy sensors. This understanding is critical for controlling many processes that depend on wetting phenomena, including printing, adhesive bonding, painting, rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing, application of agricultural chemicals, and aircraft deicing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address the needs engendered by the current environmentally mandated shift from solvent-based adhesives and coatings to water-borne systems, which has made the control of surface treatment extremely critical. Currently, surface treatment processes are performed without feedback control.  The quality of surface treatment is determined by expensive destructive testing.  The proposed sensor is based on ultra rapid determination of the equilibrium shape of a miniscule drop of a probe liquid on the surface in question, a parameter directly related to the Gibbs free energy of the surface. The research objectives are to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationship between ballistic deposition parameters of small liquid drops, the morphology and energetics of a substrate surface, and the equilibrium drop geometry, and utilize this knowledge to design and construct prototype closed loop control surface processing equipment. This understanding will be developed primarily through high-speed imaging of the interaction of growing droplets with surfaces of various chemical composition and morphology.  This knowledge will be incorporated into the design and construction of prototype surface processing equipment that includes closed loop feedback for precise control and verification of surface free energy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BTG Labs embarked on project with the primary goal of developing an automated free surface energy sensor that provided real time process feedback to cleaning and/or surface functionalization processes.  Working towards this goal required the in-depth analysis and tackling of many new challenges. The ballistic deposition and analysis of the small liquid drops utilized within the system had to be extremely precise and reliable for use in an automated system.  Also, the overall solution had to be packaged, priced, and provide data with the appropriate speed and formatting to be beneficial and viable as a marketable product.  Within the Automotive, medical, and especially the electronics industry, all of which BTG Labs believes this product will be very successful, it is understood that some of the areas of interest for interrogation could be less than 10mm in size.  This made understanding and maintaining the relationship between the inspection sensor a critical aspect of a successful product.    Through this award BTG Labs was able to develop solutions to these and many other challenges that arose throughout the project.  These efforts lead to two patentable solutions that improved the systems ability to detect and correct for volumetric and velocity variations that may occur within the deposition process.   The final outcome resulted in an automated solution being developed and sold to a company manufacturing life science tools and systems, and we now have multiple newsales opportunities in the pipeline from medical, automotive, and electronics industries.  The BTG Labs automated system can be deployed as an offline testing station or as an inline critical control point, providing process data that allows for significant improvement in overall quality and efficiency.   BTG Labs fast, easy, and accurate surface analyst solutions have taken on a whole new level now that it can be integrated with a wide range of robotic solutions, provide real time feedback to multiple levels and kinds of supervisory control systems, and provide complete hands-free operation.
