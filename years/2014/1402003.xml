<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Sam Raskin is "Factorization Categories in the Geometric Langlands Correspondence." The host institution for the fellowship is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Roman Bezrukavnikov.</AbstractNarration>

Throughout the subsequent century, a number of similar, increasingly complicated reciprocity laws were found. These results found eventually found their home in the theory of class fields, due to Kronecker, Weber, Hilbert and Takagi.

These non-abelian reciprocity laws found their ultimate form in Langlands's conjectures, which have since proved to be a cornerstone of number theory and representation theory.

The theory, now called geometric Langlands, has since found connections to infinite-dimensional representation theory and mathematical physics.  My NSF proposal concerned an extension of local geometric Langlands to the setting of factorization categories, in which local points of a curve are allowed to vary and collide.
