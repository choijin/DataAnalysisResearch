<AbstractNarration>An international conference on "Stratified spaces in geometric and computational topology and physics" will be held at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, WI, during March 30 - April 2, 2015. This award provides support for participant travel. The event will bring together researchers and students interested in the topological study of singular algebraic varieties, topological data analysis, and interactions between knot theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. Th conference, intended to disseminate recent developments, will also have a significant educational component, featuring introductory lectures at a level accessible to graduate students, as well as discussion sessions to strengthen connections among the various research groups represented. Moreover, the conference aims to provide an opportunity for junior researchers, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students to broaden their perspective and create research ties with more senior members in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference program will include the following topics, each driven by recent and fundamental advances: (1) Codimension two embedding theory and hypersurface singularities; (2) Topology of stratified maps;  (3) Hodge-theoretic aspects of singularities; (4) Characteristic classes of singular varieties; (5) Singular spaces in mathematical physics; (6) Stratified spaces in computational topology. The proposed topics intersect a broad range of research endeavors in fields ranging from pure mathematics to more applied areas, thus conference participants will reflect a broad cross-section of mathematical disciplines. In recent decades, the basic tools involved in the study of singular stratified spaces have branched out into a myriad of mathematical territories, and it increasingly becomes important to provide an opportunity such as this conference for experts in the various related specializations to interact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more details about the conference, please see: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.wisc.edu/~maxim/Sing15.html</AbstractNarration>
