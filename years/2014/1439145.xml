<AbstractNarration>Future exascale computing systems will be available to study important,&lt;br/&gt;compute-intensive applications such as multi-physics multi-scale natural&lt;br/&gt;phenomena and engineering systems typically modeled accurately by partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations (PDEs).Â  A prime example is turbulence at high Reynolds&lt;br/&gt;numbers, typically found in natural and engineering systems, which comprise an&lt;br/&gt;extremely wide range of spatial and temporal scales and has thus became a Grand&lt;br/&gt;Challenge in scientific computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many challenges exists that must be overcome before exascale systems&lt;br/&gt;can be utilized effectively. These include communication between&lt;br/&gt;processing elements as well as global synchronizations both of which will&lt;br/&gt;likely be a main bottleneck when millions of billions of processing elements&lt;br/&gt;are utilized in a simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PIs develop novel exascale numerical schemes for PDEs,&lt;br/&gt;especially those describing turbulent flows, that exploit asynchrony from the mathematical to&lt;br/&gt;the software level. These are based on widely used finite differences, compact differentiation and spectral schemes.&lt;br/&gt;Asynchrony offers better performance but also introduces errors in the solution. The new schemes will&lt;br/&gt;be able to trade-off accuracy and performance in a quantitative and predictable manner.&lt;br/&gt;The approach includes (i) rigorous mathematical studies of stability and&lt;br/&gt;accuracy based on numerical analysis and dynamical systems, which will also&lt;br/&gt;provide a framework for the development of new schemes and quantify its&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty, (ii) development of specific elements in a scalable library for parallel&lt;br/&gt;computing to enable portable implementations on current and future machines,&lt;br/&gt;and (iii) physics based modeling of numerical perturbations in&lt;br/&gt;realistic flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools, techniques and simulation data in this project&lt;br/&gt;will be integrated in the PIs' educational efforts through graduate mentoring, undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;research and as material for courses in high-performance computing, fluid dynamics and dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;taught by the PIs.</AbstractNarration>
