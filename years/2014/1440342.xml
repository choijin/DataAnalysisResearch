<AbstractNarration>This project develops the the Coral Reef Science &amp; Cyberinfrastructure Network (CReSCyNT). As ecosystem engineers, corals provide the nutritional, economic, and structural basis of ecosystems worth billions of dollars annually. The broader impacts that CReSCyNT encompasses include: (i) integration and exchange with professional societies, (ii) development of visualization products in collaboration with educators and resource managers, (iii) connecting place-based collaborative networks, (iv) building a collaborative community in the coral reef discipline, (v) training of two graduate students, (vi) broad transfer of disciplinary expertise among geoscientists, cybertechnologists, medical scientists and graphic artists (media), (vii) raises visibility and awareness of coral reef data in the geosciences, and (viii) user-friendly web-based visualization tools accessible to the public that serve to showcase the value of coral reef science and the innovative approaches employed by the EarthCube program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coral reef community has exceptionally diverse data structures and analysis requirements necessary to forward integrative science. It is therefore an exemplar for cyberinfrastructure-enabled advances to other geosciences communities. CReSCyNT will grow a multi-tiered and multidisciplinary network of coral reef researchers, cyberinfrastructure specialists, and computer scientists with the end goal of facilitating integrative and interactive research. This network will match the data sources, data structures, and analysis needs of the coral reef community with the current advances in data management, visualization, and image processing from ocean sciences, biomedical research, and graphic arts to advance coral reef research and meet the increasing challenges of coastal conservation. The network will assemble and communicate to coordinate, plan, and prioritize cyberinfrastructure needs within the coral reef community and with the broader geosciences. Our objectives are to collectively identify needs, best practices, bottlenecks, and avenues or approaches to advance the design and ultimately the development of data management, visualization, and image processing capacity for the coral reef domain that is directly and immediately translatable to the broader geoscience community.The five-member CReSCyNT Facilitating Committee will shepherd the growth of a network around 12 coral reef disciplinary nodes and 5 technology nodes, where each node represents a sub field or discipline of coral reef science (or computer science) that is led by a recognized member of that sub discipline in advocating sharing, transparency, open dialog, creativity, and the integration of data across the geosciences. Facilitated by CReSCyNT meetings, social media, and a presence at professional society conferences, the leader of each node will invite broad participation in CReSCyNT activities from members of their sub discipline. These nodes will be allowed to expand, coalesce, or divide to meet the needs and interests of the subdisciplinary communities, while maintaining a connection to CReSCyNT through the node coordinators and ongoing network activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>The Coral Reef Science and Cyberinfrastructure Network (CRESCYNT)</strong> was proposed and formed in response to the needs identified in a prior Coral Domain EarthCube Planning workshop. The coral reef community has exceptionally diverse data structures and analysis requirements necessary to forward integrative science. It serves as an exemplar for cyberinfrastructure-enabled advances to other geosciences communities. Answering critical science questions requires multidisciplinary teams of scientists to: work together; merge complex data types at different scales of space and time; solve data sharing and interoperability challenges; and work with science, data, and technology people to create new solutions for those challenges. CRESCYNT has grown a multidisciplinary network of coral reef researchers and developed collaborations with data specialists and computer scientists to identify problems and work towards solutions in data structures, metadata standards, best practices, practical workbenches, and available tools while working toward larger cyberinfrastructure solutions. The end goal is to facilitate collaborative and integrative research in order to solve important science problems to benefit society and the planet.</p> <p><strong>In Practice: </strong>Several elements needed to come together within this Research Coordination Network to learn and prioritize scientist goals and needs, identify existing data and software solutions, understand where new solutions are needed, and prepare for those future solutions. Project work was captured at the CRESCYNT blog (http://crescyntblog.org). or website (http://crescynt.org). The project had three practical phases.</p> <p><strong>Phase 1.</strong> Early workshops held at international and national coral reef and aquatic science conferences were used to survey scientists about their needs and challenges for data, collaboration, and tools, and to educate scientists about available and upcoming tools and best practices to prepare for future capabilities. Direct online surveys were also valuable.</p> <p><strong>Phase 2.</strong> We learned in Phase 1 that the greatest challenges for coral reef scientists were <strong>(1) managing data, (2) finding data, and (3) integrating data </strong>of different types and scales. In response, Phase 2 focused on identifying and sharing tools and resources with the coral reef community to address these challenges. The goal was to increase tool use where helpful, identify remaining gaps, and accelerate cyberinfrastructure readiness for the coral reef community. We also worked with with solution providers: software developers and data managers within and outside of EarthCube. A new project, Data Discovery Studio (<a href="http://datadiscoverystudio">http://datadiscoverystudio</a>) was begun to customize a search platform for geoscientists, with CRESCYNT serving as a coral reef use case.</p> <p><strong>Phase 3.</strong> In the final phase, we focused further on identified priorities through intensive workshops.</p> <p><strong>- Data Science for Coral Reefs: Data Rescue</strong> at UCSB-NCEAS March 7-10, 2018. This workshop for coral reef scientists focused on Data Rescue as a way to teach skills in data management, data cleaning, using RStudio for reproducibility, metadata creation, and repository use.</p> <p><strong>- Data Science for Coral Reefs: Data Integration and Team Science</strong> at UCSB-NCEAS March 11-14, 2018. This workshop for coral reef scientists was focused on Data Integration as a practical exercise in managing differences in granularity and data types between disparate datasets. Training included using RStudio with GitHub for documentation, sharing, and reproducibility.</p> <p><strong>- Metadata for the Future of Coral Reef Research </strong>at UCSD-SDSC Aug 14-17, 2018. Because many data management, integration and discovery challenges come down to adequate and compatible metadata, a final workshop for coral reef data managers, metadata experts, and software engineers worked to develop a formal metadata profile for coral reef scientists.</p> <p><strong>Communication and Information Distribution.</strong> In all phases scientists and partners were informed of and encouraged to contribute to developments using multiple communication methods: disciplinary nodes where scientists could interact, coordinated by node leaders; a website (<a href="http://crescynt.org">http://crescynt.org</a>) at EarthCube (<a href="http://earthcube.org">http://earthcube.org</a>); email listservs for CRESCYNT &nbsp;members and the larger coral reef community; shared online docs; online meetings and webinars; a blog (<a href="http://crescyntblog.org">http://crescyntblog.org</a> or <a href="http://crescyntblog.wordpress.com">http://crescyntblog.wordpress.com</a>) to share opportunities, resources, and tools, special guest posts, and links to workshop training materials and outputs; presentations at professional meetings; and publications.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p>As ecosystem engineers, corals provide the nutritional, economic, and structural basis of ecosystems worth billions of dollars annually.
