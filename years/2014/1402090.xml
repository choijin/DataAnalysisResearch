<AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for early career scientists and graduate students to participate in the PACIFIC 2014 Symposium. This symposium will focus on the latest developments at the interface of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and on their ramifications for understanding fundamental interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be held September 15-20, 2014 at the University of California Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station, located on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. To make the symposium more accessible to the general public, the organizers have integrated a public lecture by one of the symposium speakers into the schedule.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The symposium on Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Including Fundamental  InteraCtions (PACIFIC 2014), September 15--20, 2014, focused on cutting-edge research  in the rapidly developing fields of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.   The conference was hosted at the University of California R. Gump Research Station.  Thanks to the ample new data and a plethora of theoretical ideas, the field of  astro-particle physics has become the source of excitement and discoveries.   The symposium succeeded in bringing together researchers from the United States,  as well as other countries, representing Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.    By all accounts PACIFIC 2014 conference was a great success.  It was the fourth annual meeting in the series that started in 2011.  The organizers have received a number of messages from the participants praising the scientific content and the stimulating atmosphere of the conference.  The program and the archived presentations are available from the conference website, which doubles as a repository of contributions from past meetings.  The funding provided by the National Science Foundation was used to help junior participants, such as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, attend the conference.  While the amount was modest, it enabled the young researchers to meet the travel expenses for attending this conference.
