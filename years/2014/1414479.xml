<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research of Associate Professor John T. Giblin, Jr. at Kenyon College.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Recent observational and experimental results have shed new light on the nature of high-energy particle physics and models of the early Universe.  It is clearer now than ever that the Universe is the only laboratory in which we can study fundamental physics at energies above those achievable in accelerators.  The theories that describe physics at these energies are highly non-linear, complex dynamical systems.  Professor Giblin's research will use employ cutting-edge numerical techniques as well as analytic methods to predict the observational consequences of many models of high-energy physics.  These results will help understand how current and future observations can constrain models of beyond-the-standard model physics. This research also addresses the pressing need to cultivate interest in science among young students and college undergraduates. Approximately two hundred fifty middle school students will be brought to Kenyon College for a "Science Saturday" program that will engage them with hands on science activities. Students will also get to work with scientists throughout the day offering them a positive, interactive model of scientific inquiry. This funding will also support undergraduate research and collaboration. Meaningful undergraduate research is a critical component of supporting and cultivating the next generation of young scientists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The numerical methods studied under this award will allow for the study of non-linear and derivatively coupled field theories as they relate to Inflation, Gauge theories and Gravitation. The software developed here, Grid and Bubble Evolver (GABE), will discover how abelian and non-abelian gauge fields modify inflation and post-inflationary process and probe the effects of field theories with non-minimal kinetic terms.  Further, it will be used to predict observable signatures, primordial power spectra and gravitational radiation, of these models. These studies will help to understand whether or not realistic models of inflation are viable and consistent with observations, and explore the non-minimal nature of particles as a possible explanation of the nature of Dark Energy. In addition, this award will support investigations of nonlinear gravitational interactions during phase transitions in the post-inflationary epoch and relevant numerical.  As we prepare for the next generation of gravitational wave observatories, precise predictions of gravitational wave spectra could have drastic consequences on the design and cost of these experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award "RUI: Beyond Leading Order: Using Computation to Constrain Fundamental Physics" was completed by Prof. John T. Giblin, Jr along with his students and collaborators at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.     This award extended our understanding of the contents of the Universe.  Using analytic and numerical techniques we aimed to further our understanding of how particles interact with the Universe when inhomogeneity is present.  We wrote and extended software that studies the dynamics of fundamental fields; specifically we aimed to go beyond the normal approximations that are made when confronting non-linear dynamics and use fully non-linear simulations to extract cosmological observables.      We showed that particles, similar to those found in the standard model are efficient channels through which to reheat the Universe following cosmic inflation.  This applied to particles whose symmetries were electro-magnetic-like, but also to those with symmetries identical to those found in weak-physics.  Additionally, we studied the effect of inhomogeneity and fully non-linear gravity in the expansion history of the Universe can have observational effects on Hubble diagrams, but cannot explain the apparent dimness of supernovae (i.e. Dark Energy is not just a consequence of the inhomogeneous evolution of the Universe).     In addition, this award supported undergraduate research in Cosmology at Kenyon College making it possible for 10 students to have meaningful summer experiences and for many more to engage in cosmology during the year.  It also provided the funds to run a "Saturday Science" program for middle-school students in rural Ohio. Over the course of this program, 200 middle-school students came to Kenyon each year to participate in an interactive outreach program.  These students are given the chance to interact with science and mentors in a meaningful way.          Last Modified: 12/03/2017       Submitted by: John T Giblin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
