<AbstractNarration>The 7th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) is the 7th in a series of annual international conferences concerned with developing methods for analyzing the data that come from educational settings and using those methods to better understand students and the settings in which they learn. Its Young Researcher Track brings young researchers together with senior people in the EDM community to help them broaden their perspectives on educational data and how to mine and analyze it for assessment purposes and to learn more about how people learn. Activities are designed to help prepare the next generation of cyberlearning and learning technologies researchers. This activity supports the mission of NSF to train more advanced professionals in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EDM community is unique in its synthesis and cross-fertilization of three STEM education cyberlearning-related research capacities: (1) developing methods for analysis of fine-grained educational data, (2) evaluating cutting-edge learning technologies, and (3) using insights gained from these analyses to refine theories of learning proposed in the cognitive, social, and learning sciences. The conference balances theoretical grounding, analysis of fine-grained educational data, application of the findings to design of learning environments, and rigorous evaluation of the learning environments. Young Researcher Track activities are designed to help young researchers gain a variety of perspectives on the methods and technologies involved in educational data mining and how use them to best effect; the ways in which analysis of available data can be used to inform education and design of learning technologies; and the ways such data can be used to advance understanding of processes underlying learning. NSF funding will be used to support some of the cost of travel and accommodations for advanced graduate students from US universities.</AbstractNarration>
