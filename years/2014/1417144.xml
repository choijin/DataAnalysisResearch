<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a continuous and low-cost spray-pyrolysis process for making mixed metal oxide (MMO) materials that can be used in the petroleum and chemicals synthesis, precursors for solar panels, electrode materials, fuel cells, oxygen selective membranes, and chemical sensors. Of particular interest are crystalline pyrochlore mixed metal oxides for catalyzing chemical reactions because they offer atomic dispersion of the catalytic metals and the ability to influence activity and selectivity through the control of the elemental composition. As catalysts, crystalline MMOs offer unparalleled thermal stability, resistance to poisons and lifetimes that exceed conventional supported metals. The problem has been that MMOs require a time-consuming and costly batch process for producing crystalline materials and this has limited their use to mainly niche applications. In contrast, the spray pyrolysis process uses similar solution chemistry but creates very small droplet size and high temperatures to rapidly form the crystalline materials. While the process has been applied to pure oxides, this represents the first application to MMOs. The development of a continuous and low cost process can finally unlock the potential of MMOs for new and existing applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project focuses specifically on identifying the process parameters of a continuous spray pyrolysis process that control MMO particle size, crystallinity, surface morphology, surface area and catalytic activity for certain chemical reactions. The process parameters of interest include temperature, multiple reaction zones, droplet size, flow patterns, droplet residence time and metal solution concentrations. For this project, the spray pyrolysis process will target the production of crystalline pyrochlore materials used as catalysts in the partial oxidation and reforming of hydrocarbons. These materials (synthesized in batch mode) have demonstrated superior performance for steam reforming, CO2 reforming and partial oxidation reactions important in syngas and hydrogen production, so there is an excellent baseline for comparison of performance. The project, led by Pyrochem Catalyst Company (New Brighton, PA) brings together expertise from the National Energy and Technology Labs (the original inventors of the catalyst), the University of West Virginia and the University of Louisville. Collectively, the team?s objective is to create a clear understanding of the physical and chemical attributes of the spray pyrolysis process so that it can be scaled to demonstration and ultimately commercial capacities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Summary  Until this program, mixed metal oxide powders were prepared using one of several batch processes that were time consuming, labor intensive and costly.  Pyrochem Catalyst Company (PCC) received Phase 1 and Phase 1B STTR awards to develop, demonstrate, and optimize the proof of concept for a spray pyrolysis process (SPP) to synthesize mixed transition metal oxide powers, notably crystalline pyrochlores.  The development of the SPP is a key component to the commercialization of PCCÆs pyrochlore catalysts (PyroCat&trade;), licensed from the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown, WV.   Transition metal pyrochlores have excellent activity, very low metal contents, unparalleled thermal stability, and resistance to poisons that make then ideal of the conversion of C1 &ndash; C15 hydrocarbons to hydrogen and carbon monoxide &ndash; targeting hydrogen and syngas market applications.  In collaboration with the University of Louisville and the National Energy Technology Labs (NETL), PCC tested a lab-scale system at West Virginia University that included a high pressure pump that delivered a liquid solution of chelated metal salts to an ultrasonic nozzle that generated micron size droplets to a vertical reactor furnace.   The proposed technology is based on creating very small droplets from the precursor solution, allowing them to fall by gravity through multiple temperature zones.  Water is evaporated in the first zone, gelation occurs in the second zone and the organic fraction burns off in the third zone creating the high temperature required for crystallization and formation of the pyrochlore.   After the initial proof of concept, work focused on optimization of solution concentrations, flow rates, and the temperatures of different zones in the reactor furnace.  Sample powders were typically characterized at the University of Louisville by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and surface area/pore volume.  Powders were analyzed by temperature programmed reduction and tested for catalytic activity at NETL.  Comparison of SPP synthesized powders to conventional batch-prepared powders, showed no difference in crystal structure or catalytic activity.  SPP powder surface areas and pore volumes were high, but that is expected given the small droplet size created by the spray.  Particle morphologies were also consistent with a spray generated powder.  These are exactly the desired results with proof of concept and optimization of the process parameters.  The spray pyrolysis process has become our method for production of sample quantities of catalyst that we offer for customer testing.   We can produce 100 grams per day of high quality powder, at a cost that is several orders of magnitude less than catalysts synthesized by a batch process.  With thanks to the NSF, the increased throughput and lowered cost allows us to prepare and deliver samples to all the major hydrogen producers, several solid oxide fuel cell companies, and two companies for automotive exhaust applications.
