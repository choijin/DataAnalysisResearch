<AbstractNarration>The Midwest Geometry Conference is taking place at the University of Oklahoma on January 17-18, 2015. The conference is designed to enhance both the educational and the research opportunities of the active community of mathematicians working in the field of geometry in the Midwest and the surrounding states. This award supports participation in the conference, which features a wide spectrum of research topics of current interest. The main aim is to create a focused environment, conducive to a lively exchange of ideas, in which members of this regional community can benefit from each other's ideas, and from contact with leading geometers from outside the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will highlight recent developments and new research directions in a number of areas that include: p-harmonic geometry, Lie groups and geometric representation theory, Lp cohomology and nonlinear Hodge theory, geometry and topology of submanifolds, uniqueness in analysis, geometry and topology, geometric flows, stable minimal varieties, complex and Riemannian geometry, metric and differential geometry, conformal geometry, algebraic geometry, geometric measure theory, partial differential equations, geometric function theory, several complex variables, symplectic geometry, mathematical physics, and related problems. Both well-established researchers and promising junior researchers in the field will present talks at the meeting. More information can be found on the conference web page&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.ou.edu/mgc20/</AbstractNarration>
