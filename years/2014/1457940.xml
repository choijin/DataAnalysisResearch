<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology&lt;br/&gt;Organization: Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities &lt;br/&gt;Title: HACU STEM Workforce (Conference Proposal) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1457940&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CREST Program is interested in building knowledge related to the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates in STEM disciplines of students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty from underrepresented groups, as well as the obstacles faced in promoting graduate study in STEM for students at minority-serving institutions and how these may effectively be overcome. With National Science Foundation support, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) will implement a Conference Project entitled:  HACU STEM Workforce.  The conference project will establish and convene an expert Task Force to develop policy recommendations and to identify and promote high impact practices to be implemented at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) as well as majority institutions for the development of a more diversified STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a national and international association of more than 450 colleges and universities committed to improving Hispanic success in higher education, HACU is positioned to convene such a Task Force, support its efforts, and promote both the policy recommendations and the high impact practices identified by the Task Force.  While HACU member institutions in the U.S. represent only 10% of all higher education institutions nationwide, together these institutions enroll more than two-thirds of all Hispanic college students.  HACU goals include promoting the development of member colleges and universities; improving access to and the quality of postsecondary educational opportunities for Hispanic students; and meeting the needs of business, industry and government through the development and sharing of resources, information and expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two reports will be produced as a result of the Task Force efforts, one discussing policy issues related to Hispanic STEM education and the other will highlight promising practices for creating a diverse STEM workforce. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities will publish the reports on its website, incorporate policy recommendations into its annual Legislative Agenda, and disseminate and promote high impact practices to its 450 member institutions, as well as majority institutions through its Annual Conferences and other program activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is a membership association of 470 institutions of higher education committed to improving educational access and success for Hispanic students. While Hispanics comprise 74% of those entering the U.S. workforce 2010-20, they continue to be dramatically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  HACU convened three meetings of a diverse Task Force to address the underlying causes of this challenge. The Task Force members represented a range of STEM disciplines including biology, microbiology, physiology, agricultural engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, chemical engineering, inorganic chemistry, physics, psychology, political science and education. They included college presidents, deans, and senior faculty from community colleges, regional public and private universities, and flagship research institutions.  The Task Force's final report is scheduled for release in early fall 2017 and includes recommendations for policy and practice changes at every education level from pre-K to post-graduate, with a special focus on undergraduate education.  Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), which have undergraduate enrollments at least 25% Hispanic, are seen as a critical stage in the Hispanic STEM pipeline. HSIs enroll almost two thirds of the Hispanics in U.S. higher education, but on average are less well funded and resourced than majority-serving institutions. Building STEM laboratory and research capacity at HSIs is seen as an important step in increasing Hispanic readiness for graduate education and STEM careers.  Since Hispanic students are overwhelmingly enrolled at HSIs and the strongest STEM faculty and  research capacity are found at research universities, genuine collaborations between these two cohorts of institutions are also recommended as essential to significantly increasing Hispanic graduate school opportunities in STEM.  Addressing the persistent inequity in PK-12 school funding is the single most critical public policy issue that impacts college readiness, especially in STEM disciplines, not only for Hispanic students, but also for minority students and low-income students in general.
