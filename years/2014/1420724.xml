<AbstractNarration>As science centers and children's museums re-define their roles in a society that is increasingly linguistically diverse, many seek to engage more effectively with dual language learners. Dual language learners are young children who are still in the process of acquiring basic language skills in their first language while at the same time acquiring a second language.  At present, museum professionals face the challenge of developing programs and practices in the absence of research on informal science education for this population. The Center of Science and Industry (COSI) and The Ohio State University (OSU) will collaborate to begin a systematic study of informal science education programs and practices for reaching and serving preschool dual language learners. The improvement of dual language learners' informal science learning experiences is an increasingly important part of efforts to achieve equity and diversity in participation in science. Such efforts are particularly important as this population grows in number and as the significance of early science learning experiences for later achievement becomes better understood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will begin to address the lack of research through three interconnected activities: (1) a national needs assessment of children's museums and science museums, (2) an in-person convening and quarterly virtual meet-ups with teams from eight partner museums, and (3) an exploratory study of COSI's programs and practices to support the access, participation, and learning of preschool dual language learners and their parents/caregivers. The project will yield important insights into current practices and priorities with respect to effective museum engagement with dual language learners, their families, and the early childhood professionals who serve them. The project will (1) produce a comprehensive report on the current state of the field related to providing informal science experiences for preschool dual language learners; (2) identify gaps in existing research and practice, as well as promising foci for future study and improvement and expansion of museum practice; and (3) create a full-scale Research in Service to Practice proposal and a national network of museums to implement the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the project is to advance the knowledge and awareness of needs and practices related to informal science programming for preschool children who are learning English as an additional language. The national needs assessment will be conducted by means of an online questionnaire sent to museums identified via public association lists, and questions will focus on institutional practices in relation to school readiness and the needs of preschool dual language learners and perceived gaps in services. In the convening and virtual meet-ups, the project team, local community partners, project advisers, museum association leaders, and museum partners selected for their innovative work with linguistically diverse populations will discuss partners' programs, practices and frameworks; emergent project findings; and directions for further study. The exploratory study of COSI programs and practices will entail participant observation, document analysis, and interviews and focus group conversations with stakeholders, including parents, early childhood educators, COSI team members, community organization leaders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. Its funding includes broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. An AISL Pathways grant, such as this one, allows practitioners and researchers to undertake exploratory development work that has the potential to produce evidence, findings, and/or deliverables that will form the basis of anticipated further innovative, or potentially transformative, research and development work.</AbstractNarration>

The Exploratory Study of COSI?s programs and practices related to the support of access, participation, and learning for preschool DLLs and their families. We examined the experiences and perspectives of DLLs, parents, preschool teachers, and museum professionals through participant observation, interviews, focus groups, and video-recording of interaction on the museum floor and during museum outreach in preschool classrooms.   Project outcomes included:  National Needs Assessment       Development of the survey Distribution of the survey in partnership with the Association of Science and Technology Centers and the Association of Children?s Museums, raising awareness of preschool DLLs and linguistically diverse audiences more generally. National Needs Assessment Report   Convenings       Three online convenings in which we discussed partner museums? programs, practices, and initiatives to improve and assess the science learning experiences and school readiness of DLLs; frameworks that guide partners? efforts to reach and serve preschool DLLs, and areas of difficulty in serving this population. One 2-day in-person convening that included museum partner sharing sessions, panel discussions on cultural &amp; linguistic competence and family &amp; community engagement, a presentation on language development in young DLLs, and a workshop on the play-based and inquiry-based pedagogy of Dramatic Inquiry.  Partner profiles, written reports that provide structured overviews of partner museums? programs and practices for serving dual language learners (Children?s Museum of Houston, Children?s Discovery Museum of San Jose, COSI, Long Island Children?s Museum, Marbles Kids Museum, and Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science).     Exploratory Study       Exploratory Study Report and two article-length manuscripts Three different professional development workshops for local early childhood education workforce in which strategies for hands-on, inquiry-based science are enhanced with strategies for supporting science learning and language development for DLLs.     Across the three parts of the project, five major themes emerged that may guide future research and practice:  Informal science education for preschool DLLs needs to be grounded in an understanding that language and culture are profoundly intertwined.  Science learning experiences that are hands-on, multi-modal, and do not depend heavily on language can be engaging and successful for preschool DLLs, their families, and their ECE teachers. Nonetheless, informal science educators need to recognize the centrality of language to science and science learning for all young children. The development of relationships and partnerships between informal science institutions and language minority communities is fundamental to engaging and effective informal science education for preschool DLLs and their families.  When ISIs develop relationships and partnerships with early childhood education providers like Head Start, they amplify their ability to engage effectively with and provide high-quality science experiences for preschool DLLs and families from underserved communities.  There is a need for research on informal science education for preschool DLLs, particularly in multilingual contexts, where bilingual education approaches may not apply.       The Expanding Repertoires project advances the informal education field by providing information on current programs and practices across the nation and among museum innovators in this space, as well as direction for further study and program development that will transform how informal science practitioners serve preschool dual language learners. The project contributes to the support and expansion of participation in STEM by minorities and women (who are the majority of early childhood professionals) by creating a foundation on which to build future research and interventions that will increase our understanding of and capacities for providing effective informal science education for linguistically diverse populations and professional development for the early childhood professionals who serve them.
