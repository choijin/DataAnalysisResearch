<AbstractNarration>Gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that carry information about the changing gravitational fields of distant astrophysical objects. Gravitational waves will be a radically new tool for exploring the universe. This award supports the effort to detect gravitational waves from merging neutron stars and black holes with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Black holes and neutron stars are nature's most compact objects and their collisions are a potentially transformative laboratory for fundamental physics and astrophysics. Gravitational-wave physics offers exciting opportunities to inspire and educate students of all ages, strengthening both the diversity and competitiveness of students and improving the scientific literacy of the general public.  The proposed project will continue to drive the development of scientific workflow management tools and high-throughput computing that will have broad impact across the physics community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award directly supports Advanced LIGO's effort to detect gravitational waves and to use gravitational waves as an astronomical tool to explore the Universe. This project focuses on coalescing compact binaries, with the effort dedicated towards developing, testing and using the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) deep, offline search pipeline for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence. The primary goal of this project is to detect gravitational waves and to extract the astrophysics encoded in LIGO's signals.  Engineering and science runs during the first two years of this proposal will allow the LSC to understand both the Advanced LIGO detectors and the search pipelines in an observational mode. Science runs during the second and third years of this proposal will produce astrophysical results. The first direct detection of gravitational waves could be made during the period of this award.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award directly supported the first direct detection of gravitational waves from binary black holes by Advanced LIGO, confirming a major prediction of Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity.   As two black hole collide, the ripples from this cataclysmic event propagate through spacetime at the speed of light. They?ve traveled through the Universe for more than a billion years, before reaching the Earth on September 14, 2015.  Gravitational waves stretch space, but their effect is almost imperceptible. It has taken 21st-century technology, a team of hundreds of experts, and decades of effort to detect them. This project directly contributed to this work.  As they the back holes]collided, some of their mass was converted into energy, according to Einstein?s formula E=mc2. The peak power output was about 50 times that of the light emitted by all the stars in the Universe. These are the gravitational waves that LIGO observed.   This discovery is significant for two reasons: It opens up a new way of studying the Universe, enabling scientists to infer processes at work that produce gravitational waves, and it shows that black holes work the way Einstein had predicted.  What we have built is akin to Galileo?s first telescope. We have just taken our first look at the Universe in a completely new way. There is so much to learn from gravitational waves in the coming years and likely many surprises.  Since the first detection of gravitational waves, three more binary black hole mergers have been detected, showing that the era of gravitational-wave astronomy has begun.
