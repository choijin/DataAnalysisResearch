<AbstractNarration>Life on earth is subjected to daily and seasonal variations in the timing of sunrise and sunset. To adapt to this rhythmic environment, animals, plants and microbes have evolved circadian clocks that orchestrate daily rhythms of physiology and behavior on a 24-hour basis. Although the role of circadian clocks in driving daily biological rhythms is relatively well known, their role in seasonal responses due to changes in day-length remain unclear. The proposed research aims to understand how animal circadian clocks in the brain regulate seasonal rhythms in behavior and physiology. The objective of this project is to determine the molecular mechanisms through which brain clocks regulate seasonal rhythms in the iconic long-distance migration of the North Eastern American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The studies will address a fundamental question in chronobiology and will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying photoperiodic responses and migratory behavior. This could have broader implications for the conservation of endangered migratory species, and for understanding their adaptive potential to climate change. Through this project, graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored in biological clocks research and molecular genetics. Outreach activities will be conducted with local grade and high schools to introduce students to citizen science by participating in the generation of data on monarch migration patterns and the restoration of their habitat through monarch tagging programs and the creation of new Monarch Waystations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the proposed research is to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying clock-controlled seasonal rhythms in long-distance migration of the monarch butterfly. A fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which seasonal rhythms and photoperiodic responses in animals are regulated by the circadian clock has been hampered by the lack of genomic and genetic tools in non-model species (hamster, sheep, bird) that display robust photoperiodic responses, and the lack of robust photoperiodic responses in genetically tractable animals (fly, mouse). This project will take advantage of powerful molecular, genomic and genetic tools available in the monarch to (i) examine the role of circadian clocks and clock genes in the photoperiodic induction of the migratory behavioral and physiological switch, (ii), identify clock-output genes underlying the migratory switch, and (iii) disrupt candidate genes in vivo to define their impact on migratory behavior and physiology. These experiments will yield unprecedented insight into the molecular bases of insect photoperiodic responses and the genetic program underlying migratory behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Seasonality is a widespread adaptation in nature, which is driven by changes in day-length (<em>i.e.</em>, photoperiod) in organisms living at temperate latitudes. Understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms by which photoperiodic changes are sensed and translated into seasonal changes in developmental, physiological and behavioral processes is an important question that remains poorly understood despite decades of research. This gap in knowledge is largely due to the fact that genetically tractable organisms commonly used in laboratories (<em>e.g</em>., the mouse and the fruit fly <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) do not exhibit strong seasonal behavior and physiology, and species with strong seasonal biology are often organisms that are not easily kept in the laboratory and for which genomic access is lacking. With support from this award, we established the iconic North American long-distance migratory monarch butterfly that has inspired researchers and the public alike as an emerging model system to study the molecular and genetic bases of seasonality and migration by developing cutting-edge gene targeting tools (Transcription activator-like effector nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9) that provide genomic access. Using these tools, we genetically demonstrated that clock genes, whose products are involved in a 24-hr time keeping system that synchronizes an organism&rsquo;s physiology and behavior with the environmental light:dark cycle, are necessary for monarch photoperiodic responsiveness. The use of genome-wide sequencing approaches (RNA-sequencing and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)) also allowed us to identify rhythmic genes and putative transcription factors regulating diurnal transcription rhythms in the monarch brain. Finally, we identified the vitamin A pathway as a seasonally- and clock-regulated pathway in the monarch brain, and showed that it is necessary for mediating photoperiod responsiveness in this species. Because several lines of evidence support a role of the vitamin A signaling pathway in the brain of seasonal mammals, our work may suggest an evolutionary conserved function of vitamin A in animal photoperiodic responses and establishes the monarch butterfly as one of the few animal models in which the molecular mechanisms underlying animal photoperiodic responsiveness can be genetically dissected. Ultimately, by establishing efficient strategies to genetically manipulate and probe the genome of the monarch species, our work will likely facilitate the development of functional genomics in many other non-traditional insect species that are increasingly used for tackling important biological questions in a wide range of disciplines.
