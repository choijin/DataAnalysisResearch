<AbstractNarration>Unlike the planets orbiting the sun, the electrons that whorl around the nucleus inside atoms are not allowed to do so at arbitrary distances.  Quantum theory prescribes that only very specific average distances from the nucleus are allowed.  This limitation gives rise to the specific colors of light that atoms respond to when hit with a laser beam.  By tuning the laser precisely, one can find the specific colors that are in resonance with the orbiting electron, and thereby learn about the intricate details of the internal structure of the atom.  While most atoms have many electrons, making the task of understanding the complicated pattern of orbits relatively difficult, hydrogen and helium have only one and two electrons, respectively, and hence are amenable to very precise theoretical prediction.  By comparing these very precise predictions to similarly precise measurements, one can test whether or not the theory of "quantum electrodynamics" (the fundamental theory of light, atoms, and most of the rest of the ordinary world around us) is really correct, or only approximately so.  The group supported by this grant plans to develop and deploy the laser sources and techniques that will allow improved tests of the quantum theory described above.  If the theory is found to be correct at the new level of accuracy, the results of the experiments can then be used to determine the size of the nucleus in hydrogen and helium.  A comparison of these sizes with what is known or predicted in nuclear physics will then provide a test of the scientific understanding of these simple nuclei.  In this way, these experiments bridge the gap between the atom and the nucleus, and test the consistency of two regimes of physics which differ in length scale by a factor of 10,000.  Laser sources and optical techniques are ubiquitous in science, technology and the economy, so training of students in this area provides valuable expertise, and has the potential to develop generally important laser sources and optical techniques for a wide range of applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops laser technology and precision laser techniques.  It applies them to the study of helium fine structure and the precise determination of hydrogen and helium nuclear sizes.  Optical methods are developed which involve high-speed electro-optic modulation of a stabilized semiconductor laser, creating microwave tunable frequency side bands on the laser.  These side bands can then be used to drive and determine the transitions frequencies of the triplet 2S -&gt; 2P in helium 3 and 4, and 1S-&gt;2S in hydrogen and its isotopes. The physics of the laser interaction with hydrogen and helium atoms is carefully studied to obtain the unperturbed frequencies of studied atomic transitions.  Results will be obtained with sufficient precision to provide important comparisons with theory.  These include (1) the atomic theory and computation of electron-electron interactions in helium, the simplest multi-electron atom, and (2) the nuclear interactions and computations that predict the observed size of few-nucleon nuclei.  In particular, isotopic shifts in these experimental results allow the charge radii of helium-3 and tritium to be determined and compared to predictions of few-nucleon theory and the underlying description of the nuclear force.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported by this grant is concerned with developing and testing laser and optical techniques and applying them to precision studies of the helium atom.  These studies allow precise tests of both the theory of atomic structure and the theory of simple atomic nuclei. It is conducted in a small hands-on university laboratory with emphasis on student training in laser and optical technology and the associated human resource development.  Dr. Ronnie Currie led the development of a custom designed and built thulium fiber laser and applied it to the efficient and convenient quenching of helium atoms in an atomic beam.  As part of his doctoral degree, he published a characterization and modeling of the laser operation and suggested, among other things, values of the physical parameters needed to obtain agreement with, and predictions of, laser performance. Dr. Currey is now employed as an engineer at Raytheon Inc. and is part of a team developing, testing and actively deploying fiber laser systems under contracts with United States Defense departments in direct support of military operations.  Dr. Ali Khademian, Dr. Currey and doctoral student Garnet Cameron developed and tested custom lasers for optically pumping helium atoms and for the development of convenient UV laser sources.  Dr. Khademian now teaches a popular course (~ 400 students/year, average student rating ~4.5/5.0) on musical acoustics at the University of North Texas and is using his experimental skills to further improve the laboratory component of the course. Khadijha Alnasser received her master?s degree and Jonathan Cuevas his bachelors degree based in part from work they conducted in the laboratory on computer calculations of helium-3 energy levels and computer controlled precision laser alignment.  At the beginning of this grant Dr. Nima Rezaeian completed his doctoral degree based on contributions to this research and continued to contribute his expertise and advice.  He currently is a medical physicist at UT Southwestern Medical Center and does research on cancer related medical imaging techniques.
