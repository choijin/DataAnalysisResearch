<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thermal stability and mechanical behavior of selected titanium-base alloys with very small (nanocrystalline) grain sizes will be studied.  The alloys will be prepared by the ball milling of powders that will then be consolidated by hot pressing.  The structure and microstructures of the titanium alloys with appropriate additions of third elements that are predicted to stabilize the fine grain structure will be determined.  Mechanical properties will be measured with techniques that evaluate the strength and ductility.  Annealing studies will be carried out to quantitatively determine the thermal stability by measuring the growth of the fine grains.  The results of these studies should have a substantial impact on both the processing and elevated temperature requirements of very fine grain size titanium alloys.  Superior mechanical properties compared to conventional grain size titanium alloys can lead to breakthroughs in structural and bio-related (for example, implant materials) applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ti-base alloys processed to synthesize nanocrystalline microstructures with superior mechanical properties are of great interest for automotive and aerospace applications. These alloys are the focus of the proposed research. Powder compaction followed by elevated temperature consolidation is necessary to process the initial non-equilibrium alloys in most cases, and elevated temperatures are prerequisite for end-use. The   research will investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic mechanisms that can provide high temperature thermal stability for nanocrystalline Ti-base alloys. Ti alloys with hcp alpha stabilizers and bcc beta stabilizers will be synthesized using mechanical alloying. A model will enable selection of optimum (oversize) solutes for thermodynamic stabilization. Kinetic stabilization by solute drag or Zener pinning will be achieved by in-situ (intermetallic precipitates) or ex-situ (oxide dopant) strategies. Thermal stabilization mechanism interactions and strengthening mechanism transitions (Hall Petch vs. Orowan strengthening) are highly relevant for achieving optimum microstructures. Microstructure characterization will be done using methods appropriate to the microstructural scale of interest. This will include structural and chemical investigation using state-of-the art instrumentation capable of atomic scale resolution. Mechanical properties will be measured with techniques that evaluate strength and ductility for the sample sizes produced by hot compaction of the processed powders. Isothermal annealing studies will be undertaken to establish grain-growth kinetics and activation energies. This will provide additional insight and modeling for stabilization mechanisms and interactions in selected temperature regimes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanocrystalline Ti is much stronger than conventional grain size Ti and therefore of interest for applications such as medical implants.  An important method to produce bulk nanocrystalline Ti is to ball mill Ti powder and consolidate the powder by a combination of heat and stress.  However, pure nanocrystalline materials are unstable to heating at elevated temperatures and exhibit extensive grain growth, thus losing the nanocrystalline grain size and increased strength.  In this project we have considered the stabilization of Ti by additions of selected solute atoms that may impede grain mobility ( kinetic method) by formation of nanoscale particles, or by segregating to the grain boundaries and lowering the grain boundary energy and therefore the driving force for grain growth.  We have found that pure Ti is unstable to annealing at temperatures as low as 500C, but that the addition of Y as a solute can stabilize the grain size by , we believe, both kinetic (forming nanoscale yttrium oxides) and thermodynamic (segregation of Y to the grain boundaries) mechanisms.  Addition of 4 at. % Y to a Ti- 10 at.% Al nanocrystalline alloy stabilizes an ultra fine-grained structure even at annealing temperatures up to 1000C.  The broader outcomes of this project include the training of a Ph. D student, Mr. Peter Feldtmann, who has learned both processing and characterization methods as part of his thesis and is expected to graduate in May 2019.  Mr. Brady Trevisan was an REU student who graduated with a B. S. in materials science and engineering in May 2017.  The results of this project will be deseminated  by a presentation by Peter Feldtmann at the MS&amp;T conference in Columbus, Ohio, October 2018.  Two papers to be submitted to materials journals are in preparation and will be submitted for publication.       Last Modified: 10/31/2018       Submitted by: Carl C Koch]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
