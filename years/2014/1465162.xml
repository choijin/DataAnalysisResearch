<AbstractNarration>Frank Brown of the University of California - Santa Barbara is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program of the Chemistry Division for research that is helping us understand the structure and function of the molecules that make up the membranes that enclose all the cells in our bodies.  These membranes, a combination of fat-like molecules, cholesterol and proteins, are complex entities across which food and other substances enter our cells while wastes and cellular products exit them. The investigators are studying the ways these events occur at a fundamental physical and chemical level. They are, thus, promoting the progress of science and having an impact on a wide array of scientific topics involving the healthy functioning of living things. The research is having a further broad impact through the training of the next generation of scientists, both in the investigator's research laboratory and through the distribution of software that results from this work. In addition, the investigators are helping to coordinate outreach programs at the UCSB institution that seek to involve elementary school students in science and encourage them to consider careers in the STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are developing theoretical models, numerical methods and simulation algorithms for the study of lipid bilayers, lipid and surfactant monolayers and DNA-modifying enzymes. In particular, field-theoretic models for membrane structure are being refined at two different levels of description suited to long-wavelength undulations and short-wavelength lipid tilt/thickness deformations. The investigators are generalizing the interfacial regularized Stokeslet methodology previously developed by this group to incorporate compressibility and viscoelastic effects. In a third project, the investigators are extending their analysis methods to the development of improved kinetic schemes to analyze enzymatic turnover in DNA-modificication. A number of applications of this work are expected, including: (1) extracting quantitatively accurate values of membrane bending moduli from molecular simulations; (2) interpreting NMR measurements on lipid bilayers; (3) interpreting interfacial microbutton rheology measurements; (4) relating membrane elastic properties determined via measurements taken at vastly different length scales; (5) quantifying the influence of periodic boundary conditions on simulated dynamics in lipid bilayers; (6) elucidating the kinetics and processivity of DNA modifying enzymes; and (7) understanding thickness fluctuations in lipid bilayers and their influence on neutron scattering experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biolosciences (MCB) in Biosciences Directorate (BIO) and the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) contribute to this award.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF award 1465162 was used to carry out fundamental theoretical research at the intersection between chemistry and biophysics.  The work focused on the study of lipid bilayer membranes (cell membranes) and the catalysis of biochemical reactions by enzymes.  One of the primary outcomes of this work was the discovery that commonly employed computer simulations for the study of lipid bilayer membranes are plaged by severe inaccuracy in the determination of lipid diffusion coefficients and membrane protein diffusion coefficients (see figure).  This problem is due to the fact that computationally feasible simulation boxes are far too small to contain the hydrodynamic flows that exist experimentally.  A second outcome of this work was the derivation of new theoretical formulas that describe enzyme kinetics.  These equations have been used to interpret experimental data related to the modification of DNA by enzymes.  The new formulas make it possible to interpret experimental data with far less effort than was previously possible and should prove useful in studying the dynamics of protein motion along the DNA backbone.  Three postdoctoral scholars and a graduate student  were trained in the fields of theoretical chemistry and theoretical  biophysics during their participation in the funded research.  The  principal investigator also regularly participated in the Physics  Circus, Chemistry Outreach and Soccer to Science programs at UCSB.   These programs expose grade-school-age children to science/engineeing  principles through visually exciting presentations and hands-on  activities.  Many of the participating students come from agricultural  regions of Santa Barbara county and from homes where neither parent has  attended college.  A high percentage of these students are  underrepresented minorities.  These outreach efforts expose a diverse  range of children to the University of California system and show them  that a college education is within their reach.
