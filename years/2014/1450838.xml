<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on improving measurement methods for hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals (OH and HO2) in the atmosphere. These compounds are very reactive and known to ?cleanse? the atmosphere by oxidizing and breaking down a number of trace species and pollutants so that they are removed from the atmosphere.  Understanding atmospheric oxidation chemistry is critical for establishing the links between atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One method for measuring OH and HO2 is the Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion (FAGE) instrument using a Ground-based Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (GTHOS).  In the past, there have been discrepancies between the GTHOS/FAGE measured values and the modeled values of OH and HO2, primarily showing greater-than-expected OH in low-nitrogen oxides (NOx) environments and greater-than-expected HO2 in high-NOx environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort consists of three main tasks: (1) identifying the cause of the OH interference in the measurement instrument (GTHOS/FAGE) and implementing instrument changes to minimize its impact on OH measurement; (2) resolving the issues of HOx-NOx chemistry with focused laboratory studies; and (3) lowering the GTHOS limit-of-detection to 105 OH cm-3 and the absolute uncertainty to 20% (95% confidence).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal has a high potential to transform current understanding of atmospheric chemistry, including air pollution chemistry and the forcing of global climate by radiatively active species that respond to changes in this chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Earth?s atmosphere contains hydroxyl (OH), a simple but highly reactive molecule. Reactions with OH determine the atmospheric amounts of some potent greenhouse gases and create ozone and particle pollution. When amounts of OH reactants are large, such as in forests, the amounts of OH are reduced by the rapid reactions. Because forests cover so much of Earth?s land surface, the OH amounts in forests have a global impact on the levels of methane and some other greenhouse gases.  The OH amounts measured by some laser-based instruments in some forests suggest that OH levels do not decrease as expected, resulting higher global OH levels than are currently calculated. If this result is correct, global climate and chemical transport models would have to change substantially. However, the results of our research suggest otherwise: OH amounts are low in forests and can be explained by models using current chemical mechanisms.  This discrepancy may be resolved by reconsidering a poorly understood interference in the measured OH signal. Some investigators have found this interference; others provide evidence that their instruments have none. An OH interference was discovered in our OH-measuring instrument, but a method was found to separate interference OH from atmospheric OH and to quantify it.  While our research did not find the cause of this OH interference, experiments in a large environmental chamber at Caltech suggest that the interference comes from chemical species that are created after several steps in the forest chemistry reaction sequence. The usual laboratory test for determining if an instrument has an OH interference looks for the interference after ozone and volatile organic compounds have reacted for less than a second. If the interference appears only later in the reaction sequence, then investigators using this test would think that their instruments had no interference when they actually might.  In the area of air quality, our research provides additional evidence for greater-then-expected amounts of the ozone-producing reactive gas hydroperoxyl (HO2) in morning rush hour. HO2 reacts with nitric oxide (NO), resulting in new ozone (O3). Higher HO2 amounts when NO amounts are higher means more O3 production. Our research demonstrates that problems with the HO2 measurements or the calculation of O3 production using these measurements are unlikely. The most likely possibilities are either a HO2-producing gas emitted along with NO or missing chemistry in the air quality models.  A reaction that could produce HO2 is OH + NO + O2 = HO2 + NO2. However, laboratory studies from our research group and another group show no evidence that this reaction occurs. Further, a theoretical study from the other group shows that an energy barrier in the reaction prevents HO2 formation. Some other chemical reaction must be responsible for these greater-than-expected HO2 amounts at high NO amounts.  Finally, the primary way to test the understanding of atmospheric OH and HO2 is to compare measured to modeled OH and HO2 amounts from field or laboratory studies. For different studies in different locations, different instruments and models are used. If different conclusions are drawn from these different studies, is it because the chemistry is truly different, or are the instrument calibrations different?
