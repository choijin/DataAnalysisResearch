<AbstractNarration>Research studies, commissioned reports, and national and international tests of educational progress in STEM fields show that a large gap exists, in interest and achievement, between underrepresented students and their counterparts. The exclusion of these currently underrepresented students from STEM education and STEM careers will likely impact the Nation's scientific and engineering status in the world, as their diversity of perspectives, which is essential in innovation, is largely absent from the STEM workforce. The Nebraska WearTec project will address this gap by providing high-quality STEM learning activities in both formal and informal learning environments.  The project will target at least 900 underrepresented youth in grades 4 through 6 from 30 schools in urban and rural Nebraska. The project will test a teaching and learning model based on a hybrid problem-based learning approach to engineering design. Curriculum modules will focus on engineering design processes that merge electricity, circuitry, and computer programing with fashion (wearable technologies) and aesthetics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional development workshops and activity guides for 90 teachers and out-of-school-time educators will be provided throughout the project. These individuals will oversee student engagement in authentic experiences supported by a collaborative effort involving the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and the Nebraska Department of Education's 21st Century Community Learning Center (CCLC) program (a federally funded statewide grants program designed to support the establishment of community learning centers serving students attending high-need schools). WearTec will use recommendations from the 2009 National Research Council's comprehensive report on engineering education as the framework for this project. WearTec will employ initial redesign of wearable technologies in formal classroom settings followed by more extensive iterative design in out-of-school-time environments to provide the flexibility and freedom required for immersive extended activities. The activities will include both online and print-based formats that will be designed to transform understanding of instructional methods that foster motivation, interest, and knowledge acquisition to inspire and prepare students to pursue STEM careers; thereby positively impacting the STEM workforce.  A quasi-experimental research design will be used to examine differences between knowledge and interest in engineering design of students who participated in the WearTec intervention and a comparison group who did not participate in the intervention. The project will employ instruments specific to measuring engineering design and knowledge as well as STEM student interest and motivation previously tested for validity and reliability in prior  studies funded by NSF and the U.S. Department of Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The long-term goal of the WearTec program (NSF project#1433822) was to design, develop, and test an effective model for teaching and learning engineering design concepts for youth in grades 4 - 6 through the use of wearable electronic textiles.  The key components of the project included:   A hybrid (print and on-line) youth curriculum and adult facilitators' guide centered on wearable technologies;   The bridging of formal classroom teaching and learning environments with informal out-of-school time (OST) learning environments delivered by teaching partner teams of formal and informal educators working in 21st CCLC programs;  Broaden participation of females and underrepresented youth in STEM through exciting hands-on, technology-rich activities that are also personally relevant.   The project addressed the scarcity of hands-on, minds-on engineering curriculum for youth in grades 4 to 6, which is critical for encouraging and developing the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Results of the project showed the educational effectiveness of wearable technologies for increased STEM knowledge and attitudes.  Results of the project showed that the wearable technology instruction resulted in significantly higher scores in student knowledge of programming and circuitry, as well as STEM self-efficacy, compared to a control group.  The project also bridged formal and informal instruction through the design and delivery of an instructional package compatible in both settings and delivered by teaching teams of formal and informal educators.  We successfully provided professional development to over 100 certified teachers and out-of-school-time (OST) educators through three-day intense summer workshops.   The project reached over 900 youth with nearly an equal percentages of females (48%) and males (52%) were involved and over 300 of the youth were minority primarily Latino and African-American.  Results relevant to broadening participation of underrepresented groups  showed that  minority students scored as well as their majority counterparts on all outcomes. Males and females did not differ on knowledge outcomes; however, males displayed significantly higher self-efficacy in programming and circuitry, supporting other research showing higher computer science self-efficacy for male versus female elementary school students.
