<AbstractNarration>Verbal information is conveyed differently in the world languages. In English, this information is mostly expressed by a simple verb, while in some other languages it is conveyed by a complex structure consisting of two or more components linguists call complex predicates. For example, gerye kardan 'cry doing' (Farsi) translates as the single verb 'to cry' in English. This project focuses on a descriptive and theoretical analysis of complex predicates in seventeen Iranian languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of complex predicates has been the subject of many linguistic studies in the last 5-6 decades. One major question is whether they are word-like, or rather phrase-like with each component revealing independent properties. Furthermore, the contribution of each part to the meaning of the whole have long been a central issue in linguistic theory. Crucially, complex predicates reveal distinct behavior with respect to certain constructions compared to those observed in well-studied languages such as English. These constructions include passives (The apple was eaten), resultatives (John wiped the table clean), and causatives (John made Mary leave). The nature of these differences, and the reasons for their existence, are not well understood. New data and the microparametric comparison of the Iranian languages will break new ground in our understanding of the underpinnings of complex predicate formation and their behavior in human language. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collection will be conducted via linguistic elicitation with native speaker consultants as well as Complex Predicate Questionnaires to be filled out by native speaker consultants trained in linguistics. One of the goals of this project is to transcribe, catalogue and enter the data into a database. All the textual material that forms the basis for the descriptive analysis and pedagogical material will be stored in an accessible format available to public for further study, in addition to a web-based encyclopedia for the target languages. This study promises many benefits. It trains several students as experts in Iranian languages, provides understanding of languages and cultures Americans are interested in, but do not know much about, and fosters research relations between linguists in three continents, which will enrich collaborative activities.</AbstractNarration>

(https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/626265)  The University of Arizona Campus Repository is an institutional  repository  that facilitates access to the research, creative works,  publications and  teaching materials of the University by collecting,  sharing and archiving  content selected and deposited by faculty,  researchers, staff and affiliated  contributors.        Wikipedia style pages for seven Iranian languages (Balochi, Gilaki, Manandarani, Ossetian, Pashto, Sorani and Kurmanji) were created.

One of these  articles is already published, and the other two are under review  by two prestigious linguistics journals. A fourth article is in  progress.        This grant provided significant training for students.  Five graduate students and two undergraduate students were involved with this study throughout the life of the grant.  They attended the weekly meetings consisting of literature review and data analysis, contacted language consultants, and participated in the elicitation sessions. The graduate research assistants were also involved in writing abstract for conference presentations, producing actual articles, transcribing the data and entering them into the database, preparing Wikipedia pages, communicating with people in charge of the university wide webpage for transferring all interviews and data, and with the people in the college to transfer the Wikipedia pages to the college webpage.  In addition to the students who served as research assistants and associates, 3-4 other graduate students were regularly attending the weekly meetings, and participated in discussions.      Thanks to the supplemental funds to the original award, the research team was able to organize a one day workshop on complex predicates in Iranian Languages. Eight papers were presented at this workshop, two of them by invited speakers, and the remaining six by students from various universities in Korea, Turkey, Germany and the States.  The complex predicate research team had a one hour presentation, reporting the results of their research at this workshop.
