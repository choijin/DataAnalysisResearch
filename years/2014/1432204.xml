<AbstractNarration>Within many disciplines, concerns are frequently raised about how effective laboratory courses are at connecting experimental processes with theoretical concepts, and more generally bridging the gap between the practices of the classroom laboratory and the practices of the professional scientific research and engineering laboratories. Calls to transform laboratory courses are coming from a wide variety of stakeholders, including: the physics education community; the life sciences community; and national science policy-making bodies promoting the retention of STEM majors, the development of the STEM workforce, and updated guidelines for the laboratory curriculum. Recommendations advocate that students should develop habits of mind, experimental strategies, enthusiasm, and confidence in research through improved laboratory courses. Towards these goals this research project will advance understanding of how to support students in developing experimental skills and understanding of the experimental process, through probing students' attitudes and instructors' expectations. Evaluation tools will also be developed to enable instructors to iteratively improve their courses and to give researchers insights into the effects of different course modifications on student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To advance understanding of how to support students in developing experimental skills and understanding of the experimental process, the research team will probe students' attitudes and instructors' expectations. The student and instructor data will be gathered utilizing the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) survey. An online platform that allows instructors to administer the survey and analyze their data automatically and seamlessly thus adding an automated survey administration and reporting system will be developed.   This will allow feedback from users in order that current statements in the survey are evaluated for their usefulness.  Responses from users will allow tailoring of the survey to meet the majority of instructors' goals and the report sent to back to instructors will be refined.  Information on how instructors are using the data will be ascertained, e.g., how they are using it to reform courses and the details of the interventions attempted.  Finally building off the ideas of institutional and instructional change a "A Guide to the E CLASS: Use, Interpretation and Course Modifications" will be developed.  Through these means the use of the survey will be increased, a system will be developed to make the administration of the survey more sustainable in the long term, results will be used to help instructors tailor their courses to achieve individual goals, the validity and reliability of the survey will be increased, and progress towards answering several research questions about training students in experimental physics will be made. The project will be evaluated both internally and externally in both a formative and summative manner to ensure project success in making direct progress towards the goals.  The project will include an advisory board of key professionals who will provide formative feedback and advising on key decisions. In addition, knowledge gained and the platform developed will be shared with the education research community, as it may be a new model for dissemination of these types of assessment tools. Dissemination will occur via submission of publications to journals that are instructor focused (e.g., AJP, Physics Teacher and Physical Review Special Topics-PER.)  Results will also be disseminated through faculty workshops run by AAPT the American Astronomical Society and APS and the Annual Physics Department Chairs conference.</AbstractNarration>

At the beginning and end of the semester, the E-CLASS assesses students? views about their strategies, habits of mind, and attitudes when doing experiments in lab classes. Students also reflect on how those same strategies, habits of mind, and attitudes are practiced by professional researchers. Finally, at the end of the semester, students reflect on how their own course valued those practices in terms of earning a good grade. In response to frequent calls to transform laboratory curricula to more closely align it with the skills and abilities needed for professional research, the E-CLASS is a tool to assess students' perceptions of the gap between classroom laboratory instruction and professional research.              After development and extensive validity testing, we deployed the E-CLASS broadly through the use of an automated assessment management system, which we also developed.  The automated management system was shared with other assessment developers and is now facilitating additional assessment implementations. E-CLASS has been, or is currently being, translated into Amharic, Mandarin, Norwegian, and German to broaden its impact.  Broader Impacts  Since we began support for courses at other institutions, a large number of colleges, universities, and students have participated by using the E-CLASS. (&gt;160 institutions, 8 countries, &gt;500 separate classes, &gt;300 distinct courses, and &gt; 50,000 students). These student responses form a large database from which we have been able to ask and answer many research questions.   Intellectual Merit  We have published 15 peer-reviewed papers on E-CLASS including: 9 Phys. Rev. PER, 5 Phys. Ed. Res. Conf. Proceedings, and 1 Am. J. Phys.  These papers have investigated the impact of gender, type of course, level of course, and the goals of course on students? responses to the survey items.
