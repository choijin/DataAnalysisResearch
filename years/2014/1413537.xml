<AbstractNarration>White dwarfs are the highly dense, planet-sized end states of stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel.  About 98% of all stars - including our Sun - will end their lives as white dwarfs. The proposal team consists of senior researchers at three institutions, and they have a vast combined experience in observational studies of white dwarfs.  Their study of these stars will provide critical insights about the history of the Milky Way galaxy.  The project to measure the properties of all white dwarf stars in our solar neighborhood will produce results that are of fundamental importance in several areas of stellar astrophysics.  They will also enhance the Villanova Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs, which has been a primary resource for the astronomical community (both professional and amateur) for four decades.  PI Holberg has authored a popular science book and is working on two more, including one about White Dwarfs.  CoPI Oswalt will share results from this program as an American Astronomical Society Shapley Visiting Lecturer.  This award will provide training opportunities for a University of Arizona graduate student and for undergraduate students from Villanova University and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal team will compile and characterize a volume-limited sample of the local white dwarf population within 50 parsecs.  This will increase the number of well-studied, nearby white dwarfs by an order of magnitude, and it will enable us to address questions such as the relative distribution of different white dwarf types, the binary fraction of white dwarfs, the local mass distribution and chemical evolution of the galaxy, white dwarf spectral evolution, and many others.  It will also provide a reference sample for the vast numbers of more distant white dwarfs likely to be discovered with future survey missions like Gaia and LSST.  The new observations will also provide significant enhancements to the Villanova Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs, which serves as a fundamental reference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ White dwarfs are the small (planet sized) corpses of dead stars, 98% of all stars (including the sun) will become white dwarfs.  Being small they are faint and thus hard to find and to study.  This research program defined and studied a critical sample of white dwarfs, those with in 82 light years (25 parsecs) of the sun.  The unique aspects of this sample are that it is volume-limited, which means counting all white dwarfs within 82 light years from the sun and secondly it had a high degree of completeness (68 %).  These aspects make it possible to confidently estimate several basic properties of the population white dwarfs throughout our galaxy.  These include,   (1)  the space density &ndash;  the number of white dwarfs per unit volume of space, is 4.8 &plusmn; 0.5 &times; 10&minus;3 pc&minus;3,   (2) a well-defined distribution white dwarf masses &ndash; which run from 0.3 to 1.2 solar masses, with a sharp peak at 0.578 solar masses, (3) the number of white dwarfs with companions &ndash;  the binary fraction  of white dwarfs is surprising low &ndash; 26 %,  and (4) the fraction of white dwarfs having magnetic fields is 12% at a minimum.  Finally, it has been possible to define a rudimentary history of the birthrate of white dwarfs over the past 8 billion years.  These and other findings represent fundamental data for theoretical investigations of stellar evolution in our galaxy.  For example, the fact that only 26 % of white dwarfs are now in binary systems, implies the process of forming white dwarfs can result in the demise of binary star systems.  This is because the progenitor systems were hydrogen burning main sequence stars which have a binary fraction of about 50 %.  Our sample even gives a hint as to what may have happened to some of these former binary systems.   Current theories indicate that magnetic white dwarfs are the result of stellar mergers of close stellar systems during what is known as a common envelope phase.  If our observed fraction of magnetic white dwarfs went through a common envelope phase, then many of the missing binary systems can be accounted for.  In summary the results of our research constituted a benchmark study defining important properties of the galactic white dwarf population.  Following publication of our results, the European space mission Gaia made its first release of precise astrometric and photometric observations of over one billion stars.  From these Gaia data it is possible to construct much larger and more complete volume-limited local white dwarf samples.  Initial Gaia-based white dwarf samples continue to show very good agreement with our results.  It is important to note that our results remain important in the immediate post-Gaia era because each star in our sample contains key spectroscopic, compositional and binary information not in the Gaia data set.   It will require years of ground-based spectroscopic observations to fill out the full set of parameters (temperatures, masses, radii, composition, ages etc.) for all the stars in the larger Gaia samples.
