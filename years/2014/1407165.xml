<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site: Integrated Nanomanufacturing hosted by the Boston University Photonics Center (BUPC) is to immerse teachers in a six-week summer program that focuses on interdisciplinary research experiences to explore the design, fabrication, and application of nanometer-scale components in optical, electronic, mechanical and biomedical systems addressing important technological problems. Mentored research projects will challenge participants to engage in engineering problem solving, and the knowledge gained will help participants develop sustainable curricula and activities in STEM education. RET teachers will return to their classrooms with an improved and relevant skill set to foster their student's interest in engineering disciplines and to succeed with the ambitious educational goals of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This proposed RET Site is focused on underserved schools in the greater Boston area with the goal of recruiting participants from a diverse group with 80% from resource-limited schools with high percentages of underrepresented minority students. To achieve this goal the RET Site will work directly with Massachusetts STEM pipeline networks to target schools and individual teachers with STEM interest but limited resources to implement these activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrated nanomanufacturing research is an inherently interdisciplinary intellectual area that is evolving rapidly at the intersecting frontiers of microelectronics, optical science, materials engineering, and biomedicine.  Three thematic research areas will serve as the foundation for this RET Site: nanophotonics, nanostructures, and nanomedicine.  While engaged in mentored discovery, engineering of new devices and fabrication at the nanoscale level to explore optical systems, participants will develop critical skills, awareness and confidence necessary to advance in academics and research in the future. The summer experience will involves training sessions, hands-on cleanroom activities, scientific research in partner laboratories, seminars on classroom integration, and faculty pedagogy discussions. Participants will also be introduced to the idea of Societal Engineers, a new core concept at Boston University to develop engineers who can connect their training to integrate content and applications reflecting how science and engineering is practiced in the real world. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acknowledgement: This project is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers at the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>

Three thematic research areas served as the foundation for this RET Site: nanophotonics, nanostructures, and nanomedicine. While engaged in mentored discovery, engineering of new devices and fabrication at the nanoscale level to explore optical systems, participants developed the critical skills, awareness, and confidence necessary to advance in academics and research in the future. Participants were introduced to the idea of Societal Engineers, a core concept at Boston University, a program designed to develop engineers who can connect their training to integrate content and applications reflecting how science and engineering is practiced in the real world. Outcomes from participation in the RET Site in Integrated Nanomanufacturing included to the first hand understanding of engineering research. The teachers learned how engineers and scientists work together in the same laboratory on interdisciplinary research. Participants were able to bring back these experiences to their classrooms and communicate to their students that the future of jobs or education beyond secondary includes the ability to communicate and interact with people of various disciplines and backgrounds to achieve a full experience and complete a job or task. The teachers also learned that mistakes sometimes guide a project or can educate researchers about how their technology integrates with various other disciplines, both positively and negatively. Encouraging students that mistakes do happen and should not be labeled as failures is another area that the teachers identified as a valuable learning outcome.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader Impacts:</p> <p>Involving underrepresented groups in engineering and science depends on fostering improvement through strong role models, teaching innovation and exciting technology and societal impact brought to the classroom. The RET site in Integrated Nanomanufacturing was focused on underserved schools with the goal of recruiting participants from a diverse group with the goal of 80% of the participants who worked at resource-limited schools with high percentages of underrepresented minority students in engineering. Further, using successful strategies developed under GK-12 programs, a high percentage of underrepresented minorities among the teachers were recruited. The RET site in Integrated Nanomanufacturing worked with the STEM pipeline to target schools and individual teachers with STEM interest but limited resources to implement these activities. Outcomes were measured through participants, mentors, and visits to students in the classroom. The site recruited from public schools rather than private institutions. 68% of the RET participants were female and 24% were underrepresented minorities. 63% of the RET participants from the NSF RET INM Site are teachers at schools with more than 50% minority enrollment in the high school, and 69% of the schools had greater than 45% of families from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. 73% of the participating schools are receiving MA District Assistance at a level of 3 or higher (with 5 being the most assistance). The teachers were partnered with undergraduates as part of a complementary NSF REU Site in Integrated Nanomanufacturing. The undergraduate research population over the course of the program included participant demographics of 65% female and 76% underrepresented minorities in engineering. Participating teachers were able to talk about this diverse group of undergraduate partners to their students and share their stories and research through the REU Meet the Participants pages on the NSF REU Site in Integrated Nanomanufacturing website.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Anonymous teacher evaluations were conducted with each cohort that provided guidance and information about the intellectual merit and broader impacts of their participating in the RET program. Overwhelmingly, nearly 95% of the teachers participating in the survey felt the program prepared them to explain engineering and nanotechnology in the classroom. 85% of the teachers indicated that they would bring new concepts or clubs into their schools as a result of participating in the RET. 75% of the teachers indicated that they would include non-kit-based research projects in their classrooms, 77% would encourage students to explore topics the teacher was not familiar with, and 70% were planning to include engineering in their standard curriculum. 80% of the teachers indicated that their understanding of research technology changed a fair amount to a great deal through participation in the program. These evaluation results demonstrated the teachers? willingness and excitement to encourage their students to engage in STEM fields.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/09/2019<br>      Modified by: Xin&nbsp;Zhang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407165/1407165_10351755_1561477191859_REURETlab--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407165/1407165_10351755_1561477191859_REURETlab--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NSF REM, REU and RET INM Participants in Nanoparticles Lab"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407165/1407165_10351755_1561477191859_REURETlab--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NSF REM, REU and RET INM Participants in Nanoparticles Lab"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">NSF REM undergraduate and NSF REU/RET INM Participants all work together to create their own nanospheres and nanoparticles that will be used to for characterization the following week of the program.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joshua Albert</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Helen&nbsp;Fawcett</div> <div class="imageTitle">NSF REM, REU and RET INM Participants in Nanoparticles Lab</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407165/1407165_10351755_1561480269771_RET2015--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1407165/1407165_10351755_1561480269771_RET2015--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Summer 2015 -
