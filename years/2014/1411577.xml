<AbstractNarration>The main purpose of this project is to design efficient methods for imaging certain physical quantities from indirect measurements. The problems that we study arise in applications such as finding the electrical conductivity in the human body from electrical measurements on the skin, finding the elastic properties of tissue from controlled vibrations of the skin or even monitoring a pipeline using electrical measurements. The methods we design are efficient because they are based on networks that mimic the underlying physics of the problem. For example, to image the electrical conductivity we use a network of resistors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inverse problems on networks consist on using boundary data (analogous to the Dirichlet to Neumann map in continuum inverse problems) to find certain (scalar or vector valued) node quantities and (scalar or matrix valued) edge quantities defined on a known graph. We use ideas from Complex Geometric Optics to conjecture that if the linearization of such a problem is solvable, then the non-linear problem is also solvable. This would give a relatively simple way of checking solvability of such discrete inverse problems. Solvability results and reconstruction algorithms on networks are then used to solve a continuum inverse problem by interpreting the network problem as a discretization of the governing partial differential equation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a palpation exam, a physician feels a mass in a patient by pushing in different directions to determine if the mass is rather soft or stiff. This is valuable information that could indicate if the mass is a cancerous tumor. The doctor is intuitively solving the inverse problem of determining the elastic properties of the mass from how much it gives way to pressure. One of the problems we studied as part of this award is an analogous inverse problem on networks of springs, that is a collection of springs connected through nodes.  One of the questions we studied is: Is it possible to find the spring stiffnesses by measuring the forces needed to move a few nodes of the network?  We found a simple test to identify networks in which this is possible, up to certain exceptions that are unlikely. The results we obtained through this award apply to other problems, e.g. to a network of springs, damper and masses when the displacement/forces are periodic and to simple electric circuits where we can only access a few terminals. Other applications of our work are to optical tomography.   This award also funded research on imaging small targets with waves when the phase information is lost. This is a common situation when the sensor is slow compared to the period of the wave (as is the case e.g. for light and conventional cameras). For electromagnetic waves our results show a situation where polarization information (acquired with combinations of filters and a conventional camera) can be used to find the position and polarizability properties of a collection of small scatterers. This result could have applications to optics, remote sensing and radar.   Broader impacts: Funds from this award contributed to the following human impacts:  3 undergraduate students that directly participated in this project are pursuing graduate studies in Mathematics, Statistics or Physics. 1 current undergraduate student has decided and is very motivated to pursue graduate studies in Mathematics. 1 graduate student obtained his PhD, and currently holds a position in the industry (after a 1 year postdoctoral experience) 1 postdoctoral researcher holds a permanent research position.
