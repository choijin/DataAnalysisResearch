<AbstractNarration>The University of Miami requests funding for additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Walton Smith, a 96 foot, general purpose regional vessel operated by the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V WALTON SMITH conducts a substantial portion of her operations in the near shore waters of South Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, providing scientific information relevant to major environmental initiatives. The operations include oil spill monitoring, water management changes, municipal waste disposal, and storm water discharge among others which are deemed critical to the sustainable development of the South Florida and Gulf economy.  In 2013, R/V Walton Smith completed 115 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 19% of the total sailing schedule (22 days). In 2014, R/V Walton Smith is scheduled for 102 days with NSF days (20) accounting for 20% of the total sailing schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt; 1) 600 kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler          $39,912 &lt;br/&gt; 2) Niskin Bottles     $13,116 &lt;br/&gt; 3) Upgrade of 75 kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler $47,150 &lt;br/&gt;                                             Total    $100,178 &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Description  The major goals of this project are to improve, update, refurbish, or modify existing capabilities aboard the R/V F. G. WALTON SMITH. Items deemed most critical for continuing support of ongoing studies, perhaps quarterly or annually, are determined from safety concerns fundamentally, or obsolete instruments, plus scientific user requests. If requests come from individuals, as opposed to multiple users, we will then ascertain the most critical items based on 1) safety issues 2) overall improvements to the vessel or equipment 3) broad/general use or impending technology enhancements that may affect data collection or post-processing.  Three major oceanographic instruments were requested. All three received meritorius review from the NSF Review Panel. All items were awarded in the 2014 Oceanographic Instrumentation Award # 1420304.

The third and final item, eighteen 10-liter Niskin Sampling bottles was requested and approved to replace old, worn and poor condition bottles on the CTD carousel.     Major Activities:  Both the 600 kHz and 75 kHz ADCP transducers have been replaced and the ADCP systems utilizing these transducers are working properly.  New Niskin bottles and spare parts were ordered, received, and the new bottles are migrating into the rotation of bottles aboard the F.G. Walton Smith.
