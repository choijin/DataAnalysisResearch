<AbstractNarration>The trace metal iron is a key micronutrient throughout the oceans that plays an important role in regulating primary production. Iron (chemical symbol Fe) can exist in different ionization states in the environment, primarily as the reduced form Fe(II) and the oxidized form Fe(III), which impacts its chemical behavior within the water column, and ultimately the ability of researchers to accurately measure its abundance. There is an urgent need in the chemical oceanography community for accurate measurements of Fe(II) in the water column, as currently used methods may overestimate concentrations in water samples collected from certain depths. In this study, researchers from the University of Southern California will significantly redevelop an underutilized methodology to measure Fe(II), and carry out an evaluation and inter-comparison between the two methodologies. This work will enable the refinement of estimates of Fe(II) concentration, present a robust methodology for future use, and clarify conditions where the current methodology can be used effectively. This project will involve strong undergraduate research opportunities, and the research will be conducted in collaboration with an international researcher from India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fe(II) is thermodynamically unstable in seawater in the presence of oxygen or nitrate, yet its presence has been reported both in surface waters and in oxygen minimum zones. A rigorous assessment of Fe(II) measurements is important because its chemistry and bioavailability are so different than Fe(III). Fe(II) forms weak complexes, is weakly hydrolyzed and highly soluble in seawater. Fe(III) forms strong complexes, is sparingly soluble and strongly hydrolyzed. The presence of even a modest fraction of Fe as Fe(II) under Fe-limited conditions could increase bioavailability by orders of magnitude. The most widely used methodology to determine Fe(II) at nanomolar to sub-nanomolar levels involves the Fe(II) catalyzed oxidation of luminol, a chemiluminescent (CL) reaction. There are potential artifacts with this methodology, especially in the euphotic zone, where other reduced species might interfere. Researchers will develop a new, modified version of a published alternative method to CL involving the preconcentration of Fe(II) complexed by a synthetic chelator. While this alternative method is prone to artifacts and contamination that has limited its value in the open ocean, new approaches create a plausible path to an accurate and sensitive protocol that is independent of the luminol method. Following the new method development, this project will implement inter-comparisons with the CL approach, which will be conducted in the laboratory, in an anoxic mesocosm system, at a coastal time-series station off the California coast, and in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) are vast regions of the world?s oceans where oxygen drops to zero.   Unlike the notorious "dead zones" in places like the Gulf of Mexico, they are not caused by human activities but have existed for thousands of years.    Oceanographers study their chemistry because processes occur there that do not take place elsewhere in the oceans that can affect global budgets of nitrogen, iron and other elements important to marine life.  In this project, we are studying how iron chemistry in these zones affects its transport from the coast to the ocean?s interior.   Our study site is the OMZ off the coast of Southern Mexico.  Iron enters the system from the land as dust, and also from the Rio Balsas, Mexico?s largest west coast river.    Within the OMZ some of it is converted to ferrous iron - a form that would oxidize quickly to the ferric form (i.e. rust) in the presence of oxygen.   Instead, it stays dissolved and moves offshore in an underwater plume 100-300m below the sea surface.  This plume is important in supplying iron &ndash; an element essential for all life &ndash; to the ocean interior.  But ferrous iron is hard to measure, and many previous workers think they are measuring the ferrous form when they are measuring something else.   So we made some key improvements in the methodologies that scientists use.  Ph.D. student Ken Bolster has written a peer-reviewed scientific article that describes what we did.     The work also gives us an idea about iron and other elements behaved in ancient oceans, before there was any oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere.   The project involved collaboration with Mexican Scientists, including Alejandro Arias, a postdoc funded jointly by this project, the University of Southern California and CONACYT, a Mexican funding agency.   The project also supported two undergraduates, Rafael de la Zerda (University of Miami) and Natalianne Tuttle (Humboldt State University) who were studying iron redox chemistry off the coast of Southern California?s Catalina Island.
