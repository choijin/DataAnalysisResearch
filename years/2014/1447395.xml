<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop an innovative software prototype that uses pages out of electronic design (e-design) notebooks to automatically assess design activities from all the five stages of the design process (requirements modeling, functional modeling, concept design, embodiment design, and detailed design). The e-design notebooks are generated using tablets, or convertible laptops, which the designers receive, or bring, at the beginning of a design project, to do all of their design work on. This software will impact the way engineering design is taught, and thus contribute to the training of strong engineering workforce, by allowing instructors, mentors or supervisors to assess performance of students or design engineers with less subjectivity and on a continual basis. In industry, the tool can be used to ensure efficient compliance with internal design processes (minimize the chance of design pitfalls), and teach effective design techniques, leading to productivity enhancements that contribute to increased competiveness, higher quality, and shorter time-to-market. The company expects to grow the annual revenues to at least $11,000,000 in six years, by offering the design ecosystem stand-alone or by licensing its assessment engine, the e-design process, to vendors of electronic lab notebooks, and in the process create at least 50 jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aim is to improve teaching, learning and practice of design processes, by automating the seemingly impossible task of assessing the quality of the design activities relative to a given design process through guiding, real-time alerts. The project presents the only learning tool capable of assessing design activities from all the five stages of the design process. The research question is "Can a software application be used to assess the outcomes of a design process?" To answer this question, three technical objectives have been formulated. These are (1) Assessment of the information gathering activities; (2) Assessment of the design process activities; and (3) Engineering of the software objects extracted from the content of e-design notebooks. Central to the ecosystem is the ability of designers to upload their documents to a cloud environment, share selected designs with their teammates, and correspond with their instructor, mentor or supervisor, subject to configurable restrictions. The ecosystem also provides means for interfacing with established tools for computer aided design (CAD) or data product management. The e-design notebooks can tell a story that extends through the stages of the design process, capturing drawings with different degree of sophistication, and can even be extended to support complex CAD files.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goals for this Phase I project are three-fold.  First, the project aims to address the need for effective tools to support learning, teaching, and practice of the design process.  Second, the product developed should improve the information gathering skills of engineering students.  Third, the product should be devised as a comprehensive design environment that can be applied to all stages of the design process.  Fundamentally, the research is intended to automate the task of assessing the quality of design activities and providing process guidance through structured input and the provision of real-time alerts.  Phase I of this project focuses on the research question: "Can a software application be used to assess the outcomes of the design process?"  Major activities for Phase I of this project involve the creation and refinement of a software prototype for the ecosystem client and functionality demonstration in the context of a design example.  Additional efforts were directed at obtaining customer input and refinements of the prototype to accommodate customer suggestions.  Prevalent interactions with academic stakeholders in a number of institutions enabled significant improvements in functionality of the prototype and cemented the direction for focused development efforts during Phase II.  Substantial efforts have been expended to effectively structure input, define phase-specific design activities, and implement substantial rubrics for outcome evaluation.  Simultaneously, numerous studies have been recognized pointing to a vacuum in digital tool support within the detailed design phase.  As a result, input within this phase has been tailored to allow future development of morphological as well as axiomatic design techniques to enhance systematic and creative applications of mechanical design principles.  Meaningful alerts have been devised to reference content within each phase allowing iterative increases in design activity quality that contribute to better overall design quality at the completion of the process.   Tailoring for the proposed institutional market, the software prototype encompasses a great deal of market research consisting of thorough engagement with all varieties of academic stakeholders: faculty, administrators, and students.  Significant outreach has been undertaken to each stakeholder group at Portland State University, Oregon Institute of Technology, the University of Washington, the University of Minnesota, Iowa State University, the University of Nebraska, Missouri University for Science and Technology, the University of Nebraska, Kettering University, and the University of New Mexico.  In addition to in-person meetings and extensive e-mail dialogue, the software ecosystem was presented to participating teams at the National Formula SAE racecar engineering challenge earlier this summer.  The majority of feedback from academic stakeholders strengthens the premise that a comprehensive digital framework for design process activities would be a welcome tool for any collaborative design efforts.  Incorporation of recognized and proven design techniques and a robust project management capability tailored to engineering design were two identified characteristics of the ecosystem providing meaningful contribution to design efforts.  Additionally, features envisaged for implementation were greatly desired in the release version including integration with solid modeling and modern computational analysis software such as finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and simulation programs.  Phase I of this project culminated in an ecosystem prototype client software encompassing research performed in the course of a MasterÆs Degree project in cooperation with Portland State University.  In addition to the software, formal project write-up and presentation, the research has been summarized within a research paper for the Electronics Materials and Processes Conference 2015 (EMAP 2015) in Po...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
