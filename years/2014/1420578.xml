<AbstractNarration>One of the most urgent problems in U.S. education is how to provide more effective teaching in school mathematics. A major question facing Schools of Education today is whether and how their teacher preparation programs matter in addressing this problem. The field lacks research that would inform teacher educators and policy makers about critical variables in mathematics teacher preparation that influence the nature of beginning teachers' practices and the quality of students' learning. This project, funded through the Research on Education and Learning program, builds on empirical evidence that K-8 teacher preparation in mathematics can make a substantial difference in the nature and depth of graduates' knowledge and skills for teaching as well as their actual teaching practices. The researchers will study the links among details of K-8 mathematics teacher preparation, the nature and quality of graduates' classroom teaching, and the nature of their students' learning. Using a longitudinal design following a cohort of teachers as they transition from mathematics teacher preparation into their first two years of classroom teaching, the project will identify the details of the preparation program that enable effective classroom mathematics teaching and influence students' learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to (1) refined theory that connects mathematics teacher preparation, teaching practice, and student learning, and (2) empirical data that test key hypotheses regarding the links among these variables. Hypotheses to be tested include: (a) instructional approaches used in teacher preparation that help prospective teachers acquire conceptual understanding of both mathematics and pedagogy similar to those used to help develop conceptual understanding of mathematics influence the nature of beginning teachers'  instructional practice; (b) a focus on unpacking the mathematics into usable knowledge through, for example, multiple representations of problems and solution methods, will yield detectable improvements in graduates' teaching and their students' learning; and (c) a threshold of intensity in studying a mathematical topic is needed for prospective teachers to internalize and then later use this knowledge to plan and implement high quality lessons on the topic. This longitudinal study will follow all seniors in an undergraduate teacher preparation program, approximately 120 preservice teachers, into their first years of teaching. Using a combination of surveys, classroom observations, and measures of student achievement, the project will test the hypotheses using a mixed method study combining case studies and quasi-experimental tests of impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The absence of solid research findings on the effects of teacher preparation has spawned intense debate among policymakers about the value of traditional teacher education.  Do (mathematics) teacher preparation programs housed in universities make a difference?  One question receiving special attention is whether mathematics content knowledge developed in preparation programs is retained and used after graduates enter the teaching field.  In our previous NSF-funded work, we found that program graduates demonstrated more specialized content knowledge (SCK) for 3 mathematics topics studied during preparation coursework (e.g., dividing fractions) than for 1 control topic not taught in the program (finding the mean), as measured by a range of teaching-like tasks.  In addition, data gathered for one of the tasks (lesson planning) showed better performance on mathematics topics addressed multiple times and during multiple courses when compared to mathematics topics addressed in only one course (or no courses).  We concluded this previous project by hypothesizing that more time spent studying a topic leads to better retention and use of SCK, even up to six years after studying the topic.   Because finding strong relationships between time spent studying a topic and graduates? knowledge for teaching that topic has serious, far-reaching consequences for program design, our goal in the current project was to investigate this relationship as directly as possible.  If time must be allocated to study fewer mathematics topics in more depth, then some topics must be omitted.  We addressed this significant policy consequence by designing this project to test our hypothesis.  We created a precise measure of time spent studying each mathematics topic, we included more topics to check whether the previous findings were an artifact of specific topics (9 studied topics and 4 control topics), we checked whether differential quality of instruction could have accounted for the previous findings, we tested the effects of pre-service teachers? entry knowledge for the topics, and we gathered data on graduates? professional development opportunities and their experience teaching the topics.  We followed 2 cohorts of graduates of our program for up to 3 years after graduation.  Each year we administered an analysis of teaching task, a lesson planning task, and a set of key concepts tasks.  These tasks were the most informative tasks from the previous project.  In general, our findings confirmed our hypothesis.  If enough time is spent developing specialized content knowledge (SCK) with pre-service teachers, graduates can retain that knowledge and apply it to a range of teaching-like tasks 5-6 years later.  However, our findings also reveal that the relationship between time spent on a topic in teacher preparation and knowledge developed and retained by graduates for teaching that topic is more complex than captured by the simple assertion "more instructional time equals more knowledge."   We now hypothesize that the number of critical sub-concepts that must be understood to fully master a mathematics topic will play a major role in determining the amount of time needed to study a topic.  Topics with bigger concept clusters, like dividing fractions, will require more time than topics with smaller clusters, like multiplying whole numbers or creating simple graphs.  Although instruction in our pre-service teacher preparation program was designed to maximize chances that graduates would use what they learned about one topic to develop similar knowledge about other topics on their own, the data showed few transfer effects.  Our findings have important policy implications for the design of mathematics teacher preparation programs.  Decisions about how to allocate instructional time to mathematics topics will need to include consideration of the relative importance of each topic for elementary school students and the size of the concept clusters surrounding each topic.
