<AbstractNarration>One central question which archaeologists pose concerns the processes which gave rise to the complex large scale societies in which almost all humans live today. The roots of one major civilization lie in the Near East and the goal of this research is to gain understanding into an early stage of this development which was closely tied to the domestication of plants and animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannah Lau, under the mentorship of Dr. Elizabeth Carter, will employ data from animal bones from archaeological contexts (faunal assemblages) to assess cooperation and interaction among settled and mobile farmers and herders at the Late Neolithic Halaf (ca. 6100-5200 cal. BCE) site of Domuztep in Kahramanmara Province, Turkey. Lau will combine data gleaned from both zooarchaeological analysis and analyses of strontium, carbon, and oxygen isotopes from teeth specimens of domestic animals to examine economic coordination among people in both daily subsistence activities and in the feasting events at Domuztepe. Through these analyses this study will reveal ancient peoples? management choices regarding their livestock, an important aspect of their political economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mesopotamian case studies are among the most frequently invoked in anthropological discussions of the evolution of social complexity. This study evaluates the scale of cooperative social and economic networks in the Halaf social system and will clarify the processes by which political complexity arose in Upper Mesopotamia. The extent and degree of political complexity during the Halaf period in Northern Mesopotamia is strongly contested. The objective of this research is to use zooarchaeological and isotopic data to explore several interrelated processes: 1) to document resource and labor coordination at the site, 2) to determine whether more mobile groups contributed to and participated in large-scale feasting events, and if so, to determine if such cooperation differs or mirrors day-to-day subsistence practices, and 3) to assess the elaboration of communal rituals like feasts and their impact on animal management practices among fulltime residents at Domuztepe and possible mobile components of the population. Feasts provide a way to study Neolithic socioeconomic and political organization since they entail explicit cooperation among participants and offer an opportunity for social and political relationships to be reified, amplified or even transformed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study has implications  beyond the immediate project of clarifying resource and labor coordination at Halaf Domuztepe, and in the region more broadly. The project contributes critical data to broader discussions of how political complexity emerges, contextualizing modern  processes of political complexity and resource management. It will contribute to the developing body of knowledge of heavy and light isotope profiles found throughout southern Turkey, laying the foundation for future work in the area. Additionally, this work will enable Lau to undergo essential training to develop new analytical skills, including valuable laboratory experience analyzing and understanding stable isotopes. These skills will further her ability to interpret faunal assemblages, broadening the scope of future research projects that will contribute to understandings of human-animal relations. Finally, this project facilitates international scholarly exchange as part of a longterm international research collaboration between institutions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. The results of this study will be made available to the public through open access data publication, public presentations and traditional scholarly venues.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported research examining the inception of political complexity in the Ancient Near East during the Late Neolithic Halaf period (ca. 6100-5200 cal. BCE). This study evaluated the scale of cooperative social and economic networks in the Halaf social system, elucidating the processes by which political complexity arose in Upper Mesopotamia. Specifically, this project analyzed cooperation and coordinated action among agropastoral communities in Upper Mesopotamia at the site of Domuztepe (ca. 6000-5450 cal. BCE) in Kahramanmara? Province, Turkey. To accomplish this, Hannah Lau, under the mentorship of Dr. Elizabeth Carter, analyzed a large assemblage of animal bones recovered at Domuztepe. These animal bones are the remains of food consumed during both inhabitants&rsquo; daily meals and large communal feasts. Lau identified what animals were included in each type of consumption setting. These data were used to identify inhabitants&rsquo; herd management goals, and how they differed among contexts. Lau also analyzed a large assemblage of teeth from sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, rodents, humans, and dogs from daily meals and from feasts at Domuztepe to look at isotopic indicators (strontium, oxygen, and carbon) of the animals&rsquo; mobility and diet. The objective of this research was to use zooarchaeological and biogeochemical data to explore several interrelated processes: 1) to document resource and labor coordination at the site, 2) to determine whether more mobile groups contributed to and participated in large-scale feasting events, and if so, to determine if such cooperation differs from or mirrors day-to-day subsistence practices, and 3) to assess the elaboration of communal rituals like feasts and their impact on animal management practices among fulltime residents at Domuztepe and possible mobile components of the population.</p> <p>The results of these analyses were very informative. The biogeochemical studies show that the majority of livestock were herded in areas that are geologically similar to Domuztepe and areas to the south and southeast. This is indicated by the narrow distribution of strontium values among all herded taxa that correspond closely to the baseline values provided by the small mammal samples. This evidence of movement in this geological region is significant because these areas correspond with the distribution of Halaf sites, showing that any movement likely occurred within the western sub-region of the Halaf cultural sphere. Within this area, however, biogeochemical results&nbsp; from&nbsp; &delta;<sup>18</sup>O and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C indicate that some taxa were herded at great distances from the site, while others were kept close. From these data, we hypothesize that people herded caprines in rounds extending to the south and east of Domuztepe. Human caretakers would have driven these animals; thus, these data also demonstrate their movement. Such herding would also require members within a household or among households to schedule this labor among other agropastoral tasks. Biogeochemical results indicate cattle were likely herded nearby by individual households. People at Domuztepe kept cattle close to be used for labor and to be milked. Pigs also likely stayed close to the settlement, either semi-feral in the adjacent wetlands or in household sties.</p> <p>These data show that people at Domuztepe consumed animals from the same herding networks for feasting events and daily meals. In no case does it appear that animals consumed at feasting events represent a distinct population based on biogeochemical evidence.
