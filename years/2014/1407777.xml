<AbstractNarration>This work will investigate the potential of the newly established slotted nanobeam platform for creating and controlling extreme gradient forces using light.  These generated optical forces could be used to manipulate fluids in point-of-care diagnostic tools or for applications in homeland security or environmental monitoring where there is a critical need for high sensitivity detection of small molecules and nanoparticles in low concentrations and limited volumes. Further, the optical forces created by slotted nanobeams could be used to advance key capabilities of communications systems, computers, and portable electronic devices where higher bandwidth, lower power, more stable, more compact, and lighter weight devices are increasingly needed. The proposed research will also help to educate and train skilled workers in STEM fields.  In particular, this program will (a) bridge the gap between graduate-level and industrial research by exposing students to IBM facilities and personnel in a collaborative setting; (b) promote integrated teaching and research, including undergraduate research experiences; and (c) foster interest in STEM for K-12 students through participation in outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to advance the understanding of gradient optical forces through the design, fabrication, and characterization of slotted nanobeam structures.  The approach is to first explore through finite-difference time-domain simulations how changes in the critical dimensions of the slotted nanobeams affect the quality factor, mode volume, mechanical stability, and gradient optical forces of the structures.  Slotted nanobeams with desired properties will then be fabricated and characterized for optical sensing and manipulation of small molecules and nanoparticles, as well as optomechanical interactions.  The intellectual significance of this activity involves: (a) development of design rules to guide understanding of whether high quality factor or low mode volume is most beneficial for various applications; (b) advancement of optofluidic capabilities to detect and capture small molecules and nanoparticles in trace quantities or in limited analyte volumes; and (c) advancement of optomechanical capabilities to actively manipulate nanostructures and reconfigure active optical components.</AbstractNarration>
