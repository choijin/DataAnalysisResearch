<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for a planning visit to initiate a new international collaboration with geotechnical engineering researchers at the University of Canterbury and the University of Auckland in New Zealand.  This collaboration will focus on the integration of remote sensing measurements of liquefaction deformation and available geotechnical field data from the 2010/2011 New Zealand earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning visit will involve interactions with Professors Misko Cubrinovski and Brendon Bradley at the University of Canterbury, and Professor Michael Pender and Dr. Liam Wotherspoon at the University of Auckland.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Liquefaction of loose, saturated sand is a significant earthquake hazard because the liquefied soil can generate large ground movements that cause severe damage to the built environment.  Our understanding of the consequences of liquefaction is hampered by the limited field data that exist regarding liquefaction-induced horizontal ground movements (e.g., lateral spreading) during previous earthquakes.   This project initiated collaborations with researchers in New Zealand regarding liquefaction-induced ground movements during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes.  The focus of the work was to use displacements measured from satellite imagery, along with subsurface, topographic, and geologic data, to better understand the factors that influence ground movements due to liquefaction.  The unprecedented spatial resolution of the displacement data produced by the satellite imagery over a large regional area combined with the availability of an enormous amount of subsurface data in Christchurch provide a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the characteristics that influence liquefaction-induced ground movements.    During the planning visit we interacted with researchers at the University of Caterbury and the engineering consulting firm Tonkin and Taylor to plan joint research activities and funding for the future.  We have subsequently obtained funding from the NSF and from New Zealand to collaborate on these activities.       Last Modified: 12/07/2016       Submitted by: Ellen M Rathje]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
