<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the development of a real-time opportunistic spectrum access testbed for cognitive radio networks, called ROAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information gained from this project will provide a platform to assess maturity of spectrum-sensing technology and identify areas that need further research for real-time opportunistic dynamic spectrum access in a heterogeneous cognitive network environment, and will support enhancement of our national wireless infrastructure and capacity. ROAR will have a broad societal impact as wireless networks touch every aspect of our society. Project-based learning will be incorporated in related undergraduate and graduate courses to integrate research and education. Focused efforts will be undertaken to interest underrepresented minorities (including females) in the proposed research field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will setup a cloud-based cognitive network for real-time opportunistic spectrum access across diverse RF bands (e.g., 9 kHz ? 6 GHz) including cellular, IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, IEEE 802.15.4, DSRC/WAVE and Bluetooth networks, in order to study the implementation, evaluation and development of future wireless systems. This project also enables experimental investigations in a number of other research projects, including secure dynamic spectrum access design, cognitive radio enabled opportunistic spectrum access in highly mobile vehicular networks, primary user security emulation, energy management techniques for mobile devices, cross-layer based protocol design, security for cyber-physical system design, interference mitigation techniques and wireless resource management schemes.</AbstractNarration>
