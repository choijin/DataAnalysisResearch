<AbstractNarration>This award supports the International Conference on Turbulent Mixing and Beyond. The goals of this conference are to expose the generic problem of Non-Equilibrium Turbulent Processes to a wide scientific community, to promote the development of new ideas in tackling the fundamental aspects of the problem, to assist in application of novel approaches in a broad range of phenomena, where these processes occur, and to have an impact on technology. The meeting will consist of invited lectures by international experts on a broad range of phenomena, where non-equilibrium turbulent processes occur, tutorials by leading experts on hydrodynamic instabilities in fluids and plasmas, contributed talks and poster presentations by participants, round tables and open discussions.</AbstractNarration>
