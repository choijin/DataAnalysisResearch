<AbstractNarration>The PIs will design and build a new rapid access ice drill (RAID) for use in Antarctica. This drill will have the ability to rapidly drill through ice up to 3300 m thick and then collect samples of the ice, ice-sheet bed interface, and bedrock substrate below. This drilling technology will provide a new way to obtain in situ measurements and samples for interdisciplinary studies in geology, glaciology, paleoclimatology, microbiology, and astrophysics. The RAID drilling platform will give the scientific community access to records of geologic and climatic change on a variety of timescales, from the billion-year rock record to thousand-year ice and climate histories. Successful development of the RAID system will provide a research tool that is currently unavailable. Development of this platform will enable scientists to address critical questions about the deep interface between the Antarctic ice sheets and the substrate below. Development of RAID will provide a way to address many of the unknowns associated with general stability of the Antarctic ice sheets in the face of changing climate and sea level rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific rationale for RAID was reviewed in a previous proposal (Goodge 1242027). The PIs were granted ?Phase I? funding to develop a more detailed conceptual design for the RAID drill that would provide a better understanding of construction costs as well as operation and maintenance costs for RAID once it is constructed. Phase I support also allowed the PIs to work with the research community to develop more detailed science requirements for the drill. This proposal requests continued funding (Phase II) to construct, assemble and test the RAID drilling platform, through to staging it in Antarctic for future scientific operations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ice cores have revolutionized our understanding of past atmospheric composition, notably the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.  Currently the ice core record of CO2 only goes back 0.8 million years, falling just short of a major change in how the ice ages came and went that occurred 1 million years ago.  Before 1 million years ago, ice age cycles came and went with a regular 41,000-year periodicity, which is easily explained by the fact that the Earth's spin aixs tilts more every 41,000 years, making the sun appear higher in the sky in the polar summer and melting off the ice sheets.  But at about 1 million years ago the period of the cycles switched to an irregular and enigmatic tempo of 90,000 to 115,000 year long cycles whose origin is still poorly understood.  In some sense, we still do not know why we have the climate that we have today.  This enigma motivates the extension of the ice core atmospheric record farther back in time, at least to 1.5 million years and ideally back to the beginning of the ice ages around 3 million years ago.  So a number of nations have banded together in the effort to find "very old ice", indeed the oldest ice on the planet that still retains pristine samples of the atmosphere.  It is into this context that the award to build a Rapid Access Ice Drill was conceived.  Conventional ice cores typically take 5 years and $50M to drill.  However, the oldest ice is found right at the bottom of the ice sheet, and is often absent or disturbed.  Rather than wasting these resources only to come up empty-handed after 5 years, it makes sense to drill the ice rapidly in reconnaissance mode to verify the existence of the target ice prior to mounting an expensive and time-consuming conventional ice coring effort.  Furthermore, bedrock geologists have long yearned to collect short rock cores from the base of the ice sheets, but have not had the means to do so.  Thus a partnership was born between ice core scientists and bedrock geologists to build a novel tool that would allow rapid spot sampling of the deep ice and the bedrock below it.  The design allows drilling through 3 kilometers of ice in 48 hours and the collection of short ice and rock cores in another 1 to 2 days.  The drill is sled-mounted so that many separate holes can be drilled in one season (perhaps 5 holes) by moving the drill from site to site in an oversnow traverse, freeing the operation from the need for heavy-lift aircraft support.  The prototype drill is now in its fourth year of testing and modification, and appears to be on track for completion around 2022, the anticipated date of a final high-altitude test on the East Antarctic Plateau where old ice and the ancient bedrock of Antarctic is located.  Broader impacts of the work included the entrainment of young scientists (Jessica Ng, Ryan Bay) and technology development that strengthens the US scientific ice and rock coring capability, embodied in the parallel development of the ASIG drill by the Ice Drilling Program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, which is also sponsored by the US National Science Foundation.
