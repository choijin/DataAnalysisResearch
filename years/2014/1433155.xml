<AbstractNarration>The Alaska Community-based Monitoring (CBM) Best Practices Workshop will be held April 1-2, 2014 in Anchorage, Alaska.  This workshop will engage funders and program managers of CBM projects and programs and community members engaged in CBM, which involves dialogue and interaction between scientists and non-scientists. The development of a viable model for planning, implementing, and sustaining CBM throughout Alaska and in the Alaskan Arctic will provide the means to ensure a diversity of people become engaged in science and that scientific results are shared broadly with the communities affected by the research. Because of the nature of Alaskans engaged in CBM, the workshop will engage underrepresented minorities in science and technology. It will also increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology, and develop partnerships between academia and others. A major potential benefit to the well being of individuals in society will be realized by future contributions of CBM efforts to the detection significant environmental changes that require community or societal responses to mitigate, adapt to, or reverse.  The funding requested would make it possible to offer the workshop free of charge to participants, complete planning, invite and pay travel costs for successful practitioners as speakers, pay facilities costs, and use the results of the workshop to write a CBM Best Practices manual applicable to Alaska and the Arctic.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      National Science Foundation grant award #1433155 supported the Community-Based Monitoring: Observing Alaska's Coasts and Oceans workshop convened by Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS) and Alaska Sea Grant (ASG) on April 1-2, 2014, in Anchorage, Alaska. The workshop was intended to be a gathering place and launching pad to identify and respond to common issues for Community-Based Monitoring (CBM) in Alaska and the Arctic.  CBM was defined broadly to encompass diverse citizen science monitoring and observing networks that involved collaborations between community members who collect local environmental observations and data and their partners outside the community who support the collection, management, and use of the observations and data in some way.      The workshop was attended by 130 scientists, engaged community members, and representatives from organizations, universities and agencies from throughout Alaska, six other states, Canada, and Kamchatka. Participants heard from coordinators of programs that provided models for various aspects of CBM, discussed priorities for funders and community members.      Throughout the process of planning and conducting of the workshop, the Steering Committee was acutely aware of the challenges involved in bringing individuals together from different perspectives, cultures and experiences.

The combination of formal presentations with smaller break-out sessions for discussion and networking provided opportunities for participants to gain information about model programs and meet with their counterparts from across Alaska, other parts of the U.S., Canada and Russia. For many of the participants from small, remote communities in Alaska, this was an important and rare opportunity to connect with others working on similar projects and/or issues.  Key Conclusions:    CBM programs are collaborative in nature and involve partnerships between community-based data collectors and researchers, agencies, and organizations that use the data.  Successful and sustained partnerships result when goals are shared, benefits are achieved for all of the partners, and success is celebrated.  Ongoing, two-way communication is designed to share information among partners and to build lasting relationships.  Cultural considerations must be addressed  when the "data" collected includes local and Traditional Native Knowledge.  CBM programs often require flexibility during implementation in response to changing needs identified through on-going communication and collaboration.   Products  CBM Handbook for Alaska and the Arctic      The publication Community-Based Monitoring of AlaskaÆs Coastal and Ocean Environment: Best Practices for Linking Alaska Citizens with Science summarized the "lessons learned" by CBM practitioners based on the presentations and break-out group discussions summarized from this workshop and the experiences of presenters and participants. Subject areas explored included a comparison of the perspectives of diverse participants in CBM programs, designing for success, collecting, interpreting, and using scientific data and Traditional Knowledge; and measuring success. The handbook can be downloaded as a .pdf as a free Alaska Sea Grant publication at  www.seagrant.uaf.edu/bookstore/pubs/SG-ED-78.html .      Alaska CBM Website      Alaska Sea Grant and the Alaska Ocean Observing System are co-sponsors of the website ww.aoos.org/alaska-community-based-monitoring/ which provides links to the workshop presentations, the handbook, and other resources.   Impacts      Based on the results of a post-workshop survey by an outside evaluator, a majority of respondents were actively engaged in CBM and found the workshop to have been "greatly" or "quite" useful. They increased their knowledge of CB...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
