<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diffusive motions of atoms can lead to changes in the physical properties of solids over time that range from simple composition variations to the formation and growth of new structures.  The effects of these changes (which can be advantageous or disadvantageous) become significant at lower temperatures, shorter time periods, and smaller length scales as the sample size is reduced.  As a result, a fundamental understanding of the origins and consequences of these processes is particularly important in nanostructured materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research component of this project consists of an experimental and computational study of  diffusive atomic motion  in bimetallic samples at the nano-scale.  The analysis of the experimental and computational results will provide a detailed microscopic picture of diffusive motion in these nanostructures over a wide range of length and time scales, and ultimately will contribute to the design, synthesis, and processing of new materials with useful properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational and outreach component of the project consists of the development of a new undergraduate/graduate level course in the practical application of x-ray diffraction methods, providing meaningful research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and an outreach program targeted at junior and senior level high school students by participating in the Delaware Science Olympiad.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While solid-state diffusion (SSD) and new phase formation (NPF) in multicomponent bulk and two-dimensional (2D) thin film systems has been studied for many years, much less is known about SSD and NPF in zero-dimensional (0D) and one-dimensional (1D) diffusion couples.  The research component of this project has been designed to address this issue through a systematic experimental and computational study of the structural evolution in 0D core/shell nanoparticles and 1D multilayered nanowires.  In particular, the structural evolution of chemically prepared 0D and electrochemically prepared 1D diffusion couples will be experimentally studied using both optical pump/x-ray probe ultrafast time-resolved x-ray diffraction (TRXRD) and conventional high temperature x-ray powder diffraction (cXRD) measurement techniques.  These experimental studies will be complemented by computational studies of SSD and NPF in model 0D and 1D diffusion couples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental component of the research project will consist of pump/probe TRXRD measurements carried out using in-house facilities and facilities available at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory.  In both cases a Ti:sapphire laser will be used to pump the sample with an approximately 50 femtosecond optical pulse followed by an x-ray probe pulse.  The optical pump leads to a very rapid increase in the same temperature, and by delaying the arrival of the x-ray pulse relative to the pump pulse temperature depend x-ray diffraction patterns can be acquired with a time resolution of 10's - 100's of femtoseconds over time periods from 10's to 100's of nanoseconds.  Conventional high temperature powder x-ray diffraction measurements (cXRD) will allow complementary structural measurements to be carried out over much longer time periods (although with limited time resolution).  The computational component of the research project will consist of modeling SSD and NPF in 0D and 1D diffusion couples by combining density functional theory calculations with cluster expansion methods and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.  Computational studies of this kind are of particular importance because they are applicable at the short length scales over which continuum models break down.  These experimental and computational studies will provide a detailed microscopic picture of SSD and NPF in 0D and 1D nanostructures over both very short and very long time scales, and ultimately will contribute to the design, synthesis, and processing of new materials with useful properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit and broader impacts of our work derive from the increased understanding it has provided of solid-state diffusion and new phase formation in nanostructured diffusion couples, the multidisciplinary research opportunities it has provided to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students (including, in the latter case, hands-on experience working at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source), and it's support of STEM education more broadly through the development of a new undergraduate/graduate-level course in the practical application of powder x-ray diffraction and support of the Delaware Science Olympiad.  A major outcome of our work has been to demonstrate that the structural evolution of nanostructured diffusion couples can be followed with sub 100 ps time resolution utilizing the synchrotron-based optical pump/x-ray probe facilities available at the Advanced Photon Source (APS).  For example, we have shown that photo-excitation of a Pt/Au thin film multilayer with a single 1 ps duration optical laser pulse initiates a time ordered series of events starting with the melting of the Au layers and their re-solidification followed by the formation of a Au-Pt alloy by a solid-state diffusion process.  The melting of the Au layers takes place in less than 100 ps, their subsequent re-solidification is completed within about 10 ns, and about 90% of the original multilayer has been converted to a Au-Pt alloy within about 1 ms.  These efforts suggested that much higher quality data could have been obtained if one could optimize the intrinsic trade-off between the use of the low intensity/highly monochromatic (small energy bandwidth) and high intensity/polychromatic (large energy bandwidth) x-ray pulses typically available at the APS.   Motivated by this observation we have designed and constructed a new double-bounce thin film x-ray monochromator that has allowed the intensity and bandwidth of synchrotron produced x-ray pulses to be optimized for the requirements of a particular material and experiment.  This new capability has the potential for expanding the application of synchrotron-based optical pump/x-ray probe measurement techniques to the study of a wide range of irreversible solid-state processes.  Our work at the APS has been supported by about 8 - 10 days of beam time per year over the course of the project.  From an educational standpoint, this work has provided many opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to gain a broad range of research experiences in the chemical and physical preparation of nanostructured materials and their characterization using a suite of modern experimental, in-house, laboratory-based structural (x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy), magnetic (vibrating sample magnetometry), thermal (differential scanning calorimetry, differential thermal analysis), and spectroscopic (UV-vis spectrometry) tools.  In addition, our work at the APS has allowed each of the three graduate students who have worked on this project to gain hands-on experience with the state-of-the-art facilities available at the APS.  These activities have been promoted by the University of Delaware as one aspect of a recently signed cooperation agreement between the University and Argonne National Laboratory.  From a broader standpoint, our development of a new course in the "Practical Aspects of X-Ray Powder Diffraction" has attracted physics, chemistry, and engineering students with a general interest in x-ray diffraction.  As a result, this class has now been incorporated into the general course offerings of the Physics Department at the University of Delaware and will be offered as part of the standard course curriculum approximately every other year. Members of our project team have also participated in the annual Delaware Science Olympiad as session organizers and as guest speakers.  The outcomes of this project include two published papers, several additional papers nearing completion, about 16 presentations at national scientific conferences, one completed physics Ph.D thesis, and a chemistry thesis to be completed during the summer of 2019.  About 6 undergraduate students have participated in the project, two have matriculated to graduate programs at the University of Delaware (one in the Physics Department and one in the Mathematics Department) and one at Rice University.  One of our high school students currently has an offer to attend Princeton starting in the fall of 2019.
