<AbstractNarration>Metal ions play an important role in building nature-adaptive and responsive structures such as bones and proteins by interacting with biomolecules. Polymer hydrogel fibers have great potential applications in tissue engineering because they can provide a cell-friendly environment for cell growth. However, their application is limited by the poor stability of these fibers in aqueous environments.  Inspired by natural metal ion/biomolecule interactions, adding metal ions to charged polymer blends can improve the stability of polymeric hydrogel fibers and introduce useful functionalities.  This award supports fundamental research to produce stable hydrogel nanofibers from metal ion-containing charged polymer blends, to understand how the interactions between the metal ions and polymers affect the nanofiber's structure and property, and to explore the fabrication of nanoparticles using the metal ions. The method will produce stable hydrogel nanofibers with various functionalities that find applications in healthcare, biomedical, sensing and energy industries. The research will involve chemistry and materials science and engineering, and will offer excellent interdisciplinary research opportunities for students. The education and outreach activities will help broadening participation of underrepresented groups in research, and contribute to the workforce training and student recruitment in the field of science and engineering.  Results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogel fibers are promising candidates for manufacturing functional nanofibers for various applications but face challenges of low stability in aqueous solutions and ineffective further functionalization. Adding metal ions to complex polyelectrolytes can improve the stability of hydrogel nanofibers through metal ion/polyelectrolyte interactions and also enable the production of nanostructures on the fibers. The research team will study how the interactions between metal ions and polyelectrolytes affect the fiber's morphology, structure and property, as well as study the diffusion of metal ions from fibers. Furthermore, the team will use the embedded metal ions to produce different types of nanoparticles, which offers a novel approach for manufacturing nanomaterials. The results of the project will provide important guidance to manufacturing nanostructures using hydrogel fibers. The success of this transformative research will provide rational and predictable design rules for manufacturing multifunctional hydrogel nanofibers with structural and property control for various applications such as sensing and tissue engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objective of the proposed research is to fundamentally investigate the interaction of various metal ions with charged polymers in their blends and the impact of such interactions on the structure and morphology of electrospun hydrogel fibers (EHFs), and the nanoparticles produced on hydrogel fibers. In the first project, blends of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and chitosan were mixed with metal ions with difference charges (e.g. sodium, calcium, ferric and cerium ions) and electrospun into hydrogel fibers. The diffusion rate of metal ions and the structure of nanoparticles produced from metal ions were investigated. &nbsp;It was discovered that the metal ion-polymer interactions play an important role in metal ion diffusion kinetics in hydrogel fibers. The diffusion rate and reaction rate determine the position of nanoparticles synthesized from the metal ions.&nbsp; The correlation between metal ion diffusion profiles and nanoparticles&rsquo; location and structures opens up new avenue for controlled nanofabrication and surface modification of EHFs.</p> <p>Based on information from first project, in the second project, manganese and ferric ions were loaded into PAA fibers and used to produce small manganese oxide nanoparticle in PAA fibers and polypyrrole (PPy) shells on PAA fibers, respectively. In the MnO<sub>2</sub>@PAA/PPy core-shell composite fibers, MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles function as high capacity materials while polypyrrole shell prevents the loss of MnO<sub>2</sub> during charge-discharge process. Such unique structure makes the composite fibers efficient electrode materials for supercapacitors.</p> <p>In the third project, we used dark field microscopy imaging and persistence length analysis to investigate the mechanics of single electrospun hydrogel fibers. Traditionally, atomic force microscopy is used to study the mechanics of individual fibers through a direct three-point bend test.&nbsp; The process is slow and expensive. We demonstrated that persistence length analysis is a viable indirect approach in evaluating the mechanical properties of hydrated electrospun poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and PAA/chitosan fibers with difference concentrations of ferric ions. The Young&rsquo;s modulus of the nanofibers was estimated at values of a few kiloPascals, which is in agreement with the Young&rsquo;s modulus of hydrated hydrogel fibers. Ferric ions were found to affect nanofiber characteristics optimally at lower concentrations, allowing for shorter and stiffer nanofibers. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Infrared Nanospectroscopy (NanoIR) spectra indicated that ferric ions interact with carboxylate groups in PAA.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the fourth project, we deposited PAA/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on 3D printed microelectrode platforms fully functional for 3D cell culture applications. To demonstrate the platform&rsquo;s capability of releasing drugs, silver ions were loaded into PAA/PVA fibers and reduced to produce silver nanoparticles of 5-15 nms. The Ag NP served as a model drug and the release was confirmed by the bacterial-inhibition zones with two different types of bacteria. This study displayed the versatility of nanofibers integrated with the 3D printed microelectrodes in applications.</p> <p>This program provides fundamental understanding of the effect of metal ion/polymer interactions on metal ion diffusing behavior, the mechanical properties of hydrogel fibers and the structure of nanoparticles produced from metal ions. The understanding leads to the application of the materials in energy storage and biomedical applications. This program also facilitates multidisciplinary collaborations and student training. The program has supported five graduate students (three female students). Four undergraduate students involved in the program through NSF REU program.
