<AbstractNarration>This project creates an integrated pollution identification grid that provides detailed, real-time data on air pollution creation points.  Utah Valley, like other areas of the country, experiences severe unhealthy "inversion" days, and localized air pollution "hot spots" throughout the year. These conditions cause major health problems for people living and working throughout the valley. Current air pollution monitoring utilizes a limited number of fixed sampling and data collection points with little opportunity to create control methods to reduce pollution levels in real-time as they change throughout the day. The air quality at street level is generally unknown.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides a system to collect real-time, interactive data on the location, time, direction, and amount of pollution created to support pollution control efforts underway by various public and private entities in the state. Mobile monitoring units and large-bandwidth wireless networks allow the data to be collected, processed, and reported in real time.  With this information, air pollution hot spots can be identified and responses taken immediately to correct pollution causing conditions and improve overall air quality. The key technical elements of the project are the collection of continuous data from mobile monitoring units mounted on vehicles owned by government agencies, commercial fleets and private cars, then using high-speed wireless systems to backhaul the data to a central data center.  With this information, air pollution hot spots are identified and responses taken immediately to correct pollution causing conditions and improve overall air quality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Goal of the Project  The goal of this project was to create an application that provides more complete real-time data on air pollution than is currently available for the creation of air quality maps in a specific region.  Having accurate, real-time, air quality data can alter the actions of community members to minimize health impacts.  It can also make the community more aware of how its actions affect air quality by closely tying together the cause and impact of pollution creation decisions. Making real-time data available can have immediate as well as long-term impact on the community.   Specifically, this project attempted to create an integrated pollution identification grid that provided detailed, real-time data on air pollution creation points.  Utah Valley, like other areas of the country, experiences severe unhealthy "inversion" days, and localized air pollution "hot spots" throughout the year. These conditions can cause major health problems for people living and working throughout the valley.  This project attempted to provide a system to collect real-time, interactive data on the location, direction, and amount of pollution. This data could then support pollution control efforts underway by various public and private entities in the state.    What was Accomplished  After meeting with community leaders regarding specific air pollution concerns and doing preliminary research, the team was better able to identify the pertinent data needed. This information was then used to adapt the deployment plan of the monitors to gather actionable data with a limited number of parameters.  The original proposal did not anticipate the construction of any air monitoring devices, but since no low-cost monitoring devices were available for purchase, it was ultimately necessary to construct test devices with a limited number of parameters. The graphic representation of the parameter data was achieved using ArcGIS modeling which allowed the pollutant values to be identified anywhere in the test area.  Several low-cost air-monitoring prototypes were created and tested as both mobile and fixed monitoring stations.  Second-generation designs were explored. Future research will be needed to test these designs.  The graphical interface and remote data transfer projects were completed, but will need ongoing refinement for use with future designs.  Dissemination of Results  The project team presented at the US-Ignite Smart Gigabit Summit in Austin, TX, in the summer of 2016. The team won first place for "Best Connectivity Across Communities."  The project results were presented at an additional conference in San Diego and to the Utah County Air Pollution Task Force.

Utah Air Quality Monitoring Using Fixed and Mobile Stations. 2016 Esri User Conference. San Diego, CA. Status = PUBLISHED;  Acknowledgement of Federal Support = Yes   Impact of the Research  The principal disciplines involved are Remote Sensing, GIS, Electronics, Network and Web Design, Engineering and Air Pollution, and Informational Systems and Technology. Each discipline is contributing their specialty to the team activity to achieve the goal and objectives of the project. The project is contributing new knowledge to the team members through the solution of issues and the working with team members with different expertise.  The project provides new tools of analysis to individuals and organizations that will make their work more effective as it relates to air quality monitoring.  The project is affiliated with the nationwide US-Ignite effort to create community applications to take advantage of gigabit network capabilities.  Ultimately, this research will establish network and necessary protocols to allow rapid data transfer from monitoring stations for internal analysis, data processing, and the creation of air quality maps, and dissemination to end users.  The project benefits end-users that control infrastructure by providing them with real-time data on air quality.  This data can be used by community groups and governments to intelligently respond to increasing air pollution issues as well as develop plans for improving air quality.   As part of the US-Ignite family of communities the methodology will benefit other communities who want to track and improve their air quality.  It is expected that as the product is rolled out in additional communities, new applications and processes will be developed that will benefit all communities.
