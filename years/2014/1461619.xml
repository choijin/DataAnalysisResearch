<AbstractNarration>Diversity is an important issue in academic communities. The Journeys in World Politics project seeks to enhance gender diversity in an area of political science research that has been male-dominated historically, the study of international relations, although the success of the Journeys  mentoring program can be generalized to other projects to advance gender and racial diversity in political science and other academic disciplines. The Journeys in World Politics workshops provide mentoring for young female Political Scientists. The three day workshops support 18-20 participants and include research presentations by junior scholars and feedback from discussants, oral autobiographies by senior scholars, and career and gender discussion sessions involving topics such as networking, balancing family and work, negotiating salary, and gender issues in the classroom. The project provides active mentoring for female scholars and connects the workshop participants to broader networks of women in academia. Our project tracks the success of participants through a series of follow up surveys and comparisons of participants to their academic peer groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many studies have evaluated the status of women in political science over the past 30 years. Several indicators - differences in salaries, differences in publication rates in the top political science journals, differences in publication rates in books and edited volumes, differences in placement at research versus teaching institutions, differences in satisfaction with graduate school training, differences in scholarly citations, and increasing attrition rates for female scholars at all academic levels - evidence a significant gender gap in the field.  While recent studies show some decline in this gender gap, the under-representation of female scholars at top research institutions and high rank levels is problematic. Proactive solutions to these structural problems have been evaluated and among the most promising avenues for change are active mentoring and the creation of friendly and nurturing academic environments. The Journeys in World Politics program applies this knowledge by providing mentoring and networking for young female scholars, creating opportunities to mentor female PhDs outside their home departments. The program also allows for collection of more systematic data to evaluate the impact of mentoring programs on long-term success rates for female political scientists. NSF Funds will be used to support the costs of the workshops, to track the success of the mentoring program through survey research and collection of outcomes assessment data, to support a formal evaluation of the Journeys workshops, to support publications on the Journeys program, and to build networks of women in political science more broadly.</AbstractNarration>
