<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)program and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) program, Professor Michael Neidig and collaborators from the University of Rochester will acquire a multiwavelength Raman spectrometer built around a triple spectrometer with multiple laser lines to allow collection of Raman data from the near-IR to near-UV regions.  Raman spectroscopy in this region is used to measure the vibrational frequencies of a material. This provides information on the chemical composition and structure of substances. It is a widely used tool to understand the properties of chemical and biological systems and in materials research. The instrument will be a multi-user facility open to users at the university and in the Rochester area including faculty at St. John Fisher College and SUNY-Geneseo. It will advance the training of students in their research and course work at all levels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) investigating structure, bonding and mechanism in non-precious metal catalysis for organic syntheses; (b) carrying out ultrafast photochemistry probed by femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy; (c) analyzing biological specimens at the cell and tissue level; (d) studying second-sphere effects in heme proteins and engineered metalloproteins for energy conversion; (e) analyzing compounded prescriptions; (f) elucidating binding conformation of A-beta peptides over gold nanocolloids; and (g) studying hollow microneedles for gene delivery in living cells.</AbstractNarration>
