<AbstractNarration>Professor Kerry W. Hipps of Washington State University is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct studies using scanning tunneling microscopy on several basic temperature-dependent surface problems of fundamental and technical importance at the solid-solution interface.  A variable temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) will be customized and used to conduct the proposed research.  Processes occurring at the solid solution interface can be dramatically affected by temperature, and understanding these temperature induced processes at the molecular level will facilitate advances in several science research fields including surface chemistry, catalysis, adhesion, corrosion, photophysics, and self-assembly in industrial and biological systems.  The results from this research may lead to inexpensive and efficient manufacturing methods in areas such as opto-electronic devices, solar cells and sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to customize a variable temperature instrument to mitigate the problems associated with STM imaging at elevated temperatures, such as thermal drift, temperature differences between different parts of the instrument, and solvent evaporation and condensation on the STM head and other parts of the instrument.  The newly customized instrument will be employed to study several basic temperature-dependent surface problems of fundamental as well as practical importance. These include: 1) structures, formation kinetics and thermodynamics of physical adsorbates at the solution solid interface; 2) chemical reactions at the solid-solution interface; 3) phase transformations in covalently attached monolayers; and mechanisms and kinetics of chemical transformations of preformed organic adlayers.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in chemistry and instrument construction, two areas for which cross-training is particularly valuable.  The results of this study will be incorporated in higher level courses in Chemistry and Materials Science.  During the course of conducting this research, the research team will perform outreach activities through the WSU "Imagine Tomorrow" high school energy program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award entitled, "Scanning tunneling microscopy of temperature dependent molecular processes at the solution-solid interface," contributed to the science and society in three ways.  First, it demonstrated that well-ordered and even designed surface molecular structures were often controlled by how fast they happend (kinetics) rather than what structure gave the minimum energy (thermodynamics).  This knowledge leads to new ways to rationally design molecular surface structures. These types of structures will likely be of technological importance for catalysis, for making new and more efficient sensors, and for producing the next generation of electronics.  Thus, this aspect of our work provided new scientific insight and contributed to technology.  It should be noted that these studies required the acquisition of thousands of pictures at the single molecule resolution level at various concentrations and temperatures.        Second, the work supported by the NSF resulted in the development of new instrumentation and techniques for studying temperature dependent processes at the single molecule level. We have demonstrated that both gas environment and sample temperature can be varied over a wide range and still allow real-time imaging of single molecule processes at the solution-solid interface.  As part of this instrument development, we have used 3D modeling (Solidworks 2016) and COSMOL Multiphysics to design fluid cells for variable temperature STM.  One such design is shown in the figure.  These cells were optimized to minimize the diffusional and convective delays in changing the concentration of the solution at the sample surface.  This is critical for cells that will be used for the study of kinetics.     Third, it provided scientific and technological training for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. Three postdoctoral fellows were at least partially supported under this grant:  Dr.s Bhaskar Chilukri, Marshall Van Zjill, and Goutam Nandi.  Two graduate students completed their dissertations on this work (Ashish Bhattarai and Abdolreza Jahanbekam).  Ashish is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Pacific Northwest National Labs, and Reza is a Scientist II at Medtronic Inc. in Minneapolis.  Another graduate student (Kirill Gurdumov) has worked on this project and he continues on to earn his PhD.  Several undergraduates have also worked on this project.  They include Tiffany Zhao, Lance Keithley, Wynn Miller, and Kevin Owens (a student at an HBS).  It should also be noted that the research conducted under this award led to new research that has been funded by NSF.  One project is on cooperative behavior at surfaces and the other concerns the fundamental processes associated with the interaction of molecules in solution with surfaces.
