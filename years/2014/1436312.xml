<AbstractNarration>In this project, an investigator participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will make measurements of methane, a dissolved trace gas, as well as the dissolved trace elements of gallium, barium, and vanadium in the Arctic Ocean. In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. The trace elements and gas measured as part of this project will be used as tracers for a variety of processes such as river and atmospheric inputs to the Arctic Ocean, as well as circulation in the region. The knowledge and experience gained from this project will be incorporated into courses in oceanography and marine chemistry, as well as be shared through public outreach activities. The project will support the scientific training of a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tracers to be measured as part of this study, methane, gallium, barium, and vanadium, will provide important information about oceanic circulation and water inputs to the Arctic. Gallium is likely to prove a sensitive tracer for Atlantic versus Pacific water components in the western Arctic Ocean, an issue of interest in circulation studies and also relevant to projections of the stability of methane hydrates on the Arctic shelves. Barium is of interest because it has been shown to be an indicator of fluvial inputs and contributions to the halocline. This is pertinent to understanding upper ocean circulation in the Arctic as well as to freshwater contributions to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. For vanadium, the large proportion of shelf area in the Arctic makes this an ideal region to examine whether shelf sediment uptake determines surface ocean vanadium depletion. For methane, Arctic waters are a significant source of this Greenhouse Gas to the atmosphere and global change is likely exacerbating its release. Determination of the methane distribution will therefore be of interest in and of itself, although it is also a potentially valuable indicator of interactions with the shelf as well as of river inputs. Overall, results from this study will lead to an increased understanding of key ocean biogeochemical and physical processes including cross margin exchange of materials, sources of water in the Arctic Ocean, and fluxes of methane to the atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Arctic Ocean is a key region in global climate for various reasons including the vast amount of organic carbon and methane stored there as well as the role it plays in contributing fresh water to the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. This high latitude region is particularly sensitive to impacts of climate change: studies of chemical distributions in the Arctic Ocean can provide insight into changes both in water masses/water sources as well as into the biogeochemistry and biology of the Arctic Ocean. Trace elements are important because some can be trace nutrients affecting productivity (e.g., iron), some are potentially toxic indicators of human impacts (e.g., mercury), and some are indicators of various input and removal processes (e.g., vanadium). <br /><br />We proposed studies of selected dissolved trace elements along with dissolved methane in association with the 2015 US GEOTRACES Arctic section, which went from the Aleutians to the North Pole and back. This cruise offered a unique opportunity to collect samples through the western Arctic and participate in related studies of chemical fluxes in this important environment. We also obtained similar sets of samples collected in 2015 Canadian and European scientists to get a broader representation of Arctic Ocean geochemistry. Barents Sea samples were also obtained from Russian colleagues. Figure 1 shows sample locations. <br /><br />Besides trace elements, we also examined the distribution of dissolve methane. Methane is a greenhouse gas responsible for ~20% of anthropogenic warming; it also plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry. Within the Arctic, there is particular interest in the effects of climate warming on methane reservoirs including those in permafrost and shelf sediment hydrates. The economic costs of the release of methane from these stored reservoirs could be staggering due to its impact on global warming and ultimately sea level rise.<br /><br />Our research revealed a number of important and useful findings:<br /><br />1. We contributed to two research papers involving multiple groups of investigators examining the impact of atmospheric input on trace element distributions on Arctic Ocean waters. This is important because some trace nutrients and contaminants are primarily delivered to the ocean from the atmosphere. As the extent and timing of ice cover on the Arctic Ocean changes, the timing of the input of these atmospheric materials...and their impact on biological processes...will change.<br /><br />2. We found that dissolved gallium (Ga) concentrations help distinguish waters derived from the Atlantic Ocean versus the Pacific Ocean. Unraveling these contributions is important because the inflowing Atlantic waters have a greater potential for global change effects (such as release of trapped sedimentary methane) than Pacific waters. Our data show a more realistic separation of Atlantic and Pacific waters than had previously been estimated from nutrient distributions. In particular, our results indicate a greater contribution of Pacific water in the western Arctic Ocean compared to estimates from previous methods. <br /><br />3. We found that processes on the margins of the Arctic Ocean basin, particularly the shallow shelf areas, can strongly affect the distributions of certain trace elements. The exchange of material between the shelves and open waters is an important process that can affect biological productivity. We demonstrated that dissolved vanadium (V) gets removed over the continental shelves by particle scavenging coupled with reducing conditions. Because of this, low dissolved V concentrations in the central Arctic Ocean basins are indicative of shelf exposure. <br /><br />4. Dissolved barium (Ba) has previously been applied in the Arctic Ocean as a tracer of river waters, and it has also been noted that Ba concentrations tend to be lowest in Atlantic-derived waters. We see similar trends: concentrations are highest in surface waters and Pacific-derived water types and lowest in deeper, Atlantic-derived waters. <br /><br />5. Dissolved methane concentrations in our section are highest over the continental shelves and slope, which supports our understanding of the major sources of methane (i.e., from microbes in oxygen limited sediments, from gas seeps, and from gas-hydrates). Current-induced resuspension of seafloor sediments at the shelf break may release greater amounts of methane to the water column than regions without mixing at the seafloor.
