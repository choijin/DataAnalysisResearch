<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to implement an integrative curriculum in genomics and bioinformatics, by using direct research-based learning approaches based on modern techniques, and to examine the impact of this curriculum on increasing the number of Puerto Rican students choosing to pursue scientific and research career paths. This project will provide a unique platform for studying the effect of the integrated education on career choices in a major underrepresented minority-serving institution with students encompassing the whole socioeconomic spectrum of the Puerto Rican society. The major educational objective of this project is to establish an undergraduate curricular sequence starting from teaching genomics and bioinformatics, through collaborative class project to fostering independent and original research by the undergraduates. Participation in undergraduate research activities and authorship, along with academic achievement are among the significant factors mediating the effect of race/ethnicity in the scientific career choices.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major research objective is incorporated into the curricular sequence and will result in an on-line map of human genome diversity across the island of Puerto Rico. The long-term goal is to create independent researchers through implementing dozens of student-initiated projects that will be communicated in various forms, including platform presentation participation in undergraduate research symposia, presentations at national meetings, online reports and peer-reviewed publications. Endpoints and outcomes such as test grades, pre- and post- evaluation of the general knowledge on the topic, perceptions of the research experience, evaluation of the course, mentorship, and recommendations to other students, as well as attitude towards entering graduate schools or other careers related to STEM disciplines, will be recorded for all participants. These outcomes will be correlated with the socioeconomic status and the career choice attitudes before, during and after application of the courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hispanic minority students self-perceive themselves as having greater difficulties of succeeding in academia, thus, creating an obstacle for engaging into research career paths. A disparity in socioeconomic status among students adds additional variance to the career decisions.  We anticipated that participation of students in undergraduate research activities in genomics and bioinformatics, along with academic achievement are factors mediating these effect in the scientific career choices. Therefore, the major goal of this project is to develop and implement an integrative curriculum in genomics and bioinformatics, and to study career choices of students exposed to the research oriented training.   In this project, we directly applied the research-based learning approaches using modern techniques in next generation sequencing (Ion Torrent) and bioinformatics analysis (PYTHON), transitioning students into the independent research in genomics using class projects, and providing opportunities to the mentored or independent research in the labs of the P.I. and the co.-P.I.s of this project. We have been able to implement three cycles of this curriculum with 12 undergraduate students in each cycle, and involve and support seven graduate students at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.  Simultaneously, we evaluated the courses and the procees of lerning, and examined the impact or resarch based education on Puerto Rican undergraduate students from different socioeconomic backgrounds choosing to pursue scientific and research careers. The family income and the parent?s education seems to have a decisive role in the self-declared career choice. Participants all agreed that the courses in genomics have helped them in their career choice.  The students that participated in the LGDS research reported a slightly higher percentage of those who would like to continue graduate studies.   This study supported several independent student-lead research that included sequencing, annotating, and analyzing genome data.  Each project involved one or more undergraduate student.  Most of these projects also involved graduate students who are either in process of or already defended their M.S. thesis, who lead these projects, or generally mentored and supervised the undergraduates involved. Overall evaluation to the genomic courses was given as "excellent", and 100% would recommend this course sequence to others.   One of the main research projects that the students were involved in supported the analysis of genetic diveristy across the island of Puerto Rico: a systematic collection of samples has been completed across all 78 municipalities of Puerto Rico, including islands of Vieques and Culebra. Distribution of genetic markers shows influences of indicating admixture between the three source populations (African, European and Native American) other evolutionary processes such as drift and selection may also be determining frequencies of the medically relevant markers in the island population of Puerto Rico.  Other pojects involved assemblies of Caribbean animals (parrots, solenodons) as well as design of the Puerto Rican Geovisualization System (PRGWS) a website dedicated to visualization of the results of the island wide gennomics study.
