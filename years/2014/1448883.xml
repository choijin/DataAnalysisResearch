<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to lower manufacturing costs in the photovoltaic (PV) industry. In the past decade, the solar energy industry has seen double digit compound annual growth rates. This success has resulted in the industry consuming nearly 10 percent of the global silver production. The cost of metallization on silicon solar cells has become a notable cost driver for the manufacturers and the lack of stability of silver spot prices increases the volatility in this highly competitive industry. The successful implementation of copper inks would lead to significant cost savings, due to copper being around 100 times cheaper than silver. This project supports a materials research and development for a renewable energy industry that has the potential to offer significant cost savings to a very large industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop copper based inks and pastes with an in-built diffusion barrier.  The inks and pastes will be formulated from copper nanoparticles manufactured in solution phase. During this stage barrier layers will be grown directly upon the particles.  This project will study the growth mechanisms of the nanoparticles and performance of the diffusion layer using high tech analysis techniques. The inks will be designed to be thermally processed using intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment, an advanced manufacturing technology. Reaction kinetics during IPL treatment will also be investigated in order to optimize ink formulations. This project will result in the formulation of two copper based inks for screen and ink jet printing, with optimized thermal processing conditions. Metal contacts formed with these inks will show that the barriers mitigate diffusion of copper into silicon and are a viable option for the replacement of the current silver contacts on silicon solar cells.</AbstractNarration>

Over the past 3 years this has resulted in an overall module price reduction of approximately 20%. This has led to pressure on cell and module manufacturers profit margins, with the only winner being the consumer. With over 90% of the market share, crystalline silicon (Si) solar cells continue to dominate the PV market and as such, remain one of the leading consumers of silver (Ag) and aluminum (Al) pastes. The printing and heating of these contacts is a critical step in the production of cells, and affects both cell performance and lifetime. However, the high price of Ag continues to be one of the main non-Si based manufacturing expenses. One of the leading materials investigated to replace Ag is copper (Cu), due to the significant cost savings generated as a result of the bulk commodity price being almost 100 times lower, and is a primary goal for the PV industry. However the adoption of Cu is highly challenging, due to the chemical and physical nature of Cu resulting in a drop in performance when placed in direct contact to the Si.

Ink jet printing is a future prospect in the PV sector where thinner Si cells and narrower front contact patterns are desired to manufacture higher efficiency devices.
