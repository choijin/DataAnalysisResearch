<AbstractNarration>The development of novel methods in nuclear many-body theory is critical for the study of phenomena at the frontiers of astrophysics, mesoscopic science, fundamental physics and technology. As a mesoscopic system, the atomic nucleus reveals the transition from the macroscopic world, with pronounced statistical regularities, to the microscopic world, where individual quantum states can be identified and studied. In this project, using the atomic nucleus as a research laboratory, powerful theoretical methods will be developed for the study of generic properties of many-body systems, such as shell structure, superfluidity and superconductivity, particle decay and radiation, the onset of chaotic dynamics and its interplay with collective motion. The project puts a strong emphasis on the development of cross-disciplinary theoretical methods with applicability to various strongly-correlated many-body systems. Applications of these methods provide insights in a variety of nuclear physics phenomena, such as beta decay, charge-exchange reactions, electron capture, two-neutrino and neutrino-less double beta decay, and the weak interaction processes. The work pursued here will support in part the experimental programs concerning the physics of stable and exotic nuclei at radioactive beam facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed work is to find self-consistent high-precision solutions of the nuclear many-body problem, where masses, matter and charge distributions, spectra, decay and reaction rates can be calculated within the same framework at zero and finite temperatures. The mathematical apparatus for the generalized covariant response theory will be advanced beyond the existing formulation by means of Green's function techniques, involving extra dimensions accounting for nuclear superfluidity effects. The effects of coupling between single-particle and emergent collective degrees of freedom, coupling to the continuum and the formation of bubbles, skins and other exotic geometries will be included on equal footing. The project helps to answer fundamental questions, such as: What is the origin of chemical elements? Where are the limits of nuclear stability? What are the masses of neutrinos? The developed approach will allow for the consistent astrophysical modeling of such competing processes as beta-decay and neutron capture, and thereby remove the ambiguities arising from the nuclear physics input. This project will provide students with an intensive training of their analytical and numerical skills, serving as a basis for their future careers in industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes  Intellectual Merit   1. A new theoretical approach to nuclear spin-isospin excitations, based on the meson-exchange interaction and extending to complex emergent effects, has been developed. This is a significant step forward in understanding the microscopic mechanisms of the nuclear beta decay and in building an accurate and predictive theory, which helps to answer fundamental questions about the elemental composition of our universe and neutrino mass.  2. Nuclear response theory taking into account complex nucleonic correlations was formulated for the case of finite temperature. For this purpose, the relativistic time blocking approximation (RTBA) to the time-dependent part of the in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction amplitude was adopted to the thermal (imaginary-time) Green's function formalism. The developed method called finite-temperature RTBA was implemented self-consistently in the framework of quantum hadrodynamics based on meson-nucleon interaction for both neutral and charge-exchange nuclear responses. This approach will provide better understanding of the microscopic processes in ?hot? nuclei and accurate predictions for nuclear transitions of astrophysical interest.  3. The developed generalized response theory represents a step toward a more precise solution of the nuclear many-body problem, which aims at a unified description of both high frequency nuclear oscillations and low-energy spectroscopy. The generalized response theory truncated at the two-body level was linked to the underlying bare nucleon-nucleon interaction which opens a way toward an accurate ab initio description of the nuclear structure properties.   4. Altogether, the detailed studies of the coupling between the single-particle and collective degrees of freedom, pion exchange and superfluidity effects have lead to important conclusions about the nature of the in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction. Comparison of the theoretical calculations to experimental data from stable and radioactive beam facilities allowed for constraining and benchmarking the theory as well as for determining future research directions.  Research from this award resulted 17 journal publications, a review book chapter, 7 Conference Proceedings and 48 presentations at national and international meetings and academic seminars on nuclear physics: 39 invited talks (25 by the PI and 14 by the research associate) and 9 contributed talks (4 by the PI, 2 by the research associate and 3 by the graduate students).   The Broader Impact of this project includes: (i) training the next generation of scientists, (ii) raising the profile of female physicists, (iii) integration of the forefront research into the graduate program of Western Michigan University.    The project has provided training opportunities for three graduate students and one research associate. One graduate student and the research associate supported by this award are female. For their future careers, students benefit greatly from putting into practice theoretical concepts and computational algorithms they encountered in their classes. The students and the young postdoctoral associate involved in this project received training and gained experience in theoretical and computational physics, including nuclear theory, quantum field theory, programming, and presentation skills. After such a training, the young scientists can advance their research careers or work outside of academia, making use of the skills they acquired in solving complex theoretical physics problems.
