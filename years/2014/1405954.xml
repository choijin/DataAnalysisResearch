<AbstractNarration>Compilers are software tools that bridge the gap between the functions supported by hardware processor and high level programming languages.  Cetus is a compiler infrastructure at Purdue University, is publicly available (downloaded over 1000 times for use in compiler research), and has become an important part of the global compiler research infrastructure.  The Cetus compiler infrastructures supports the goals of the NSF CRI program by providing an easy to extend code base that allows the broader compiler research community to avoid having to repeatedly re-implement foundational compiler techniques and thereby accelerating the discovery of knowledge in the area of compilers and programming tools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work funded by this proposal has several goals. First, the group will continue to maintain this essential infrastructure for the community and to add enhancements that satisfy user requirements.   Second, the group will continue to keep Cetus' internal representations at a high level of abstraction allowing it to be used as a building block for instructional purposes.  Third, while Cetus is the most advanced program parallelizer, its capabilities will be further enhanced, particularly for GPU accelerators, for analyzing and optimizing irregular programs, and for auto-tuning programs for best results.  Finally, Cetus will be made available for use with Purdue's NanoHub, which is a cyber-infrastructure platform for research on emerging technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of the this project was to maintain and enhance the Cetus parallelizing compiler infrastructure.   An parallelizing compiler is a program that seeks to automatically transform a computer program into one that can run on  multiple processors or an accelerator.  Cetus has the advantage of being written at a very high level, making it  easier to modify and use in developing new parallelization and optimization techniques.   In the course of this project we have incorporated work from the OMP project that takes programs written using the shared memory OpenMP interface targeting shared memory programming to run on multiple processors.  We also incorporated the Hydra project code that allows Cetus to target accelerators that support OpenGL, such as AMD an Nvidia GPUS.   Cetus is released under an open source license at https://github.com/cetusopensource/Cetus.git.   In the course of the work supported by this grant we had releases in 2015 and 2016.   This grant supported, in full or in part, 6 students that earned PhDs and 3 students that earned MS degrees.  The PhD students used Cetus for all or part of their PhD work.   The work also supported two workshops on Compiler Infrastructures for Research and Education (WCIRE) which brought together faculty from around the world to discuss advances in compiler infrastructures.
