<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER award, the Chemistry Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Joshua G. Pierce of North Carolina State University. Professor Pierce will develop new methodologies for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles.  One aspect of the research allows efficient approaches to densely functionalized thiazolines providing unique nitrogen radical precursors for chemical synthesis.  A second research endeavor is asymmetric approaches for the construction of pyrrolidines, heterocycles commonly found in complex natural products.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Professor Pierce is engaged in a collaboration with the Natural Sciences Museum in Raleigh, NC involving a series of Science Cafes for the general public. The partnership also involves an interactive "synthesis lab" to engage K-12 students in organic chemistry and chemical biology.  Professor Pierce is a mentor for Project SEED students and NSF REU students at North Carolina State University.</AbstractNarration>

Through these efforts, several graduate and undergraduate students received hands-on training and mentorship, and this experience has propelled them to industry and further education. Finally, this award has allowed the development of innovative outreach programs with the local community through the museum of science in downtown Raleigh and for local elementary students through our development of a science fair assistance program for disadvantaged students.  The scientific outcomes of this award have led to 8 publications and 2 thesis documents, enabled both the PI and research personnel to travel to conferences to share their discoveries, and has build a set of preliminary data that will enable the pursuit of additional funding and publication.  A highlight of this work is the development of novel access to sulfur containing molecules that are exceptionally difficulty to access using known chemistry and these reactions have been adopted by industry and other academic labs.
