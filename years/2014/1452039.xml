<AbstractNarration>Organic molecules dissolved in aquatic ecosystems represent the largest pool of organic matter transported through river networks and one of the most complex mixtures on Earth. The processing of these organic molecules by microorganisms resulting in their conversion to CO2 contributes to the large exchange of CO2 between the aquatic environment and the atmosphere with implications for global climate change. Despite the importance of this phenomenon, as much as 80% of the organic carbon susceptible to microbial metabolism remains unidentified.  The goals of this study are to use recent advances in low through-put, ultra-high resolution analytical organic chemistry to identify and characterize the pool of biologically reactive molecules and to extend the ability of commonly used high through-put, low-resolution optical techniques to provide information about the temporal dynamics of these molecules in river networks. The outcomes of this research could advance the understanding of the link between the composition of organic molecules in a river network and the evasion of CO2 to the atmosphere, answering the question of what makes an organic molecule biodegradable.  The researchers will work with educators who teach K-12 students in making processes that are invisible to the naked eye accessible and compelling as the educators develop curricula that depict the influence of molecular geochemistry and microbial geobiology to life on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers hypothesize that: (1) biologically reactive but molecularly uncharacterized humic molecules account for the majority of dissolved organic matter that bacteria respire to CO2; (2) the constituents of colored or fluorescent dissolved organic matter can be associated with groups of individual molecular formulas through the use of advanced statistical analyses, including Spearman Rank and 2-D correlation analyses; and (3) dissolved organic matter molecules that are ubiquitous across distant watersheds span the biological reactivity spectrum, while molecules unique to a watershed are predominantly reactive and readily converted to CO2. The research will be performed in streams within 2 well characterized river basins, one in the temperate forests of Pennsylvania and one in the tropical evergreen forests of Costa Rica.  Water samples will be collected under baseflow and storm flow conditions, across stream orders and seasons, and separated into biological reactivity classes using stream water-fed plug flow bioreactors. The samples will be molecularly characterized using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry as well as UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence spectra with excitation emission matrices. The successful completion of the research should advance the ability to use optical sensors to understand carbon flow through river networks and advance the understanding of the molecular nature of the dissolved organic matter that fuels the evasion of CO2 from streams and rivers to the atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research carried out with support from the National Science Foundation made advancements in understanding how natural organic molecules enter streams and are processed by stream ecosystem microorganisms, mostly bacteria, as a primary source of energy for metabolism and carbon building blocks for growth. We sampled streams within two well-characterized river basins, one, White Clay Creek, in the temperate forests of Pennsylvania and the other, Rio Tempisquito, in the tropical evergreen forests of Costa Rica. In each watershed, sampling was performed in headwater streams, beginning where groundwater emerges from springs and forms a small stream channel and continuing downstream as tributary streams join the flow and form larger stream channels.  Chemical analyses of the stream waters included a measure of total dissolved organic carbon to determine how much organic matter was present, and measures of different properties of the organic matter.  Those measures included ultraviolet and visible light spectroscopy as well as fluorescence to determine the optical properties of the organic matter, high resolution mass spectrometry to provide chemical formulae for the organic matter, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to provide some chemical structural information.  Each of these measures was applied to the stream water samples before and after a bioassay that was used to determine biodegradability with organisms from the stream.    This research has led to the writing of several manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed scientific journals that describe: (1) the crystalline structure of soil minerals that favors the retention of dissolved organic matter in soils through adsorption; (2) a model that simulates microbial uptake of different forms of fluorescent organic matter flowing downstream; (3) the interaction of sunlight and dissolved organic matter and how that impacts biodegradability of the molecules; and (4) the protection of some small organic molecules from biodegradation through chemical interactions with positively charged ions in the stream water.    The project provided opportunities to mentor and train a post-doctoral student and three graduate students in the various chemical and biological assays, analysis and interpretation of the data, making oral presentations at international scientific meetings, and the writing of manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Additionally, because surface waters are often used as sources of potable water and the treatment of water supplies can involve biological filtration, this research may help drinking water utilities better understand the dynamics of organic matter removal from source waters through biodegradation.
