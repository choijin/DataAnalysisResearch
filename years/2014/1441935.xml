<AbstractNarration>The transfer of information from the genomic DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) during the process of gene expression provides an important way to control the genes responsible for specific biological processes.  Understanding how these processes work normally allows us a means to comprehend how they can change when organisms face alterations in their environment or evolve. Recently, it is clear that mRNA degradation is also an important means for regulating gene expression.  Thus, gaining a complete understanding of mRNA degradation mechanisms and its regulation are of critical interest. More recently, the spectacular use of interfering RNA to experimentally degrade specific mRNAs has expanded the applications of understanding mRNA decay mechanisms beyond any expectations. The Federation American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) meeting on mechanisms of mRNA decay from July 6th to 11th 2014 in Big Sky, Montana brings together the leading experts in mRNA decay in animal, fungal, plant, viral, bacterial, and archaeal systems. One of the chief benefits of this 5-day meeting is that it brings together experts who study mRNA degradation using various approaches and organisms, providing the opportunity for cross-fertilization and allowing many parallels between mRNA degradation in pro- and eukaryotes to become evident.  Both the size and planned organization of the meeting support junior investigators in the field of RNA degradation.  With only 100-150 attendees all being housed in the same venue, and with talks and posters only in the morning and evening, there is expected to be ample time and opportunity for informal interactions between junior and senior attendees.  Some of the oral presenters will be selected from submitted abstracts to give junior investigators the opportunity to present their work for critical viewing by the community.  In addition, poster sessions will allow others to display their work to stimulate conversations and feedback.  There will also be meet-the-expert sessions and opportunities to interact with them more informally during the meeting.  All of these aspects are viewed as positive enhancements of the professional development of junior investigators in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds will be used to reimburse seven speakers for about half their costs some selected from submitted abstracts. Priority for this support will be  students, post-docs, early-career independent investigators, and members of underrepresented groups who are members of the US scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
