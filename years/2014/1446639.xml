<AbstractNarration>The project funds the organization of a workshop on "Airborne Networking and Communications". The workshop, colocated with the ACM MobiHoc Symposium, will be held on August 11, 2014, in Philadelphia. The workshop will be the third in a series that started in 2012. Airborne Networking is an emerging area of cyber physical systems - and issues of control, processing, and networking lie at the heart of this field. It is important to build a foundational science to support this area as unmanned vehicles become more prevalent. The workshop brings top researchers in area together to help develop a research agenda and continue to further the field. In addition, strong outreach to undergraduate students for participation is a key component of the NSF funding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are primarily three outcomes from the series of workshops: (A) an understanding of the most important challenges in airborne networking and communications, (B) engaging students in research and (C) knowledge dissemination within the research community.   (A)   Understanding of the most important challenges in airborne networking   Airborne networking continues to be a challenging domain. The workshop series gave an opportunity for the researchers and professionals to share their expertise and learn from one another.  While many topics were discussed, the following represent a sample of the challenging problems in this domain.     UAV Traffic Management (UTM) Deployable  Communication Systems (DCS) Deploying UAVs in urban environment      Aerial communications and networking is the key to achieve success in integrating UAVs into the National Airspace.  (B)   The workshops provided an avenue for undergraduate and graduate students for demonstrating their own research and to learn from the experts in the field. In addition, participation in major conferences allowed them to understand the topic in a broader context.  (C)  Knowledge dissemination  Organizing the three workshops in conjunction with major conferences helped us to reach out to a larger community of researchers. The regular papers submitted to the workshop have already been disseminated to the research community through the conference proceedings. In addition, the following      A special issue on the topic of airborne networking was published in  IEEE Communications magazine, in May 2014. In collaboration with IEEE, a new working group (P1920.1) has been created to develop standards for aerial networking and communications. A textbook on "UAV Networks" co-edited by the PI will be published by the Cambridge University press in fall 2016.
