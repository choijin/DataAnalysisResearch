<AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will engage ten undergraduate students each summer in research on sustainable energy, including projects on wind, solar and bioenergy. This site will provide a rich research experience focused on the personal and professional development of the participants. Students will gain not only the technical abilities required to conduct research in sustainable energy, but will also become aware of the social and political issues associated with sustainable energy. By being involved in a team outreach project on sustainable energy, students will learn to communicate their research to broad audiences and about how their research fits into society. The REU site will also enhance the participation of students from underrepresented groups in research and in graduate school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will engage ten undergraduate students in research on sustainable energy each summer. The objectives of this REU site are to help students develop the technical skills necessary to conduct research on sustainable energy, an understanding of sustainability as an applied, multidisciplinary field, the ability to engage in life-long learning, and the ability to communicate engineering and science topics to K-12 students and public audiences.  The REU site will also enhance recruitment of students, particularly students from underrepresented minorities, into graduate studies in science and engineering. Towards meeting these objectives, participants will conduct research on biofuels, wind and solar energy, rechargeable batteries, small renewal energy systems, and algae. They will orally present the results of their research in a poster at a summer-ending research symposium. In addition to their research, students will participate in weekly seminars on sustainability and professional development.  They will attend field trips to see a wind farm and an ethanol plant, and be engaged in a number of community building activities (e.g., a visit to the Konza Prairie). A final key component of this project will be the inclusion of a team outreach project related to sustainability. In this project, groups of students will interact with K-12 students and public audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers is gratefully acknowledged.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thirty-one undergraduate students from multiple universities representing several science and engineering disciplines took part in the "Earth, Wind, and Fire: Sustainable Energy for the 21st Century" Research Experiences for Undergraduates from 2015-2018. The program had four primary objectives for the participating students:  To develop and apply knowledge and skills in the area of mathematics,   science, engineering, and research methods. To develop an understanding of sustainability as an applied   multidisciplinary field encompassing economics, science, technology, and   social, political, and ethical issues facing contemporary societies. To develop a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in   life-long learning by increasing the capacity for self-directed learning   and original investigation. To develop skills for communicating scientific and engineering   concepts to the public and to K-12 students.     Towards meeting these objectives, students participated in a variety of activities including a faculty-mentored research project, field trips to local facilities related to sustainable energy (wind farm and an ethanol plant), professional development seminars, a seminar series focused on sustainability, and a group outreach project related to sustainability.  The primary activity was a research project that focused on some theme of sustainable energy.  Some examples of research conducted include projects on wind energy, biofuels, batteries, solar energy, and solar charging stations for electric cars.   Each of these projects led to new knowledge that was reported in international conferences (eighteen conference presentations), in peer-reviewed journals (fourteen publications), and one book. We illustrate the research activities with a description of progress in one area of research: energy storage. Sustainable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy, can produce more energy than is demanded during certain times of day. This suggests that energy storage is a key technology to help further implement sustainable energy.  Towards this end, REU students have been researching material chemistry for potential application in batteries and supercapacitors. Harrison Gunn (2015) spent his time at K-State learning synthesis of graphene oxide and its characterization by various microscopy and spectroscopy techniques under the direction of Gurpreet Singh in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Harrison worked with other students in the lab to prepare a design of experiment approach to test the hypothesis that elimination of sodium nitrate as the oxidizing agent may lead to formation of graphene oxide with lower defects that may show high cycling efficiency toward alkali metal ions. He utilized Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy to characterize the synthesized material. Harrison then tested the optimized graphene oxide as a battery electrode. It showed high cycling efficiency of sodium-ion and higher cycling stability than traditional graphene. These results were presented at the MRS Spring -2016 and APS-March 2016 meetings.  Jonathan Turnley (2017) studied the electrochemical performance evaluation of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets as electrode materials for aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors. During the course of his study Jonathan learned to exfoliate nanosheets of TMD via liquid phase exfoliation; characterize the morphology by use of scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, and prepare electrochemical devices for two and three-electrode supercapacitor testing. Initial results suggest that sulfide and telluride TMDs outperform selenide TMDs and the tungsten TMDs outperform molybdenum TMDs in terms of areal capacitance and cycleability. Jonathan presented his research at the ASME's International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE) in Tampa, Florida.  In addition to their research projects, students were involved in a sustainability project. In these projects, students researched some aspect of sustainability, developed a presentation, publication, or activity based on this research, and delivered this product to the general public.
