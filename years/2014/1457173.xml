<AbstractNarration>Successful communication and social assessment require receivers to discern when signals are reliable and when they are not. Compounding the problem is that signal reliability varies between signalers and across time within signalers. Because communication systems are not intrinsically reliable, primates, especially humans, spend a great deal of time and resources assessing the reliability of information received from members of their own species. Surprisingly, hard-wired communication systems of animals with simpler communication systems than humans are proving no more reliable, and we do not know how receivers in these species deal with unreliability of signals. This project will focus on a species with less sophisticated cognition to examine how fundamental strategies have evolved to cope with unreliable signals, the most important outstanding scientific puzzle in the field of communication. The investigator will also continue a successful hands-on science pedagogy workshop series that brings inquiry-based teaching methods into middle school classrooms, as well as offering direct mentorship opportunities for minority college and high school students in the research lab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will address the central question by determining (1) whether receivers know when signals are reliable and when they are not, (2) whether receivers have strategies for addressing variable reliability and (3) whether signalers compensate for a receiver's lack of trust by providing more reliable information through other means. Male electric fish (Brachyhypopomus gauderio) are ideal for such investigation because their signal waveforms encode body length and androgen level with near perfect reliability, or virtually no reliability. Signal reliability in this system depends on population density and food availability. These variables will be controlled in the lab to promote reliable and unreliable signals, and to create prior exposure of receivers to signals that vary in reliability. Behavioral mate choice and male-male competition experiments will determine whether receivers assess reliability of a male signal by (i) monitoring prevailing social and food conditions, (ii) reviewing recent signal reliability, or (iii) whether receivers ignore signals and assess other, more reliable traits. The project will also determine whether signalers compensate for their lack of reliability by making the desired information readily available through other sensory strategies. Both raw and analyzed data are secured by the investigator prior to publication and made available for electronic sharing upon acceptance of the resulting manuscripts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merits  When animals communicate relevant information to rivals or prospective mates, these receivers must determine whether this information is sufficiently reliable to use when making important life decisions.  Assessing the quality of a signaler is difficult they exaggerate signals of quality, and much more difficult if signalers exaggerate only some of the time.  The ability of receivers to assess the reliability of signals is largely unexplored in the animal kingdom and constitutes one of the outstanding problems in the field of animal communication.  This project sought to determine whether fish that communicate with electricity in the dark of night ("weakly electric fish") attend to their neighbors? electric signals when assessing body size of competitive rivals.  This project found that electric signals can accurately convey body size or body condition of the signaler, but not under all environmental conditions, rendering the signals only intermittently reliable.  Because of intermittent signal reliability, it was unknown whether receivers would trust the signals in making socially important judgements of signaler quality. In the simplest case, receivers would always trust the signals, irrespective of environmental conditions. Alternately, they might never trust the signals.  Under a third, nuanced option, receivers would attend to the history of signals in their neighborhood and trust signals only when signals had been reliable in the recent past. A fourth possibility would be for receivers to assess current environmental conditions and trust signals only under conditions that promote signal reliability.  The data collected in this study revealed that male electric fish never trust the signal of a rival to make an assessment of his body size, ignoring both recent history and environmental conditions.  Rather, they insisted on taking direct measurements of their rival?s body size using their active electric sense, the bioelectric equivalent of sonar. This process requires close approach and more time, but proved absolutely reliable in guiding decisions of aggressive action during territorial encounters.  These results are the first findings that intermittent unreliability in a non-human signaling system is accompanied by complete lack of trust in the system, and reliance on a more trustworthy, but more expensive, sensory assessment process.     Broader impacts  The Miami-Dade County School District asked us to use our grant-enhanced resources to improve the training of middle school science teachers.  Accordingly, part of this project was to refine a training program for hands-on inquiry-based teaching, taking advantage of the broad diversity of organisms, equipment, and materials available in a well-stocked research lab.  Two cohorts of six middle school teachers spent a week in the lab each summer, receiving guidance in the creation and execution of an inquiry-based teaching curriculum.  This project was initiated during a previous grant cycle and refined further under this cycle.  Each teacher selected a subject in the state mandated curriculum that met two criteria: the subject must come early in the school year, and it must be a subject the teacher hates to teach (boring, difficult, confusing, etc.).  Teachers completing the training came away with a lesson plan of their own devising, refined with extensive practice and feedback, plus lesson plans from their colleagues in the course.  Two months into the fall semester, we got back together and reviewed videos of the students engaging the activity.  Initially, teachers were skeptical whether they could afford the extra time needed for inquiry-based teaching.  They were surprised to find that they made up the time, since inquiry-based exercises introduced additional curricular material that allowed faster progress later in the term.  As revealed by the unmistakably happy chatter in the videos, the students were thrilled to be engaged in the classroom and making discoveries on their own.  Finally, at year?s end, students took the state?s subject competency tests.  Teachers contacted me the following year to report that their students who experienced inquiry-based learning performed far better on the tests for the covered subjects than their peers who did not, and better than students of the same teacher from the prior years.  We have trained over 50 middle school science teachers in a minority-majority community, greatly multiplying the effects of our efforts, since each teacher will engage thousands of children and many other teachers throughout his or her remaining career.
