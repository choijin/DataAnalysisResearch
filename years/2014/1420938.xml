<AbstractNarration>Pseudorandomness is the theory of generating objects that "look random" despite being constructed using little or no randomness. Work on pseudorandomness has implications for many different areas of research in computer science, communications, and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to advance the theory and application of pseudorandomness, focusing on two core directions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Pseudorandomness for space-bounded computation and related models: using a new method from the PI's recent work, the project aims to make significant progress on the long-standing "RL vs. L" problem --- whether every randomized algorithm can be made deterministic with only a small increase in memory usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Pseudorandomness for cryptography: The project will export powerful techniques and concepts from the theory of pseudorandomness to cryptography, in particular exploiting computational measures of randomness that were introduced in the PI's recent work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be closely integrated with the PI's educational efforts.  In particular, the PI will continue to develop new curricular, educational, and expository material that are made openly available for others to use.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all phases of this research, and will be given opportunities to publish and present their results at premier international conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also continue his extensive service to the scientific community, including chairing the SIGACT Committee for the Advancement of Theoretical Computer Science. This committee does a substantial amount of outreach activity, interfacing with funding agencies and helping convey the achievements and potentials of research in theoretical computer science to a broad audience.</AbstractNarration>

Work on pseudorandomness has implications for many different areas of research in computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics.  This project advanced the theory and applications of pseudorandomness, focusing on two core directions:  1. Pseudorandomness for memory-bounded computation and related models.   The project made significant progress on a long-standing question about whether allowing computer algorithms to "toss coins" can enable them to solve problems using significantly less memory.  In particular, it showed that many questions about the behavior of "random walks" on undirected graphs can actually be solved in a memory-efficient manner without tossing any coins.  2. Pseudorandomness for cryptography: The project exported powerful techniques and concepts from the theory of pseudorandomness to cryptography.  For example, it initiated a study of pseudorandomness and related notions of "computational entropy" for quantum states, which model the way in which a quantum computer stores information.  This helps in the design cryptographic systems that will remain secure even in the face of future attacks that may arise with quantum computing technology.  The research was closely integrated with the PI's educational efforts.  In the course of the project, the PI trained five PhD students (two of whom completed their dissertations and will soon start faculty positions) and two undergraduate research assistants (both of whom are now in PhD programs).  He also taught and refined several courses related to the research, gave several invited tutorials at workshops aimed at educating graduate students, and wrote a survey paper on one of the project?s main foci.  The PI also continued extensive service to the scientific community.  He completed his chairmanship of  the SIGACT Committee for the Advancement of Theoretical Computer Science, which does a substantial amount of outreach activity, interfacing with funding agencies and helping convey the achievements and potentials of research in theoretical computer science to a broad audience.  He also organized four workshops at a variety of international locations and a yearlong program at the Harvard Center for Mathematical Sciences &amp; Applications; these meetings fostered a fertile exchange of ideas between theoretical computer science and other fields such as electrical engineering and pure mathematics.
