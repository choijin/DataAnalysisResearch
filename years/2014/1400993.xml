<AbstractNarration>The rapid biodiversity change in North America has significant effects on essential ecosystem services, from impact on soil health and nutrient cycling, to agriculture, forestry and water quality. Exploding populations of invasive species threaten fresh water and terrestrial habitats and potentially impact the natural resources of the nation. Easy access to robust, expertly vetted baseline data for species occurrences, abundances, and distribution ranges, and monitoring how these parameters have changed through time, will facilitate the protection of the nation's natural resources, and vastly improve the capacity for effective restoration, land management planning, and conservation management.  Numerous undergraduate students will receive training in digitization technologies and a modular exhibit will be developed to engage public interest in biodiversity changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective monitoring requires easy electronic access to historical specimen baseline information for temporal and regional species diversity comparisons that can facilitate informed land management decisions. Vast amounts of specimen data are housed within the nation's natural history collections, but most of these data are not readily accessible from digital resources. Size and complexity of scientific specimen collections require major technological advances in capturing specimen data. The goal of this four-year collaborative project is the rapid digitization of  &gt;2 million specimens and their locality data from ten arthropod and mollusk collections housed at six major US museums in six states (Il, OH, AL,MI, DE, PA). This project will significantly automate specimen data capture by utilizing optical character and voice-recognition technologies. The digitized data from this project will be immediately deployed for habitat-based distribution modeling and analyses.This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Frost Entomological Museum cares for approximately 1,000,000 specimens of insects and related terrestrial arthropods. The collection contains specimens from the 1870s through today and is especially strong in Odonata (dragonflies, damselflies), aphids, sucking lice (Anoplura), and the insect faunas of Pennsylvania and Florida. Prior to this digitization project specimen data were available digitally for only 100 or so specimens and could only be accessed with help from a curator.</p> <p>The InvertEBase Thematic Collection Network facilitated the digitization of approximately 260,000 specimens at the Frost Museum, including imaging the entire Odonata collection (close to 100,000 specimens), including immature specimens, imaging of the entire Anoplura collection (15,000 slides), label transcription for the entire beetle collection (approximately 100,000 specimens),&nbsp;and imaging and transcription for species involved in Batesian and Muellerian mimicry complexes (mainly aculeate Hymenoptera and their dipteran and coleopteran mimics), among other taxa. The intellectual merits of having these data available are myriad. The data can be applied to research on numerous biological phenomena, including imperfect mimicry (Why do some flies seem to mimic wasp species that don't exist?), changes in phenology (Are bees emerging from their overwintering sites earlier now?), and the impacts of invasive species (How is spotted lanternfly impacting the bug fauna of the northeast?). There have been several high profile and troubling reports of dramatic declines in insect diversity and biomass globally. Understanding this phenomenon in a temporal context requires data from natural history collections, especially data from structured, repeatable biotic inventories - a rare asset in natural history collections, which are often built ad hoc. The Frost Museum was able to make such data available during this project, with more than 30,000 arthropod specimens from a standardized survey in central Pennsylvania. (Fort Indiantown Gap). These data are available now as a baseline for follow-up research into insect declines in the northeastern U.S.A. and the impact of spotted lanternfly, a recent and devastating invasive insect in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>The impacts of this digitization project are broader than simply making data available for research. At least 50 graduate and 10 undergraduate students were trained in collections care and biodiversity data management. Another 200 people, mostly non-experts, were educated in the role and relevance of natural history collections and the importance of specimen digitization. By having orders of magnitude more data available, the Frost Museum was also able to raise its profile in the research community, with loan requests increasing by at least 50% and data requests by 100% over the life of the project. This increased awareness of the Frost Museum as a resource for research and education has also has positive impacts with the parent institution, which has resulted in increased investment and appreciation of this asset.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/17/2019<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;R&nbsp;Deans</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1400993/1400993_10335042_1574011114567_syrphidFly--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1400993/1400993_10335042_1574011114567_syrphidFly--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hover fly specimen in digitization jig"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1400993/1400993_10335042_1574011114567_syrphidFly--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hover fly specimen in digitization jig"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Typical imaging jig for a pinned specimen and its labels.
