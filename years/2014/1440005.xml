<AbstractNarration>Synchrotron radiation user facilities are critical resources which enable state-of-the-art research and training in mineralogy, mineral physics and environmental science. Access to these facilities is very competitive and time allocated for experiments is constrained. The most popular and fundamental type of experiment is X-ray diffraction, which produces information on crystal structure, symmetry, chemical bonding, composition and density of minerals and other crystalline solids. Modern synchrotron-based diffraction experiments are typically conducted with the use of area detectors, in which case the data is recorded as digital diffraction images. Technology used in synchrotron experiments evolves rapidly increasing the speed of the data collection and producing massive volumes of experimental data, posing new serious challenges for data analysis. The experiments are often decision-driven, and require at least partial real time data interpretation to guide the experimenter. Software offering such real time analysis capabilities is currently not available. This proposal is a collaborative effort to provide this scientific community with easily accessible tools and training opportunities for using these codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on a combination of novel tools for diffraction-based synchrotron research in Earth and environmental sciences including: (IM1) New capabilities for structure determination of unknown phases and identification of known phases in natural and synthetic samples; (IM2) Opening new possibilities for real time analysis in studies of solid state dynamic processes; (IM3) Robust Bayesian analysis of outliers, uncertainties and missing data; and (IM4) Creation of new free advanced tools for utilizing the available mineralogical database in synchrotron research. Utilizing a combination of existing, well-tested and widely used software components developed in the Interactive Data Language , Python, the project creates a new integrated multiplatform, open-source Python software package ATREX (Advanced Tools for Research in Extreme Xtallography), with unique capabilities to process diffraction image data from samples in all forms from glasses and melts, bulk powders, though coarse multi grains, to single crystals, which will support new data types produced by novel ultrafast X-ray imaging detectors, offer extensive automated serial processing capabilities for massive data sets and will allow real time data analysis for time-constrained decision-driven synchrotron experiments. ATREX will include database access capabilities utilizing the free American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the ATREX project was to create a new, integrated multiplatform, open-source software package, with unique capabilities to analyze experimental data from X-ray diffraction experiments. The software product created within this project has been distributed on GitHub and has been deployed at several beamlines at synchrotron national user facilities. The capabilities and concepts behind the software have been broadly discussed and disseminated by the developers using conventional (journal publications, conference presentations) as well as unconventional (audiovisual publications, video tutorials) media.  ATREX has enabled usage of unique instrumentation at national user facility: Partnership for eXtreme Xtallography (PX^2) project at Argonne National Laboratory created a novel instrument for mineral physics. ATREX is currently the only software package supporting the complex geometry of this instrument for data analysis, and enabling its usage for novel types of experiments.  Thanks to original and innovative algorithmic solutions implemented in ATREX, the new software package became a primary tool of experimental data analysis at the PX^2 synchrotron facility at Argonne National Lab, and has enabled a number of significant scientific discoveries. During the three years of duration of the project, according to Google Scholar, 64 peer reviewed papers have been published, citing usage of ATREX, averaging over 20 papers per year, including work that appeared in such prestigious journals as  Physical Review, Journal of Geophysical Research, Chemistry of Materials, Nature Communications, Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Physical Chemistry Letters, etc.   ATREX also stimulated development of new experimental techniques for high-pressure research, such as Thermal Diffuse Scattering analysis, multigrain diffraction analysis and deviatoric stress analysis of compressed single crystals.  Software libraries of ATREX have been used in development of computer code used by NASA Mars Science Laboratory team for analysis of data from the CHEMMIN instrument on board of the Curiosity rover on Mars.   Mineral physics and extreme conditions materials science, both of which are supported by ATREX software, contribute (mostly indirectly) to several key areas of societal importance including development of alternative energy sources and energy storage, abrasives industry, earthquake monitoring and prediction, mineral resource exploration.
