<AbstractNarration>This project brings a group of experts in data citation into a workshop involving researchers and experts in Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and metadata standards. The DDI standard is the premier metadata standard for the social sciences. Biomedical data are also in scope, as the lines between the social sciences and other disciplines are blurring. The lifecycle branch of DDI (DDI-L) allows documentation of data from initial concept and study development to archiving and reuse. The DDI standard has been refined over the course of the last 18 years. Integration of citation information into uniquely identifiable information elements across the whole lifecycle would leverage this already well-adopted standard as a foundation for developing metrics that measure production and reuse of data. DDI-L already has structures for various activities (e.g., data collection and sampling), entities (e.g., funding organizations and archives), and tools (e.g., software and instruments) within the research process. The focus of this project is to ensure that DDI integrates the necessary information elements to support the collection of desirable citation metadata. The DDI Alliance is currently developing its next-generation specification - DDI4 - which is model-based and modular. This workshop will feed into the DDI4 development, as robust citation capabilities are part of the design goals. But more importantly, the workshop will produce a set of best practices for citing data at all levels and providing attribution to all dataset contributors. These best practices could be applied to other metadata standards in other disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating citation information into an existing lifecycle metadata framework will supply the foundation for metrics of impact of datasets, instruments and procedures, as well as for their creators. It should also serve as the foundation for tools to collect this information during the normal research workflow. As these metrics become adopted in promotion and tenure decisions, documenting data will increasingly be seen as an activity carrying a reward, rather than as just burdensome overhead. This, in turn, should lead to better documentation and more reusable, better quality data.</AbstractNarration>

The meeting was held at Schloss Dagstuhl &ndash; Leibniz Center for Informatics in Wadern, Germany, in October 2014. The Dagstuhl meeting included experts from outside the regular DDI community &ndash; experts in Dublin Core, CDISC, EML, and data citation and archiving in general. A one-day five-person follow-up meeting occurred prior to the North American Data Documentation Initiative Conference (NADDI) in April 2015 in Madison, Wisconsin. Further follow-up took place at the week-long DDI sprint in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May 2015. <br />The intent of this work was to enhance the capability of the developing version of the DDI standard to capture information supporting comprehensive citation of data. An important outcome of the Dagstuhl meeting was an addition to the standard that permits one to assign a set of roles and associated degree of contribution (extent) to the description of a creator, contributor or publisher of an intellectual entity. It was decided not to limit this capability just to datasets, but to also enable similar documentation of questionnaires and other instruments, variables, software, methods, and even concepts - essentially almost any object modeled by DDI for which someone might get credit. Roles and associated contribution degree can be described by shared controlled vocabularies (codelists). During the Dagstuhl meeting the group interacted with one of the developers of the proposed CRediT taxonomy (http://credit.casrai.org/proposed-taxonomy/) and decided on that taxonomy as the recommended vocabulary for both role and degree of contribution (See Figure 1).<br />The Dagstuhl meeting also identified a need for a more generic mechanism for describing citation-like supporting material. One example use case identified for this was the need to document &ldquo;degree of burden&rdquo; information related to a questionnaire, which is required by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. The OMB mandates a specific set of information to be collected for statistical surveys conducted by government agencies. This information has a structure defined by the OMB. Another example use case is the description of instrument parameters. Each instrument or instrument type might have a unique set of controls and settings. In both of these cases a facility for a user to describe and use a metadata model from within DDI4 would be useful.&nbsp; A particular description could be shared by a community and uses of it could be validated against the description. <br />To that end the two follow-up meetings produced a Custom Metadata model which can be viewed at: http://lion.ddialliance.org/package/custommetadata&nbsp; &nbsp; (See Figures 2 and 3). The model allows for the description of a set of keys and associated value domains. Use of these key/value pairs can then be validated against the description. A key/value scheme can be developed by a community and then used within that community by reference. The work on a Custom Metadata capability also produced a model for representing controlled vocabularies in DDI4.
