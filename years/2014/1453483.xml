<AbstractNarration>Dr. Mindy Levine of the University of Rhode Island studies how molecules interact with each other when they are in close proximity, but are not physically contacted, and investigates how such interactions affect the transfer of energy from one molecule to another.  This knowledge is fundamentally important and is useful for the design and optimization of systems for sensitive detection of analytes (e.g., sensing of metabolites in biological fluids) or environmental remediation (e.g., extraction of toxic substances in water from oil spills).   Additional broader impacts of this project include: 1) training of graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research; 2) education of high school girls in Rhode Island about the importance of science through the outreach programs on the "Sugar Science Day"; 3) education of the general public by sharing the videos of "Sugar Science Day" at YouTube; and 4) research opportunities for high school girls through paid science internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Dr. Levine's research group studies fluorescence energy transfer from a variety of aromatic energy donors to small molecule fluorophore acceptors, when both the donor and acceptor are held in close proximity by cyclodextrins or cyclodextrin derivatives in solution.  Isothermal calorimetry, 2-D NMR analyses, and X-ray crystallography are employed to determine the binding affinities and geometries of the donors and acceptors in the ternary complexes.  To enable the development of applications requiring solid-state immobilization of cyclodextrins, the researchers further investigate the effect of surface immobilization of cyclodextrins on binding affinities and fluorescence energy transfer.  This research also aims to generate a cyclodextrin-based system for the extraction and detection of polyaromatic hydrocarbons from complex oils.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Throughout the five years of this award, we have used cyclodextrin, a cyclic sugar molecule, to understand how molecules interact and communicate through space even when they are not physically attached. This understanding is important because through-space interactions are used in molecular electronics, in drug design, and in developing materials such as water repellent paint coatings for vehicles.  This research has led to the following outcomes:  (a) We have developed a significantly improved understanding of such through space interactions for a variety of small molecules when they are bound in and around a variety of cyclodextrin structures, by using a bright ?turn-on? energy transfer to indicate when interactions occur;  (b) We have expanded our understanding of such interactions even in cases where energy transfer does not occur using changes in the fluorescent signal of a reporter molecule;  (c) We have investigated how these interactions occur both in solution as well as when the relevant compounds are immobilized on a paper support;  (d) We have applied our understanding of such interactions in applications including cyclodextrin-containing metal-organic frameworks for chemical education, cyclodextrin-based materials for oil spill remediation, and cyclodextrin-based devices for improved water purification processes;  (e) We have developed, implemented, and evaluated a Sugar Science Day outreach program for high school girls, to introduce the girls to the chemistry of sugar (including cyclodextrin molecules) and the importance of gender parity in STEM disciplines;  (f) We have published the results of this work in 10 peer-reviewed publications and presented the results of this work in 61 presentations at local, regional, national, and international chemistry conferences;  (g) We have trained six high school student interns, ten undergraduate students, four graduate students, and one postdoctoral scholar through the execution of the research program over the past five years.
