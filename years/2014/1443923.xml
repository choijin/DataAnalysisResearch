<AbstractNarration>The recent wave of radio spectrum deregulation encourages shared use of underutilized spectrum (so-called 'white spaces') where licensed users (primary) co-exist with unlicensed or lightly licensed users (secondary).  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has recommended use of online spectrum databases to ensure that primary communications are protected against interference coming from secondary communications. However, these databases provide notoriously poor estimates of whether a primary communication is active as they are based on empirically driven radio propagation modeling. This accuracy issue ultimately weakens the business case for white space networks, particularly in urban regions where the demand of both primary and secondary use is high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core intellectual merit of the project is a fundamental rethinking of the current approach to spectrum databases. The project develops a functional system architecture that improves the spectrum database estimates by integrating the current modeling-based approach with distributed spectrum measurement data. The project delivers the key components necessary to realize such measurement-augmented database system: (i) open access spectrum observatory tool backed by models and databases, (ii) a spatial statistics-based approach to integrate modeling and measurement data, (iii) practical methods to collect large-scale, distributed spectrum measurement data to feed into the database. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in the project will revitalize the interest in white spaces among commercial operators and also will help FCC in future spectrum policy formulation.  The open access spectrum observatory tool will provide researchers with significant data sets and models. The project also plans technology transfer and cross-disciplinary educational efforts in wireless systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spectrum Sharing (increasingly a core mechanism to improve network efficiency in het-net coexistence) has led to operational mechanisms that rely on database-supported approaches to determination of White Spaces (currently unused spectrum by the licensee at a given location and time). A fundamental goal of this effort was  to rethink current approaches to spectrum database supported network coexistence; the proposal espoused novel ways to integrate a-priori information with a-posteriori distributed spectrum measurement data. The project focussed on three key components to realize such measurement-augmented network coexistence.   1. Spectrum Observatory Tool. We built a foundational  TV White Space Database (for the contiguous 48 states)  GUI  based on information available from FCC databases - https://specobs.ee.washington.edu. Queries allow users to obtain statistical information about TVWS availability at a given location or region, based on commonly used propagation models.   2. Distributed, Large-Scale Spectrum Measurements. To advance state-of-art in distributed, large-scale spectrum data collection, we considered new system design aspects focussing on  tradeoffs in measurement sensitivity vs. network scale. In particular, we explored the role of incentives for opportunistic spectrum data acquisition using low-end commodity client devices (with limited power and computation capabilities).   3.  Network coexistence using Spectrum Spatial Statistics. The available spectrum measurements was used to construct spatial statistics of channel availability that in turn drives optimal secondary channel allocation subject to primary interference protection constraints.   SIGNIFICANT OUTCOMES   * Developed new incentive models for crowd sourcing to contribute sensor datato a (central) platform tasked with spectrum mapping - the platform announces a pricing mechanism based on expected utility (EU) maximization, where EU captures the tradeoff between radio mapping performance(location and data quality), crowd-sensing cost and uncertainty in offer outcomes (i.e.possible rejection of offer by users). We showed that our approach provides provable performance guarantees and quantified improvements compard to various baseline mechanisms.   *Developed a new graph-based approach for  Channel Allocation (CA) applicable to shared spectrum systems. This  new coexistence aware CA algorithm arose out of a collaboration with Nokia Bell-Labs, a vendor of Spectrum Access Systems in 3.5 GHz CBRS band; the proposed approach is being tested in a lab prototype.
