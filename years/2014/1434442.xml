<AbstractNarration>The quality of the mathematical education provided to teachers and ultimately to their students depends on the quality of teacher educators at the colleges and universities.  For several decades, there has been a shortage of well-prepared mathematics teacher educators. Doctoral programs in mathematics education are the primary ways that these teacher educators learn the content and methods that they need to prepare teachers, but the quality of these programs varies and the number of qualified graduates has been insufficient to meet the demand.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will research the programmatic changes that resulted from the NSF investment in Centers for Learning and Teaching of Mathematics (CLT) at the 31 participating institutions. It will provide information on the core elements of doctoral preparation in mathematics education at the institutions and ways in which participation in the CLTs has changed their programs.  It will also gather data on the number of doctorates in mathematics education from the CLT institutions prior to the establishment of the CLT and after their CLT ended.  A comparison group of Doctoral granting institutions will be studied over the same time frame to determine the number of doctoral students graduated during similar time frames as the CLTs.   Follow-up data from graduates of the CLTs will be gathered to identify programmatic strengths and weaknesses as graduates will be asked to reflect on how their doctoral preparation aligned with their current career path.  The research questions are:  What were the effects of CLTs on the production of new doctorates in mathematics education?  What changes were made to doctoral programs in mathematics education by the CLT institutions? How well prepared were the CLT graduates for various career paths?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work on the project entitled Centers for Learning and Teaching: Research to Identify Changes in Mathematics Education Doctoral Preparation and the Production of New Doctorates has been completed.  Each of the objectives of the project were addressed and answers to the research questions were provided.  In an effort to disseminate the results of this research to the mathematics education communication, several articles have been prepared, submitted and published in professional journals.  I am continuing to work on a couple of additional articles that will report some of the research that has been done that will be of particular interest to mathematics educators involved in the preparation of doctoral students.  I prepared and submitted (July 31) a final report electronically to NSF for the project.    I also prepared a final written report for the project that included data and narrative that was not included in the report that was filed electronically.   I felt this written report would provide a more complete picture of the researach that was done during this project.     I have sent a copy of the written report to my Program Officer (Margret Hjamarson), Dr. Elizabeth VanderPutten (who was instrumental in getting the initial proposal for this project reviewed), and to Dr. Jim Lewis who served on the Advisory Board for this project.
