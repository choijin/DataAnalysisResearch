<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to provide support for approximately 20 students to attend the Wireless Innovation Forum Conference on Communications Technologies and Software Defined Radio (WinnComm) to be held March 31-April 2, 2015 in San Diego California. The grants will provide partial support for travel, housing, and conference attendance. Software-defined radio technology will become increasingly important as the foundation of wireless communications, and attendance at the conference will expose students to many technical and practical aspects of the technology.</AbstractNarration>
