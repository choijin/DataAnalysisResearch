<AbstractNarration>This project applies two recently introduced evolution equations to fundamental issues in hydrodynamic turbulence.  The first equation is for the determining modes of a differential equation of Navier-Stokes type. A set of low modes is determining, if for any solution on the global attractor, the high modes of the solution for all time, can be produced from only the low modes (for all time). Extending this relationship to the Banach space of bounded functions from the reals into the low modes leads to a determining form, an evolution equation that is globally Lipschitz, and dissipative. The global attractor of the original differential equation is contained in the long time behavior of the determining form.  This provides an alternative to the theory of inertial forms which is not known to be applicable to the Navier-Stokes equations. The other evolution equation is for the radius of analyticity in the spatial variable.  We will use this equation to study the domain of analyticity for solutions on the global attractor and its effect on aspects of fluid flow such as intermittency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluid motions at large scales, for instance in ocean and atmosphere, display erratic, seemingly incomprehensible (turbulent) features when viewed locally and for short times. However, over time, consistent global statistical patterns emerge. The purpose of this research is to develop a rigorous understanding of the nature and origin of such patterns, and of deviations from it, with a view towards diverse applications such as ocean modeling and weather forecasting. For instance, weather forecasting is done by solving a large system of equations which model the state of the atmosphere over a period of time.&lt;br/&gt;The current state of the atmosphere is needed as input in order to compute the state in the future.  As there are always limited measurements of the state of the system, this input inevitably contains some error. The inherent sensitivity of the system to such an error means that as time goes on the computed solution diverges from reality. The technique of data assimilation uses the limited measurements of the system at not just a single moment of time, but rather over an extended time period in the past, to arrive at a more accurate input.  This project applies recent mathematical discoveries to develop new variations on this technique. It will lead to new algorithms that will be implemented and tested by the research team.  Graduate students will play an essential role in this collaborative effort, thus serving to train future generation of scientists in the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

The results of this research has been published in leading journals in the field and has been disseminated in various national and international conferences, workshops and seminars and colloquia in various universities.  One  of  the  major  goals  of  the  project  was  to  train  future  generation  of  scientists.  To this effect, most  of  the  research  projects  were done  in  collaboration  with  graduate  students  and  postdoctoral  fellows.  The  highlights  are  as  follows. 1) One  of  the  focus  in  this  collaborative  research  was  joint  mentoring  of  students across various universities. The  PI  served  as  a  co-&shy;mentor  to a student  in an institution different from his home institution. This work also involved  another  graduate  student  whose  area  of research  was in a different discipline.  This  is  an  example  of  trans-disciplinary  research  involving  different  universities. The  research  was  primarily  carried  out  by  weekly  video  conferencing  sessions.  2) The  PI  was  instrumental  in  organizing  annual workshops  for students jointly with his collaborators.  The  main idea  behind  these  workshops  was  to  train  graduate  students and postdoctoral fellows,  where  they  could meet  with  all  the  PIs  in  person  and present  their  research.  Other  scientists  were  also  invited  to  speak  which enabled the  students  to gain  fresh  perspectives  and  learn various  aspects  of  the  subject.  The  workshops  concluded  with  a  discussion  of  open  problems  and  future  directions  of research.  This  has  proved  to  be  a  very  successful  model  to  train  young  scientists  and  researchers.  3) It  is  universally  acknowledged  that  participation  in  undergraduate  research  leads  to  an  improvement  in  graduation rates  and  subsequent  success  in  careers.  The  PI  has  offered  research level  courses  to  groups  of  undergraduate  students where the students also participated in guided research.  Currently, the PI is in the process of expanding on these course notes to make it suitable for publication. The emphasis will be on an elementary approaches so that it is accessible to a large audience including advanced undergraduates; yet it will contain topics...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
