<AbstractNarration>With increased levels of device integration accompanied by use of transistors with deep-nanometer feature sizes, analog, switched-capacitor and digital filters that are used for isolating "wanted" signals in electronic circuits from "unwanted" ones, have become increasingly susceptible to noise induced by the operation of vast amounts of circuitry. Such noise leads to degradation of signal quality and loss of Quality of Service (QoS) of the end application (wireless communication, sensing, etc). One way to address the noise issue is to devise a noise-cancellation scheme similar to that used in popular noise-canceling headphones. Such techniques are difficult to implement on-chip due to the unknown nature of on-chip noise sources. To solve this problem, we introduce limited redundancy into the filter implementation, that allows the filter to check for signals (injected noise) at internal circuit nodes that are inconsistent with the input signals to the filter and compensate for their effects on filter operation. As long as the injected noise is localized within sub-regions of the filter, near-perfect noise/error cancellation is achieved regardless of the source of the noise and the manner in which it couples to the filter involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the demand for high speed wireless communications technology grows, there will be a strong need to develop research and education programs that produce personnel that can service the relevant system design, yield management and field maintenance problems in industry. Students working on this project will participate in summer internship programs with industry and work on real industry test cases. This will facilitate technology transfer to industry and will also challenge the academic researchers and students to address practical technology transfer issues that eventually lead to commercialization of the technology developed, thus impacting economy and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical details of the project involve design of analog, switched-capacitor and digital filters that are resilient to noise/errors induced by electrical bugs such as due to power/ground bounce and crosstalk. A key goal is to develop a design methodology that provides maximum resilience to noise induced errors with the least impact on area and power consumption. The project will result in a chip design for proof-of-concept and validation of the fundamental resilience concepts. The approach is based on the principle of checksum based encodings of the state transformation matrices of linear as well as linearized-nonlinear analog, switched-capacitor and digital filters. When noise is injected into a specific node of the filter, the filter encoding can be used to generate a phase-inverted version of the injected noise. By feeding the latter into the affected circuit state, perfect or near-perfect noise/error cancellation can be achieved. A key benefit of this approach is that it is independent of the source of the noise/error as long as the effect of the noise/error injection is localized to one or a few system states.</AbstractNarration>

In the case of nonlinear systems, the check state (at time t) bears a known relationship with the corresponding states of the nonlinear system. This check state can also be predicted from knowledge of the prior system states and inputs using nonlinear mappings. Consistency between the prior known relationship and its predicted value above, is used to check for errors in system function. For linear systems, when errors are injected into specific parameters of the system, the state encoding can be used to generate a phase-inverted version of the injected error. By feeding the latter into the affected system state, perfect or near-perfect error correction can be achieved. For nonlinear systems, error correction is achieved using equivalent linearized representations of linear systems. A key benefit of this approach is that it is&nbsp;<em>independent of the source of the error as long as the effect of the noise/error injection is localized</em>&nbsp;to one or a few system states. Specific research outcomes included:</p> <p><strong>Real time error detection and correction in switched capacitor filters</strong>: Experiments were performed on linear switched-capacitor filter designs. 6dB improvement in noise injected by soft errors into the circuits concerned was obtained using the checksum driven error correction algorithms.</p> <p><strong>Error detection and correction in nonlinear digital filters</strong>:&nbsp; A low cost error detection technique for non-linear digital lters using linearized checksum codes and linear predictive coding (LPC) algorithms was developed.&nbsp; For bit errors, coverage of up to 80% was obtained using the proposed method vs. only 60% for prior time-freeze linearization methods.</p> <p><strong>Error detection and correction in linear state variable systems</strong>: In this work, simulation experiments on a biquadratic analog filter and DC motor speed control system were performed&nbsp; in a MATLAB environment. The state equations of the system were encoded using checksum codes and it was shown for the first time that the time-domain error signature obtained, contains information about the cause of the error or failure. Error correction for the filter was performed by diagnosing the erroneous filter state using the time-domain checksum error signal and performing correction via phase-inverted error feedback into the affected filter state variable. Error correction for the DC motor was performed by changing the motor control parameters to adjust to the injected parametric deviations.</p> <p><strong>Error resilience in Kalman filters using encoded state and statistical covariance checks</strong>: The Kalman filter is a versatile tool used in control and signal processing systems to predict statistically significant data from noisy measurements. The goal was to detect errors in any underlying arithmetic computation (e.g. addition/multiplication) involved in the operation of the Kalman filter. For error detection, state covariance and encoded state checks are used to detect errors. For word and bit errors, high detection coverage is obtained (90% - 97%).</p> <p><strong>Error detection in&nbsp; nonlinear control systems using mapped predictive check states</strong>: In this research, a&nbsp; real-time error detection methodology for nonlinear control state space systems was developed that uses mapped predictive check states for detecting sensor and actuator malfunction and transient errors in the execution of the control algorithm on the underlying processor. &nbsp;Simulation experiments indicated almost 100% coverage of errors and failures that affected the performance of the control systems studied.</p> <p><strong>Real-Time Self Learning For Control Law Adaptation in Nonlinear Systems</strong>: For systems that learn continuously from their operating environment, it was demonstrated that as much as one order of magnitude acceleration in adaptation time could be achieved by coupling the diagnostic information inherent in the time-domain check error signal with the reinforcment learning based recovery methodology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/22/2018<br>      Modified by: Abhijit&nbsp;Chatterjee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1421353/1421353_10317466_1532302072934_Image7--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1421353/1421353_10317466_1532302072934_Image7--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Goals"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1421353/1421353_10317466_1532302072934_Image7--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Goals"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This describes the overall goals of the project and the key problems investigated.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Abhijit Chatterjee</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Abhijit&nbsp;Chatterjee</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project Goals</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1421353/1421353_10317466_1532299935321_Image5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1421353/1421353_10317466_1532299935321_Image5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Error Detection in Nonlinear Control System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1421353/1421353_10317466_1532299935321_Image5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Error Detection in Nonlinear Control System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Mathematically, the brake by wire system has a similar state variable representation to a nonlinear filter (similar structure).
