<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for attendees and invited speakers for the thirteenth annual symposium of the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowships (AAPF) program, to be held in conjunction with the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in January, 2015, in Seattle, Washington. The purpose of the AAPF program is to integrate research and educational activities at the postdoctoral level to better prepare fellows for a scientific career. The annual symposium provides a venue for fellows to discuss their research and teaching or outreach projects while increasing their exposure within the astronomy and astrophysics community. The symposium represents a key component of the AAPF program and acts as a mechanism to facilitate knowledge transfer from experiences that the fellows have obtained in the course of their activities to a broad audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with previous symposia in this series, the AAPF symposium for 2015 will promote interactions among astronomers with very different interests and backgrounds. By creating a forum in which discussions can occur across the standard boundaries defined by sub-discipline, there is great opportunity for new insights and the ability to develop new interdisciplinary collaborations. The symposium will also provide a venue for discussing other issues that are important to early career astronomers. In addition, the symposium will (1) provide a forum for discussing the combination of research and teaching, (2) facilitate collaborations between AAPF fellows on both research and education, and (3) provide exposure for the fellows and the fellowship program within the astronomical community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded the 2015 National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral FellowÃ†s symposium.  This symposium took place in Seattle, WA conjunction with the larger meeting of the American Astronomical Society and was open to all attendees of that meeting.  Unique among similar symposia, this meeting featured presentations and discussion forums on both astrophysics research and education and public outreach activities.  The symposium featured both keynote presentations from leaders in research and outreach, as well as contributed presentations from the National Science Foundation fellows.  It also featured three discussion panels with invited expert panelists, covering the topics of "The Decadal Survey: 5 Years Out," "Education and Outreach Metrics and Evaluation," and "Non-Academic Career Paths."  These presentations and forums provide unique resources for developing the research and educational programs of both the AAPF fellows and the other attendees. In particular the multi-prong focus on the future developments in astrophysics research, teaching and outreach, and careers in industry gave participants a broad overview of their future career options that will advance our national interests. The symposium therefore provides the groundwork for advancing the careers and skill sets of young leaders in astrophysics research and education, ultimately leading to improved knowledge and STEM education for the broader community.
