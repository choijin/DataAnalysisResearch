<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a new scalable manufacturing capability for producing bio-based chemicals for surfactants, lubricants, and polymers.  This manufacturing platform will utilize biologically derived sugar carbon-source and transform this carbon to higher value products via microbial fermentation.  At the core of this new manufacturing platform is a re-designed microorganism that will deliver homogeneous preparations of individual fatty acids of defined carbon-chain length that contain a single carbon-carbon double bond. This contrasts with current sources of oleochemicals, which are complex mixtures of fatty acids of different carbon chain lengths ranging between 12 and 18 carbon atoms, and may contain 0-3 carbon-carbon double bonds.  The complex mixtures that occur in these oleochemicals limit the types of products that can be generated from fats and oils, or adds considerable separations cost to the manufacture of homogeneous products. The project will take advantage of unprecedented technological capability to produce homogeneous preparations of a single monounsaturated fatty acid, which is a platform feedstock for producing many chemicals that impact surfactant, lubricant, and polymer markets, currently valued at $40B per annum, and predicted to grow to $150B per annum in the next 5-years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new transformational technology that is based on the discovery and fundamental understanding of the biocatalytic mechanism that terminates the elongation cycle of Type II fatty acid synthase, the enzyme acyl-ACP thioesterase.  The project will harness this technology for the production of near homogeneous preparations (~60%) of the monounsaturated fatty acid, 7-tetradecenoic acid, and proposes to optimize the system to produce over 80% homogeneous preparations of this fatty acid.  This monounsaturated fatty acid is not currently available in the marketplace at a reasonable cost.  The unprecedented availability of 7-tetradecenoic acid makes it a platform biochemical for subsequent chemical conversion to numerous biorenewable chemicals that have applications in surfactants, lubricants, and polymers. In the long-term, this platform technology can be expanded to produce alternative homogeneous preparations of monounsaturated fatty acids of different chain lengths, with carbon-carbon double bonds at different but defined places in the molecule.</AbstractNarration>

However, the relatively high cost and complex fatty acid composition of vegetable oils and animal fats are two major issues that limit the wider industrial application of these molecules. To overcome these issues, VariFAS is focusing on developing a scalable manufacturing platform to convert biomass sugar to cost-efficient biorenewable chemicals consisting of simpler mixture of monounsaturated fatty acids. VariFAS aims to deliver cost-efficient monounsaturated fatty acids of between 10- and 18-carbon chain lengths.

VariFASÆs monounsaturated fatty acids are superior raw materials for producing many chemical derivatives and high-value bi-functional chemicals for the application in polymers, lubricants, and surfactants.  Outcomes  The core of our technology is a re-designed microorganism (i.e., Escherichia coli) that is capable of producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE) is an enzyme that controls the output of fatty acid synthesis machinery in microorganism cell factory; it plays important role in determining the types and amounts of fatty acids produced by the cells. In this SBIR Phase I project, we focused on engineering this enzyme in E. coli and develop strains that are capable of efficiently producing our target monounsaturated fatty acids. The project outcomes are summarized below.  (1)  To improve the catalytic activity of acyl-ACP TE, a molecular evolutionary strategy was developed. First, a large number of TE variants were generated with PCR, and these variants were screened in E. coli strains for higher fatty acid titers. We successfully identified a TE variant that exhibited 4.5-fold increase in fatty acid titer. By introducing a previously identified beneficial mutation, we were able to generate a mutant that could produce up to 3.7 g/L of fatty acids, with 56% monounsaturated fatty acid.  (2)  In a second strategy for optimizing fatty acid production, we used promoters of different strengths to modulate the expression of acyl-ACP TE. T7 promoter variants of different strengths were generated and these were used to modulate the level of TE expression in E. coli strains. We successfully identified a T7 promoter variant that produced 10-fold higher fatty acids titers than the wild-type T7 promoter.  (3)  To enhance the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids, we used two independent T7 promoter variant libraries to modulate the relative expression levels of fabA and fabB genes. The rationale for this experiment is based on the fact that the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in E. coli can be manipulated by altering the ratio of fabA and fabB expression. Via this strategy we increased the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids from 45% to 74%.          Last Modified: 03/31/2015       Submitted by: Libuse Brachova]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
