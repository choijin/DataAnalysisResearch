<AbstractNarration>Rising sea levels, reduced precipitation in watersheds, and global increases in water consumption are resulting in widespread saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater wetlands. The movement of saline water into these historically freshwater ecosystems is likely to impact plant productivity, the decomposition of roots and litter, the metabolism of soil microbial communities, and, as a result, the rate of organic matter accumulation. Organic matter accumulation is an important factor determining the rate of vertical accretion in tidal freshwater wetlands, and whether these wetlands will be able to "keep up" with rising sea levels. The overall goal of this project is to understand how saltwater intrusion will impact the fate of organic carbon in tidal freshwater wetlands. Several tidal freshwater wetlands in Virginia and South Carolina that cover a range of soil types, plant communities, and potential responses to saltwater intrusion will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastal marshes supply a number of important ecosystem goods and services, including water quality improvement, floodwater buffering, and habitat for economically and ecologically important plants and animals. As sea level rises, it is critical to understand whether and how freshwater tidal wetlands will be able to keep pace by building soil volume. This research will allow us to understand and perhaps respond to the effects of climate change on tidal freshwater wetlands.</AbstractNarration>

By building soil, tidal wetlands are able to grow vertically and can avoid being permanently submerged by rising sea levels. Because organic matter accumulation is important in building soil volume, changes in organic matter storage have implications for the ability of these wetlands to track rising sea levels and will ultimately play a role in determining the long-term stability and persistence of these valuable coastal ecosystems.

Introduction, Hypothesis and Objectives   Wetlands are important ecosystems that provide a multitude of services for humanity such as serving as a reservoir for freshwater, controlling floods on the landscape, and serving as key nursery habitat for inland and coastal fisheries. Importantly, wetlands store almost one-third of the world?s carbon while covering a mere 3-4% of the terrestrial land area. Vertical accretion in tidal wetlands is governed by net input of organic matter (a function of both production and decomposition) and inorganic matter; any factor that changes either organic or inorganic accumulation rates will impact the ability of these systems to grow vertically and keep up with rising sea levels. The goal of this project was to determine how saltwater intrusion impacts the fate of organic carbon in coastal freshwater wetlands by examining factors that affect the decomposition of soil organic matter.  Experimental Design, Research Sites and Methods   We established a suite of twelve tidal freshwater wetland sites, six sites in South Carolina and six in Virginia, that collectively span gradients of dominant vegetation (herbaceous marsh vs. forested swamp versus scrub-shrub wetland), soil characteristics (e.g., high versus low organic matter content), and hydrology. We exposed the soils from these sites to either freshwater or low salinity brackish water and measured rates of total decomposition (as production of carbon dioxide and methane), quantified the desorption of organic carbon from soils, and assessed how quickly that desorbed material was broken down by microbial processes. We collected baseline data on soil properties, plants, and porewater, and used spectroscopic techniques to examine the chemical composition of desorbed soil organic carbon. We related our indices of organic matter preservation and decomposition to various environmental drivers.  We provided training to multiple technicians and undergraduate students, each of whom helped with field sample collection, laboratory analyses, and data processing. All of these individuals also received training in concepts relating to wetland science, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem ecology. The Carbon Awareness Partnership (CAP) was created as part of the outreach component of this grant and has now been active in the greater Richmond area since 2011. The primary goals of our CAP program were 1) to provide Virginia high school teachers with strong lesson plans and hands-on activities that focus on C cycle, and 2) to expand scientific literacy and competency at the secondary school level.  Results   Our results show very interesting trends in responses of freshwater wetland soils to saltwater intrusion. In the low organic soils of the Virginia wetlands, increasing salinity caused a decrease in pathways of decomposition that result in the production of methane but did not affect the production of carbon dioxide through decomposition. In contrast, neither carbon dioxide nor methane production of the wetland soils was affected by salinity at the South Carolina sites.

This work raises interesting questions about the effects of saltwater intrusion, suggesting the decrease in organic matter inputs caused by plant stress in response to rising salinity is more important than changes in decomposition in influencing how much organic matter can be stored in wetland soils.
