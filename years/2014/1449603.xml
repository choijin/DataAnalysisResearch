<AbstractNarration>A low cost and accurate motion capture system is a fundamental improvement in the technology that is available to physician, physical therapists, and other medical professionals to diagnosis, treat, and monitor patients with movement disorders in the lower-extremity. Currently motion analysis systems cost tens of thousands dollars; require dedicated space and special training for operations. Therefore the cost to perform motion analysis is up to one thousand dollars per session and only available in large hospitals.  The availability of low-cost depth cameras brings the possibility to perform motion analysis with a fraction of the current cost. In this proposal, the team has developed a clinically viable 3D markerless motion capture system that meets the strident needs of the medical community for a high accuracy and precision as well as convenience and affordability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team proposes to use a commercially available depth and color camera to accurately and precisely define movement mechanics of injured populations. The team has developed an effective system for human pose tracking that achieves comparative accuracy to marker-based systems. Moreover, the team has developed novel algorithms for complex human pose tracking in general scenes that achieves state-of-the-art results. The proposed system will build upon the current pipeline of novel algorithms to achieve higher accuracy and robustness for the relatively better controlled motions commonly used in clinics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this award was to explore the potential for the commercialization of our technology which is 3D markerless motion capture.  We conducted over 100 customer interviews and have gained significant insights into the mode, type, and cost points needed to transition this technology from the laboratory  to the marketplace.  Additionally, we were able to participate in weekly training meeting with other teams and gain significant insights into the business model canvas.  Along the way we gained many critical insights about exactly who our customers really are and what their needs are. We have been able to focus on what is likely our largest customer segment  with earliest adaptation to our product first.   We have continued to develop a prototype of our technology to best fit our customer segment and have worked on several significant remaining challenges to make it ready for commercial use.  These include making the technology fast enough for commercial users and simplifying the user interface such that a person with minimal training could use the product.   We believe successfully brining our product to market will have a significant impact on health and well being of many who have had an injury that affects their ability to move.
