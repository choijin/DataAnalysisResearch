<AbstractNarration>1438578&lt;br/&gt;Chandran&lt;br/&gt;1438221&lt;br/&gt;Ramsburg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The widespread occurrence and environmental impacts of microconstituents has received increasing attention in recent years. An important class of microconstituents is pharmaceutically active compounds. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests chronic exposure to pharmaceutically active compounds, even at extremely low concentrations could have adverse effects on ecosystems, such as impaired embryo development, modified feeding and social behavior of fish, suppression of growth and reduction in respiration in algae. While some of these effects are reversible, other anatomical, physiological, and genetic alterations are permanent. Thus, the challenge of assessing, understanding, and mitigating the deleterious influence of pharmaceutically active compounds, and microconstituents more broadly, on the environment is one of the great challenges facing the environmental engineering and science community. Current approaches to study pharmaceutically active compounds fate in biological wastewater treatment generally lack a mechanistic basis and therefore cannot unambiguously pinpoint the protagonist microbial communities and metabolic pathways that are active in the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds. This leads to a lack of consensus regarding the identity of active species and critical attenuation processes. To unravel the conundrum of complexity and site specific results, the PIs propose a fundamental approach to understanding the fate of pharmaceutically active compounds - one that can guide future research and implementation efforts. This project aims to develop a clear understanding of the microbial "active fraction" in activated sludge which is responsible for the transformation and removal of pharmaceutically active compounds, and to elucidate the constituent metabolic pathways. A secondary objective is to quantify and differentiate between growth associated (linked to anabolism) and non-growth associated (linked to catabolism or fortuitous reactions) pharmaceutically active compounds transformation and degradation. Understanding the interplay of microbial processes acting on contaminants of emerging concern is critical to meeting the scientific challenges now facing water quality researchers and professionals. The approach to understanding these processes offered in the proposed research may seed future scientific investigations aimed at understanding biodegradation mechanisms throughout the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The influence of anthropogenic chemical mixtures present within the environment at low concentration is one of the great challenges facing scientists and engineers in the 21st century. Effective wastewater treatment is critical to maintaining water quality, but what is traditionally thought of as effective may need to also include microconstituents - compounds that these facilities were never specifically designed to treat. This study will further the development and application of advanced microbial-ecological techniques to shed new light on how bacteria within activated sludge interact with pharmaceutically active compounds. The advanced understanding enabled by these state-of-the-art molecular tools can be extended to interrogate pharmaceutically active compound metabolism in different activated sludge configurations. Further, the knowledge of the "active fraction" and metabolic pathways can help improve standardized protocols that can be used by future studies to estimate the extant biokinetic parameters and to construct more accurate predictive models for pharmaceutically active compounds removal. From a fundamental perspective, there is no metabolic model to date, that can describe pharmaceutically active compounds degradation pathways. This is possibly due to a lack of detailed studies related to understanding the mechanisms by which pharmaceutically active compounds are biodegraded within mixed communities of bacteria. As part of this project, the PIs propose to develop and parameterize such a model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Importance of Research  The influence of anthropogenic chemical mixtures present within the environment at low concentration is one of the great challenges now facing scientists and engineers.    Effective wastewater treatment is critical to maintaining water quality, but there is increased emphasis on understanding how wastewater treatment can influence concentrations of emerging contaminants and microconstituents - compounds that water resource recovery facilities were never specifically designed to treat.  Our research focused on one class of microconstituents ? pharmaceuticals present in wastewater.  More specifically, this research project focused on three commonly prescribed beta blockers, atenolol, metoprolol, and sotalol, as well as a limited number of benzodiazepines.  While beta blockers and benzodiazepines have important therapeutic uses, low concentrations of these compounds in the environment present the possibility of causing neuroendocrine disrupting effects for aquatic species.  In this project we aimed to understand how bacteria used to treat wastewater may transform the selected pharmaceuticals during the processes of ammonia oxidation and denitrification.  Intellectual Merit  Degradation of benzodiazepines was not observed in our research.  Thus, laboratory experiments focused on the representative beta blockers, where we found evidence of atenolol and metoprolol degradation in conditions that mimic those found in water resource recovery facilities.  Results suggest that in water resource recovery facilities designed for nitrification, the ammonia oxidizing bacteria may co-metabolize these pharmaceuticals at rates that are disproportionately higher than suggested by their relatively small population within the microbial community.  Experiments conducted under denitrifying conditions suggest that atenolol is fortuitously degraded, perhaps by a limited number of microorganisms present within the diverse microbial community present at water resource recovery facilities.  Thus, findings from this project support the evidence emerging from the community of research that degradation of some microconstituents is synergistic with nitrogen treatment.   Broader Impacts  Understanding the interplay of microbial processes acting on contaminants of emerging concern, and specifically microconstituents, is critical to meeting the scientific challenges now facing water quality researchers and professionals.  Results from this project contribute to understanding of the conditions under which some of these compounds may be degraded.  Results from the laboratory support development of models that can be used to assess degradation and perhaps one day improve the effectiveness of treatment of microconstituents.  The project has supported the training of both graduate and undergraduate students at Tufts University.  As these students enter the workforce, their training will provide a resource to the community of water quality professionals.       Last Modified: 12/31/2019       Submitted by: C.
