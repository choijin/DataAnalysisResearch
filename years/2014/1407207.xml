<AbstractNarration>Many systems of scientific and technological importance can be represented as networks: the Internet, the power grid, airline and road networks, biological networks, and social networks, to name just a few.  The last fifteen years have seen a wave of advances in mathematical and computational techniques for understanding these systems and analyzing the massive troves of network data that are becoming available.  The work to be undertaken under this funding will do two things: (1) develop fundamental new mathematics to enhance our understanding of the structure and function of networks of all types, and (2) employ that mathematical foundation in the creation of new measures, metrics, and computer algorithms for practical application to real-world network problems.  The work will draw on mathematical methods from two areas in which the PI has worked extensively: Statistics (Bayesian inference) and spectral theory.  Using these tools the PI and his students and collaborators will develop techniques to tackle a range of network problems, including: the detection of communities of interacting nodes or individuals within larger networks; the identification of the most influential or core nodes with a network; the understanding and prediction of spreading processes on networks, including the spread of diseases over human contact networks; fast and scalable computer algorithms for the analysis of network data on the largest scales; and specific applications to a range of technological, social, and information networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will fund a three-year research effort to develop fundamental mathematical tools for understanding large, real-world networks such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, biological networks, epidemiological contact networks, social networks, and others.  The proposed work focuses on large-scale network properties, rather than local properties, and will employ techniques mainly from two fields, spectral methods and statistical inference.  Recent work by the PI's group and others has produced significant advances, including a number of results revealing deep and previously unsuspected connections between spectral and inference methods. These advances have opened up substantial avenues for new research whose exploration is the primary goal of the proposed work.  Specific projects to be undertaken include the development of random matrix and free probability methods for computing spectra of complex networks within several widely used structural models; development of new inference algorithms for features such as core/periphery structure and centrality, particularly based on belief propagation methods; connections between inference and spectral methods, particularly via the Hashimoto operator which appears in the theory of graph zeta functions; spectral localization and the development of improved spectral centrality measures; applications to network processes such as percolation and disease transmission, which can be treated using belief propagation and hence connected to spectral properties of graphs; applications to spectral algorithms for multiway community detection and other large-scale structure detection problems; connections between spectral and inference methods derived from relaxations of the likelihood function; and model selection methods for network inference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many objects of scientific interest can be represented as networks: the internet is a network of connected computers; social networks, both on- and off-line, are networks of interactions between people or groups; information networks like the web and citation networks represent the structure of bodies of information; and biological networks such as neural networks or metabolic networks are crucial to the workings of our brains and cells.  Analysis of the structure and behavior of these and similar networks provides one of the best tools we have for understanding a wide range of complex systems from the internet and transportation to human health, markets, and society itself.  Intellectual merit: The research conducted under this funding has aimed to develop fundamental new mathematical tools for analyzing and understanding the structure of networked systems.  At the mathematical level, the techniques developed have focused on two specific approaches.  The first is spectral techniques, which capture the structure of networks as mathematical matrices then analyze those matrices to shed light on the networks they represent.  The second approach makes use of inference methods, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.  In this approach one formulates mathematical models of the processes by which networks are created, then fits those models to observed network data.  The parameters of the fit give us information about network structure in a manner analogous to (though more complicated than) the way the fit of a straight line through a set of data points gives us information about the slope of the data.  Within these broad classes of techniques, a number of applications were developed to specific network-related problems and systems.  A substantial part of the research conducted under this project has focused on community structure in networks -- the commonly observed phenomenon in which the nodes of a network divide into groups, with dense connections within groups but sparser connections between groups.  The ability to detect communities in networks gives us a way to split very large networks into smaller parts that can be tractably analyzed, as well as shedding light on the structure of networks at the largest scales.  Work performed in this area under the current funding includes development of community detection algorithms for use in networks where the data are noisy or uncertain, methods for determining the exact number of groups in a network, fast spectral algorithms for community detection, and continuous or "fuzzy" generalizations of community structure useful for instance in the analysis of geographical data.  Other work completed under this funding includes: development of new centrality measures for networks, which allow us to identify the most important or central nodes in a network; studies of core-periphery structure, in which networks are found to divide into a dense central core of the best connected nodes and a sparser periphery of satellite nodes; the mathematical theory of percolation phenomena in networks, which is used to model the robustness of networked systems like the internet to failure of their nodes; methods for analysis of network data that includes so-called metadata, meaning accompanying labels or annotations, in arbitrary format, that may help improve our understanding of structural features; and studies of models of dynamic networks that change their structure over time.  Broader impacts: The work performed under this funding is broadly interdisciplinary in nature and has the potential for broad impact and substantial benefits to society across a range of areas outside of mathematics.  The work performed includes applications to a wide selection of networked systems, including the internet, social networks, linguistic networks, protein-protein interaction networks in biology, web networks, ecological networks, genetic networks, and others.  Computer codes for algorithms developed during the work have been made available to other researchers and have potential application in many areas across the physical, biological, social, and information sciences.  More generally, the mathematical techniques developed form a foundation for potential future advances in methods, algorithms, and applications of networks in science, technology, medicine, and industry.
