<AbstractNarration>The transition from surface-based to elevated convection and the subsequent organization and evolution of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) as the nocturnal stable boundary layer (NSBL) develops is not well understood, complicating the forecastability of severe winds.  During the transition from discrete cells to an MCS, severe surface winds may be generated but the processes responsible for the onset, intensification, and cessation of these winds are uncertain. Likely the hydrometeor type, distribution, and evolution within these MCSs, as well as the evolving properties of the NSBL, environmental shear and other factors play important roles in the initiation and maintenance of intense, surface-reaching downdrafts. The research will investigate how intense-wind-causing downdrafts reach the surface in the presence of a NSBL through characterization of the MCS and transitioning-to-MCS convective system kinematics, thermodynamics and microphysics, and how these are influenced by the local environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study uses data from the Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) project, planned for 2015, in addition to already collected but less complete data sets from the field programs. PECAN kinematic, thermodynamic and microphysical data obtained from a large and diverse array of observing data will enable the study of initiation/transition, evolution, internal kinematics and microphysics of severe-wind-producing MCSs. Multiple-Doppler analysis will be used to quantify the 3D winds through the depth of the MCS. Internal microphysical processes will be inferred from the radar reflectivity and dual-polarization fields and surface disdrometer data. Sounding systems and wind profilers will be used to diagnose atmospheric stability, depth of the NSBL, vertical wind structure and the location of the nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ). Mobile mesonet and stationary weather stations including Pods and PISAs, will be used to quantify the strength and horizontal extent of the surface cold pool, and quantify severe winds at the surface. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The multi-platform integrated observational study will result in a better understanding of the microphysical, thermodynamic and kinematic processes underlying nocturnal MCS evolution, transition from daytime to nocturnal/MCS organization, and how these are influenced by the NSBL during severe wind events. The research will result in a better understanding of the factors leading to the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of severe nocturnal winds. This research will also provide analyses fundamental to understanding whether severe-wind producing MCSs are elevated, surfaced-based, or hybrid systems, the microphysical composition of these systems, and the kinematics of these systems before, during, and after the occurrence of severe surface winds, and how they are affected by the local environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Analyses, results, and improved scientific understanding from the research will be made available to the modeling and forecasting communities. Improvements to numerical models and hence the forecasting of the occurrence, severity and timing of nocturnal severe-wind producing MCSs will benefit from these fine-scale observational analyses through comparison with model output and predictions. Better understanding, leading to improved forecasts will aid in mitigating the impact of these severe-wind producing events. Education of students through the development of a PECAN-specific university course focusing on radar and mesoscale observations, participation in the field phase of PECAN, and subsequent analysis efforts will help train the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Hazards associated with transitioning and nocturnal convective systems, such as high winds and flooding, can pose a danger to life and property.  Predicting the occurrence, location, and timing of high wind events, in particular, is challenging.  In real-time, it is a nowcasting challenge to diagnosing whether the strong winds seen aloft, by radar, are making it to the surface and, hence, causing damage.  Results from the analyses of three PECAN cases suggest that systems with damaging winds have strong and deep cold pools that have some composition of air parcels that original in the surface boundary layer.  While the shape of these systems is complex, damaging winds are more likely in the parts of the system where the gust front shear is line perpendicular.  All of the analyzed systems contained sub-system scale vortices that were associated with enhanced wind speeds.               Broader Impacts:  Complex convective systems impact not only the United States, but other countries, as well.  Applying similar analysis methods to MCSs observed in Argentina during the RELAMPAGO project will yield a greater understanding of and the ability to diagnose the impacts of these systems.  Tools developed as part of the PECAN grant will be applied to more cases to gain a general understanding of severe wind producing MCSs in varied topography.  Two postdocs and 11 students participated in the field portion of the PECAN experiment and were supervised by the PIs.  In addition, as part of this award, the PIs co-taught a seminar course on field project planning, design, and analysis at the University of Colorado.  Both of these activities, coupled with publications, presentations and conferences, seminars, and general interest events contributed to the education of people from varied backgrounds.
