<AbstractNarration>Improving the success and retention of community college students in STEM, especially underrepresented minority students, is crucial for increasing the number of STEM graduates nationwide.  CUNY Kingsborough Community College, which serves a largely low income and highly diverse population of students, proposes to develop, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive set of proven approaches that target the major barriers of unpreparedness, lack of support networks, financial burdens, and inability to connect STEM education with daily life for students in their beginning biology courses.  Improving student success in these early biology courses will lead to improvements in retention and increase the number of STEM students graduating and transferring to 4-year institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three types of activities are proposed for students selected to participate in this program.  First, a Strategies for Success in STEM workshop will be offered prior to General Biology I to strengthen basic reading, math, and study skills.  Second, a community of biology learners will be established for students to collaboratively review biological principles, build camaraderie, and interact with faculty outside of the classroom setting.  Third, a campus as a research lab approach that leverages the existing campus aquarium, farm, beach, and marine technology facilities will provide relevant research experiences and one-on-one faculty mentoring.  Support will also be provided for faculty to develop and implement new pedagogies, receive training in assessment of classroom activities, and participate in opportunities to communicate their work both on campus and with the larger community.  The goals are to improve student performance and retention; foster greater understandings of nature, science, and citizenship; and enhance the capacities of the faculty to engage students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these activities will be carefully evaluated through student interviews, concept inventories, assignments in community of biology learner meetings that explore misconceptions about biological concepts, and reflection papers about their campus as a research lab experiences.  Evaluation of faculty activities will include interviews, surveys, focus groups, publications, presentations, and tracking of faculty involved in the project.  Progress will be measured by the degree to which the project met its benchmarks.  The mixed methods evaluation will provide valuable information, models, and materials that other community colleges can use as they struggle to improve STEM learning, retention, and transfer for low-income and underrepresented minority students.</AbstractNarration>

These projects displayed the interdisciplinary nature of science to other disciplines such as engineering, math, and chemistry.  Examples of projects included oyster cultivation, construction of "living walls" made of plants grown by the students, Jamaica water quality analysis from our campus beach.     The student impact of each of the project’s activities was assessed. For the S3 Workshop, daily student reflections were analyzed for recurring themes. Students reported they felt they had a greater connection to the KCC biology faculty, advisors, and their peers. In addition, students reported they had a better understanding of the requirements to complete their degree as well as the resources and support program available to them.  Students also mentioned they felt more confident about basics skills reviewed in the S3 Workshop (metrics conversation, foundational mathematical and statistical concepts, scientific notation; study skills and note-taking; critical thinking and problem solving).  Assessment of the CoBL activity involved comparing the General Biology 1 and 2 grades of Crossroads students to those who did not participate. Student grades were compared over the five years project period.  For General Biology 1, 64.7% of the Crossroads students (99 out of 153) received a grade of A/B/C compared to 60.2% of the students (1,741 out of 2,911) that did not participate.  For General Biology, 75.8% of the Crossroads students (69 out of 91) received a grade of A/B/C compared to 74.7% of the students (1,034 out of 1,391) that did not participate.   Finally, the CoBL and CRL activities were assessed using the following three validated surveys: Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS), a multiple-choice survey that assesses students’ attitudes about biology; the Science Process and Reasoning Skills Test (SPARST),which assesses biology students’ acquisition and mastery of science process skills; and Project Ownership Survey (POS), a survey that measures project ownership and emotions about their CRL research experience.  Students completed the questions from the CLASS and SPARST surveys at the start of CoBL-1 (pre-survey) and at the end of CoBL-2 (post-survey). The post-survey also included POS survey items. Analysis of the SPARST results found students had statistically significant changes int their responses to questions about analyzing treatments, controlling for variables and understanding the parts of primary literature papers. For the CLASS questions, statistically significant changes were seen in students’ response to statements about relating biology to their everyday life, applying biological concepts to new situations, and using their personal experiences to relate to a biological topic being analyzed.

In addition, students responded that they felt their project impacted the larger scientific community and gained personal satisfaction.   Based on the data gathered over the past five years with biology majors, students participating in the Crossroads project were more likely to participate in research programs and felt more connected to the college. This information allows KCC to plan to expand this project’s activities to other STEM majors with the ultimate goals of improving the student experience and increasing the number of STEM majors.
