<AbstractNarration>Science is often taught not as a coherent body of knowledge, but as distinct, unrelated topics. The Next Generation Science Standards aim to change this by organizing science teaching around crosscutting concepts, which reflect the coherence of science through their use in explanations of phenomena in different scientific domains. This project will address the research questions of how crosscutting concepts develop longitudinally,  how this development can be supported across different science topics, and whether the learning of crosscutting concepts is improved. The project will create computerized, simulation-based instructional modules for use in middle school earth science that teach crosscutting concepts. This project not only will document student learning of these important ideas, but also will analyze how this learning occurs, what support is reliably related to this learning, and how these ideas might develop in response to support across different earth science topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on learning crosscutting concepts of scale, systems and cycles as they are supported across three middle school earth science topics: ecosystems, plate tectonics and climate. The project will leverage previous work by the PI and other team members by building upon the SimScientists simulations already constructed, and upon their demonstrated technique of embedding assessments in the simulations to inform what students learn while simultaneously providing feedback on the simulation design. Initial efficacy of the simulations will be established with 13 teachers and 1300 students. Results of this project will have impact not only through use of the simulations by these and other middle school students, but also through research on how cross-cutting concepts can be supported over time in multiple scientific domains.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>The SimScientists Crosscutting Concepts </strong>project developed computerized, simulation-based instructional modules with curriculum embedded formative assessment, to determine how learning of cross-cutting concepts of Scale, proportion, and quantity (Scale); Systems and system models (Systems); Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation (Cycles) progresses within and across three topics in middle school Earth science (ecosystems, geology including plate tectonics, erosion, and deposition, and climate and weather). In total the project developed a total of 10 modules, including simulation-based instructional modules, simulation-based assessments, and a pre/post instrument. The focus of these modules is making explicit student understand of and progress toward mastery of crosscutting concepts. Instructional modules incorporate real-time feedback and coaching tailored to individual students based on their responses. The embedded assessments are intended for formative use by providing timely feedback to students and teachers, opportunities for student self-assessment, and reports to students and teachers that focus on the level of assistance students need to complete investigations and other simulation-based tasks included in the assessments. &nbsp;&nbsp;Figures 1-3 provide examples of the instructional modules, feedback, and benchmark assessments.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project also developed detailed learning trajectories for three crosscutting concepts identified in the Next Generation Science Standards: Scale, Systems, and Cycles and researched how learning of these concepts is integrated into learning of Earth systems: plate tectonics (geosphere), climate (atmosphere and hydrosphere); and ecosystems (biosphere).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>The project tested and gathered evidence of the reliability and validity of these hypothetical learning trajectories through items developed with the intent to measure levels of understanding of the crosscutting concepts. The items were administered through the simulation-based assessments for middle school Earth sciences. Evidence from studies comparing the impact of using the simulation-based assessment systems to typical instruction demonstrated their promise for improving learning of crosscutting concepts content, within a given unit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Validation of the learning trajectories centered on the assumption that items on an assessment developed for different levels of the assessment will have IRT difficulties that correlate with the learning trajectory level. The results of this analysis support this assumption for each of the three crosscutting concepts included in the study.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The study also investigated the impact of using the modules on student learning, in an underpowered RCT with 21 teachers and their students in the treatment group that used all of the modules, and 20 teachers in a business-as-usual control group that used only the pre- and posttest. IRT EAP scale scores for the pretest and posttest assessment were generated for an overall estimate of science ability and for each of the three crosscutting concepts: Scale, Systems, and Cycles, to measure the effect of using SimScientists on a traditional, multiple-choice posttest created to independently measure learning of the crosscutting concepts across treatment and control conditions, controlling for pre-test and student background characteristics. The analytical sample consisted of 2,420 students with both pretest/posttest scores and student background characteristics, in the classrooms of 41 teachers. Overall, across the four domains, there were no statistical differences found between the two samples. Hedge's <em>g</em> effect sizes ranged from -0.03 to 0.14 standard deviation units. Although none of the treatment differences were statistically significant across the 4 measures, performance on cycles yielded the largest treatment difference with a non-trivial effect size of 0.15 standard deviation units.
