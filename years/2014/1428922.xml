<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Cornell University to support the acquisition and technical management of a new type of light microscope that provides the resolution to see and differentiate features in living cells as small as 20 nm, or 5000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. This is more than a 10 fold improvement over what is achievable using a conventional light microscope.  In addition to enabling new avenues of biological and biomedical research that are now impossible without it, the instrument will be located in the Cornell Imaging Core Facility so that it is open and available to investigators and students from all areas of scientific research inside and outside of Cornell.  The imaging facility has a steady flow of students passing through it due to its participation in the numerous outreach programs occurring at Cornell.  The facility hosts educational workshops and supports STEM initiatives on campus by providing tours and demonstration modules for a wide range of outreach activities. In particular, broadening the participation of women and under-represented minorities in engineering and biotechnology is a major focus at Cornell, and the facility routinely offers unique imaging laboratory modules for programs such as CATALYST and Expand Your Horizons. The acquisition of a unique and cutting edge super-resolution light microscope will provide graduate, undergraduate and local and visiting high school students with access to a type of instrument not available anywhere else in the region.  It will make students of all ages aware of the remarkable developments in technology and engineering that are continually advancing fields such as imaging, and let them see the inner workings of living cells in ways that no one has ever before seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The newly acquired microscope will be used in variety of research projects ranging from high resolution studies of the cellular biochemical signaling machinery, to investigations into the molecular structure of cellulose in research directed at improving biofuels. It will allow for the spatial, temporal and functional relationships between, for example, proteins that regulate transcription and the gene being transcribed to be mapped and quantified. The field of super-resolution microscopy is in its infancy and new and important applications of optical super-resolution are being demonstrated in all areas of the life sciences at a remarkable rate.  Cornell has a high level of microscopy and biological imaging experience and a particularly broad repertoire of applications, and as such, is an ideal site for an instrument such as this to be located.  The extensive microscopy expertise available at Cornell will lead to synergistic advances in biological imaging and extend the emerging field of super resolution microscopy through the development of new methodologies tailored for the specific applications of the investigators.  This type of synergy will translate into the most significant and broadest possible impact of the research carried out using the instrument, and ultimately advance the knowledge base and understanding across diverse fields as the results are published and new technology broadly utilized.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF funded project provided funds for the acquisition of a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 super-resolution optical microscope through the NSF?s Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program.  The instrument provides biomedical and biological researchers at Cornell University with a cutting-edge imaging tool that allows them to see the inner workings of cells at a level not previously possible with a conventional light microscope.   Super-resolution microscopy refers to a range of evolving optical technologies that break the optical diffraction of around 250 nanometers inherent in standard light microscopes.  Depending on the mode of operation, these types of microscopes can see objects as small as 20 nanometers in diameter &ndash; about 1/10,000 of the thickness a human hair.  Using it, investigators at Cornell are now able to quantify structural details in fixed and living specimens which were currently un-resolvable and non-measurable.   This instrument has been particularly valuable for studying interactions between proteins and other biological molecules that are involved in the countless number of biochemical signaling pathways in cells, investigations of the molecular structure of cells, and of factors that control how are genes are expressed in the cell?s nucleus and their associations with developmental abnormalities and disease.  The instrument has been installed in the Cornell University Biotechnology Resource Center (BRC) Imaging Facility which provides open access to the instrument as a Shared Resource.  The project principal investigator (PI) and project personnel have the technical expertise required for the optimal implementation of this cutting-edge super-resolution microscope, and provide full-time maintenance, user training and assistance.  In addition, the PI has developed several new software programs specifically customized for the analysis of the different types of unique imaging and single molecule data the microscope can collect, which extends the use of the instrument as new needs have arisen in some the research projects being carried out in the facility.  There are currently no similar instruments on or near the Cornell campus in Ithaca, and over the past three years the instrument has advanced research projects in all areas of the life sciences at Cornell as well as for other fields such as materials research.   Outside users from nearby universities, including the University of Rochester, SUNY Albany, Syracuse University and SUNY Upstate Medical in Syracuse have travelled to Cornell for imaging experiments.  The Zeiss Elyra microscope has become a heavily used instrument that has expanded the research infrastructure at Cornell, helping make the Cornell Microscopy Facility one of the most advanced university imaging centers in the United States.
