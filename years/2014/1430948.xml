<AbstractNarration>Professor Mark Cane has been a leader in the field of climate dynamics for over three decades, and his research has led to fundamental advances in our understanding of the climate system.  His research spans the fields of tropical ocean dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, seasonal forecasting, applications of climate science to society, data analysis techniques, and paleoclimate dynamics. He was a developer of the first self-consistent dynamical model of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which was used to produce the first successful forecast of an El Nino event from a dynamical model (the 1986/87 event, which was predicted a year and a half in advance).  This work paved the way for routine predictions of ENSO and the development of operational seasonal-to-interannual predictions of global climate variability. He has also led the way in the application of climate information for the betterment of society.  More generally, his work has lead to broad recognition of the key role played by the tropics in climate variability, climate change, and the evolution of past climates. Much of the recent work on tropical paleoclimate and its global implications can be directly traced back to Professor Cane's pioneering efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-day symposium consists of a series of invited presentations highlighting key advances made during the past few decades in understanding the role of the tropics in the climate system, as well as outstanding problems in the field. The symposium will focus on two main areas: ENSO dynamics and societal applications of ENSO prediction; and tropical climate change from the distant past to the future. Presentations are intended to provide a broad and up-to-date perspective on each topic, and provide context for panel discussions that will focus on key questions and strategies for future progress. The underlying theme of the symposium is the extent to which the tropics play a dominant role in variations of global climate on all timescales, from year-to-year fluctuations to paleoclimate evolution to future climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds provided through this grant will be used to cover the travel costs of students, postdocs, and invited speakers. Travel funds for students and postdocs will be advertised to the community and made available through a competitive process.  The symposium will have a broad scientific impact by encouraging the exchange of ideas between climate scientists in different stages of their research careers. It will also provide an opportunity for prominent researchers to educate and inspire the next generation of scientists in research areas related to tropical climate dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A symposium was held at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University to honor Professor Mark CaneÃ†s 70th birthday. Prof. Cane is one of the leading climate scientists of the last half-century and a long term Professor at Columbia and member of the scientific staff of Lamont.   Prof. Cane was the first person to predict in advance an El Nino event (the 1986/87 one) and initiated the field of seasonal to interannual climate prediction.  His career has focused on the role of the tropics in driving climate variability around the world and on the impact that climate variability has on society.  The symposium brought together elder statespersons in climate research, middle career scientists and junior scientists to honor Prof. Cane and to review current theories about how the tropics influence climate worldwide, how the tropics are affected by the extratropics and how climate variability and change impact human society.   Intellectual Merit:  The presenters presented a comprehensive overview of the historical evolution and current state of research into climate prediction, tropical atmosphere-ocean interaction and tropical-extratropical teleconnections.  The symposium highlighted the tremendous advances in the field, and improvement in understanding of the physics of the climate system, as well as making clear the near term and longer term challenges that remain, including the role that tropical atmosphere-ocean dynamics will play in climate adjustment to human-induced changes in radiative forcing.  The symposium also presented much very new research into societal impacts of climate variability and change including exciting developments in the fields of climate and conflict and how extreme weather events can influence long term prospects for economic development.   Broader Impacts:   Presenters showed the vast leaps that have occurred in seasonal to interannual prediction turning it from a basic NSF funded project involving a few people into the multi-institutional multinational effort involving hundreds of people it is now.  Seasonal to interannual prediction, it was shown, now provides information of use in water resource, agricultural, economic and health planning worldwide.  In addition it was shown how the study of the impacts of climate on society has transformed into a data-driven quantitative science.  Young scientists were able to learn about these transformations of research fields, discuss them with the scientists who made it happen and took the opportunity to present their own research and ideas to an audience of world leaders in climate research.
