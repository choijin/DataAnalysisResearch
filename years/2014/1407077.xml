<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the international meeting "Building Bridges: 2nd EU/US Summer School &amp; Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics," which will take place June 30 to July 11, 2014, at the University of Bristol, England.  The website with details is http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~mamjd/bb/index.html.  Grant funds will be used to support US-based participants in the international summer school and workshop.  This conference follows the success of the meeting "Building Bridges: 1st Summer School &amp; Workshop," held in Aachen, Germany, in August 2012.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms are present in almost every area of modern number theory, and they are becoming increasingly important in mathematical physics.  Current research on automorphic forms is being impacted by such topics as "Explicit Methods for Modular Forms and L-functions," "The Legacy of Ramanujan," and "The Langlands Program," which are the three mini-course topics for the summer school.  Each mini-course is led by a team of two internationally-recognized researchers, and will consist of three hours of lecture each morning, followed by work sessions (in small groups) in the afternoon, focused on exercises developed by the instructors.  Designated post-doctoral researchers and the instructors will provide tutorial support during these sessions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Following the summer school is a conference on automorphic forms and related topics, where participants will present cutting-edge research in all areas related to automorphic forms.  This workshop aims not only to foster and strengthen a long-lasting exchange between automorphic forms researchers in the EU and the US, but also to generate and sustain a friendly, supportive atmosphere, providing encouragement to young researchers, establishing mentoring opportunities for more established researchers, and serving as a forum for exchanging ideas and forming new collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Building Bridges Summer School + Workshop series began in 2012, with the primary aim of fostering and strengthening a long-lasting exchange between automorphic forms researchers in the EU, the US, and beyond.   The purpose of the research school is to bring together an international group of Ph.D. students and early-career researchers, to provide training on some topics that are having great impact on current research in automorphic forms. The school is comprised of three 2-day intensive mini-courses, each team-taught by a pair of experts. The school aims to facilitate new connections between topics of the school and topics of the current research of the participants, as well as  new connections between researchers.  Based on the long-standing annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics held (with one exception) in the United States for over two decades, the workshop aims to generate and sustain a friendly, supportive atmosphere, providing encouragement to young researchers, mentoring opportunities for more established researchers, and a forum for exchanging ideas and forming new collaborations. All school participants are strongly encouraged to participate in the workshop, and all workshop participants are encouraged to give talks.  Both the research school and the workshop were highly successful.  The expert instructors provided excellent lectures, and the students had the opportunity to learn and discuss the material as they worked on exercises in the study sessions, with supervision from TAs.  The conference maintained the friendly atmosphere, and along with the talks, had an important international panel discussion on "Encouraging and supporting diversity in the mathematics community."  There were ninety international participants, of whom twenty were funded by the NSF.  Seven of those receiving NSF funding were women.  With remaining funds and a No-Cost Extension, a second conference was held at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, from June 2-4, 2016.  It was called the "Southern New England Conference on Quadratic Forms and Modular Forms," and the aim was to provide a smaller conference with the same friendly atmosphere as in Building Bridges, with plenary speakers in the morning, and shorter (20-30 minute) talks given by participants in the afternoon.  NSF funding was used to support the travel and hotel of junior participants.  Fourteen individuals received NSF funding, of whom seven were women.
