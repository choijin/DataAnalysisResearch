<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to address the problem of short battery lifetimes, which continue to frustrate users of smart phones. Existing approaches to battery management are proving too inflexible to respond to the significant variations in application program energy consumption, user behavior, charging habits, and battery lifetime expectations that both define and complicate the energy management problem. This level of diversity means that "one size fits all" approaches are likely to fail, as are approaches that make broad generalizations about applications or users: one user's favorite application may cause unacceptable battery drain for another user. One user may be willing to charge multiple times per day while another wants their phone to last all day. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project research approaches the battery lifetime problem through a novel energy management framework, named Jouler. Jouler is distinguished from other efforts in three ways: First, Jouler is automated, removing the user from the loop to reduce the burdensome and error-prone nature of manual energy management. Second, Jouler is flexible, encapsulating energy management strategies into policy modules that can be distributed through application marketplaces and installed as needed by users. By separating energy management policies from mechanisms, Jouler also enables innovation in energy management algorithms, which can now be written by developers and evaluated like apps. Third, Jouler attempts to provide a cross-device framework to allow energy managers to work successfully across broad classes of smartphone devices with different features. The educational and outreach activities of the project include a new course on energy management, a yearly challenge contest to increase interest in policy module development, and a new energy management assignment augmenting a widely-used instructional operating system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Smartphone battery consumption remains an important concern to smartphone users. Limited battery lifetimes both frustrated users and limit the impact of these transformative mobile devices. In addition, concerns about battery consumption cause smartphone users to be reluctant about participating in systems and studies that leverage the ubiquity of smartphones to instrument and study the world around us.  The Jouler project examined all aspects of smartphone energy consumption and management: features of the smartphone device itself, energy management by software running on the device, and user behavior and variation related to daily energy consumption.  Based on detailed energy consumption traces collected from users of the PhoneLab smartphone testbed, we proposed an architecture and system support for personalized energy management. The Jouler system modifies Android to enable personalized energy management through policy modules that can be easily developed, tested, and widely distributed.  During the course of our investigations we also discovered important energy-related aspects of the underlying smartphone hardware. We noticed significant differences in energy consumption between seeming identical devices. These variations arise from natural differences in the smartphone CPU manufacturing process. But this variation is handled quite differently on smartphones than on laptop and desktop systems. As a result, two identical devices can present very different energy consumption profiles.  These differences are both important for users to know about and for researchers to understand. The Jouler project helped raise awareness about these effects both among users and among scientists, who need to account for these variations when performing any experiments that measure smartphone energy usage.
