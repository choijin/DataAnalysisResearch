<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Eric Sharpe at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  The goal of this project is to further develop technical tools and methods used to help extract real-world physics from string theory, the leading contender to unify general relativity with quantum field theory, two of the most significant developments of twentieth-century physics.  The price one pays for that unification is a prediction that the world has more than four spacetime dimensions.  One standard proposal to resolve that discrepancy is via a `compactification' of string theory, in which the extra dimensions are rolled up on some small compact space.  It can be shown that the geometry and topology of that small compact space determine low-energy four-dimensional physics.  This project will further develop tools and techniques for understanding compactifications of string theory and the predictions of various compactifications for low-energy four-dimensional physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically, Professor Sharpe will study `gauged linear sigma models' (GLSM's), one of the most powerful tools used to study string compactifications.  These tools have undergone a striking series of advances within the last few years.  One part of that effort will revolve around extending the technology of supersymmetric localization in two-dimensional theories.  As another part, Professor Sharpe will study dualities in nonabelian (2,2) and (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories in two dimensions.  Professor Sharpe will also continue developing quantum sheaf cohomology, a mathematical generalization of ordinary quantum cohomology that determines stringy nonperturbative corrections to charged matter couplings in heterotic string compactifications, with a special focus on understanding quantum sheaf cohomology in Grassmannians and other objects built via nonabelian GLSM's, as a stepping-stone to computing quantum sheaf cohomology in compact Calabi-Yau manifolds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project derived results on compactifications of string theory, an attempt to unify general relativity and quantum field theory, the two primary developments of twentieth-century physics.  String theory predicts that the universe is ten-dimensional, whereas we only see four space and time dimensions.  A `compactification' of string theory reconciles that mismatch by taking six of the dimensions to be rolled up on a small compact space, whose geometry and topology is only observed indirectly via, for example, the corresponding set of observable low-energy particles.     Over the course of this project we developed some new types of string compactifications, gained insight into some existing compactifications, and also solved some technical questions regarding existing compactifications.  For example, a number of papers were written on `quantum sheaf cohomology' and `(0,2) mirror symmetry,' which compute subtle `non-perturbative' contributions to charged-matter couplings in low-energy quantum field theories derived from string compactificaitons.  We also worked on global aspects of moduli spaces of certain string compactifications, providing the first concrete examples of the `Bagger-Witten line bundle,' something often discussed but previously without any known examples.  We also discussed `higher group' symmetries in string theory, as well as extensions of duality groups appearing in string theory.  Our most recent contribution was a set of constructions of string compactifications which had not previously been realized in string theory.     NSF funds were used to help train graduate students, by providing research support during the summers, as well as travel support for students and faculty to attend conferences and summer schools.
