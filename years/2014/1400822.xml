<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Boris L. Hanin is "Gaussian Random Functions in the Semiclassical Limit." The host institution for the fellowship is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Alice Guionnet.</AbstractNarration>

In the course of this Postdoctoral Fellowship, the PI produced seven articles on topics in the fields of spectral theory, probability, and partial differential equations, along the lines proposed in the project description for the grant. Specifically, the PI, together with collaborator Y. Canzani, wrote three articles on the scaling limit of the spectral projector of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold. The purpose of these articles was the understand the relationship between quantum and classical mechanics (the so-called correspondence principle) in simple case of a single free particle moving along a manifold. The PI also completed, together with collaborators S. Zelditch and P. Zhou, an article about the scaling limit of the spectral projector for the quantum harmonic oscillator at the caustic.

In the other article, the PI, together with T. Beck, obtained some of the first results about nodal sets of eigenfunctions for the harmonic oscillator deep into the classically forbidden region.
