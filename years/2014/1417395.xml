<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of the proposed research is to obtain records of platinum, iridium, and osmium concentrations and osmium isotope ratios in the GISP2 Greenland ice core in order to investigate the hypothesis that there was a meteorite or comet impact at the onset of the Younger Dryas abrupt climate event 12,900 years ago. These analyses will be combined with high-resolution measurements of climate proxies obtained on the same samples. Osmium isotopes have the potential not only to conclusively confirm or refute the presence of an extraterrestrial impact, but also to provide information about the size and type of the impactor, should one be confirmed. High-resolution analyses of the atmospheric circulation proxies sodium, calcium, and iron represent a leap in ice core analysis resolution from one sample per three years to over 100 samples per year. The proposed research activities would contribute towards an understanding of what happened at the Younger Dryas, which will be of broad interest to geologists, geochemists, climatologists, archeologists, astronomers, and the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following recent reports of a large anomaly in platinum concentration in the GISP2 ice core, four investigators propose a series of collaborative analyses at Dartmouth College and the University of Maine on GISP2 ice core samples of Younger Dryas age to: (1) evaluate the platinum spike at the Younger Dryas onset for potential contamination and contributions from volcanic and terrestrial sources, (2) measure osmium concentration and isotope composition to evaluate whether an impact occurred at the Younger Dryas onset and assess the nature of any impactor, and (3) assess the environmental change across this critical climate transition by measuring iron, sodium and calcium at storm-scale resolution using a new laser ablation mass-spectrometry system. The proposed research will provide students with opportunities for engaged learning in order to increase their interest and knowledge of how geochemical investigations provide insights to climate change affecting the Arctic. In particular, this study will constitute a major portion of a Ph.D. thesis and an undergraduate Senior Thesis. It will expose graduate and undergraduate students to cutting-edge geochemical and mass spectrometric techniques.</AbstractNarration>

The abrupt onset of this event appears to have coincided with the Pleistocene megafaunal extinction in North America and Europe and Clovis Paleoindian cultural modifications and population declines. &nbsp;For the last eleven years numerous papers have documented evidence for a Younger Dryas extraterrestrial impact including microspherules, nanodiamonds, magnetic grains, and glass-like carbon, although the hypothesis remains controversial. The discovery of a large Pt anomaly at the onset of Younger Dryas in a Greenland ice-core (GISP2) (Petaev et al., 2013) with a Pt/Ir ratio of ~1200 has been interpreted as the signature of an impact by a geochemically unusual iron meteorite (Sikhote-Alin type). While it is difficult to find terrestrial material with this geochemical fingerprint, extraterrestrial material with such a high Pt/Ir has likewise not been documented.

As the extraterrestrial Os isotope signatures provide a unique fingerprint we expected to settle the question of whether or not there was a meteorite impact at the onset of Younger Dryas. The project was technically very challenging as the expected Os background concentration of ice is of the order of 1 femto-gram per gram of ice (1 fg of Os = 3 million atoms of Os) or less. The anomalous Os enrichment resulting from Sikhote-Alin type of meteorite (Petaev et al., 2013) should be on the order of 600 fg/g. Working with Sungmin Hong (Korea) and J.P.

Using a triple quadrupole ICP-MS instrument (ICP-QQQ) that uses reaction cell technology instrument we have developed highly sensitive protocols to measure Ru, Pd, Ir, and Pt isotope ratios. However, we find that a key chemical (ultrapure hydrogen peroxide) contains high amounts of Pt, Ir, Ru and Pd and cannot be cleaned by any procedure!

We find that the transition begins with a large plinian eruption (Laacher See, Germany) and the climate starts to deteriorate. The Laacher See eruption may have occurred in at least three phases spread over about 15 years. Two earlier pulses of eruption that we identified are associated with high peaks in Os and Pt (#6 and #7). The Os isotope composition unequivocally points to a magmatic and not an extra-terrestrial contribution. Significantly, we did not find any increase in Os at the time period (#3) where a large Pt peak was found by Peteav et al (2013). In fact the corresponding <sup>187</sup>Os/<sup>188</sup>Os ratios are unremarkable. However, most intriguingly, the Younger Dryas Transition ends with a sharp decline in d<sup>18</sup>O just after #1, which marks the time (2.5 years or less) when the Os isotope composition and concentration of ice indicate a 5 fold increase in the accretion of extra-terrestrial material, with respect to present day. If this represents a global increase in extra-terrestrial Os it would indicate a meteorite impact just before the onset of Younger Dryas. If that meteorite was a carbonaceous chondrite its size would be about 70m. Such a meteorite would release an energy of up to 10-50 megatons of exploding TNT. These observations suggest a double-whammy of volcanism and meteorite impact may be involved in the Younger Dryas abrupt cooling.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/24/2018<br>      Modified by: Mukul&nbsp;Sharma</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1417395/1417395_10333941_1527135404318_NSFFigJHS_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1417395/1417395_10333941_1527135404318_NSFFigJHS_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Possible Meteorite Impact at time-point no. 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1417395/1417395_10333941_1527135404318_NSFFigJHS_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Possible Meteorite Impact at time-point no. 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Glaciochemical properties and Os concentration and 187Os/188Os ratio in GRIP ice-core through the Younger Dryas Transition.</div> <div class="imageCredit">J-H Seo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mukul&nbsp;Sharma</div> <div class="imageTitle">Possible Meteorite Impact at time-point no. 1</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
