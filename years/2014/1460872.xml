<AbstractNarration>This project funded by the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation (NSF) creates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of South Dakota (USD), led by Professor Andrew G. Sykes. The REU Site program is specifically designed to serve the research needs of students at regional tribal colleges, local primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), and USD.  Eight students will be hosted at USD each summer for three years.  This REU site includes four major project elements: 1) onsite hosting of undergraduate students from regional tribal colleges, PUIs and USD conducting intensive research for ten weeks during the summer; 2) a two week computational chemistry workshop involving all participants; 3) communication of research results during and following the research experience; and 4) select social activities characteristic of the region. The research opportunities offered at USD fall under the theme of materials chemistry that involves non-covalent interactions to control structure and function. Non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, van de Waals forces, halogen bonds, coordinate-covalent bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, to name a few) are linked to a variety of material applications that are associated with all the research projects conducted by participating chemistry faculty at USD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing, understanding and controlling weak intermolecular forces is critical to modern chemical and materials research. In addition, students will learn about the use of single-crystal and powder XRD; NMR spectroscopy; fluorescence and optical techniques; SEM and TEM imaging; and other chemical characterization methods during their research experience. Computational chemistry is also of growing importance, where almost every communication in the literature offers some computational component. Students will benefit from an immersive learning experience in computational methods as linked to their individual research projects. The broader impact of this REU program includes increased access to the chemical sciences for students attending Tribal colleges and PUI institutions in the area.  The University of South Dakota (USD) is ideally situated geographically to serve both Native American and small PUI student populations in the region.</AbstractNarration>

The research takes place at the University of South Dakota (USD), Department of Chemistry for ten weeks beginning after Memorial Day.  The program ran for three years from 2015 to 2017, supporting approximately eight students per summer plus three additional students in 2018 with a one year no cost extension, for a total of 28 students.   The first day of the program was devoted to safety in the laboratory, including the proper handling of hazardous substances and prudent practices for disposal of waste materials.  Each summer also began with a series of analytical research workshops to help train students in the instruments they would be using during their research experiences.   All workshops generally lasted two days and included training for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and computational chemistry. Students were paired with an appropriate faculty mentors based on their preferences and experience, then engaged in approximately nine weeks of intensive one-on-one laboratory work.  Specific research projects ranged from studies of the basic principles of chemical reactivity to the development of advanced materials for applications such as trace analysis of heavy metals, solar energy conversion, and organic semiconductor devices.  All students were required to present the results of their research. A summer undergraduate seminar series allowed students to give short (~20 minute) oral presentations, followed by time to address questions from the audience. At the end of the summer, students presented posters of their work at the annual Undergraduate Research Symposium held in the capitol, Pierre, South Dakota. Due to its small size, South Dakota holds a statewide undergraduate research symposium for all REU programs within the state that attracts a critical mass of students and is a judged event with awards made to students for the best poster and presentation.  Approximately 160-180 students attend this event every year.  Of the 28 students supported by this award: twelve have yet to finish college, seven have entered graduate programs in chemistry, four have unknown whereabouts, two have entered into jobs/industry, one is in medical school, one graduated and is continuing to apply for medical school, and one entered into an MBA program.  Six of the 28 REU participants were undergraduates from USD, thirteen were from regional PUI colleges, and nine were from outside the immediate region.  Nine participants were female and nineteen participants were male.  Six REU students have made 14 presentations at regional and/or national meetings so far.  USD has maintained a commitment to improving science education at regional tribal colleges through research workshops conducted on tribal campuses, training in the use of newly acquired scientific equipment on tribal campuses, and analytical support for research projects of tribal faculty and their students.  This REU site expanded on this effort by offering research experiences to Native American students from Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC). A total of three students from NICC participated over the four years of the program.  REU at USD has offered undergraduate participants a unique opportunity to apply their chemistry background to new research applications, increase their confidence concerning their career path, and learn additional technical skills in a wide variety of areas in chemistry.  From an exit survey conducted at the end of the program, students have expressed increased interest in chemistry and slightly increased their inclination to pursue graduate school in the chemical sciences after graduation from college.
