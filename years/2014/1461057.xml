<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Washington State University Vancouver (WSUV), located in Vancouver, WA, will support the training of 8 students for 9 weeks during each summer from 2015-2017, within the School of the Environment.  The scientific themes are landscape ecology and ecosystem dynamics, contrasting terrestrial and aquatic systems within the Columbia River Basin (CRB).  The CRB extends across Washington state and serves as a 'living laboratory' within which to explore how biotic and abiotic factors shape ecosystem form and function. Each summer experience is designed to engage undergraduates in high-quality research and improve skills in scientific inquiry and communication, promote collaboration and the responsible conduct of research, and provide meaningful professional development and social opportunities.  The WSUV REU site is targeted specifically toward talented undergraduates who are 'place bound' within the Vancouver, WA/Portland, OR metropolitan area, and attend one of the region's 4-year and 2-year colleges.  This REU site also considers applicants from across the US, and works with every accepted student to secure summer housing.  Students who have completed at least one year of undergraduate study may apply online through the WSUV REU website noted below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.  More specifically, this REU project promotes participation of highly qualified undergraduate students who are typically excluded from immersive summer research experiences due only to their inability to leave home for extended periods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) is used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://vancouver.wsu.edu/reu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Gretchen Rollwagen-Bollens, rollboll@vancouver.wsu.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Our Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project, entitled Landscape Ecology and Ecosystem Dynamics of the Columbia River Basin: Integrating Terrestrial and Aquatic Perspectives, was active from 2015 ? 2018 on the Vancouver, WA, campus of Washington State University (WSU).  Geographically, the Columbia River Basin (CRB) is the wide and varied expanse of land in the Pacific Northwest that encompasses the watershed of the Columbia River - one of the largest river systems in North America.  The CRB extends across 7 US states and two provinces in Canada, and narrows on its west side into a more narrow basin surrounding the Columbia River as it carves its way across the state of Washington, from the rolling hills of the Palouse covered with winter wheat and alfalfa in the east, through the Cascade Mountains and the iconic Columbia Gorge, toward the US west coast and into a large estuary, where it releases enormous amounts of freshwater into the coastal ocean.  From a cultural, social, economic and political perspective the CRB encompasses an equally rich and varied history of confluence - the intersection of tribal cultures with European settlers and rapid technological changes expanding the economic base from primarily agricultural to thriving industries driven by the cheap energy and irrigation potential of the river itself.        In our REU project, we built upon the unique position of Washington State University, with campuses located on either side of the state, and faculty in the WSU School of the Environment whose internationally-recognized research is focused on the natural history, ecosystems and landscape dynamics of the CRB.  We based our REU project on the Vancouver, WA, campus of WSU, located in southwest Washington state and directly on the lower Columbia River, that served as the base for numerous field research experiences for undergraduates in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats in the CRB.  The Ecosystem Ecology and Landscape Dynamics REU project at WSU Vancouver engaged primarily non-traditional (e.g. community college, veteran, older, first generation) and under-represented minority (URM) undergraduates from the Vancouver, WA-Portland, OR region in scientific research that increased our understanding of how abiotic vs. biotic drivers differentially impact the dynamics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the CRB. The REU students contributed to the research programs of WSU faculty focused on the biology, ecology, geochemistry, and ecohydrology of this interconnected biophysical region. Our REU site also focused on the interdisciplinary connections among researchers working within the CRB, and allowed REU students to experience first-hand the complexities and rewards of working collaboratively to define and contribute solutions to environmental challenges in the CRB.        We explicitly targeted our recruitment toward students who resided in or attended college in the Vancouver-Portland region, and sought an immersive summer experience but wanted to (or were required to for family or other employment responsibilities) remain in the region. We also welcomed and included applicants who attended college outside the region.  Over the course of 4 summers (2015-2018) we supported 26 undergraduates with a faculty-mentored research experience.  Our student population was &gt;50% non-traditional (i.e., veteran, &gt;25 years of age, place-bound, or first generation) and included higher proportions of URM students than found in the regional population from which we recruited. Moreover, 19% of our REU students were from community colleges and had never before participated in independent scientific research.  Moreover, our REU students conducted independent research leading to authorship or co-authorship on 2 publications in peer-reviewed international scientific journals, and were official authors or co-authors on 7 presentations at international, national and regional conferences to date.         Because many of our REU students attended college near WSU Vancouver, our REU students and their mentors established research partnerships that in many cases extended well past each 9-week summer session. This allowed for a high level of REU research productivity, as well as a strong sense of ownership and commitment on the part of the REU students and their mentors to their projects. Our faculty mentors also reported increased enthusiasm for working with diverse undergraduates in their laboratories, and our annual mentoring workshops have generated vigorous discussion and sharing of ideas for improving the REU experience for all participants.        Finally, we are excited about the very real possibility of our REU project to lead to societal benefits in our region, since so many of our REU alumni have remained here, or intend to return, and will contribute to pursuing fundamental, basic science as well as addressing applied, natural resource issues (water, agriculture, fisheries, wildlife, climate change) that are currently pressing public policy and management challenges.
