<AbstractNarration>There is an established need in the United States to increase the number of American scientists in the workforce.  This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project will award scholarships to help increase the number of students who complete associates degrees in engineering at Cabrillo College, transfer to 4-year institutions, and seek careers in STEM.  As many as 84 scholars will participate in a three-year program, designed to immerse them in academic enrichment activities including participation in a learning community and a course meant to help them to develop strong professional identities through doing hands-on projects, interacting with local engineers, and touring local industry.  The institution's STEM Center, will provide students with an abundance of resources including academic, career and financial aid advising, transfer assistance, mentorships, field trips, scholarship assistance, and study groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address three challenges that Cabrillo College students face while attempting to obtain a STEM degree (a) long time to transfer (four or more years), (b) lack of math preparation and subsequent inability to succeed in precalculus, and (c) the high cost of living in the area.  The scholars will participate in the Math, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program facilitated through the STEM Center.  MESA will provide students with intensive precalulus preparation and peer-lead Academic Excellence workshops in math, engineering, computer science, and physics for those students who pass precalculus.  Formative evaluation will address student and mentor satisfaction (surveys), the viability of the students' educational plan, and academic progress.  Summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of how well the project components align with successful attainment of the retention and graduation targets.  Dissemination of the results of evaluation will be done through the annual MESA Leadership Retreat and the Research and Planning Group Strengthening Student Success conference (for California community college faculty and administrators) and help contribute to expanding the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which programs of this type are successful.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The SPECS projects goals were to provide financial support, academic success strategies, and professional identity enrichment activities to increase the success of the SPECS scholars and decrease their time-to-transfer. The evaluation compared the 2014-15 to 2017-18 project years data to the baseline year (Academic Year 2011-12):   Number of new students interested in engineering;   [Measurable Outcome: 5% over the baseline year]     Number of students declared as engineering majors and taking engineering pathway courses;    [Measurable Outcome: 5% over the baseline year]    Number of full-time engineering students;    [Measurable Outcome: 5% over the baseline year]    Number of engineering students transferring to a university; and    [Measurable Outcome: 5% over the baseline year]    Number of years spent at Cabrillo prior to transferring to a four-year university.    [Measurable Outcome: 5% over the baseline year]    The results are as follows: I: New Students Interested in Engineering The number of new students interested in engineering is measured by the number of students enrolled in the ENGR 5 Engineering as a Profession course which is the course that increases the students awareness of engineering careers through a hands-on approach.  Table 1 and Figure 1 present the number of students enrolled in ENGR 5 from the 2011-12 baseline year through 2018-19 of this SPECS project.  The number of new students interested in engineering has increased over 70% from the 2011-12 baseline year.   This far exceeds the proposed measurable outcome of 5%. [Reference to Table 1 and Figure 1 as attached image.] II: Number of Engineering Majors Taking Pathway Courses The number of engineering majors taking pathway courses is measured by the number of engineering majors enrolled in Precalculus (Math 2+3 or 4), Calculus (Math 5ABC), Linear Algebra (Math 6), and Differential Equations (Math 7).  This far exceeds the proposed measurable outcome of 5%.  Table 2 and Figure 2 present the number of engineering majors enrolled in pathway courses from the 2011-12 baseline year through 2018-19 of this SPECS project.  The number of engineering majors enrolled in pathway courses has increased to over 116% from the 2011-12 baseline year.  [Reference to Table 2 and Figure 2 as attached image.] III: Number of Full-Time Engineering Students The number of full-time engineering students is measured by those students who declared engineering as their major and are taking 12+ units per semester.  Table 3 and Figure 3 present the number of engineering majors which has increased to over 108% from the 2011-12 baseline year.  This far exceeds the proposed measurable outcome of 5%. [Reference to Table 3 and Figure 3 as attached image.] IV: Number of Engineering Students Transferring to a University The number of engineering students who transferred to a university is measured by the number of engineering majors who completed 12+ units at Cabrillo College and whose transfer records were reported by the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC).  Table 4 and Figure 4 present the number of transferring engineering students which has increased to over 31-91% from the 2011-12 baseline year.  This far exceeds the proposed measurable outcome of 5%. Please note that tracking transfer data is very difficult to accurately assess because students can opt out of disclosing their transfer information.  Therefore, the transfer data is more likely higher than the 31-91% reported. [Reference to Table 4 and Figure 4 as attached image.] V:  Number of Years Spent at Cabrillo Prior to Transferring to a Four-Year University Rather than measuring the number of years engineering majors spend at Cabrillo College prior to transferring, we measured the percentage of engineering majors who transferred within three years.  Three years was selected because the SPECS proposal presented the course plan of full-time engineering students showing that students can complete the program in three year of beginning the Engineering Program which is defined as their first attempt taking Math 5A Calculus 1.

Therefore, the percentage of SPECS scholars who transfer within three years is 83.7%, which far exceeds the 24-35% for all engineering majors.
