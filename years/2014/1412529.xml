<AbstractNarration>Guasoni&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1412529&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project seeks to identify portfolio management strategies that are optimal for endowment and retirement planning.  Endowed institutions and retirees have a shared preference to avoid spending cuts at the expense of foregoing spending increases -- shortfall aversion.  A central aspect of retirement planning is the role of health spending in extending life spans, which is still poorly understood and largely ignored in standard models.  Graduate students will be trained as part of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Shortfall aversion introduces a novel aspect of preferences, distinct from usual risk aversion, and leads to different implications for investment and spending policies.  Retirement planning problems lead to a rich class of new models, in which agents can reduce their mortality through investment in health at the expense of current consumption.  Such models have the potential to explain the low annuitization observed in reality, and bear on several questions for retirement planning, such as the relation between wealth and longevity and the dynamics of medical expenses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research supported by this grant has focused on two main issues arising in endowment and retirement planning: Aversion to declines in spending levels is a common concern for both retirees and endowments managers, separate from usual risk aversion, and implies time-varying optimal policies even with constant investment opportunities. An important aspect of retirement planning is the ability of individuals to reduce their mortality through investment in health at the expense of current consumption, thereby increasing their life span.  The project has: (i) developed new models of consumption and investment which account for the aversion to shortfall in spending levels that is documented for both endowment beneficiaries and retirees; (ii) designed a class of models of endogenous mortality, in which current consumption is traded off against healthcare spending that reduces mortality; and (iii) devised new quantitative techniques to obtain general qualitative properties of their solutions to these problems, and solved them either explicitly or through asymptotic expansions whenever possible.  The broader impacts of this research include: (i) Curriculum development for existing and new courses, which will absorb current research; (ii) Cross-training of graduate students in both Financial Economics and Mathematics; and (iii) Vertical Integration in research and education, allowing graduate students to collaborate with the PI in Ph.D. projects related to this research.
