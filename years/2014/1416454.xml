<AbstractNarration>The rapidly developing field of quantum information science (QIS) exploits the unique properties of quantum systems to process, store, and transmit data in ways that are not tenable with classical information systems.  For many applications of QIS, a "quantum memory" that can store and recall quantum states on demand is an urgently needed enabling component. This project pursues a new approach by introducing controlled chemical disorder into high-quality crystals to inhibit the "decoherence" processes that corrupt stored quantum information and limit the performance of existing memories.   This international collaboration funded by the Division of Chemistry through the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B program and the French ANR, combines teams with expertise in diverse areas ranging from solid-state chemistry and quantum physics to non-linear optics and information theory to solve this outstanding problem.  Advancing the capabilities of quantum memory technology is of strategic importance given the broad need in our society to transmit information in a way that is and remains absolutely secure.  In addition, the materials developed in this project have applications in many other photonic technologies including classical optical signal processing, ultra-stable optical clocks, and solid-state lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration addresses a critical need for new photonic materials with low quantum decoherence by introducing specific types of chemical disorder in crystals. Of all the optically addressed quantum memories being investigated, rare-earth ions in crystals at cryogenic temperatures stand out as one of the most promising light-matter interfaces that can store and recall the quantum states of light with high fidelity, efficiency, and bandwidth. This project investigates how incorporation of substitutional chemical dopants, introduction of defects such as oxygen vacancies, and weak local perturbations of chemical bonds due to compositionally induced lattice strain can disrupt the ion-ion, spin-ion, and photon-ion interaction mechanisms responsible for decoherence dynamics that limit the performance of quantum memories. This new material chemistry solution for developing low-decoherence materials coordinates fundamental studies of material properties and chemistry, design and synthesis of materials, and practical tests of performance in quantum memory demonstrations to develop a telecommunications-compatible system for efficient teleportation of quantum states between light and matter in quantum communication and computing systems.</AbstractNarration>

Practical applications of QIS, including quantum computers, secure long-distance communications, quantum networks for computers, and non-classical metrology (measurements) and sensing, urgently need a quantum memory that can store and retrieve quantum states of matter and light on demand.  In particular, quantum memories enable long distance distribution of the quantum keys that are of strategic importance for transmitting confidential information in a way that remains secure far into the future.  Of all the optically addressed quantum memories being investigated, rare-earth ions in transparent crystals at cryogenic temperatures stand out as one of the most promising that can store and recall the quantum states of light with high fidelity, efficiency, and signal bandwidth (capacity).  Furthermore, these advanced photonic materials can also process and manipulate quantum states of light, including conversion of signals between leading superconducting quantum computers and devices based on trapped atoms into telecommunications-wavelength photons that are readily transportable over existing optical fiber networks.  Consequently, continued research and development of these quantum materials is essential for transformational advances in connectivity of quantum systems, creating significant techno-economic impact in research, public, and commercial sectors of the nation.  The central goal of this project was to introduce controlled chemical disorder (manipulation of crystal compositions and crystal lattice structure) to engineer new rare-earth doped quantum materials and inhibit fundamental mechanisms that corrupt stored quantum states (decoherence) and limit the time these states can be stored.  This work pursued better understanding of how the solid-state chemistry of impurities and defects in crystalline and amorphous materials leads to corruption of quantum states and how those effects can be controlled in rare-earth-activated materials and solid-state quantum systems broadly. This new solution for developing low-decoherence materials coordinated studies of properties and chemistry, material design and synthesis, and tests in quantum demonstrations to develop telecommunications-compatible efficient teleportation of quantum states between light and matter.  This ambitious goal was pursued by a collaboration of international teams at Montana State University, Laboratoire de Chimie de la Mati?re Condens?e de Paris and Laboratoire Aim? Cotton (France), and Caltech (USA), each contributing in diverse areas of  chemistry and quantum device physics, for coordinated synthesis, characterization, and modeling of new erbium-activated materials tailored to provide efficient, high-fidelity quantum memories at telecom wavelengths.  Significant advances were made in understanding effects of composition, processing, and fabrication on optical and quantum decoherence properties of single crystals, organic glasses, transparent ceramics, and nanocrystals.  It was shown that thermal and chemical processing could dramatically influence quantum properties, leading to up to 1000X improvements in aspects key to applications.  Approaches for manipulating atomic vibrations were developed and demonstrated, minimizing temperature-induced decoherence.  Of even greater significance, introducing controlled amounts of nano-scale strain inhibits interactions between ions, improving their quantum properties.  A new protocol to convert quantum states between the microwave signals of superconducting quantum computers and the optical signals of telecommunications networks was developed using optically excited states of the ions to reduce undesirable interactions between ions and spins.  Advances in high-quality, rare-earth-activated materials pursued in this project also have direct applications in other optical/photonic technologies including classical optical computing, ultra-wide-bandwidth spectrum analysis of microwave signals, and ultra-stable Laser Local Oscillators for atomic clocks.  Specifically, the materials development carried out on this project provided new insights into crystal imperfections, material fabrication processes, and the light-matter interaction itself; these impacts arise from the extreme sensitivity of quantum measurements to the nano-scale perfection of materials.  This research accelerates development and commercialization of both targeted applications and entirely new ones.  Materials from this project are already being investigated by industry for electronic signal analysis applications with high time-bandwidth performance, and some of the materials developed on this effort have already been transferred to industrial partners for use in next-generation photonic signal processing products.
