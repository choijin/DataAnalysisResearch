<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating concrete material science research to fill the need for advanced next-generation construction materials.  These next generation materials will enhance the sustainability of infrastructure, buildings, and bridges when subjected to environmental loadings.   The project will result in a large-scale cast-in-place mixing procedure and high energy input mixers, as well as design recommendations and analytical models for the design and analysis of structural members of ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC). The UHP-FRC is important because the major problem of concrete is the considerable deterioration and consequent repair work needed due to its brittleness and limited durability. The consequence of concrete deterioration and short service life requires frequent repair and eventual replacement, which consumes more natural resources. Using UHP-FRC will introduce significant enhancement in the sustainability of concrete structures due to its damage-tolerance characteristics. These characteristics can reduce significantly the amount of repair-rehabilitation-maintenance work and give infrastructure longer service life, all of which will eventually lower the environmental liability of concrete use and lead to enhanced sustainability, safety, performance, and economy of our future infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;UHP-FRC has the following unique features: high compressive strength, up to 25 to 30 ksi, excellent compressive and tensile ductility beyond first cracking, and high flowability. The new mixing procedure requires no special treatments such as heat, pressure, and vacuum, thereby avoiding any major changes to current concrete production practice. This makes the conversion seamless and cost effective. In addition, the use of UHP-FRC is expected to provide greater durability, high damage tolerance, life-cycle cost savings, simplified construction, and structural efficiency when compared to the leading competing high-performance concrete that is either proprietary or requires a unique mixing procedure.   &lt;br/&gt;  The project engages a small business partner, Bailey Tools Manufacturing (BTM), to develop the large-capacity high-shear mixers and high-performance fibers, as well as the Texas Manufacturing Assistance Center (TMAC), to guide commercialization aspects, in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.&lt;br/&gt;  This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) to develop a large-scale cast-in-place mixing design procedure and high energy input mixers; 2) to formulate design recommendations and analytical models for the design and analysis of UHP-FRC structural members. Experimental results will be used to formulate the major design aspects for UHP-FRC structural members. Once representative relationships are developed, systematic parametric evaluations will be carried out with particular attention paid to the flexural and shear design recommendations of UHP-FRC structural members.&lt;br/&gt;  The potential economic impact is expected to be transformational, creating a more durable product with cost savings that will be clearly evident in the next 10 years. Implementation of the new equipment and technology will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the next-generation construction market and will reduce state funded concrete installation and repair costs by at least 25%.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: We developed a highly flowable ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC) by using currently available materials in the U.S. market. The compressive strength was about 30 ksi (six times higher than conventional concrete) with a post-cracking tensile strain up to 0.6% without strength degradation. The one-day strength was approximately 12 ksi, which is more than twice that of the ultimate long-term strength of conventional concrete. UHP-FRC has very high durability due to its dense microstructure. Micro high-strength steel fibers were incorporated in the concrete mix to enhance its ductility and toughness. The excellent flowability of UHP-FRC was achieved by introducing a pozzolanic material (fly ash) which has a spherical shape. Its shape allows all the particles to roll over thereby increasing the flowability during the mixing state.
