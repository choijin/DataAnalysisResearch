<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Explanation of the Project's Broader Significance &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suspended sediment and associated contaminants and nutrients are leading causes of environmental degradation in rivers, but predicting the movement of fine-grained material through watersheds remains difficult. Most watershed management planning treats fine-grained suspended sediment as "washload" that is rapidly transported to receiving waters once particles enter stream channels. However, sediment particles actually move downstream by a series of discrete jumps, with each jump punctuated by a period of resting in floodplains and other alluvial deposits.  According for this view, particle travel times from upland sources to estuarine sinks may be very long (up to 1000 years for the Chesapeake Bay watershed, for example).    The disparity  between these two views is most critical where Best Management Practices are used to reduce the contribution of sediment and other contaminants  from upland watershed sources to downstream receiving waters, such as the Chesapeake Bay.   Sediment travel times are not currently incorporated into existing watershed modeling schemes used to evaluate and design Best Management Practices, so the time required for them to achieve their maximum effectiveness is unknown.  During this project, particle waiting times will be determined for a sub-basin of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and these results will be incorporated into a new modeling framework for predicting the movement of particles through watersheds that explicitly incorporates measured particle waiting times.   These results will help evaluate restoration schemes designed to reduce loading of sediment and other particles from watersheds to ecologically damaged receiving waters.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description of the Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geomorphologists widely acknowledge that suspended sediment routing through large (100-1000 km spatial scales) watersheds must account for the 100-10,000 year timescales associated with alluvial storage, but this knowledge is rarely reflected in watershed models. A few recent modeling schemes include both sediment transport and storage, but the necessary reach averaging introduces a new variable, the sediment-storage (waiting) time distribution that is virtually undocumented.  This study will use pollen analyis, optically-stimulated luminescence, radiocarbon dating, and fallout radionuclide concentrations to measure contemporary waiting time distributions for all significant alluvial storage reservoirs in a mid-Atlantic Piedmont watershed where rates of erosion, deposition, and transport are well-constrained. The measured waiting time distributions will be used with a suspended-sediment routing model in a series of scenarios designed to illustrate timescales required for suspended sediment to move from upland sources to basin outlet in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The results will improve existing theory concerning sediment waiting time distributions and sediment budgets within fluvial systems. The results will also help interpret the complex histories of watershed disturbance amd provide a means for a more accurate prediction of future changes. This study is designed to test the following hypotheses: 1) sediment storage or waiting time distributions can be quantified using measured erosion rates, geomorphic mapping, radiometric dating, and reservoir theory; 2) sediment waiting times for mid-Atlantic upland watersheds range from months to millennia, with characteristic values on the order of 1000 years, implying very long timescales to transport most suspended particles from upland sources to basin outlets; 3) observed waiting time distributions are not exponential, suggesting that valley storage reservoirs are not well-mixed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this collaborative award our team at the University of Minnesota has worked collaborative with the teams at the University of Delaware and United States Geological Survey to evaluate the time it takes suspended sediment to exit a typical mid-Atlantic watershed in the piedmont region.  We have used a combination of mathematical modeling and field-sampling in the Difficult Run watershed located in Northern Virginia as well as utilized companion data from a collection of other studies in similar regional landscapes, such as those in White Clay Creek in southeastern Pennsylvania and the South River in Virginia.   Collectively, our model results indicate it can take centuries or longer for sediments to exit relatively large watersheds, owing in large part to relatively long storage in the floodplains adjacent to the river channel.  Field results, particularly those evaluating individual storm events, indicate fine sediments can be stored within the channel, such as in deposits, gravel bars, etc, and become remobilized and transported some distance with each subsequent storm event.  In addition to our overall results, we are contributing to the technical evaluation of chemical tracers of suspended sediments, such as radioactive isotopes used in sediment age dating and source evaluation. We are in the process of communicating these results to scientific audiences through papers and presentations and to the larger watershed and water quality management community through broader meetings and workshops. Throughout the course of this project, undergraduate and graduate students have been involved in all aspects of the research.  Data and results from this project has already been incorporated into college undergraduate and graduate hydrology courses at the University of Minnesota. Although the University of Minnesota portion of the project is wrapping up in 2017, we will continue to work with our collaborators on the companion award at the University of Delaware and United States Geological Survey throughout the course of their award, which is extended one more year.
