<AbstractNarration>The nascent Science of Security (SoS) seeks to develop the principles with which to understand how computing systems are architected, built, used, and maintained with a view to understanding and addressing security challenges systematically across their life cycle.  The Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security (HotSoS), held April 2014 in Raleigh, North Carolina, will help further research in the field.  HotSoS is a follow-on to the NSF/NSA-sponsored Science of Security Community meeting held in conjunction with the 2012 SaTC Principal Investigators Meeting.  As this is the first year of HotSoS as a separate event, it is difficult to predict attendance, but the organizers are anticipating 150-200 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the travel grant program is to encourage participation in HotSoS by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Availability of student travel grants is publicized through the website and announcements, with particular encouragement for women and underrepresented groups to apply.  Preference for awards is given to full-time students with limited other means to support their participation, with priority given to students who are presenting papers at HotSoS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project's goal was to support travel by US student researchers to the Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security (HotSoS), which was held in April 2014 in Raleigh, North Carolina. This project covered travel expenses for 10 students to attend HotSoS. Supported students were able to attend tutorials on the  science of security, network with other researchers in the field, attend  paper and poster presentations, and present papers and posters where  appropriate.  The Science of Security is an important emerging theme of research in computer science that seeks to develop the principles of cybersecurity that would enable the development of robust techniques to improve the security of online interactions. The key motivation behind developing such a science is to address in a rigorous manner the fundamental problems of security. Security has been intensively studied, but a lot of previous research emphasizes the engineering of specific solutions without first developing the scientific understanding of the problem domain. This domain is complex because it incorporates concerns of computing and communications as well as organizations and people.  The main contributions of this project were to help improve participation by student researchers in this nascent area, thereby  helping train the next generation of researchers and thus helping advance the prospects for scientific research into cybersecurity.
