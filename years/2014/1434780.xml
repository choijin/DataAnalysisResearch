<AbstractNarration>Swift currents can create robust, circular structures approximately 100 kilometers in diameter, known as "rings."  The ocean is filled with these rings, which propagate according to their own dynamics. Observations and modeling studies have revealed several formation sites and pathways known for the prevalence of ocean rings. One of these sites is the northeast coast of Brazil. Each year, eight or nine rings form and propagate along the Brazilian coast. These rings trap warm water in their cores as well as nutrients and organisms, and are thus important to all aspects of oceanography. North Brazilian Rings, in particular, are thought to be important for climate variability by contributing half of the northward warm water transport of the global ocean circulation in the Atlantic Ocean.  As these ocean rings circulate, they interact with the bottom topography but the ring-topographical interaction is still not well understood. Idealized studies have demonstrated that rings can accelerate or slow down when entering in contact with the topography. However it is unclear if these theories apply in realistic cases such as the North Brazilian Rings. This study will address this question in a combined theoretical and numerical study of the region. This research will clarify the ring-topographic interactions for realistic topographies and lead to a better understanding of the ocean dynamics in coastal areas. Each summer, a high school science teacher will be involved in the conduct of the research. The project team will visit the teacher's classes during the regular school year to give presentations on oceanography and update the class on the work done during the summer by their instructor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North Brazil Current (NBC) rings are observed to accelerate suddenly upon departing the South American coast at 12Â°N (often doubling their propagation speed). This phenomenon has never been explained, but given that these rings are responsible for roughly 50% of the Meridional Overturning Circulation inter-hemispheric exchange, one needs to understand their pathways and evolution. The ring-topographic interaction will be examined in a combined modeling and analytical study. This study will proceed systematically from simple process-oriented work to regionally embedded, fine scale primitive equation modeling of the western tropical Atlantic. New ideas about the nature of mean flow-topography interaction will be explored and studied by solving a reduced equation set along with complementary process ocean circulation models. This combination should allow the project team to assess the validity of the theory and to test its limits of applicability. In addition, the mechanics of cyclonic vorticity generation, which is potentially a powerful effect on the separation of NBC rings from the coast, will be examined. Finally, a series of aggressive embedded, downscaling modeling experiments will be performed to provide detailed numerical statements of the regional dynamics. The possibility that the mean flow topographic interaction can be explicitly calculated, rather than having to rely on poorly known parameterizations and boundary conditions, could be a significant breakthrough.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many important flows in the ocean occur very near to boundaries.  One well-known example is the Gulf Stream, which flows along the east coast of the United States.  A less broadly known example is the North Brazil Current, however this is an important flow in the ocean as it helps to connect the South Atlantic to the North Atlantic, which is an interocean connection of importance to global climate.  This current flows along the coast of Brazil, and then exits the coast, but continues along the Carribean archipelago.  All along the way, it experiences important interactions with coasts and islands and general forms of topography.  The focus of this grant was to examine these interactions in detail with a view towards how such interactions might be efficiently modeled in global climate models.    We have found that such interactions can be described by a simplified set of equations which, due to their simplicity, are much less computationally demanding than the general equations.  These equations have been studied in general experimental settings, involving rather complete topographic structures.  We have also developed techniques for including these equations in more complete models of the general circulation. Along the way, we uncovered surprising tendencies for the numerical construction of models to insert vorticity, or 'spin', into fluids, particularly at pronounced points of topographic sharpness.    This previously unrecognized capacity in models is important to the diagnosis of model behavior, and to the assessment of model reliability.    We plan to continue examining the control of topography on interior flow dynamics and the means by which these effects can be efficiently included in models by parameterization, that is, without the need to explicitly resolve the computationally demanding dynamics.
