<AbstractNarration>This 3-year collaborative SHINE project is expected to: (1) advance basic understanding of how charged particles are accelerated in the inner heliosphere; (2) yield new information about the properties of suprathermal (ST) ions in the inner heliosphere; and, (3) provide a sound basis for enabling broader theoretical investigations involving acceleration of ST and energetic ions at a variety of astrophysical sites.  The outcome of the project is expected to significantly improve basic understanding of a fundamental problem in space plasma physics namely, how charged particles are injected and accelerated at shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections in the inner heliosphere.  Since solar energetic particle events increase radiation hazards in the near-Earth's space environment, the results from the project will also impact several NSF initiatives supporting the National Space Weather Program.  The scientific outcome of this project will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals, scientific meetings such as the AGU and SHINE workshops with active student participation, and space physics graduate-level curriculum at the UTSA.  The project will also train one  postdoctoral researcher and one half-time graduate student at the SwRI/UTSA.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this SHINE project is to determine the relationships between the properties of locally accelerated ST ions observed in near-Earth's orbit and those of the concurrent in-situ interplanetary (IP) structures and provide observational constraints for the two main types of models.  The project team will achieve this objective by answering the following three science questions: (1) what are the properties of potential IP sources of ST ions near 1 AU?; (2) what are the properties of locally accelerated ST ions associated with these IP structures?; and (3) what are the relationships between the properties of ST ions and those of the IP structures?  In order to answer these questions, the project team will perform four tasks.  The first task is to identify and eliminate the ST contributions from remote, discrete high-energy particle events.  The second task is to identify and determine the properties of quiet-times and of IP structures such as compressions, rarefactions, CIRs, ICMEs, and IP shocks using ACE, Wind, and STEREO.  The third task is to identify and determine the properties of ST ions associated with the above IP structures.  The fourth task is to quantify the relationships and establish definitive links between properties of ST ions and IP structures and provide observational constraints for existing ST ion acceleration models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Award 1460118: Outcomes Report   Project description and objectives   Suprathermal (ST) particles are charged ions and electrons that are found throughout interplanetary space, and move at speeds two to hundreds of times faster than the thermal plasma of the solar wind. ST particle population is of high importance for space weather. It is widely thought that shocks associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) draw their material from this ?seed? ST population. The picked-up material is then accelerated to very high energies contributing to the so-called solar energetic particle events (SEPs), which are key drivers of space weather and pose significant risks for space exploration.       The origin and properties of the ST population continue to be topics of debate within the scientific community. Currently, there are two prevailing theories that describe their origin and acceleration, i.e., where do these particles come from, and how do they energize? One theory suggests that they originate from solar wind or similar low-energy particles in space and become energized by localized compressions; while the other suggests that they are partially remnants of previous events such as solar flares, CMEs, and corotating interaction regions (CIRs), etc. Understanding the ST population is thus critical to advance our knowledge of space weather causality and effects.   The goal of this project is to understand the physical properties of the ST population, by answering the following three science questions:  1. What are the properties of potential IP sources of ST ions near 1 AU?  2. What are the properties oflocally accelerated ST ions associated with these IP structures?  3. What are the relationships between the properties of ST ions and those of the IP structures?  Over the project period of performance (2015-2018, and 1 year no-cost extension), we have performed numerous studies that directly addressed and brought closure to the proposed questions. In particular, we published seventeen scientific publications and presented our results at numerous national and international scientific meetings.   Outcomes:  Among other, our key results relevant to the project objectives include:  Providing ground-truth evidence that the composition of the interplanetary medium at suprathermal energies and during interplanetary quiet times is reflective of the solar activity levels, exhibiting remnants from solar activity during solar maxima and solar minima (Dayeh et al. 2016, 2017). Providing evidence that CME properties play a role in the size of associated Energetic Storm Particle events, which are associated with the CME-driven shocks, thought to accelerate the ST material ahead as they sweep in space (Dayeh et al. 2018).   Intellectual Merit:   Our results have contributed to the basic understanding of ST particle properties and how they are accelerated in space. Furthermore, results provided a sound basis for enabling broader theoretical investigations involving acceleration of ST and energetic ions at a variety of astrophysical sites.  Broader Impacts:   Results from this project confirmed that the ST population in the interplanetary space is highly dynamic and include an admixture of ions accelerated via different physical processes. In addition, results show that the ST population properties' are important in driving and determining the properties of shock-accelerated ions in large solar energetic particle events (SEPs), which are key elements of Space Weather.
