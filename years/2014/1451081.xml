<AbstractNarration>Johns Hopkins University is awarded a grant for research leading to an improved understanding of how the brain is connected. Drosophila larvae, with 10000 neurons (and about 1000 neuron types), offer an opportunity to determine how an entire nervous system generates behavior.  The research combines information from three sources: a neuron activity map of the entire Drosphila larval  nervous system; a library of neuronal lines yielding a neuron behavior map; and a "wiring diagram" or connectome for the entire larval nervous system. Together, the neuron-behavior map, the neuron-activity map, and the connectome complement one another, laying the groundwork for a brain-wide understanding of the principles by which brains generate behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goals for this project will be to develop principled statistical pattern recognition &amp; machine learning methods for clustering neurons based on three different data sets, both individually and jointly. The extent to which clusters obtained from the three datasets agree, and the manner in which they disagree, will reveal how the structure of neural circuits relates to their function and how brains generate behavior. Current methods for discovery and characterization of neural circuitry from behavior, connectivity patterns and activity patterns - fusion and inference from multiple disparate data sources- are insufficient; the approach developed in this project will yield improved methods developed in conjunction with neuroscientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed theory and methods for discovery and characterization from multi-modal connectomes. This project also dealt with inference from connectome data; and was concerned with initial development of statistical inference theory and methods. Intellectual Merit of this project includes development of principled methodology for multi-modal connectome inference and compelling demonstrations on real data. Broader impacts of this project include material for graduate pattern recognition course at JHU; training of PhD students; and new theory and methods for general multi-modal inference.  Publications: This project produced one conference paper, one paper accepted for journal publication, two papers under revision for journal publication, two papers submitted and under review for journal publication, and two papers in preparation for journal submission.  Data: This project used (and impacted the collection of) data from HHMI Janelia Research Campus.  Ongoing: In recent PNAS opinion piece (Geman and Geman, 2016), Donald &amp; Stuart Geman describe the 'usual explanation' for a perceived lack of 'fundamental innovation' in areas such as brain science: that such systems are somehow 'inherently too complex,' 'unsimplifiable,' 'not amenable to abstraction.'  The quest for a connectome code that reveals the principles and mechanisms of the connectivity of neural circuits seems to be in keeping with their position that this 'usual explanation' may be shortsighted.
