<AbstractNarration>PI:  He, Bin    &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1458986&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Minnesota-Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Workshop: IEEE EMBS BRAIN Grand Challenges Conference, November 13-14, 2014, Washington, DC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE EMBS BRAIN Grand Challenges Conference will be organized during November 13, 2014 - November 14, 2014 in Washington DC. The goal of the Conference is to provide a platform for open discussion and debate joined by the international scientific community with regard to the road maps of addressing BRAIN grand challenges as discussed and identified by NSF and NIH workshops and advisory groups. Such public discussions are critical for the scientific community to engage so the visions on BRAIN grand challenges can be smoothly translated into research innovations in years to come. Of particular emphasis will be the engineering challenges for advanced brain research through advancing innovative neurotechnologies (BRAIN).  This reflects the vision that technological innovations are key to major advances in BRAIN research. The broader impacts of the Conference will include recruiting and recognizing outstanding young investigators to/in BRAIN research, and facilitating their participation in addressing the BRAIN grand challenges in a highly integrative platform together with world leaders in BRAIN research and education.  This award is being made jointly by two Programs.  (1) Biomedical Engineering, in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Division (Engineering Directorate); and (2) Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) (Engineering Directorate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conference will have plenary lectures and panel discussions in mapping neural circuits: micro and macro; understanding functional neural dynamics; controlling neural circuits and restoring function; and funding and translation in the BRAIN initiative. Keynote and plenary speakers will include thought leaders from academia, government and industry. An interactive poster session will also be organized, in which the scientific community will present their ideas and engage in discussions. To attract and recognize outstanding young investigators to the BRAIN initiative, a young investigator BRAIN awards competition will be held for students, postdoctoral fellows and assistant professors (or equivalent). These awards will be selected by a panel of international experts in BRAIN research. It is anticipated that the Conference will contribute to public debate and discussion on how to address the grand challenges in BRAIN initiative.  It will lead to a better understanding of several issues including, but not limited to: how can we image the brain activity and function with high spatial and temporal resolution by developing novel noninvasive imaging technologies; how can we image neural circuits with greater spatio-temporal resolution; how can we manipulate neural circuits and brain networks so as to enhance our understanding of the brain function and treat brain disorders; what are the engineering innovations needed to address the grand challenges, such as innovative sensors, imaging technologies, informatics and computational techniques; and what are the challenges to involve more engineers to work together with neuroscientists to address BRAIN grand challenges.</AbstractNarration>
