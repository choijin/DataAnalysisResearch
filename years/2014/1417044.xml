<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be a significant transformation-changing reactive orthopedic surgery into  proactive, preventive and cost-effective surgery. The project will have a direct positive impact  on the quality of orthopedic surgery practice while reducing significant social costs. According  to 2013 national survey, 25% of the patients who underwent orthopedic surgery reported  dissatisfaction with their orthopedic surgical outcomes. Even worse, patients suffered great  pain if the orthopedic implants experienced catastrophic failures and extensive costs have been  spent on the recall of the defective implants and complex revision surgeries. The lack of a data- driven, decision-making tool available to surgeons during and after orthopedic surgery is  created by the current inability to continuously monitor ?physical health? of orthopedic  implants. Creation of this missing tool will empower surgeons to make reasonable judgment as  to when trauma fixation devices can be optimally removed or when revision surgery can be  optimally timed. The key impacts of the project will be: 1. Reduction of patients discomfort; 2.  Reduction of orthopedic healthcare costs; 3. Reduction of social costs due to delayed revision  surgery and endured long hospital stays; 4. Improvement of post orthopedic surgery  rehabilitation.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a health monitoring sensing system for orthopedic implants  using a patented self-powered piezo-floating-gate (PFG) sensing technology. This proposal  tackles a long-standing technical challenge in orthopedic surgery to create a proactive and  preventive orthopedic surgery experience. A key question often asked of surgeons after trauma  surgery is an inquiry on the patients bone healing progress - a common question that is nearly  unknowable today. X-rays generally do not give surgeons a full, accurate and continuous  assessment of the extent of healing of bone fractures. A key feature of the PFG sensor is the  use of floating-gate sensing circuits that compute and store cumulative statistics of the strain- rates and stresses while achieving operational power limits not possible with any competing  health and usage sensing technologies. The sensor requires less than one microwatt of power that can be easily harvested from a miniature piezoelectric transducer operating in strain-mode  (not vibration-mode). This will enable batteryless, self-powered PFG sensors to be implanted  inside the body or attached to orthopedic implants. This PFG sensor would empower trauma  surgeons with quantitative information to enable actionable decisions regarding bone-healing  progress, and to plan timely revision surgery if needed.</AbstractNarration>
