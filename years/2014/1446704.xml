<AbstractNarration>This award will support the design and implementation of an integrated research and education program in solar, geospace and atmospheric physics at the CUNY/Queensborough Community College (QCC), a Hispanic and minority serving institution. The year-long research experience has two components: 1) during the academic year, students will be enrolled in course-based research where they will conduct research on real-world problems; and 2) during the summer, students will be placed in research internships at partner institutions. Specific objectives of this project include: 1) to provide QCC students with research opportunities in solar and atmospheric physics as early as their first year; 2) to develop educational materials in solar and atmospheric physics; 3) to increase the number of students, especially underrepresented minorities, that transfer to 4-year STEM programs; and 4) to increase the number of students that obtain Bachelor's degrees in STEM, especially in geosciences related fields. The educational materials will be developed using data from NASA and NOAA, and a modular, interdisciplinary concept approach that will integrate educational materials into the research experience. The project will also use evidence-based best practices (i.e., research experience, mentoring, outreach, recruitment, enrichment and partnership with 4-year colleges and institutions) that have proven successful at increasing the retention, transfer and graduation rates of community college students at Hispanic Serving Institutions. This project will offer benefits to society by providing future researchers with an understanding of space weather impacts on Earth's environment. Through a strong collaboration with CUNY/City College of New York NOAA CREST, University of Colorado's Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research, and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Space Weather Research Center, the project will train and retain underrepresented community college students in geosciences related STEM fields. This project will provide a service to the discipline, which is taught at relatively few colleges, by increasing both its visibility and diversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With this 2-year EAGER project, the PI designed and implemented a high impact practice integrated research and education program in solar, geospace and atmospheric physics at the CUNY/Queensborough Community College (QCC), a Hispanic and minority serving institution. Proposed is a year-long research experience with two components: 1) during the academic year, students will be enrolled in course-based introductory research (CURE) where they will conduct research on real-world problems; and 2) during the summer, students will be placed in research internships at our partner institutions.  Specific objectives included: 1) provide QCC students with research opportunities in solar and atmospheric physics as early as their first year; 2) develop educational materials in solar and atmospheric physics; 3) increase the number of students, especially underrepresented minorities, that transfer to 4-year STEM programs; and 4) increase the number of students that obtain BS degrees in STEM, especially in geosciences related STEM fields. Proposed is a modular, interdisciplinary concept approach that will be used to integrate educational materials into the research experience. The project will also use evidence-based best practices (i.e., Research experience, Mentoring, Outreach, Recruitment, Enrichment and Partnership with 4-year colleges and institutions) that have proven successful at increasing the retention, transfer and graduation rates of community college students at HSIs.    Intellectual Merit  Both faculty and students will be involved in existing solar and atmospheric research projects that are in collaboration with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center research scientists, and faculty from CUNY/NOAA CREST Center and the University of Colorado at Boulder.  Both QCC faculty and students will be engaged in original research and contributing to the general body of knowledge in solar, geospace, and atmospheric physics, under the umbrella discipline of space weather.  In addition to research, educational materials will be developed using "real data" from NASA and NOAA that can enrich QCC physics curriculum for both science and non-science majors. This project has the capacity to enable strong collaborations between these institutions, which will result in leveraging research resources. Through research experiences, academic support and strong mentorship, the project will encourage community college students that are under-represented in STEM areas to transfer to 4-yr STEM program, thereby increasing the number of BS degrees in STEM.  Broader Impacts  This unique collaboration will benefit community college students at QCC that are under-represented in STEM areas.  Students will be involved in cutting edge research; have access to a team of mentors and research scientists; access to NASA and NOAA research centers; opportunity to present their results at national conferences; and as co-authors in peered review publications. Participating students and faculty will also experience the rich scientific and diverse research topics in the geosciences.  Through its strong research component and partnership, the project offers benefits to society by providing the general public and researchers with an understanding of space weather impact on Earth?s space environment, and the connection between Earth and the Sun.  The project aims at advancing community college students that are under-represented in STEM areas through the STEM pathway: transfer to 4-year colleges; BS in STEM; and to graduate study in areas in which fewer students are selecting as careers and where the loss of retired scientists is significant.  Key Project Outcomes:  Created a yearlong space weather integrated research and education program, including a paid 10-week summer internship at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center and 4-Yr colleges. Undergraduate and graduate students and faculty engaged in solar atmospheric research under the umbrella discipline of space weather. Developed web-based educational and research materials in space weather appropriate for all undergraduate students, including non-science majors.  Engaged 2-Yr college faculty and students from diverse populations and backgrounds in interdisciplinary research. Developed courses based on the Course Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) model that engage students in research in the classroom. Successful community college students' transition to 4-Yr STEM programs.  Student-led and faculty-led research and education abstracts presented at both national and international meetings and conferences.  Students trained as NASA Space weather Forecasters. Developed strong partnership between a 2-Yr college, Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) operating at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and 4-Yr colleges to foster collaboration on research projects; sharing of resources and facilities; and opportunities for student summer internships.
