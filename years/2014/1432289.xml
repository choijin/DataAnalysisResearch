<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between Northern Illinois University, The Milwaukee School of Engineering, and Rutgers University intends to improve student learning in sophomore-level engineering dynamics.  Engineering dynamics is a required topic for a large fraction of all engineering majors including mechanical, aerospace, biomechanical, and civil engineering.  The material is challenging and many students struggle to master the important concepts encountered in this course.  The project will utilize a virtual reality simulated environment to present interactive challenges that require application of engineering dynamics principles to solve.  This interactive environment, called Spumone, was developed under previous NSF-sponsored projects. In pilot studies, use of Spumone by students has been shown to improve learning of engineering dynamics concepts. The current project will expand the use of this simulated environment to evaluate the effectiveness in a wider range of students. The primary purpose of the project is to take an educational simulation that was designed and tested in the classrooms of a single educator, and broaden its reach to the classrooms of other educators. In doing so, the investigators will discover which features of the simulation-based learning environment favor broader adoption, and which impose barriers.  Lessons learned will enable even wider adoption of a promising intervention, designed for a critical sophomore-level engineering course that tens of thousands of students take each year. It is expected that lessons learned will be transferable to other efforts to build video-based STEM learning environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using virtual reality and complex simulated environments has been shown to engage teens and young adults in problem-solving tasks that are often long, difficult, and require high level critical thinking skills. The degree of engagement produced by video simulations extends across all races and socioeconomic backgrounds.  Some of these simulations are found to appeal to both males and females. The investigators working on this project have been developing simulated environments for use in teaching core mechanical engineering courses. In their studies, they found that students who learned in the simulated video environment, achieved higher scores on standard concept tests, compared to students who took the courses that did not employ simulations. Furthermore, students who learned with the simulation were more engaged, more motivated, and much more likely to pursue advanced studies in the same subject.  A pivotal step in bringing simulation-based engineering education to a wider audience is that of making the simulation easy to adopt by other educators.  In this project a group of potential adopters will work together to modify their courses to incorporate the simulation.  At the same time the potential adopters will inform the simulation designers how to modify the application to best fit into their courses.  In the process the project investigators will perform an educational test in which they determine if the gains in learning and student engagement achieved by the developer can be replicated by the new adopters. Evaluation of the project will provide information about the effectiveness of video-based STEM learning environments and the extent to which this simulation is easy to adopt by other educators. An implementation evaluation component will assess whether the project is being conducted as originally envisioned. A progress evaluation component will assess progress toward answering the design and research questions, as well as progress toward the goal of successfully implementing Spumone in the alternate settings. Summative evaluation will assess the overall success of the project in rigorously answering the design and research questions as well as assessment of the goal of implementing video-based STEM learning environments on a larger scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At the center of this project is an interactive videogame-like computer simulation called Spumone. The software was designed to help sophomore-level engineering students gain a better understanding of physics concepts and to improve problem solving skills that are necessary to become productive engineers.  In a previous study, the principal investigator found that students learning with Spumone had a significantly higher conceptual understanding of course material compared to a control group of students who learned without the software. Previous studies showed that such students were more emotionally engaged in their learning.  In this project, investigators examined whether the previous results could be replicated by other engineering instructors at two universities. Would there be similar learning gains? Would students show similar engagement? And, how could the software be improved in order to have a significant positive impact on engineering education?  The results of the study, unfortunately, showed that use of the software in the other settings did NOT have a positive impact on learning nor engagement.  The use of the software, however, provided investigators an unusually detailed view of how students solved engineering problems within the videogame-like simulation. Normally when a student hands in a homework assignment, the instructor sees just a final snap-shot of the student's understanding of the problem. In contrast, the Spumone simulation logs show everything the student does in his or her effort to solve the problem. The logs reveal all the false starts, conceptual misunderstandings, mistakes, revelations, and (hopefully) success.  Analysis of the log files provide strong clues into why the new batch of students, as a whole, did not achieve the same level of success as students in the previous study.  In particular, there were fewer students in the current study who tended to be confused initially when solving problems, but were sufficiently motivated to persevere and figure it out.  It is natural to blame the implementation of the educational intervention in the new settings for not providing an environment to sufficiently similar to the original in order to help and motivate students.
