<AbstractNarration>The Enabling Big Computing for Data Intensive Computing (EBCDIC) project upgrades the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) research Internet connectivity to 100 Gb and allow the redesign of the campus network to better support data-intensive computing.  As a first step,  UMBC is upgrading its Internet2 connection to  MidAtlantic Crossroads (MAX) Gigapop so that it can connect to the Internet2 Innovation Platform at the fastest speeds possible. Through the implementation of the science-DMZ, UMBC improves capacity and productivity in its collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the sharing of data for climate change investigation and weather prediction. In addition, the EBCDIC project greatly benefits the ECOSYNTH project, which is designed to support the use of 3D and spectral imagery data from a variety of low-altitude sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once UMBC completes its 100 Gb connection to the Internet2 Innovation Platform, the investigators can focus on the deployment of software-defined-networks (SDN) on campus. Through the use of SDN, UMBC seeks substantially improved connections of big-data projects that require extremely low latency times, including a neuroscience project that involves real-time processing and the monitoring of EEG data between users at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and UMBC. As the UMBC Cybersecurity Center prepares for increased participation in the Global Environment of Network Innovation (GENI) campus deployment of SDN also enables UMBC's recently-acquired ExoGeni infrastructure to advance cybersecurity efforts.</AbstractNarration>

As part of this engineering effort, we also upgraded the Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology (IMET), a multi-institutional research facility operated by UMBC and located in Baltimore City, to increase their external network from 1Gb to 10Gb and bring all the research universities and institutes in Maryland up to a minimum of 10Gb. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>For UMBC, we also used the grant to re-engineer our internal campus network to better support research. This effort was focused on implementing improved intra-campus networking, especially working to link core research facilities on campus together so faculty can easily leverage these core facilities for their research.. These facilities include:</span></p> <ul> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>A large scale 3D photogrammetry scanner, </span><a href="https://photogrammetry.irc.umbc.edu/"><span>https://photogrammetry.irc.umbc.edu/</span></a><span>, for developing 3D maps of objects;</span></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>The Immersive Hybrid Reality Lab for visualization of 2D and 3D data; and</span></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Expansion of our high-performance-computing system.</span></p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>All three of these facilities have been supported by NSF funding. Each of these facilities generate or process large amounts of data and directly benefit from the grant, especially the scienceDMZ for acquiring or sharing data with third parties. Please refer to the UMBC scienceDMZ design to see our design. Of note in our design is that we use two DTN nodes, one that is restricted behind an access-control list and interconnected with our HPC storage environment. The other is a general-purpose DTN that is used by a variety of researchers and facilities to share data.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>One of the major benefits of this project was working with other CC* grant recipients. This collaboration led us to deploy performance monitoring tools, such as perfSonar; implement the scienceDMZ to minimize network disruption due to security devices; and implement new technologies, such as the FIONA data transfer node (DTN) developed by the University of California San Diego to optimize large data file transfers. The figure labelled DTN Transfer Speeds From UMBC to Pacific Platform show the results of regular tests. Results range from a high of 768 megabytes/sec (or 6.144 Gbits/sec) for the University of Illinois to 307 megabytes/sec (2.456 Gbits/sec) to CalIT at the UCSD.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The overarching goal of this award was to advance research. One research group was led by Dr. Larrabee Strow, the leader of the Atmospheric Spectroscopy Lab (ASL) to improve his file transfers necessary for his research. ASL processes data from three Earth observing satellites to calibrate their sensors. We subsequently used perfSonar and other tools to improve network transfers with both the University of Wisconsin and NASA Goddard.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>One graph that is telling is the figure labelled &ldquo;DTN Performance to NASA Behind Campus Firewall and From ScienceDMZ.&rdquo; Our tests showed that even though we had one of the best firewalls on the market, the campus firewall effectively cut the file transfer throughput in half when compared to the scienceDMZ. Using the scienceDMZ we are getting approximately 7.5Gb of throughput and from inside the firewall we get under 4Gb. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We also worked with the Center for Hybrid and Multi-Core Productivity Research (CHMPR), an NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC). UMBC is the lead institution for CHMPR, which is led by UMBC professors Yelena Yesha and Milt Halem. To better enable CHMPR&rsquo;s work, Co-PI Don Engel and CI engineer Mike Petry worked closely with CHMPR to utilize the scienceDMZ so they can pursue their data-intensive projects. In fact, our work with CHMPR was so successful that UMBC has worked with its CHMPR partners to submit a letter of intent to the NSF&rsquo;s solicitation &ldquo;Towards a Leadership-Class Computing Facility.&rdquo; This LCC effort would not be possible without the advances we have made under this grant.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>One of the academic sites of CHMPR is the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Through contact with Dr. Larry Smarr, we were connected with DTN group working on the Pacific Platform Network. As part of that, we worked with the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) and joined the DTN testbed that is part of the Pacific Platform. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Special thanks go to Dr. Larry Smarr and John Graham of UCSD who worked with UMBC on the configuration of the FIONA DTN and provided us with scripts to utilize GridFTP. &nbsp;&nbsp;Working with the Pacific Platform team was a great asset to UMBC and greatly extended our expertise in cyberinfrastructure. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We are grateful to NSF for this grant and the many derivative benefits of this work.</span></p> <div><span><br /></span></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/11/2017<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Suess</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440477/1440477_10331889_1505011708500_PerfSonar_Diagram_performanceofScienceDMZandCampus.--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440477/1440477_10331889_1505011708500_PerfSonar_Diagram_performanceofScienceDMZandCampus.--rgov-800width.jpg" title="DTN Performance to NASA Behind Campus Firewall and From ScienceDMZ"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440477/1440477_10331889_1505011708500_PerfSonar_Diagram_performanceofScienceDMZandCampus.--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="DTN Performance to NASA Behind Campus Firewall and From ScienceDMZ"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This graph shows the DTN transfer speed when running through campus firewall  is approximately half that when using the ScienceDMZ.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mike Petry</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Suess</div> <div class="imageTitle">DTN Performance to NASA Behind Campus Firewall and From ScienceDMZ</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440477/1440477_10331889_1505011909023_UMBCScienceDMZDesign--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440477/1440477_10331889_1505011909023_UMBCScienceDMZDesign--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UMBC ScienceDMZ Design"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440477/1440477_10331889_1505011909023_UMBCScienceDMZDesign--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UMBC ScienceDMZ Design"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This diagram describes how we set up our scienceDMZ to support both our high-performance computing users and other research faculty.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mike Petry</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Suess</div> <div class="imageTitle">UMBC ScienceDMZ Design</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440477/1440477_10331889_1505013105457_DTN_Transfer_Speeds_UMBC-to-PacificPlatform--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440477/1440477_10331889_1505013105457_DTN_Transfer_Speeds_UMBC-to-PacificPlatform--rgov-800width.jpg" title="DTN Transfer Speeds From UMBC to the Pacific Platform"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440477/1440477_10331889_1505013105457_DTN_Transfer_Speeds_UMBC-to-PacificPlatform--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="DTN Transfer Speeds From UMBC to the Pacific Platform"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This diagram shows the speed in megabits per second from UMBC to schools participating in the Pacific Platform.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mike Petry</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Suess</div> <div class="imageTitle">DTN Transfer Speeds From UMBC to the Pacific Platform</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
