<AbstractNarration>The most important crops in the U.S. for food and biofuel are all closely related, members of a plant group known as Andropogoneae.  Corn (maize), the crop with the highest dollar value, is related to sorghum and sugarcane, the potential biofuel Miscanthus and about 1000 other wild species.  Because the entire genomes of corn and sorghum have been sequenced, we can translate information from these crops to wild species and conversely, we can study wild species to help develop better crops.  This project will use DNA sequences to determine how members of the group are related to each other, and then will use that information to assess how their genomes have evolved.  Genome doubling is very common in this group, and may have allowed the species to colonize new habitats and to develop new growth forms.  This work will illuminate untapped genetic resources that crop breeders desperately need to feed the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from this project can be used for crop improvement, for identifying new sources of biofuels, and for understanding the response of American and African grasslands to climate change.   Training of undergraduate and graduate students in grass taxonomy, analysis of DNA data, and plant genome evolution is another part of this project.  Education components of the project include involvement of undergraduate lab assistants, participation in the summer program for high school students at UMSL, and involvement in the Botanical Society's PlantingScience program.  In addition, we will develop a graduate computational course built around the analytical components of this project, so that beginning graduate students can contribute directly to the analysis of sequence data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The tallgrass prairie of North America once covered the central part of the continent, from north of the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast.  The head-high grasses that gave the prairie its name include big bluestem, little bluestem (FIgure 1), Indian grass, and gama grass, all of which have close relatives in the great African grasslands.  The tallgrass prairie ecosystem now persists only in a few protected areas; one large example is the Konza Prairie in Kansas (Figure 2). Today, the area in the U.S. that was once prairie is largely converted to agriculture, dominated by corn (maize), which is a close relative of the tall native grasses and which originated in Central America.  Other relatives include sorghum (originally from Africa) and sugar cane (from Southeast Asia).  This group of related wild and cultivated species is known by the Latin name Andropogoneae.     This project discovered that most of the species in Andropogoneae are ancient hybrids, created by spontaneous crosses between other species.  Following hybridization, the genomes of the plants doubled, so that each hybrid plant now has twice as many genes as its parental species had.  An unexpected result was how often this happened.  At least 1/3 of the species in this group are hybrids with doubled genomes.  After hybridization and genome doubling, the resultant species often then diversified to form additional species.  One remarkable example is corn and gamagrass.  These are very closely related and are the descendants of an old (&gt;8 million years) hybridization event.  Curiously, the hybridization event appears to have occurred in Africa.  The ancestor of corn and gamagrass must then have dispersed westward across the Atlantic.      The project involved collecting a substantial amount of DNA sequence data from both the nucleus of the cell and from the chloroplast (in which photosynthesis takes place).  Because of the size of the project, it was necessary to develop new computational tools to help process the data.  These were developed and published and are now being used by increasing numbers of plant biologists, particularly those who use the chloroplast genome to study evolutionary history.  Thus one major contribution of this project is development of tools that are useful for a large community of scientists.       The computational work was led by a post-doc supported on the grant, and involved three computer scientists all of whom learned a great deal of biology in the process.  All are now working full time in the field of informatics.  In addition to the post-doc and computer scientists, the project supported an additional post-doc (now an assistant professor), four graduate students (two now in post-doctoral positions and two assistant professors), two technicians (one now in a Ph.D. program), six undergraduate students, and one high school student.  Of the 15 people involved, three are women, three are Asian, and two from Latin America.          Last Modified: 10/27/2016       Submitted by: Elizabeth A Kellogg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
