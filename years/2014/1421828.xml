<AbstractNarration>Distributed information storage architectures that are resilient against drive failures and organized in a manner that allow themselves to heal efficiently are a key component of the emerging area of big data systems.  Moreover, the transition by companies and individuals to storing data in the cloud are enabling gigantic economies of scale, and distributed storage architectures are one of the most important components of such a large scale computing services system.  The architectures modern distributed storage systems are using are still, from the standpoint of the coding utilized, archaic.  More efficient distributed storage architectures would deliver better, more responsive, services to customers including faster access, better reliability, and more responsive processing, and at a lower aggregate long term cost.  To reap these long term benefits, new science has to be developed to understand and determine the fundamental limits for these systems.  These fundamental limits can be expressed in terms of the capacity regions of networks under network coding, which are themselves as of yet only implicitly characterized in all but the most symmetrized and simplified forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the capacity regions of networks and distributed storage systems, and the classes of codes that achieve them.  Automated methods of computing these rate regions for small networks will be developed that harness the detection of problem symmetries, specialized polyhedral computation, and the enumeration of classes of matroids associated with optimal codes.  Larger networks and storage systems will also be studied via the introduction of network embedding operations that preserve the sufficiency of classes of codes to achieve the entire capacity region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Network coding rate regions lie at the heart of fundamental design tradeoffs in a number of engineered systems ranging from communications networks to learning systems and distributed information storage systems.  Academics and practioners still primarly determine and prove these rate regions, the codes that achieve them, and the resulting tradeoffs, through human intuition and by hand calculation.  Under this project, algorithms and software, the first of their kind, were created that enable a computer to rapidly determine prove rate regions for network coding problems that are far more complicated than can be solved by hand.  A new theory for network coding rate regions emerged, built on a celebrated theory of graphs, which enabled the combination of solutions of smaller network coding problems to obtain those for larger problems, as well as the ability to predict properties of larger problems from smaller ones contained within them.  The research results of the project have been disseminated through dissertations available to the public, as well as through publications in journals and conferences.  The software developed and the data collected have been shared with the public on the PIs research group website and on github.  The project supported, in part, the Ph.D. studies of multiple students, many of whom upon graduation joined the workforce as data scientists.
