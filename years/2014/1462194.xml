<AbstractNarration>This funding enables the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's (UCAR) Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) to provide logistic support, partial travel support for US graduate students, transportation, as well as onsite support to the Tenth International Conference on Mesoscale Convective System (ICMCS-X)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to enable the US graduate students to be prepared to address future scientific demands on high impact weather through the interactions with leading researchers in the US and East Asia countries. In addition, students will be exposed to new emerging technologies to sample and analyze these extreme weather events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;High impact weather such as tropical cyclone and flooding events is one of the top research and operational priorities in the US in this rapidly changing climate environment. ICMCS-X will stimulate the intellectual curiosity of junior scientists and create a valuable international network to support their careers. This project will add to the resources to encouraging participation of US graduate students and benefit the educational community.</AbstractNarration>
