<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between the Southwestern Research Station (SWRS)  and the Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC) at the Desert Research Institute (DRI) will build five high-quality, long-term climate monitoring stations positioned along an elevational gradient on the eastern and western slopes of the Chiricahua Mountains. The data collected by these climate stations will be important both locally to scientists conducting research at the SWRS, and globally to scientists all over the world to observe both predicted changes in the distribution and abundance of plants and animals, as well as, the associated gradients in climate data. Climate change is predicted to be associated with changes in the distribution and abundance of plants and animals. Various climate models predict the most dramatic effects of climate change to be apparent along the slopes of the "Sky Islands" of southeast Arizona. However, climate monitoring stations are almost entirely lacking in this otherwise well-studied mountain range. Because of the wide diversity of habitats and organisms easily accessible in the areas surrounding the Southwestern Research Station (SWRS), the distributions and abundances of plants and animals of this area have been well studied for over five decades.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SWRS is located in the Chiricahua Mountains, part of a unique complex of about 27 mountain ranges, the Madrean Archipelago/Sky Islands of the southwestern U.S. Much of the data collected by SWRS scientists already has had direct influence on the conservation and management of the Madrean Sky Island habitats and species. The high biodiversity of plants and animals of this diverse area insures that scientists will continue to be attracted to the SWRS for future and ongoing studies of the area?s biota. Installation of five climate stations, spanning the eastern and western slopes of the Chiricahua Mountains and an encompassing an elevational gradient from 1280 to 2743 m, will allow scientists to compare their ecological observations to this shared climate data and expand their questions to include new areas of  ecology-climate interactions at different spatial scales. Access to local climate data by visiting scientists, students, and teachers will enhance virtually all research and educational activities at the SWRS.  Partnership with the WRCC and its host institution DRI will expand the use of collected climate measurements to the academic, governmental, management, and private sectors. Physical geographers and atmospheric scientists building climate models will benefit from the data obtained along the elevational gradient of this sky island mountain.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project entitled, <strong><em>Collaborative Research:&nbsp; A Climate Station Network for the Chiricahua Sky Island Ecoregion</em></strong><em> </em>(<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/show~$27Award?AWD_ID=1418727">https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/show~$27Award?AWD_ID=1418727</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1418726%20">https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1418726</a>) , the Southwestern Research Station (SWRS) partnered with the Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC) at the Desert Research Institute (Nevada System of Higher Education) to establish a long-term climate monitoring network consisting of five research-grade monitoring stations in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona. The Sky Islands ecoregion is recognized as one of most biologically diverse areas of the world where several major biological regions converge. Various climate models predict significant changes in climate along the slopes of the &ldquo;Sky Islands&rdquo; of southeastern Arizona which are expected to impact the distributions of flora and fauna in the range. Data collected from the network will serve a vital role to students, educators, and scientists conducting research at the SWRS as well as having a direct influence on conservation and management of the habitat and species of the Chiricahua Mountains.</p> <p>In the Spring of 2018, the Chiricahua Sky Island Climate Monitoring Network was completed and is currently fully operational. The network spans across an elevational gradient from east to west across the Chiricahua Mountains with stations situated at elevations ranging from approximately 4000 feet in the San Simon Valley to just over 9000 feet along the crest of the range. All stations in the network are powered by solar panels and equipped with either satellite or radio telemetry systems which provide near real-time access to the station data. Each station in the network collects a core set of climatic parameters including: air temperature at multiple heights, relative humidity, barometric pressure, incoming solar radiation, wind speed and direction, soil moisture and temperature at three different depths, and precipitation. Several stations in the network are equipped with all-weather precipitation gauges which allow for high-precision, accurate measurements of both liquid and frozen precipitation. Preliminary data from the network is already proving to be very valuable in capturing the high degree of spatial and temporal variability in precipitation in association with the North American Monsoon which has a significant influence on the climate as well as the flora and fauna of the Chiricahua Mountains. The network would not have been possible without the cooperation of the Chiricahua Desert Museum, National Park Service (Chiricahua National Monument), and U.S. Forest Service (Coronado National Forest).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2018<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;B&nbsp;Simeral</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent"
