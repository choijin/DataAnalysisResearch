<AbstractNarration>EAGER: Defining a Dynamical Behavioral Model to Support a Just in Time Adaptive Intervention &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER supports exploratory work to develop a novel approach to the creation of a dynamical computational model of human health behavior. The goal of this high risk project is to apply an experimental design that merges methods from multiple disciplines to generate the necessary data to develop a dynamical systems model of human health behavior. In theory, mobile technologies have this capacity to provide health interventions in real-time that are adapted to the individual, but in practice the specific theoretical models and decision rules required to determine exactly when, where, and how to intervene do not exist. Standard health approaches use theoretical frameworks to identify and select target behaviors and approaches or intervention. By creating dynamical models of human behavior, real-time adaptive interventions can be developed and empirically assessed building the foundational science of computational behavior. While this project is concerned with creating dynamic computational models for increasing exercise behavior, the approach may find applications more broadly with a wide range of human health issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this EAGER project is to create a mathematical model that will provide the evdience for making decisions about when, where, and how a "just in time" adaptive mHealth physical activity intervention should be implemented. Creating this dynamical behavioral model is a challenging problem that requires insights from different disciplines because behavioral science provides insights regarding what to measure, and behavioral intervention strategies that could be used dynamically; however, current behavioral theories fail to provide any real insights on when, where, and how to intervene at the opportune moment. Control systems engineering provides a methodology for creating dynamic mathematical models and decision-making, but this methodology has only sparsely been applied in a human behavioral context. A key first step for developing a dynamical behavioral model is to gather "informative" empirical data to estimate the model. These data will be generated with an informative system identification "informative" experiment within a human context that builds on lessons from behavioral science about experimental designs and that takes full advantage of the temporally rich data available from mHealth technologies. We will use these data to develop a fundamental yet empirically- supported dynamical behavioral model for understanding our target behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BACKGROUND: The targeted intellectual merit of this work was to establish both the conceptual and empirical foundation for the use of control systems engineering methods in mobile and ubiqutious behavioral interventions.  This is justified based on the complex and dynamic nature of human behavior and, therefore, the need for behavioral interventions that can take into account individual differences, changing circumstances, and even changing responsivity to an intervention (e.g., a person no longer paying attention to, or using an intervention that previously helped them). Control systems engineering, which is pervasive (e.g., pacemakers, thermostats, air traffic control, robotics, and cellular networks) but often goes unnoticed as a "hidden technology," is a discipline focused on supporting dynamic decision-making in complex and dynamic environments.  As such, there is real potential for the translation of control systems engineering methods to a behavioral context as the methods are well aligned with the complexity of behavior. Further, the advent of mobile and ubiquitous computing, coupled with robust cloud computing that can support advanced analytics on a server that can then be translated back to a phone, provides the requisite technological infrastructure to justify this approach.  To the best of the authors' knowlwedge, the work of this NSF EAGER was the most advanced and comprehensive translation of control systems engineering practices to the domain of behavioral mHealth interventions.   METHODS: Within this NSF EAGER we: 1) translated experimental strategies used in control systems engineering (i.e., system identification) into ones appropriate for behavioral interventions, 2) piloted tested our experiment among a sample of 22 individuals via a mobile health (mHealth) physical activity intervention, 3) conducted dynamical systems modeling and other analyses to examine the results of the work; and 4) simulated the utility of a model-predictive controller, which is the technology that can use the dynamical models created via system identification to make dynamic decisions on the fly, to to examine the feasibility of this approach for a behavioral intervention.   RESULTS: As of completion of the project, we have 6 published publications from this work with several publications under review or in prepration.  Results of our work illustrate that we have: 1) translated prior behavioral knowledge into a dynamical model that can be used to support evidence-based and individualized decision-making on selection of an intervention for a given person for increasing physical activity; 2) articulated a dynamic hypothesis about the targeting of an "ambitious but doable" daily step goal to target as a dynamical decision in a behavioral context that would benefit from control systems practices; 3) translated a system identification experiment into one appropriate for humans; 4) developed an mHealth system to conduct system identification studies; 5) piloted our methods with positive results, which justify the use of control systems engineerinog practices in a behavioral/mHealth context; and 6) staged a controller for behavior, with indicators of robustness even when simulating the decsion-making process within otherwise poor contexts (e.g., noisy environments with models with only limited predictive utility).  DISCUSSION: The intellectual contribution of this work is clear specification of concrete strategies for translating control systems engineering practices into behavioral science, particularly for mobile health interventions.  Our work establishes the conceptual, methodological, and empirical justification to warrant further use of control systems engineering practices in mHealth research. This foundational research can feasibly lay the ground work for far more advanced behavioral interventions for supporting behavior change across a wide range of behavioral targets including physical activity, healthful eating, smoking cessation, sleep, and substance abuse. Based on this, the broader impact is potentially enormous.        Last Modified: 10/30/2016       Submitted by: Eric Hekler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
