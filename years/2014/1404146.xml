<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to search for a new fundamental property of the electron, one of the main constituents of matter and a charged component of all atoms. This new property, called an electric dipole moment, can be described as a slight bulge on an otherwise perfect sphere of charge. This seemingly abstruse property may hold the key to one of the most fundamental mysteries of nature: why is everything in the universe made of matter rather than of antimatter?  In accelerator laboratories, whenever energy is converted into particles (according to E=mc2), equal numbers of matter particles and antimatter particles are created. For example, the electron has a counterpart antimatter particle, the anti-electron, which has identical mass but opposite electric charge.  Energy can be converted into an electron/anti-electron pair, and conversely an electron and anti-electron can annihilate each other and turn into energy. Just after the Big Bang, energy was converted into particles and anti-particles. Astronomical observations show that since then, essentially all the antimatter annihilated with matter--but a tiny bit of matter was left over.  That small excess makes up all of the objects seen in the Universe today. The current framework that describes all known fundamental forces between elementary particles, known as the "Standard Model", cannot explain how this excess of matter survived. However, many mathematical theories have been devised that can explain this "matter-antimatter asymmetry", by positing new forces and particles not yet discovered in any experiment. These same new forces and particles also often lead, according to the same theories, to an electric dipole moment that is large enough to observe in the experiment supported here.  Hence, this project is essentially seeking an answer to the question: how is it that matter was slightly preferred over anti-matter at some time in the past, resulting in the physical Universe seen today? In a general sense, this project also advances the range of techniques for precision measurement science, which in the past has led to unexpected breakthroughs in technology such as GPS (the Global Positioning System), new types of sensors, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The electric dipole moment (EDM), if it exists, must lie along the spin axis of the electron. In the presence of a nonzero EDM, an electric field will induce a torque on the electron, resulting in precession of the spin about the field. This spin precession angle is the experimental signal. The huge internal electric field of a polar molecule, ThO, is used to amplify this observable effect. The internal structure of ThO also suppresses possible systematic errors. A cryogenic molecular beam source that delivers an unprecedented high flux of molecules is used. Lasers and optical techniques put the ThO molecules in usable coherent superpositions and then probe the quantum interference that signals the electron's spin precession. Over the previous grant period, an initial version of these methods was used to make by far the most sensitive measurement of the electron's EDM. This result was consistent with a zero value for the EDM, but many theories of what lies beyond the Standard Model of particle physics predict that, with improved sensitivity, detection of the EDM is likely. In this project, methods to greatly improve the sensitivity of the experiment will be introduced; these include focusing of the molecular beam and a use of a more efficient process for state preparation, based on adiabatic passage.  Improvements such as the use of low-absorption optical elements will reduce systematic errors observed in the previous experiment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      This project is a search for new particles and forces, beyond those known and described in the Standard Model of particle physics theory.  The standard search method is to attempt to create them by colliding known particles accelerated to high energy with a giant accelerator.  Instead, we attempt to sense their expected existence around ordinary charged particles through extremely precise measurements.  Every known particle carries with it a quantum cloud of "virtual" particles.  In this cloud, every particle that can exist in nature is constantly blinking into and back out of existence, as they are temporarily generated from the energy of the electric field of the particle and then quickly re-absorbed.  This cloud modifies the properties of the ordinary particle when it is viewed from afar, in a way that depends on the properties of all the "virtual" particles in the cloud.       Our experiment, ACME, is designed to detect a tiny deformation in the shape of the cloud of virtual particles around an electron, away from perfectly spherical.  Exactly such a deformation is predicted due to particles that have already been identified by colliders or other means (Standard Model particles), but with a size roughly one billion times smaller than can be detected at present.  By contrast, many new theories of particle physics predict new particles, whose presence in the cloud around an electron will cause a much larger deformation.  Therefore, detecting this deformation, known as an electric dipole moment, is possible only if such new particles exist. The implications of such a discovery would be profound, since particles outside those in the Standard Model have been sought, unsuccessfully, for nearly 40 years.       To detect the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM), ACME measures the behavior of electrons bound inside the polar molecule, thorium monoxide. Here, they experience a huge effective electric field that will produce a torque on the electron if it has an eEDM.  ACME achieves extreme sensitivity to a deformation by using lasers to create and detect quantum superpositions of electron states. The measurement technique is based on protocols similar to those used in atomic clocks and qubits in quantum computers.  The molecules are produced in a cryogenic beam that enables precise measurements with good statistics. The apparatus is small enough to fit in a basement laboratory and staffed by a team of under a dozen scientists, yet is capable of detecting new particles well beyond the reach of any particle accelerator.       The second generation of ACME (ACME II), supported by this grant, met all goals within the 5 year time frame of this grant.  It achieved sensitivity to the eEDM 10 times better than in the first generation of ACME, which had established the prior record sensitivity.  ACME II used the same basic approach as ACME I, but instituted several major technical improvements to increase the statistical power of the measurement.  These included new methods to prepare and detect the required quantum superposition states, using new complex laser systems, new improved photomultipliers, and other new techniques.  ACME II also employed more advanced data analysis methods to account for spurious noise in the eEDM signal.       In the closing months of the grant, we also developed detailed plans for a next generation of the experiment, with which we project another factor of 10 improvement in sensitivity.  This lays the groundwork for a potential near-future discovery of the eEDM, which many theoretical models predict could lead to the first evidence for new particles that lie outside the framework of the Standard Model.       Intellectual Merit: The measurements from ACME II were consistent with an eEDM having a value of zero within our range of uncertainty.  From this, we set an improved upper limit on the size of the eEDM, smaller by a factor of 10 than before.  This significantly constrains many theories that predict new particles with mass in the range from 30 to 10,000 times larger than that of the Higgs boson.  This eEDM measurement is complementary to direct searches for new particles at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, and provides greater sensitivity in some cases. EDM measurements, such as this one, are a very promising way to determine whether any such new particles have the properties needed to explain the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe.           Broader Impacts: The ACME project provided the primary training for 2 postdocs, 13 Ph.D. students, and 9 undergraduates.  In the course of the project, new experimental methods were developed for measuring and manipulating quantum states of molecules. These methods may be useful in other areas of AMO physics.  ACME II also serves as a powerful example of the particle physics discovery potential that can be obtained using quantum-enabled measurements in medium-scale experiments. Finally, the extremely fundamental nature of the scientific goal has its own intrinsic impact.       Last Modified: 12/19/2019       Submitted by: David Demille]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
