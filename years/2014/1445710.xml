<AbstractNarration>The importance of literacy, the ability to read and comprehend a written document is so great in the modern world that the United Nations considers literacy to be a fundamental human right. From legal documents to educational materials to cultural heritage, the importance of understanding the information contained in written texts is fundamental to modern society. The Internet has created new challenges for literacy, where people can easily access a document that they lack the domain specific background to understand. Consequentially, they often surf to other documents, seeking ones they can understand, even if they contain less useful information than the original document. The proposed work assists people in burrowing down into documents they are specifically interested in understanding, instead of having to browse off to other often tangential and potentially less reliable documents, in their quest for comprehensible information. Although this proposed technology was created to assist people in understanding or analyzing chemical documents, it can be of value to understanding documents in any technical or other specialized domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information and Communication Technologies have been changing how our society shares, communicates and manipulates information. The proposed technology "WikiHyperGlossary (WHG)" is an Information and Communication Technology that uses both social (web 2.0) and  semantic (web 3.0) technologies to both increase the readability of digital printed documents, and connect them to new forms of information. The WHG allows the public to follow hyperlinks that are automatically added to words in a document of interest, based on whatever glossary the user chooses.  As a semantic tool demonstrated in the chemical sciences, the WHG allows access to cheminformatic information like spectra and physical properties of compounds mentioned in an article, as well as the ability to edit those molecules and acquire information on the newly created molecules. This team plans to apply this architecture to other domains as well, as it seeks multiple commercialization opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction     The WikiHyperGlossary system fits directly into a broad stream of interest in communicating and comprehending the written word. Thus it is part of an endeavor that goes back centuries with roots in antiquity. Until recently print on paper was unchallenged as the primary mode of communicating and preserving our society?s scientific, cultural and civil records. The early internet essentially mimicked this document-based form of communication, with people navigating to "web-pages" as primarys unit of information. Unlike a printed page, a web page can provide very convenient hypertext links and, more generally, hypermedia links that support multimedia modes of communication (videos, images, software, etc.). However, these still use file based documents as a basic unit. Increasingly, the semantic web offers a new non-file based form of communicating information through software agent mediated knowledge frameworks of information objects, often located in databases. Yet the vast majority of the human scientific and cultural record is represented in printed and, increasingly, digitally disseminated articles. The WHG connects on-line documents such as journal articles to this new and evolving world of databases and other resources containing data and multimedia content. This aims to enhance learning as well as the scientific discovery process by enabling new connections across diverse resources.     To accomplish its objectives, the WikiHyperGlossary (WHG) implements an information literacy technology that automates the markup of words in a document, connecting them to multimedia definitions and database content. If the word is a chemical, the WHG also associates it with an International Chemical Identifier that allows the program to interact with databases and software agents. This I-Corps grant led to the creation of a startup company, "DeepLit" (for Deeper Literacy), with the objective of investigating the commercial feasibility of the WHG.     Intellectual Merit     The intellectual merit behind this project revolves around a novel solution to one of the literacy challenges of the modern internet age, enhancing reading comprehension of documents in one?s distal knowledge space.  In this age of instant access to information, anyone can acquire seemingly incomprehensible expert level documents of knowledge domains that they are novices in.  The current practice is to skim over these expert-level documents and search the web until a "comprehensible" document at the novice?s level of understanding is obtained, with the result that no direct benefit comes from the expert-level document.  The WHG offers an alternative to search engines for enhancing understanding of expert-level documents by linking expert-level documents to novice-level definitions, allowing the novice to acquire the background required to understand the expert-level document dynamically, without ever leaving the document.     The WikiHyperGlossary system and our ideas have been described in a journal article (DOI: 10.1186/s13321-015-0073-7) and a number of other forums, including a presentation at the Future of Text Symposium in 2016 on Google Campus, where the audience and questioners included Vint Cerf, winner of the 1997 National Medal of Technology, the 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the 2004 Turing Award (www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ykvRYsk2o&amp;t=51m58s). The system itself was hosted by the Chemical Education Digital Library, part of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL), until the ChemEdDL underwent an administrative and hosting transition, moving from Amazon to Hope College in late 2016.              Broader Impacts     The broader impact of the WikiHyperGlossary lies in extending the amount of comprehensible information that is accessible to an individual when that individual is making decisions based on that information. It leverages the web, which in-and-of-itself, has created new challenges for literacy, in that people can more easily than ever access a document that they lack the domain specific background to understand. The WikiHyperGlossary assists people in burrowing down into documents instead of having to browse off to other often tangential and potentially less reliable documents.

The project created a foundation from which a related project is being pursued, the Cheminformatics OLCC (on-line chemistry course), where students are learning how to create smart spreadsheets that connect their experimental data to big data on online digital repositories without ever going through a webpage.  This course has now been taught at 12 campuses.          Last Modified: 03/13/2017       Submitted by: Robert Belford]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
