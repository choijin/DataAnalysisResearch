<AbstractNarration>UCF has established a Cyber Infrastructure Engineer (CI Engineer) position to serve as a bridge between UCF's Computer Services &amp; Telecommunications organization and the campus research computing community, as well as a catalyst and link to the broader community of CI Engineers.  This new CI Engineer position leverages the research network that is being constructed at UCF. This position expands UCF's capability to perform basic research by focusing on cyber infrastructure dedicated to meeting current and future research needs.  Responsibilities for this position include the expansion of UCF's research network and Science DMZ in close operation with campus IT staff, extension and execution of UCF's long-term Cyber-Infrastructure plan, and participation in the wider community of growing Cyber-Infrastructure professionals at other institutions, both regionally (through Florida LambdaRail) and nationally (through Internet2).  Additionally, this effort helps meet the accelerating data transfer needs of campus research by facilitating and participating in research relating to the use of software defined networking and performance monitoring of high-performance research networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCF's full-time cyber infrastructure engineer position is expected to expand and improve access for faculty, graduate student researchers, and undergraduates to high performance computing resources, both on and off campus.  Moreover, the University expects this CI Engineer position to help broaden the general understanding of best practices for research-focused cyber infrastructure by participating in the growing community of CI engineers at universities throughout the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this award is to establish a Cyber Infrastructure Engineer (CI Engineer) position at the University of Central Florida (UCF) who will be a bridge between UCF's Computer Services &amp; Telecommunications organization (CS&amp;T) and the campus research computing community, as well as a catalyst and link to the broader community of CI Engineers.  During the project, UCF was able to:  Hire a CI Engineer to help manage the UCF research network and interface directly with researchers regarding research needs; Help craft and document research network policies and proceedures; Expand the research network to a set of research labs at the Institute for Simulation &amp; Technology; Setup a software definited networking (SDN) vlan to support other funded research involving using software defined networks for dynamic network reconfiguration; Replace and reconfigure data transfer nodes (DTNs) within the research network; Standardize the configuration of DTNs for other units on campus.   The most critical objective of this project was to for both UCF CS&amp;T (our IT division) and UCF research staff to each evaluate whether it was productive to have an engineer designed to bridge the gap, particularly when it comes to managing our research network and enabling research that operates within the UCF Science DMZ.  Coupled with this objective was the need to solidify the precise mechanisms of sustainability and growth for such staff in the future.  All parties found the CI Engineer positino and role vital and productive for enabling research at UCF.  The CI Engineer was able to help enable several specific research projects (e.g., the afore mentioned DoD project), and was successful at taking over research network management responsibilities and helping expand research network resources at UCF.  The CIO, director of UCF's Adanced Research Computing Center, and were engaged in determining what the long-term organization and managment of such positions should be at UCF.  All three stakeholders are committeed to maintaining the research network and the CI Engineer position moving forward.
