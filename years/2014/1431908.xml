<AbstractNarration>Developing scientific reasoning skills is a major goal of contemporary education. The nature of jobs in the global, knowledge-based economy calls for a shift of educational goals from content drilling toward fostering higher-end skills in reasoning, creativity, and open problem solving. Unfortunately, the typical introductory science course does not significantly impact students in these areas. Although scientific reasoning has become a widely targeted domain for high-end skills in STEM learning, the knowledge base about the impact of curricula targeting scientific reasoning is still not very deep. This project will address the gap by producing a research-based curriculum specifically designed to develop scientific reasoning skills, as well as solid evidence about how the course activities and their specific strategies affect college students' development of scientific reasoning skills. Outcomes of the project will include (1) a complete lab curriculum for first-semester (introductory) physics, with lab modules designed such that they can be flexibly used in lab settings across institutions, and (2) a knowledge base with assessment outcomes on the effectiveness of different elements of the curriculum in helping students develop scientific reasoning skills, as well as best practices for implementing the curriculum in different settings to optimize learning. Because the scientific reasoning modules will be designed to readily fit into existing lab courses, this work has the potential to impact thousands of STEM majors (1,600 per year at the University of Cincinnati alone). Because scientific reasoning skills cross all areas of STEM, the project's research outcomes will be adaptable across many courses in the STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines the development of promising curricula with a rigorous assessment/evaluation study. The robust assessment plan will be conducted across six pre-selected test sites. A validated assessment tool will be used to measure students' scientific reasoning. The research design, which involves multiple repeated measures with random subgroups of a student population, will produce data that allows for the identification of patterns of class mean performance on scientific reasoning skills over time, as well as an understanding of how changes in scientific reasoning performance are connected with specific instructional events. Statistical analyses involving multiple t-tests will determine whether the evolution patterns and states are statistically significant and consistent with instructional events by comparing performance before and after relevant instruction. Survey data collected from instructors at test sites will provide evidence of successful implementation strategies, as well as challenges, such that the curriculum and related products (i.e., instructor guides) can be designed to optimize learning and promote widespread use of the end products.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Modern education goals have shifted towards fostering higher-end skills, such as non-routine problem solving, systems thinking, or critical thinking; all foundational for the reasoning necessary for building scientific understanding and science literacy. Unfortunately, research has shown that scientific reasoning (SR) skills are lacking in students, including the ability to reason effectively in both science-related and everyday life contexts, to evaluate evidence independent of prior knowledge, and to consider alternative hypotheses. Therefore, the introductory college physics lab curriculum developed under this project was deliberately designed to promote abilities in these areas.</p> <p>The guiding curricular model and methodology was informed by a range of literature for science inquiry, reasoning, and critical thinking. Pre-lab instruction introduces key concepts or skills, while providing deliberate practice in hypothetical situations. Pre-lab quizzes gauge students' understanding while promoting self-reflection. In-class activities are organized around a central research question (e.g., <em>What impacts the period of a pendulum?</em>) that explicitly targets causal and hypothetical reasoning embedded in cycles of inquiry, reflection, evaluation, and communication of outcomes; providing authentic practice in increasingly complex contexts. The learning goals focus on science as a process and checkpoints engage students in Socratic Dialogue with the instructor; both well supported in the literature for developing SR and conceptual understanding. Students design and conduct 7 investigations across 12 weeks, sharing results between lab groups to develop robust mathematical models. Final wrap-up questions guide students to consider claims in light of their original ideas, the claims of other groups, and scientifically accepted theory. Lab report writing is heavily emphasized, and detailed grading rubrics award points for behaviors sought.</p> <p>The project involved a rigorous research plan to evaluate the curriculum for impact on student COV skills, which are foundational for more advanced SR skills. To support these efforts, we constructed and validated a skills progression and assessment questions for COV. Project outcomes indicate that the curriculum significantly improves student COV abilities in our lab course as well as those offered at our branch campus and several dissemination sites. We also determined that students' COV skills follow a progression, and through pre- and post-testing students (n=799) early in the project, were able to show that the curriculum significantly impacts students at the low and intermediate COV levels of reasoning, but additional work is needed to impact students at the higher level (see Figure 1).</p> <p>In addition, we successfully tested a research methodology for determining the impact of the curriculum on skill acquisition at finer time measurements. All students were pre-tested the first week of the course, and then randomly selected for post-testing after an inquiry cycle was completed. In this way, we demonstrated the responsiveness of COV skills to instruction, although most impact was due to the first 4 weeks of the course (one inquiry cycle)(see Fall 2016 in Figure 2), with most improvement in the low to intermediate skill range. Further curriculum revisions, including additional pre-lab exercises and in-class question prompts to guide student thinking, resulted in further improvement in 2017/18, but again most improvement was early in the course for lower and intermediate COV skill levels. This suggests the need to go beyond traditional COV training and blend COV tasks with processes involving data analytics and causal decision-making, which involve higher levels of reasoning for hypothesis evaluation.&nbsp;</p> <p>For other SR subskills, including data analytics and causal decision-making, we have just begun to develop curriculum and assessment questions. As shown in Figure 3, preliminary data indicate minor impact of the current curriculum on the more advanced skills involving causal decision-making, with no change for data analytics. This preliminary research, however, has allowed us to identify common college student difficulties in these areas, something not well reported in the literature. This work provides the necessary foundation for future work.</p> <p>Finally, our curriculum has impacted students' success. Our previous labs were traditional, cookbook-style, and the percent of students earning a D, F, or Withdrawing (DFW rate) was 25-28%. In 2013, our new curriculum, which emphasized group work in an inquiry setting, sharply decreased these rates to 7% for non-URM and 16.5% for URM students (primarily African American/Black)(Figure 4). Recently, we further reduced these rates to 6% and 8%, respectively, due to additional strategies supported by the research literature, including clearer course expectations and the use of rubrics that clearly define how assignments are scored.</p> <p class="clear">The project has benefited over 8000 UC students as well as those at multiple dissemination sites, with the potential to impact thousands of others. We have demonstrated that an existing course can be modified to explicitly target select SR skills, and that content and reasoning can be taught in parallel. The domain general curricular framework, which involves a new approach for teaching SR skills, provides educators and researchers across STEM with innovative ways to promote and evaluate transferable skills.
