<AbstractNarration>Microfluidics is a multidisciplinary technique with applications in several science and engineering disciplines that yields practical design of systems in which small volumes (microliters or less) of fluids can be handled. Typically, gas bubbles or liquid droplets can be moved, mixed, separated or otherwise processed at a micro domain, and in ways that bulk processing simply cannot attain. [Common examples are ink-jet printers, or 'lab-on-chip' analysis systems]. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several applications to the study of the physics and chemistry of individual, or group aerosol particles or droplets to which microfluidic approaches may be well tasked. Microfluidics allows precise control over droplet size and shape. The chemical composition of generated droplets will be chosen in order to replicate ambient atmospheric aerosol particles. When trapped in a hydrodynamic trap, a holding device, these aerosol mimics will be further examined by microscopy with an attached high-speed camera.  Experiments with changing fluid flow rates, and, thus, extensional strain rate on the droplets, along with temperature, will change the environmental conditions experienced by the droplets. Direct educational benefits include the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in a multi-disciplinary research group. The project has the potential to foster increased partnerships between academia and industry because the methods used in this project have general applicability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Small particles are ubiquitous and the atmosphere and are found in small numbers even in pristine environments.  These particles affect climate through direct and indirect radiative effects and can adversely affect human health.  Atmospheric aerosol particles may consist of many components, including multiple liquid phases with many dissolved chemical species.  The exact nature of the complex mixture within a single particle will affect the particle size, shape, and the tendency to attract water.  Current research results are mixed regarding the effect that organic coatings have on these aerosol properties.  The goal of this project is to build a research platform using microfluidics to study problems of relevance for atmospheric aerosol science.  Microfluidics is a mature research platform which has been around for several decades.  Microfluidic devices are small devices which operate on a microscope and allow rapid and repeatable experiments to be performed in a short amount of time with a very small amount of reagent fluid.  This project builds upon the wealth of microfluidic research to adapt technologies for application to atmospheric science.   A major result of this project was to show the utility of microfluidics for aerosol studies.  Because both scientific fields are so large, one risk associated with the proposed work was to find a specific application of the microfluidic platform to a question of interest to the atmospheric science community.  This challenge was immediately addressed by studying the interfacial properties of a model secondary organic aerosol system and comparing to previous studies of this same chemical system.  The results of this work (Metcalf et al., 2016, Environ. Sci. Technol.) prove that the microfluidic platform can be used to assess the interfacial properties of aerosol liquids which is complementary to traditional bulk surface tension measurements that potentially require significantly more liquid sample.  Knowledge of the interfacial properties of aerosol liquid samples allow thermodynamic predictions of aerosol shape in the atmosphere.  This key finding will facilitate future studies where only very small sample volumes of liquid are available.  More specifically, microfluidic experiments on several aerosol chemical systems have shown the relationship between various organic species and the depression of interfacial tension; sometimes called surface activity.  Some chemical species are more surface active than others, meaning that it takes very little organic concentration to cause a large perturbation of interfacial tension.  Other organics have no effect on the interface.  The addition of an inorganic salt to these aerosol systems can complicate interfacial behavior due to competition between dissolved molecules in the model aerosol droplet.  During this project, some preliminary work towards future projects was performed.  While this project was focused on mimics of atmospheric aerosol, an important advancement to this work would be to perform microfluidic experiments on ambient aerosol samples.  Towards this goal, secondary organic aerosol was generated in a laboratory reactor, collected on a filter, and then extracted into methanol and water.  These liquid samples were then used in microfluidic experiments to assess interfacial tension as a function of the aerosol content in the liquid.  The addition of salt to these samples showed a remarkable decrease in interfacial tension, demonstrating the chemical competition within the aerosol and the surface activity of the organic component.  These measurements have provided the groundwork for proposals of future studies which will target ambient aerosol filter sampling.  Because of the typically disparate fields of microfluidics and atmospheric science, considerable outreach to both scientific communities was done for this project.  To the microfluidics community, presentations on the key challenges in atmospheric aerosol research were made at conferences to elicit feedback on the ways microfluidics could be used to address these challenges.  To the atmospheric science community, presentations included an overview of the usefulness of microfluidics to address key challenges for the community and were meant to introduce atmospheric scientists to a new field.  Because microfluidics is such a large field, it was useful to distill the field down to terms most relevant for atmospheric scientists as well as present the findings from the measurements of aerosol mimics.  Bridging both scientific communities has fostered collaborations across these disciplines that otherwise might not have been made.  During this project, many other outreach activities took place.  Mentorship of several undergraduate and graduate students has served to pass along some of these microfluidic projects to the next generation of students.  Outreach to the community to increase public engagement with science and technology was accomplished through tours and demonstrations in our laboratory and through encouragement of high school students at local science fairs.  Service to the scientific community has been through reviewing papers and proposals and serving as a chair and poster judge at several conferences.  Outreach to local industry with our technology has yielded a partnership between our laboratory and a local company to apply our measurements to solve the real-world problem of water-fuel separation.
