<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in experimental techniques have opened the way to unprecedentedly accurate studies of charge and spin dynamics in two-dimensional electronic systems, which are formed at the interface between semiconductors, metals, and metal oxides, and in various layered materials.  The ability of these materials to transport spin, charge and energy in an efficient and controllable manner makes them promising candidates for the development of new technologies, both in the field of information processing and in that of energy conversion. This project combines theoretical research and accompanying educational and outreach activities that address key issues relating to charge, spin, and energy transport in single- and multi-layered electronic systems. Particular systems which will be investigated include materials such a single-atom-thick form of carbon, known as graphene, and other graphene-like two-dimensional materials composed of transition metal atoms and sulfur.  Through careful analytical and computational studies, the PI will examine the interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom in these systems, and predict how external fields (e.g. electric, thermal) can be manipulated to bring out novel phenomena that could lead to technological innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is strategically positioned at the interface between fundamental condensed matter theory, applied physics, and computational materials science, and has potential technological implications in electronics and thermal energy transport. While carrying out this research with the assistance of postdoctoral researchers and external collaborators, the PI will maintain a weekly seminar on "Selected topics in condensed matter theory", in which the graduate students of the Physics Department at the University of Missouri will be introduced to the basic concepts and methods which underlie the execution of the project. The broader significance of the research will be explained to a wider audience through public lectures delivered by the PI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in experimental techniques such as transient grating spectroscopy, magnetopolarimetry, spin noise spectroscopy, and nonlinear optical generation of spin currents open the way to unprecedentedly accurate studies of charge and spin dynamics in two-dimensional electron liquids, which exist at the interfaces between semiconductors, metals, and metal oxides, and in layered materials such as graphene, MoS2, and the surface of topological insulators.

This project combines theoretical research and accompanying educational and outreach activities addressing key issues relating to charge, spin, and energy transport in single- and multi-layered electronic systems. At the core of the projected activity lies a set of basic physics problems which will be addressed in parallel or sequentially during a period of three years. These are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Evaluating the microscopic spin-charge response functions for two-dimensional electron liquids in graphene and graphene-like materials, including electron-electron interactions, disorder, spin-orbit couplings, and magnetic fields in suitable approximations;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Developing the theory of spin diffusion, thermal conductivity, and viscosity in graphene and graphene-like materials, to the point where the calculations exhibit the crossover between the collisionless (high-frequency) and collision-dominated (hydrodynamic) regimes;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Identifying and quantifying novel thermoelectric phenomena for interacting electrons in multi-layer structures;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Developing the theory of spin Hall effect and spin-galvanic effects at metallic and oxide interfaces with strong spin-orbit interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is strategically positioned at the interface between fundamental condensed matter theory, applied physics, and computational materials science, and has potential technological implications in electronics and thermal energy transport.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main outcome of this project has been the theoretical study of several novel effects - all of them experimentally observed - in which electric currents are transformed into spin currents via spin-orbit coupling, thus affecting the electrical resistance of materials, and causing this resistance to depend on the strength and direction of externally imposed electric and magnetic fields (magnetoresistance).   The fundamental importance of magnetoresistance lies in the fact that states of slightly different resistance can be used for the digital storage of information, for example by assigning logical value 1 to a high resistance state and logical value 0 to a low resistance state - thus enabling new types of information storage and processing devices.  Among the new effects we have studied, the following are particularly prominent:   1. A new type of magnetoresistance occurs in metallic bilayers that consist of a heavy metal and a ferromagnetic metal.  The electric resistance of the interface changes even as the magnetic field is rotated in a plane perpendicular to the current (standard magnetoresistance was believed to depend only the component of the magnetic field parallel to the current)  2. In a heavy metal/ferromagnetic metal a unidirectional magneto resistance is observed, which changes sign when either the direction of the current or the direction of the magnetization are reversed.  We have developed a detailed theory of this effect, and we believe that this effect could in principle be used to create much more compact memory devices than presently possible.  3. Again in heavy metal/ferromagnetic metal bilayers, we have developed the theory of the nonlocal anomalous Hall effect.  The "ordinary" local anomalous Hall effect produces a transverse voltage when a current is driven in a magnetic material.  The "nonlocal" effect also produces a transverse current, but without the assistance of a magnetization in the region in which the current flows. This greatly expands the range of conditions under which the anomalous Hall effect, a robust and useful effect in spin electronics, can be used.  3. Recently discovered materials, known as "topological insulators", exhibit the phenomenon of spin-momentum locking, meaning that electrons moving near the surface of these materials have a spin-orientation that is completely determined by their momentum.  We have theoretically shown (and experiments confirm the theory) that the existence of spin-momentum locking is responsible for the appearance of a  "magnetoelectric resistance", which depends linearly on the applied electric and magnetic fields and has a characteristic angular dependence on the direction of the magnetic field.  Indeed this angular dependence can be used, in reverse, to determine the form of the spin-momentum locking - thus bypassing the need for much more complicated experimental techniques.  4. We have showed that a ferromagnetic metal supports a new type of charge density oscillations localized near the surface or near the edge (depending on whether the material is three-dimensional or two-dimensional) of a ferromagnetic material: we call these oscillations ferromagnetic surface/edge plasmons. They are different from the more familiar and long known surface/edge magnetoplasmons,  because they do not rely on the classical Lorentz force exerted by a magnetic field on the charge, but rather on subtle geometric effects that are present in the band structure of strongly spin-orbit coupled materials. We believe that ferromagnetic plasmons will be usable in the future to establish a coupling between charge dynamics and magnetization dynamics.  5. Lastly, we have shown that some two-dimensional materials which are nominally insulators in the bulk can in fact support "squeezed edge currents" in the vicinity of their edges, even when they do not support conducting edge states.  This possibility - confirmed by some experiments - stems from a subtle magnetoelectric effect whereby an applied electric field produces an accumulation of magnetic moments near the edge: the nonuniform magnetization that ensues drives a nearly dissipation-free charge current, which flows along the edges of the material.     In summary, a series of new magneto-transport effects driven by spin-orbit interaction has been introduced and their physics has been elucidated. Because spin currents are used as drivers of magnetization in memory devices, our findings are  important beyond basic physics, particularly  in the field of electric engineering.
