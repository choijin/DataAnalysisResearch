<AbstractNarration>1438644 &lt;br/&gt;Assaf-Anid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is for partial support of a workshop entitled "Clean Water Matters: Challenges and Research Perspectives Workshop," to be held in Beijing, April 18, 2014. These funds will be used to support plane fares and subsistence for the U.S. delegation. The overarching goal of this workshop is to initiate joint research collaborations among scholars in China and the United States to address pressing water challenges affecting both nations, with potential applicability to other regions of the world. Specific objectives are to: 1) build a research platform for collaboration across the US and China that supports active engagement and joint approaches to clean water challenges facing both nations and 2) form a U.S. - China water research and education community and set the grounds for the establishment of a joint research consortium. The proposed collaboration will enhance scientific cooperation between Chinese and US scholars and junior fellows, and provide students from both nations opportunities for international research experience. The event is structured to favor dialogue and collaborations among participants with various perspectives and backgrounds. It will bring together lead water protection and management scholars, seasoned policy professionals, agencies that support sciences and research advances, together with young investigators in their early stages of their careers, and post-doc fellows and graduate students interested in pursuing research in this area. This grant is co-funded by the Global Venture Fund (GVF) of NSF's International Science and Engineering section (ISE) as well as the Environmental Sustainability program in the CBET division of NSF's Engineering Directorate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the "Clean Water Matters" workshop was to initiate joint research collaborations among scholars in China and the United States to address pressing water challenges affecting both nations, with potential applicability to other regions of the world. The event was structured to favor dialogue and exchange among participants with various perspectives and backgrounds. It brought together lead water protection and management scholars, seasoned policy professionals, and representatives from agencies that support science and research advances, together with young investigators in the early stages of their careers, post-doc fellows, and graduate students pursuing research in the workshop topical areas.   The interdisciplinary nature of the workshop resulted in a broad-based research framework drawing from academia, the scientific and academic community, and entities that focus on the advancement of science and technology, including national agencies, foundations, and corporate partners.     The following offers a synthesis of the four sessions held during the workshop :        1) Water quality modeling and approaches for megacities and rural areas     1.a. Models grounded on theory-driven experimentation and multi-scale testing are recommended for long-term monitoring, and intelligent guided remediation (e.g. hydraulic fracturing sites) and better understanding of fundamental processes in sub-surface systems (e.g. dimensionality, conductivity). 1. b. Improved management and monitoring tools and technologies are needed for the effective detection and prevention of water infrastructure failures and/or the prioritization of maintenance and rebuilding projects.   1.c. A promising approach to water purification is the use of "artificially created wetlands," which require less area than natural wetlands, have low maintenance fees (as compared to treatment plants) and can easily address 70% of the water purification process.   1.d. Dynamic water quality simulation models are needed to understand the chemical transport of pollutants through the environment.     2) Water scarcity and hydrologic challenges   2.a. Multi-disciplinary perspectives, place-based  science and observations that represent actual phenomena at the site, as well as research collaborations are recommended to advance the state of the art of watershed science.       2.b. A hydrological model that integrates climate scenarios may be used to estimate the effect of higher temperatures on stream flows.   2.c. Another model has been developed to analyze sub-surface water resources, in particular natural springs. 2. d. An integrated model of the surface water &ndash; groundwater exchange, is being applied at the Heihe river basin, in northwest China.   2.e. Most water scarcity models only consider water   quantity (blue water). Pollution induced water scarcity (gray water) should also be considered, thus the significance of integrating water quality parameters into scarcity models was emphasized. This integrated approach may be used to develop water scarcity indices, which may serve to educate the public about the need for water conservation.   3) Research advances in water management for hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas production    3. a. The water energy nexus is most evident in hydraulic fracturing operations, which often takes place in areas that are water stressed. Potential substitutes for potable water include reuse of flow-back and produced waters as long as treatment facilities are available.   3.b. Practices to drill wells by hydraulic fracturing are similar from a process perspective. 3.c. A life cycle analysis at Sandia National Laboratories compares hydraulic fracturingÆs water demand against different ways of generating electric power. 3.d. Along several regulations to manage water scarcity and imbalances among different provinces in China, new water markets and trading mechanisms have also been set up based on an allocation regime for eac...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
