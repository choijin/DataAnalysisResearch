<AbstractNarration> The involvement of students of any age in different phases of research can be  a  stimulating  experience  for  both the scientist and the student. We propose  to  continue  a  program  where  cutting  edge research is done in partnership  of faculty with students starting from high school through the post doctorate. We believe that this  arrangement can be beneficial for all participants.  The  faculty brings the excitement of original research into the  classroom, providing role models and motivation for the students. Post doctoral  and graduate students, who are heavily involved in the day to day research  activities  also   learn  teaching  and  mentoring skills through working with the undergraduate and high school students. Becoming  involved in  all  phases  of  the  research, undergraduate and high school students, learn  first  hand what is expected if they are to chose careers in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;A  central goal of the National Nanotechnology Initiative has recently been identified  by  an  NSF  report  to  be  the  ability to create "smart" and adaptable materials with atomic level precision and control in economically viable  quantities  that  would  "be of broad benefit to industry, economy, health,  environment,  and society".  The report pointed to "our ability to achieve a better understanding of materials at dissimilar interfaces" as a key  vehicle  to  attaining  this  goal. Polymers, which can be molecularly engineered   on  a  macroscopic  scale,  while  retaining  nanometer  scale precision,  play  a  central  role  in  attaining  this goal. This proposal therefore has  two  research  directions:  Engineering  biomimetic polymer  scaffolds for tissue engineering and fundamental studies of cell mechanical transduction  and  the  desing of self extinguishing polymer nanocomposites that  can  withstand  extreme  conditions.  This proposal therefore has two interrelated goals; (a) Produce   original   and    relevant  research  in  biomaterials  and nanocomposite  polymer engineering ;       (b) Allow for versatile training of   students   from  high  school,  undergraduate,  graduate  through  the post-doctorate  to  develop  necessary  skills  for  achieving professional careers in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Academic accomplishments:  In the last year we published 18 articles in peer reviewed journals, were awarded one  and submitted three patents.We presented invited talks at the "Pioneers in Soft Matter Physics"  conference at KAIST,  Korea,  the Faculty Symposium at Beijing Institute of Technology and the conference  "Stem Cell Differentiation: The influence of Biomaterials and Biomechanics", the MRS Symposium UU, and the BCC conference on Flame Retardant Materials.  We also had contributed presentations together with high school students ,  high school teachers, undergraduate students, as well as graduate students  at the MRS fall meeting, the APS Spring meeting, the ACS summer meeting, and  the NYSTEM regional conference.  Educational accomplishments: Three students received PhD degrees, including one AGEP participant.  Two Suffolk Community College students participating in our Bridge to the Four Year College program completed associates degrees and transferred to Stony Brook School of Engineering,  85 high school students,  4 High School Teachers and 22  undergraduate students participated in our research scholar programs. Thirty One  students were named Siemens semi-finalists, two were regional finalists,  eleven were Intel semi-finalists, three were  Isweep gold medal winners, and four  placed at the top in several categories at ISEF.  Outreach:  720 High school students from 16 schools in the NY metropolitan area attended our annual Science Open House day at CUNY/  Queens College Campus. The  program aimed at encouraging participation in science for disabled students initiated in partnership with Science Buddies and the Motorola Company, hosted a trip for 6-8th grade students.   The students  were selected from the  Louis Armstrong Middle School in New York City,  which is a magnet school for gifted students with physical and developmental disabilities. The students toured the Stony Brook College of Engineering and the School of Dental Medicine where they performed several experiments and practiced dentistry on robotic models.   Research Highlights:   Enhancing the Efficiency of Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells via Templated Self-Assembly     Morphology control in bulk heterojunction  solar cell is considered to be critical for the power conversion efficiency .  We have developed a  a novel approach which using a tertiary polymer blend of  polystyrene,  poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The technique uses principals of polymer phase segregation and self assembly in planar confinement to produce a film with columnar polymer structures that template the locus of the PCBM, forming a continuous pathway between the electrodes. This structure represents a realization of an idealized morphology of an organic solar cell, in which both exiton dissociation and the carrier transport are optimized, leading to increased power conversion efficiency.   Gold nanoparticles cellular toxicity and recovery: Adipose Derived Stromal cells     Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are currently used in numerous medical applications. Herein, we describe their in vitro impact on human adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) using 13 nm and 45 nm citrate-coated AuNPs. In their non-differentiated state, ADSCs were penetrated by the AuNPs and stored in vacuoles. The presence of the AuNPs in ADSCs resulted in increased population doubling times, decreased cell motility and cell-mediated collagen contraction. The degree to which the cells were impacted was a function of particle concentration, where the smaller particles required a sevenfold higher concentration to have the same effect as the larger ones.  Furthermore, AuNPs reduced adipogenesis as measured by lipid droplet accumulation and adiponectin secretion. These effects correlated with transient increases in DLK1 and with relative reductions in fibronectin. Upon removal of exogenous AuNPs, cellular NP levels decreased and normal ADSC functions were restore...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
