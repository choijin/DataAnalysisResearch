<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0602298 F.Thomas Farrell The goal of this project is two pronged. One &lt;br/&gt;direction is the basic problem of classifying homotopically equivalent &lt;br/&gt;manifolds up to homeomorphism. Surgery theory was developed  for this &lt;br/&gt;purpose. But in order to make this theory effective for manifolds with a &lt;br/&gt;given fundamental group, it is necessary to calculate the algebraic L- and &lt;br/&gt;K-groups of its its integral group ring which occur in the surgery exact &lt;br/&gt;sequence. Direct algebraic methods have generally proven&lt;br/&gt;unsuccessful for this. The case of finite fundamental groups being a major &lt;br/&gt;exception. The techniques to be used instead will come from differential &lt;br/&gt;geometry, controlled topology, dynamical systems and Lie group theory. The &lt;br/&gt;results obtained so far using these methods have been quite encouraging. The &lt;br/&gt;second direction of the project is to find applications of these manifold &lt;br/&gt;classification results to geometry. One area that looks promising is to &lt;br/&gt;understand the topology of the space of all negatively curved Riemannian &lt;br/&gt;metrics on a smooth manifold and its quotient moduli space. There is the &lt;br/&gt;related following question. If one smooth structure on a closed manifold &lt;br/&gt;supports a negatively curved Riemannian metric, then does every other smooth &lt;br/&gt;structure support such a metric? And a possible application to affine &lt;br/&gt;geometry is to the problem of whether homeomorphic complete closed affine &lt;br/&gt;flat manifolds are necessarily diffeomorphic.&lt;br/&gt;    Manifolds are geometric objects which locally resemble the space of &lt;br/&gt;Euclidean geometry but are usually quite different globally. For example the &lt;br/&gt;surface of the sphere locally resembles the plane; but is only finite in &lt;br/&gt;extent. Being finite in extent is what is meant by a closed manifold. A &lt;br/&gt;smooth manifold is one without corners or edges. For example the surface of &lt;br/&gt;the sphere is smooth but the surface of a cube, although a manifold, is not &lt;br/&gt;smooth. However these two manifolds are homeomorphic; i.e. it is easy to &lt;br/&gt;construct a continuously varying bijective correspondence between the points &lt;br/&gt;of these two surfaces. When the distance between points on a manifold is also &lt;br/&gt;considered, we are now talking about Riemannian manifolds and distance &lt;br/&gt;preserving correspondences are called isometries. For example the egg and the &lt;br/&gt;ball represent two different positively curved Riemannian metrics on the &lt;br/&gt;surface of the sphere. And these two metrics even represent different points &lt;br/&gt;in the moduli space of such metrics since the ball is uniformly round while &lt;br/&gt;the egg is not. However if only the notion of straight line is being &lt;br/&gt;considered (i.e. geodesic ) we are talking about affine manifolds and affine &lt;br/&gt;equivalences. Distance preserving correspondences take straight lines to &lt;br/&gt;straight lines but not necessarily vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
