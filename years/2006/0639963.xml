    <AbstractNarration>This project involves studies of global and regional seismicity.&lt;br/&gt;Central to the project is a continuation of the Harvard&lt;br/&gt;Centroid-Moment-Tensor (CMT) Project, which now represents a&lt;br/&gt;22-year-long effort to analyze global earthquake activity and to&lt;br/&gt;maintain a comprehensive and authoritative catalog of earthquake&lt;br/&gt;focal mechanisms, the CMT Catalog. In addition to the systematic&lt;br/&gt;analysis and of earthquakes and dissemination of earthquake information,&lt;br/&gt;the research also includes the development of a dynamic earthquake&lt;br/&gt;moment-tensor database. The new catalog will be searchable on the&lt;br/&gt;web, and will include auxiliary data, such as information about the&lt;br/&gt;seismograms and Earth model used in the analysis, the quality of&lt;br/&gt;the solution, and any history of updates to the results.&lt;br/&gt;A second component of the project is an examination of previously&lt;br/&gt;undetected earthquakes. More than 1,800 events with magnitudes greater&lt;br/&gt;than 4.7 have recently been found using a new detection algorithm, and&lt;br/&gt;a substantial subset of these are clearly not common earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;The effort will involve a first-order, systematic analysis&lt;br/&gt;of the new events to determine why they eluded earlier&lt;br/&gt;detection (e.g., whether all of the events lack high-frequency&lt;br/&gt;radiation and are thus slow earthquakes) and the specific tectonic&lt;br/&gt;(or non-tectonic) explanations for several specific groups of&lt;br/&gt;detections, including (1) events associated with volcanic eruptions&lt;br/&gt;or collapses; (2) events associated with glaciers in Alaska, Antarctica,&lt;br/&gt;and Greenland; and (3) events off the coast of North Carolina,&lt;br/&gt;possibly associated with submarine slumping.</AbstractNarration>
