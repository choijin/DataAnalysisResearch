<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit.  The long-term maintenance of genetic diversity in natural populations is widely regarded as one of the most interesting challenges for biologists.  The parasite hypothesis predicts that parasites and pathogens will evolve to infect common host genotypes disproportionately, thereby resulting in the long-term maintenance of genetic variation.  The parasite hypothesis will be tested using long-term surveys in conjunction with a series of laboratory infection experiments focused on a diverse population of freshwater snails and their parasitic worms.  The results will be of broad interest to ecologists, parasitologists, and conservation geneticists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  This study system has brought together an international group of scientists and students.  As in the past, these investigators will continue to train undergraduates in the basic ideas surrounding host-parasite coevolution and the maintenance of genetic variation; every effort will be made to attract undergraduate students from under-represented groups and to give them hands on experience in research.  Previous results from this system have been used in textbooks, television shows, and radio programs.  Because the basic ideas surrounding host-parasite coevolution are generally very accessible, they are nicely suited for educational purposes.  They also have important ramifications for conservation biology, agricultural practices, and disease ecology.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most pressing questions in evolutionary biology concerns the maintenance of genetic diversity.  At first sight, natural selection would be assumed to reduce diversity; but genetic diversity is common, especially for genes involved in combating infectious diseases.  Our work has been focused on the role of host-parasite coevolution in maintaining genetic variation in natural populations.  In addition, our work has focused on the role of host-parasite coevolution in selecting for cross-fertilization as opposed to either self-fertilization or clonal reproduction.  The basic idea is that parasites will rapidly evolve to infect the most common host genotypes, which leads to the long-term maintenance of genetic diversity and possibly to selection for cross-fertilization.   To test the basic ideas, we have used a combination of long-term surveys, short-term experiments, and mathematical models.  Most of the empirical work has been focused on a freshwater snail and its trematode parasites.  The snail has been valuable in this regard, because its populations often contain clonal females living in coexistence with outcrossing females.  Our results strongly suggest that the clonal females have an advantage in the absence of parasites; but that the outcrossing females have an advantage when parasites are common.  The advantage to outcrossing results from the production of genetically variable progeny, which are more likely to be resistant infection.  The work has direct applications to human pathogens, such as the Schistosome worms that also use snails as intermediate hosts.  In addition, theoretical models produced as part of this study have directly shown how increasing genetic diversity can reduce the spread of diseases in natural populations.  The work has resulted in more than 25 peer-reviewed publications.    Funding from this study has been used to facilitate the doctoral research of six women scientists: Dr. Britt Koskella (presently at Exeter University), Dr. Kayla King (presently at Oxford University), Dr. Deanna Soper (presently, post-doctoral associate at the University of Iowa), Daniela Vergara (PhD defense scheduled), Kate Charles (PhD candidate) and Amanda Gibson (PhD candidate), as well as one post-doctoral associate (Dr. Levi Moran, who will join the faculty at Emory University).  Funding has also been used to support the research of dozens of undergraduates, as well as two recent high school students.  Our results have been featured in radio programs, TV series, Evolution textbooks, and monographs on Evolutionary Biology.  We have also contributed to peer-reviewed papers on outreach and education.            Last Modified: 05/01/2013       Submitted by: Curtis M Lively]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
