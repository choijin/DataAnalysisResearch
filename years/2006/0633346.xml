<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  The goals of this project are to enhance undergraduate student understanding of chemistry using the theory and applications of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to increase student competency with modern chemical technology by providing hands-on experience with a high-field NMR, and to develop a community of chemical educators with faculty from several primarily undergraduate institutions in Northwest Oregon. These goals are being achieved by sharing the use of a high-field (300 MHz) NMR spectrometer with broadband, variable temperature, and autosampling features, housed at George Fox University (GFU), with students and faculty at Warner Pacific College and Corban College.  NMR theory and practice are being integrated throughout the chemistry curriculum at GFU according to specific student learning objectives in chemistry knowledge and technical proficiency. Existing experiments and lecture topics are being enhanced and modernized by access to the new NMR spectrometer. Laboratory exercises that emphasize the full range of NMR techniques are being adapted from other sources and added to the curriculum. All NMR topics in the chemistry curriculum at GFU are being added in a carefully designed manner so that discussions build on prior knowledge from previous courses. The curricular changes at GFU also involve participation by the GFU chemistry faculty in an NMR project with Dr. Karl Mueller from Pennsylvania State University. Faculty and students from the other colleges are using the instrument remotely at no cost, and faculty from all of the participating institutions gather to share insights about NMR teaching pedagogy, laboratory experiments, assessment strategies, and training procedures. Project evaluation involves course-specific assessment of NMR theory and practice, the use of NMR-specific assessment tools developed by Dr. Mueller, surveys of alumni regarding NMR technical proficiency and general competence with scientific equipment, laboratory practica that assess student proficiency with the NMR spectrometer, and assessment by an external team of chemistry educators from institutions in the Pacific Northwest.</AbstractNarration>
