<AbstractNarration>Objectives. What religious goals did Charlemagne (ruled 768-814) hope to achieve by supporting&lt;br/&gt;a revival of scientific knowledge at the beginning of the ninth century? How were royal political&lt;br/&gt;legitimacy and science related in Charlemagne's striving for greater order in his kingdom and&lt;br/&gt;empire? In what ways did royal court culture and the education of clerics intersect and promote&lt;br/&gt;the sciences? Intellectual Merit    In answering these questions the project will present Charlemagne's case for ordering a reform of Christian knowledge as part of a broad renewal of the religious culture in his&lt;br/&gt;realm. This religious renewal included the vision of Charlemagne and his dynasty as divinely&lt;br/&gt;chosen to direct the ordering of Christian Europe and improve Christian education within it. The&lt;br/&gt;king assembled from Italy, England, Ireland, and elsewhere scholars with extensive knowledge to&lt;br/&gt;his court. The court itself emerged as a source and a point of dissemination for revived or&lt;br/&gt;rediscovered literary texts and scientific knowledge along with fuller exploration of writings by&lt;br/&gt;the church Fathers and more recent Christian authors. Using the advice of various scholars, both&lt;br/&gt;secular and clerical, the king oversaw doctrinal reform, ordered attention to specific areas of&lt;br/&gt;study in the education of clerics, and stimulated the interest of ecclesiastical leaders in a renewal&lt;br/&gt;and expansion of the liberal arts as an essential foundation for biblical and doctrinal&lt;br/&gt;understanding. The project will show how certain of these leaders pursued a distinctive&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of Saint Augustine's view of secular scientific knowledge in order to justify an&lt;br/&gt;extensive revival and teaching of classical Roman texts (and some translated Greek texts) on&lt;br/&gt;astronomy, cosmology, medicine, agriculture, mathematics, and military science among others.&lt;br/&gt;The nature of these texts, illustrations from their pages, the ways they were studied in the&lt;br/&gt;Carolingian renaissance of the ninth century  all these will be exposed. The search for and&lt;br/&gt;discovery of order in the heavens, the weather, human physiology, the structure of the cosmos,&lt;br/&gt;and the behaviors of animals contributed to a greater sense of confidence in the direction and&lt;br/&gt;order of the church and kingdom. At the same time, such confidence always required renewal&lt;br/&gt;through analyses of new phenomena and newly revealed knowledge. The project will show how a&lt;br/&gt;succession of clerics from Charlemagne forward interacted with the royal court and royal&lt;br/&gt;patronage to support increasingly more sophisticated scientific study and the teaching of natural&lt;br/&gt;science. These were seen to strengthen the church and Christian culture and thereby to benefit the&lt;br/&gt;king, acting in accord with the will of God.&lt;br/&gt;Methods. Historical methods, reading and translating medieval Latin manuscripts, engaging and&lt;br/&gt;applying current scholarship on the era of Charlemagne, will allow the PI to offer new&lt;br/&gt;understandings of the place of science in the vastly different world of ninth-century northern&lt;br/&gt;Europe. Description and analysis of the political and religious situations will use official&lt;br/&gt;documents, letter collections, religious treatises, and scientific texts to expose the particulars of&lt;br/&gt;scientific revival. These sources also reveal goals and strategies of ecclesiastical advisors and&lt;br/&gt;power figures, interacting with the royal court and with each other in regard to the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. The history of scientific knowledge in ninth-century Europe has moved from&lt;br/&gt;the study of computus (calendar-making and computation) to astronomy and to medicine and&lt;br/&gt;beyond. The present project will for the first time bring together a broad range of sciences and&lt;br/&gt;explore more deeply the religious background behind the Carolingian profusion of scientific&lt;br/&gt;studies, including the sense of connection between good kingship and the reform of religious and&lt;br/&gt;secular studies in schools. This picture of a Christian revival of science will show the reasons&lt;br/&gt;specific to ninth-century politics and religion for such a renewal and advancement.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The project will show the importance of historical conditions for different&lt;br/&gt;relationships among science, religion, and politics. The publication of an accessible historical&lt;br/&gt;narrative in book form will engage public interest. Both the limits and opportunities, historically&lt;br/&gt;conditioned, of political and religious involvement in science will be set out and discussed.</AbstractNarration>
