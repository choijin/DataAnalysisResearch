<AbstractNarration>Proposal: Robotics and Intelligent Systems Planning within the Context of the International Advanced&lt;br/&gt;Robotics Programme1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;William R. Hamel, Professor and Head&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering Department&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed that the United States host a planning meeting in conjunction with the 2006 IEEE&lt;br/&gt;International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) to be held in Orlando, Florida May&lt;br/&gt;14-15, 2006. The planning meeting will be restricted to invitation only. It will incorporate a&lt;br/&gt;workshop-style environment to facilitate discussion about new ideas and emerging technologies&lt;br/&gt;that should drive future IARP workshops. The ICRA venue will provide access to world experts&lt;br/&gt;in selected topical areas who will be invited to give position papers on the basic&lt;br/&gt;robotics/intelligent systems technical areas corresponding to IARP interests: 1)&lt;br/&gt;intelligence/reasoning, 2) perception, 3) action and 4) human interfacing/interaction matters. The&lt;br/&gt;workshop output will provide assurance that future IARP meetings are based on collective&lt;br/&gt;reasoning about importance and priorities, thus enhancing the value of the overall IARP&lt;br/&gt;interactions to the US and other country participants.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The planning forum will include plenary keynote presentations from world&lt;br/&gt;experts in fundamental topics of robotics and intelligent systems. Researchers from the US and&lt;br/&gt;other countries will hear the keynotes and participate in breakout discussions about the most&lt;br/&gt;important research challenges that lay ahead. The collective result will be the integration across a&lt;br/&gt;representative subset of the international community as to the key research issues in robotics and&lt;br/&gt;intelligent systems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The planning forum will provide a focused platform for open discussion on key&lt;br/&gt;research challenges as viewed by a cross-section of leading international researchers from&lt;br/&gt;government, industry and academia. By virtue of the large number of member countries and&lt;br/&gt;member affiliates, the results of the planning and the execution of future workshops based on the&lt;br/&gt;planning, the results will influence research agendas across the globe. The forum will provide&lt;br/&gt;each participating country with a global view of robotics and intelligent systems research interests&lt;br/&gt;and priorities.</AbstractNarration>
