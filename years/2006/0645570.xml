<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Career: Lattice QCD Calculations of Nuclear Interactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental goal of modern nuclear physics is to rigorously compute the properties and interactions of nuclei. However, presently there is little understanding of nuclear physics in terms of the underlying theory of the strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  Aside from the intrinsic interest in understanding the origin of nuclear forces from first principles, there is practical motivation for establishing quantitative links between nuclear physics and QCD: many nuclear phenomena relevant to our understanding of astrophysical objects like neutron stars, as well as to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, cannot presently be determined experimentally or can only be poorly determined. This CAREER proposal outlines a program to perform pioneering calculations of simple nuclear properties using lattice QCD, a form of QCD amenable to large-scale computer simulations. Primary goals of the proposed research are a computation of the properties of the simplest nucleus ---the deuteron--- using lattice QCD, and the determination of hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon scattering parameters that are relevant to an understanding of the equation-of-state of high-density baryonic matter. In addition, the PI proposes to perform precision calculations of fundamental particle properties that are essential for a deeper understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics and its possible extensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project will also focus on the teaching of elementary physics, at the high-school and undergraduate levels, through the construction of simple computer programs. An initial goal will be to provide New Hampshire high-school teachers with a program of study involving real-world problems ---like projectile motion with drag--- using a computer program implemented with a basic desktop spreadsheet, which is a universally-available platform. This will be important in providing teachers with a method of teaching physics and other mathematical sciences that considers real-world problems from the onset using very-basic numerical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

These baryons are called hyperons, one example being the Lambda hyperon which is composed of up- down- strange.  Despite being somewhat difficult to deal with in the laboratory, as they quickly decay back into the protons and neutrons (along with other particles and energy) from whence they came, the properties of the hyperons are generally well known.  The solutions of the equations of QCD contain everything one would want to know about neutrons, protons and hyperons, but because the interactions among the quarks and gluons are strong, the solutions are notoriously difficult to obtain.  Fortunately, today's supercomputers have sufficient processing power so that the equations of QCD can be solved numerically in a controlled way, using a technique called Lattice QCD, in which space-time, the stage on which particles like quarks and gluons interact, is replaced by a lattice, or grid (see Figure 2).  The picture of protons, neutrons and hyperons that has long been seen experimentally is now being confirmed with ever-increasing precision using Lattice QCD.  Things get particularly interesting --and significantly more complicated-- when one jumps to the next level of complexity and asks whether one can, using Lattice QCD, see a proton and a neutron coming together to form a deuteron bound state.  While this is a very interesting question, it is somewhat academic as we already know all about deuterons from a large number of precise experiments, and therefore Lattice QCD would be ``postdicting'' (rather than``predicting'') simple nuclear physics using the fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom.  A more interesting question is whether hyperons can come together with themselves or with protons and neutrons to form so-called hypernuclei. Bob Jaffe, a theoretical physicist at MIT, proposed in the late 1970's, using a simple intuitive model of quarks, that one should expect to see a bound state of two lambda hyperons, the so-called H-dibaryon (see Figure 3).  Jaffe's proposal spawned a flurry of experimental work to detect the H, and while bounds have been placed on its existence, the experimental situation remains ambiguous: a perfect opportunity for Lattice QCD.  It is, in principle, simple to determine the mass of a particle using Lattice QCD. For instance, to determine the Lambda mass, one simulates an up, a  down, and a  strange quark on the space-time lattice and lets them quantum-mechanically wiggle around and exchange gluons according to the rules of QCD, and then measures the average energy of the wiggles. That energy is the Lambda mass.  To determine whether there is a bound H-dibaryon, one places two  up's, two down's, and two  strange quarks on the lattice to represent two Lambdas, and one again calculates the average energy.  If the energy of the two Lambdas is less than twice the mass of the Lambda,then the H-dibaryon is a bound exotic nucleus which would be stable were it not for the weak interactions slowly changing  strange quarks back into  up quarks.  This simple procedure has been carried out recently in realistic Lattice QCD calculations by two completely independent groups, one in the US and Europe (NPLQCD),  which was funded by this NSF grant, and one in Japan (HALQCD). The results, which are consistent with each other, sugg...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
