<AbstractNarration>The "STEP into Science" project at Medgar Evers College/ City University of New York is pursuing the goal of raising by 45% the total number of students earning baccalaureate degrees in in Biology and Environmental Science by the completion of the funding period in 2011. This project is an interdisciplinary effort between the faculties of two departments - Biology and Physical, Environmental, &amp; Computer Sciences.  In pursuit of its goal, the project is engaged in (1) aggressively recruiting new students and non-STEM students from within the college to major in biology or environmental science; (2) improving the retention of these science majors by providing additional academic, financial, and mentoring support; and (3) strengthening both departments with curricula that fosters the integration of research, technology and academics to better equip majors with the skills and knowledge necessary to transition successfully into graduate and professional programs and, ultimately enter rewarding science-based careers.  Prior to being awarded a STEP grant, both departments initiated and embraced numerous activities to advance their programs, improve the quality and quantity of their majors, and educate non-majors and the community to the importance of science in their lives. "STEP into Science" is facilitating efforts to seek further increases in majors and baccalaureate graduates.  A key objective is to have 60% of biology and environmental science students participate in a research experience after this project is fully operational.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project derives from its careful deployment of best practices (based on similar efforts on other campuses) in attracting and retaining students in STEM disciplines, and ultimately increasing the number of graduates that enter professional careers in the sciences. This proposal builds upon previous STEM education successes and existing articulations and research collaborations with feeder institutions.  It is also being served by a planned expansion that is providing new science facilities. A major theme underling this proposal's management and implementation plan is to improve the basic preparation and advising of entering students, who are primarily women and minorities from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Often these students enter college believing that they can't be successful academically or professionally as a science major because they (1) have not been encouraged in their pre-college experiences to choose science as a major; (2) are not adequately informed and encouraged when they start college about science degree programs and the potential professional career opportunities available to B.S. graduates; and (3) often enter college at risk with a poor science education and a variety of financial and other personal problems.  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is to increase the participation of under-represented groups (minorities and women) in science in order to meet the future needs of providing a technologically and scientifically advanced workforce.</AbstractNarration>
