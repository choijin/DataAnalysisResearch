<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                        Little Priest Tribal CollegeÆs TCUP grant award, Improving Science, Technology and Math Programs at LPTC, has supported LPTCÆs efforts to enhance STEM educational opportunities for its students. And, although the grant has undergone slight changes in scope, the goals of the grant have remained consistent, which are to attract and engage current and future students in STEM-related majors and courses. The following overview explains the core concepts and scope of the award.           Goal one: "to increase recruitment, enrollment, and retention in STEM courses and programs." This initiative has seen successes and, more importantly, it continues to grow in capacity. From its inception, a STEM recruiter, retention specialist and advanced skills lab instructors were hired, and infrastructure materials for a skills lab were purchased and installed. Library resource materials were upgraded and LPTC began offering dual enrollment classes at the local high school. These initiatives continued to be strengthened (i.e. expansion of recruiterÆs efforts, youth and community workshops, summer science camps, hiring of tutors for learning lab, etc.) throughout the time of the award, and most years saw increases in enrollment and retention for our STEM courses.[1] In 2013, a Summer Bridge Program in math, English and technology began, which has helped to recruit high school students into LPTC programs.           Goal two, "to improve the quality of STEM courses by cultural infusion, experiential and research projects," has also been successful. An ongoing program of professional development opportunities emphasizing cultural integration was initiated and participated in by faculty and staff. This was especially important for newly hired employees. Additionally, the award allowed for an increase of cultural integration within LPTCÆs courses, to include redesigned content, new modes of delivery, incorporation of Native Case Studies, guest speakers and community service projects. Presently, all LPTC courses (not just STEM courses) require cultural integration. Other improvements in STEM course quality have also occurred, such as the implementation of new math software, experiential learning activities, research projects, and both increased and more efficient use of technology. For example, students in multimedia courses are now recording powwows and other culturally-relevant community activities; then, editing and broadcasting them on LPTCÆs radio station which has been converted to all Native content.           Goal three, "to strengthen STEM foundation courses and LPTCÆs capacity to deliver STEM offerings", is closely related to the other goals of this grant. It includes professional development, cultural integration, experiential learning, development of the learning lab and hiring of STEM tutors, as mentioned above. However, this grant has also allowed LPTC to hire new STEM-related faculty members in math, science, computers, multimedia and alternate energy; redesign and revise existing STEM programs and their courses, including our developmental math program; and offer new STEM courses, which has increased enrollment in STEM-related programs. The award has also allowed the purchase of materials and equipment in order to ensure our STEM curriculum meets the needs of students in the digital age.           Goal four, "to deliver a GIS/GPS visualization degree program that supports the environmental STEM foci at LPTC" has seen a strong beginning. Computers capable of handling this program have been purchased and installed, library materials were acquired, a faculty member for the program was hired and networking with local universities has begun. (Note: This goal was revised in 2009 to increase number of high school graduates enrolling in LPTC, which ties into the outcomes of Goal one of this report).           The grant has also allowed LPTC to embark on future STEM projects to better meet the needs of our students. Our c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
