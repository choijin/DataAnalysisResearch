<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0640282&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Alan D. Weinstein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scientific symposium titled "Geometry and Theoretical Physics"&lt;br/&gt;will take place at the National Meeting of the Society for the&lt;br/&gt;Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in the Sciences&lt;br/&gt;(SACNAS) in Tampa, Florida on October 27, 2006. Mirror Symmetry,&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Cohomology and Gromov-Witten theory lie at the heart of&lt;br/&gt;the intersection of contemporary geometry and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics. Great strides have recently been made in our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these subjects, including a complete&lt;br/&gt;determination of the Gromov-Witten theory (and Donaldson-Thomas&lt;br/&gt;theory) of local curves, and of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and&lt;br/&gt;new proofs of Witten's conjecture; announced results include the&lt;br/&gt;computation of the quantum cohomology of certain Hilbert schemes&lt;br/&gt;of basic importance, and a construction of the Equivariant&lt;br/&gt;Vertex, determining the Gromov-Witten theory of all toric&lt;br/&gt;threefolds. A number of important conjectures drive the field,&lt;br/&gt;including Chern-Simons/Gromov-Witten duality, the&lt;br/&gt;Donaldson-Thomas/Gromov-Witten correspondence, and the Crepant&lt;br/&gt;Resolution Conjecture. The speakers at this symposium will&lt;br/&gt;announce accomplishments and also discuss new directions of&lt;br/&gt;research. Specifically, Jim Bryan will discuss Topological&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Field Theories, Robin Wilson will discuss knots and&lt;br/&gt;three-manifolds, and Vincent Bouchard will discuss the Standard&lt;br/&gt;Model of particle physics, and its relation to geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will enable and encourage students and other&lt;br/&gt;scientists to pursue research in areas related to the interaction&lt;br/&gt;of theoretical physics and mathematics, provide the opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for scientists to interact and foster collaboration and new&lt;br/&gt;research, and disseminate knowledge to a wide and extraordinarily&lt;br/&gt;diverse audience.  While the reasons for organizing a scientific&lt;br/&gt;symposium on geometry and theoretical physics are many, there is&lt;br/&gt;additionally an acute need to do so for an audience of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities. There is at this time significant&lt;br/&gt;underrepresentation of minorities in the mathematical sciences;&lt;br/&gt;this underrepresentation is evidently severe in Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory and other fields relating to the interactions of geometry&lt;br/&gt;and physics. There are very important questions that need to be&lt;br/&gt;addressed in Gromov-Witten theory, and it is necessary to attract&lt;br/&gt;a broad and diverse audience to work on these&lt;br/&gt;problems. Gromov-Witten theory and related fields have been&lt;br/&gt;extremely successful in solving outstanding problems, some over&lt;br/&gt;100 years old, in several branches of mathematics and physics. It&lt;br/&gt;is predicted that underrepresented minorities will become the&lt;br/&gt;majority of United States Citizens; as such, it is in the long&lt;br/&gt;term interest of geometry and physics to have increased&lt;br/&gt;participation from members of these groups.  Moreover, given the&lt;br/&gt;importance of geometry and theoretical physics to mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;science in general, it is in our National interest to work&lt;br/&gt;against the underrepresentation of minorities conducting research&lt;br/&gt;in these fields.  This symposium has been approved and scheduled&lt;br/&gt;by SACNAS. In addition, funding has been secured from SACNAS to&lt;br/&gt;cover the speakers' and organizers' travel, lodging and&lt;br/&gt;conference registration fees. The funding requested in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal will be used for student support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information about mathematics at SACNAS in general, and&lt;br/&gt;about this symposium in particular, can be found, respectively,&lt;br/&gt;at http://www.uprh.edu/~sacnas/ and&lt;br/&gt;http://math.berkeley.edu/~dkarp/sacnas.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
