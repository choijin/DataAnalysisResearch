    <AbstractNarration>With support from the National Science Foundation's Major Research Instrumentation grant, Dr. Jose E. Nenez, Sr. of Arizona State University at the West Campus will acquire a suite of instrumentation to pursue research in visual perception and neuronal organization. The instrumentation consists of a variety of devices and computing systems that include: Macintosh G5 computers with high resolution monitors, a macular pigment densitometer, a temporal contrast sensitivity device, a photometer-radiometer, a visual resolution hyperacuity device, and an eye tracker. Pentium 4 computer systems will be used for training undergraduate students in the research process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although a number of related research goals will be pursued, a central goal is to explore the relationship between brain plasticity and critical flicker fusion, an indicator of efficiency of information processing in neurons within the dorsal stream of the visual cortex. Critical flicker fusion is the ability to fuse a flickering light presented within the central visual field into a steady light stream and reflects basic aspects of neural processing. In prior research Dr. Nanez and his collaborators have demonstrated that, contrary to prior beliefs, plasticity exists in the neurons within the visual cortex of human adults. Thus the neurons are not hard wired in infancy and early childhood. The researchers now wish to determine the presence and degree of plasticity in Area V1 of the visual cortex of middle-age and older humans and whether this can be altered as well. The results have the potential not only to provide new insight into basic neural mechanisms but also provide methods to increase effective functioning in individuals with dyslexia and poor reading ability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of this instrumentation will permit the creation of two fully-operational research units and in addition to facilitating senior scientists' research will also provide undergraduates with supervised, value-added research training and hands-on experience.</AbstractNarration>
