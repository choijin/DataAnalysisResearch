<AbstractNarration>The project covers a wide range of aspects in algebra such as&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, algebraic groups and motivic cohomology.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator proposes to use theory of algebraic cycles in&lt;br/&gt;geometry to study properties of splitting varieties of algebraic objects. &lt;br/&gt;The first topic the investigator proposes to study is the canonical&lt;br/&gt;dimension of an algebraic object such as algebraic variety,&lt;br/&gt;quadratic form, central simple algebra, etc. The canonical dimension&lt;br/&gt;measures complexity of the class of splitting fields of an algebraic &lt;br/&gt;object. In particular, the investigator  proposes to compute the canonical&lt;br/&gt;dimension of projective homogeneous varieties and simple algebraic&lt;br/&gt;groups. The investigator also plans jointly with A. Suslin to compute &lt;br/&gt;the motivic cohomology of Severi-Brauer varieties and generalize&lt;br/&gt;this computation to the case of generic splitting varieties of arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;symbols. These varieties were used in the proof of the Milnor and the&lt;br/&gt;Bloch-Kato Conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of mathematics is to provide an approximation to the&lt;br/&gt;picture of the physical world. This project develops methods from&lt;br/&gt;topology that studies continuous transformations of structures called&lt;br/&gt;topological spaces and algebraic geometry concerning geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;coming from graphing polynomial equations and called algebraic varieties.&lt;br/&gt;This project is devoted to the study of certain fundamental problems&lt;br/&gt;of motivic cohomology theory - a relatively new and very quickly developing&lt;br/&gt;branch of algebraic geometry. The new areas of algebra that will hopefully&lt;br/&gt;evolve from the work on the project will create new research opportunities &lt;br/&gt;for mentoring graduate students and junior faculty and provide material&lt;br/&gt;for graduate courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
