<AbstractNarration>This project will provide support to U.S. graduate and postdoctoral scholars to participate in the International Workshop Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy: Routes to Three Dimensional Imaging of Single Molecules. The Workshop will be held at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York from June 21 - 24, 2006. The goal of the Workshop is to explore strategies for developing a molecular microscope capable of determining the molecular structure of single biomolecules and other organic nanostructures. The organizers have chosen Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM) as the focus of the Workshop because it is the best technology available for realizing a molecular microscope and because recent progress in MRFM has been dramatic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Workshop Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy: Routes to Three Dimensional Imaging of Single Molecules. will advance education in MRFM and related scanned probe microscope technology by developing tutorial lectures that will be posted on the World Wide Web. The Workshop will impact society in a number of ways. First, it will accelerate development of a tool for nanoscale characterization that will have an enormous impact across many areas of research and technology. Research in organic solar cells, light emitting diodes, and field effect transistors; research in molecular biology; and the development of cures for diseases will be accelerated greatly by the realization of a molecular microscope. Second, by bringing together a broader cross section of research groups than would typically attend a national conference session, the workshop will enable molecular microscope technology to have an impact on research at U.S. corporations and government laboratories. Finally, Workshop participants will analyze, interpret, and synthesize research results into a white paper which will be broadly disseminated on the World Wide Web. This white paper will be written in a format understandable and useful for non-scientists, and will thereby help Federal, State and local agencies formulate policy impacting the development of the next generation of nanoscale characterization tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
