<AbstractNarration>The Harvard Forest LTER (HFR) investigates forest response to natural and human disturbance and environmental change over broad spatial and temporal scales. Involving many researchers and students from a dozen institutions, HFR embraces the biological, physical, and social sciences to address fundamental and applied questions for dynamic ecosystems. Its work on the ecological effects of the primary drivers of forest change in New England (human impacts, natural disturbances, and climate change) has resulted in synthetic publications, cross-site collaborations, and effective outreach in conservation and environmental policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forests of eastern North America are being (sub)urbanized and fragmented more rapidly than elsewhere in the U.S., and regional impacts of pollution and climate change may be especially dramatic due to New England's location at the end of the nation's 'tail-pipe'. The proposed work for HFR's next phase focuses on the impacts of the changes in rates and magnitudes of these key drivers of landscape change and explores their consequences for regional populations, communities and ecosystems. The proposed research represents a shift in focus from the impacts of the primary, physical drivers of forest change examined largely at a single site or landscape to a comprehensive analysis of both primary and secondary forces and responses operating across the entire region. This mandates a greater emphasis on the biological components of landscape change, such as invasive species and pests, and the contributions of individual taxa to ecosystem processes. In addition to considering drivers explored earlier, this phase will incorporate new measurement and experimental studies of land-cover change (resulting from forest harvesting, conversion, and land protection) and the spread of invasive species (plants, pests, and pathogens) and native ungulates (especially moose) that are re-colonizing the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This broadened research agenda is a consequence of an increasing regional perspective, greater interdisciplinary participation, a strong commitment to inform conservation, management, and policy efforts through collaboration with mission-oriented agencies and non-profit organizations, and a commitment to position HFR for emerging research opportunities outlined by the LTER Strategic Task Force and NEON planning processes. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

We work to strengthen the scientific basis for environmental stewardship by connecting scientists and long-term ecological data with news media and decision makers at multiple levels of society.  Key outcomes of HFR LTER-IV include:  Synthesis of century-long studies document persistent legacies of human and natural history in shaping modern forest ecosystems. Ancient land-use practices and prior forest conditions continue to influence a forestÆs potential to grow trees, respond to disturbance and stress, and support diverse plants and animals.   Data collected from the worldÆs longest continuously operating forest-atmosphere exchange measurement system and permanent forest measurement plots revealed that old forests at Harvard Forest can store carbon at rates higher than previously documented. These results imply that allowing forests to mature can be an important strategy for mitigating climate change, and suggest a major paradigm shift in forest management strategies.   Results from 20-year climate-change experiments have illustrated that warming soils release more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and accelerate the pace of climate change, and nitrogen deposition leads to increased soil carbon storage. The composition and function of the soil microbial community largely controls observed responses to both warming and nitrogen deposition. Connecting data from Harvard Forest with regional field sampling, imaging spectroscopy, remote sensing, and tower-based carbon flux measurements revealed strong linkages among canopy carbon, nitrogen and albedo. The results raise the possibility of an unrecognized feedback in the EarthÆs climate system involving the nitrogen cycle as a key factor influencing surface energy exchange. Researchers at Harvard Forest and six other LTER sites introduced the concept of a "foundation species" into terrestrial ecology. Individual foundation species disproportionately influence biodiversity and modulate ecosystem dynamics. In LTER-IV, Harvard Forest scientists used a network of permanent forest plots, a large-scale, long-term experiment, analyses of fossil pollen, and modeling forecasts of regional carbon budget response to explore the consequences of losing eastern hemlock, a forest foundation species of northeast North America. The discovery that some invasive plants release chemicals belowground that disrupt the relationship between native tree seedlings and beneficial, co-occurring fungi.
