<AbstractNarration>Frederick D. Lewis, George C. Schatz, Michael R. Wasielewski (all at Northwestern University), Torsten Fiebig (Boston College) and Alexander L. Burin (Tulane University) are jointly supported for research into the electronic structure of DNA.  More specific objectives include the investigation of the nuclear and electronic structure of short, well-defined duplex base pair domains in both the ground and electronically excited states;  and investigation of the structural and electronic changes which occur upon the oxidation or reduction of duplex domains. The team will study short stable base pair domains in custom-designed hairpin and dumbbell structures. A wide range of state-of-the-art time-resolved spectroscopic, computational, and structural techniques will be used to probe how the structural changes within DNA are coupled to the properties of excited and ion states within it. Experimental approaches include molecular design and synthesis, spectroscopy, time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, time-resolved EPR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, time-resolved circular dichroism, and electronic structure calculations. David Tiede (Argonne National Laboratory) will also collaborate with the team and bring expertise in time-resolved diffraction techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structural and functional integrity of DNA is critical to its role in biology, so that this project will provide fundamental information on how light and chemical agents introduce reactive sites within DNA, which change its structure and potentially alter its function.  The anticipated outcomes of this collaboration include elucidation of the properties of neutral and ionized short DNA base-pair domains, training of undergraduate and graduate students in an important interdisciplinary area, and providing a model for interlocking collaboration among investigators with varying experience and in different research environments. This project is supported by the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ DNA Photonics  NSF-CRC: CHE-0628130           Frederick D. Lewis, George C. Schatz, Michael R. Wasielewski (all at Northwestern University), Torsten Fiebig (Northwestern University, formerly Boston College), and Alexander L. Burin (Tulane University)     Project Outcomes Report: August 31, 2012     Submitted by:             Frederick D. Lewis, Principle Investigator                          Northwestern University     DNA is a large molecule essential for nearly all known forms of life.  It consists of building blocks (nucleotides) which can be assembled into single strands (oligonucleotides) like beads on a string, which in turn can bind to complementary strands to from double stranded DNA.  The scientific objective of this project is to understand the changes which occur when short pieces of DNA are exposed to UV (ultraviolet) light or when an electron is removed or added to DNA, a field of study which we have called DNA Photonics.  This project was funded by the National Science Foundation under the Collaborative Research in Chemistry (CRC) program for a five year period beginning September 1, 2006.  Five academic scientists located at three universities (Northwestern, Tulane, and Boston College) with expertise and interest in the design, synthesis, spectroscopy, and theoretical aspects of this project served as co-investigators.  They directed the research of the undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs who worked on this project.  During the initial phase of this project the major activity was the synthesis and character-ization of small pieces of DNA needed for further studies.  A combination of experimental and theoretical methods was used to investigate the interaction of synthetic DNA with UV light.  UV-induced damage to DNA has been linked to skin cancer and thus understanding the damage process and its repair are the subjects of continuing interest.  We are able to control the sequence of nucleotides (building blocks) in synthetic DNA and thus determine how this sequence determines the efficiency of the damage and repair processes caused by UV light.  Additional information about DNA can be obtained using modified nucleotide building blocks which can be incorporated into DNA in place of the natural building blocks by synthetic design.  UV excitation of these modified building blocks can also be used to inject or remove electrons from the neighboring natural bases.  The scientific results of this project have been published in approximately 40 scientific articles in widely accessible journals.  The broader impacts of this project include the training of students in an important interdisciplinary area of research and the development of models for collaborative research.  Students at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level were actively involved in this project.  An annual meeting with talks by all of the participating students provided for extensive contact between students with diverse research training in synthesis, spectroscopy, and theory.  Several of the doctoral students worked closely with two of the PIs for extended periods of their thesis research.  Three senior PIs at Northwestern served as mentors for PIs at Tulane and Boston College embarking on their independent careers.  The outcome was excellent in the case of the Tulane PI, regrettably less so for the BC PI.  The productivity of this project peaked in its third year when it became clear that the NSF would not continue funding for CRC projects.
