<AbstractNarration>1Center for Environmental and Applied Fluid Mechanics (CEAFM), 2Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD 21218, 3Ecole Polytechnique Federale Lausanne, Switzerland, and  Dept. of Geography and Environmental Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD 21218.&lt;br/&gt;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: In hydrology, the main practical approach to obtain regional scale evaporation continues to be based on classical similarity theory of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The theory assumes a uniform land surface yet has also often been found acceptable in flows over heterogeneous natural land surfaces due to the turbulent flow in the ABL, which efficiently blends&lt;br/&gt;the various sources and inhomogeneities across the landscape. It is thus essential to understand and predict how land heterogeneity and atmospheric stratification affect the relevant length-scales associated with this blending process. Specifically, the height of blending layers, and effective  'average') roughness lengths for surface fluxes of temperature and humidity are of needed to formulate simplified models. In the proposed research, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of turbulent&lt;br/&gt;flow and transport in the ABL will be conducted to identify the blending properties of turbulent mixing under various conditions of stratification and spatially heterogeneous roughness properties, including fractal distributions. Numerical simulations will employ the newly developed and tested&lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic model, which has been shown to be particularly well suited to capture unresolved small-scale turbulence physics in complex environments in which turbulence&lt;br/&gt;deviates from the classical assumptions of isotropic, inertial-range behavior. The dynamic procedure eliminates the need to specify tunable model coefficients. Extensions of the dynamic model to account for scalar transport will be implemented. Through a parametric series of high-resolution simulations (parametric LES) where surface roughness, geometric arrangements, and surface temperature and/or heat flux are varied systematically, those features which drive the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;land-atmosphere exchange over heterogeneous terrain will be quantified, and their relevant lengthscales established. This information will be used in new strategies for obtaining regional scale fluxes such as heat flux and evaporation over realistic terrain. Field validations of the LES and parameterizations will be conducted using data collected during the planned Swiss Mosaic&lt;br/&gt;Experiment. Broader impacts: Large-scale (regional or global-scale) earth-system simulations, used to simulate weather and the Earth's climate and project temperature changes in the coming decades, rely heavily&lt;br/&gt;on parameterizations to represent the atmospheric boundary layer and the land surface. LES with accurately tested subgrid models allows us to undertake assessments and developments of new,&lt;br/&gt;carefully and individually tested, components of the larger scale models. Increasing the trustworthiness of individual components of large-scale models is a necessary step for predictions to be taken more seriously by policy-making bodies, and ultimately also by the broader public. Broader impact of the proposed research activity is also achieved through our unique graduate studenttraining&lt;br/&gt;program. The students are trained rigorously in science through course-work in various departments, possibly leading to a M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering and a PhD in the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering through the CEAFM's Dual Degree&lt;br/&gt;Program. And, through the program in Geography and Environmental Engineering they will have a&lt;br/&gt;broader knowledge at the interface between society and environment. This program is distinctive in&lt;br/&gt;the scope of its focus on the interaction between human behavior and nature over time and in its&lt;br/&gt;structure, which combines political and human aspects with the science of the environment. The&lt;br/&gt;Hopkins program has garnered considerable recognition for its success in influencing public policy&lt;br/&gt;through solid science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed at developing computational tools to simulate wind flow and associated exchanges that occur at the land &ndash; atmosphere interface for cases in which the terrain displays non-trivial scale distributions and spatial heterogeneities.  A highly challenging problem in simulating wind flow and associated momentum, mass and energy fluxes across the land-atmosphere interface (ground surface, terrain) is how to represent the portion of these fluxes that occurs at scales small enough to be "invisible" to the computational grid because the grid has to be coarse. To represent these features, we need so-called subgrid-scale models. Developing such models for terrains that exhibit multi-scale features is a relatively unexplored area. For instance, for fluvial landscapes that contain branching channels at multiple scales, how should the subgrid-scale fluxes be parameterized? What are the characteristic parametrized scales? And, how should one deal with the spatial heterogeneity associated with such surfaces?  In this project, we have proposed and developed a new technique based on the observation that often such surfaces display fractal character, i.e. they "look" similar when viewed at various length-scales (see e.g. bottom examples shown in Figure 1). Then, our approach relies on the observation that properly normalized model parameters can be obtained at a large (grid-resolved) scale and applied during the simulation to parameterize the smaller (unresolved) scales. Technically, the approach is based on requiring the total force to be the same, regardless of whether a model is formulated at the grid scale &Delta;, or at some multiple of it, for instance 2&Delta;.  Figure 1 shows some basic equations underlying this method, and the surfaces to which the method has been applied. Large Eddy Simulations were performed and the characteristics of the new model explored and quantified. The results are very promising. They show that notions based on fractals and scale-invariance can be used in a predictive dynamical fashion, in addition to their more traditional applications in merely describing natural phenomena.  This grant supported other related research activities on modeling pollen dispersal in the atmosphere, on the use of field experimental data to validate and improve subgrid-scale models for unclosed terms in the bulk of the turbulent air-flow in LES, as well as on simulating a daily cycle of the atmospheric boundary layer.  A total of 11 journal papers were produced, as well as 4 conference proceedings papers, 7 abstracts and at least 15 talks were presented based on this grant by the principal investigators and graduate students involved.
