    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) project describes a fabrication technology to produce sub-micron liquid metal droplet switches for analog and RF device applications. Using this technology, MEMS switches can be integrated and placed on top of conventional CMOS circuitry isolated by dielectric film. In this technology the size of the switch is restricted by lithography limit, not by metal droplet deposition process which is the case with conventional method. And hence, dense switch matrices can be made and applications of non-silicon based MEMS switches extend to, not only discrete switches, but also to programmable circuits and systems including FPGAs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the miniaturized metal droplet switches will significantly lower operating voltage, possibly reducing it from tens of volts to few volts with faster switching times. Also, environmentally hazardous mercury droplet is replaced by non-toxic gallium alloy. Since gallium alloy is easy to oxidized, use of separation of oxide liquid/gas such as ammonia is proposed. The proposed technology bridges silicon based CMOS VLSI and MEMS technology. By accomplishing the objectives of this proposal the CMOS VLSI technology horizon could be extended beyond "Moore's Law".</AbstractNarration>
