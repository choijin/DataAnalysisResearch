<AbstractNarration>Support from this proposal will help early career scientists to travel to the "2006 Workshop on Seismic Anisotropy and Geodynamics of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere System" held in the Czech Republic.  This workshop is jointly organized by the Geophysical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences and the Department of Geology and Geophysics at Yale University, and has been held every 10 years.  The goal of the workshop is to bring together students and researchers to discuss: 1) Mantle deformation seen by seismic anisotropy measurements; 2) Model for anisotropic mantle fabrics from ancient and ongoing processes; 3) Constraints from textures in xenoliths and exposed mantle sections; 4) Mechanical interactions between the lithosphere and asthenosphere; 5) Surface tectonic style and the underlying mantle flow; and 6) The role of water in the development of anisotropy.  There are several broader impacts:  The workshop will have tutorials on anisotropy and data analysis, in which code will be shared.    In addition, the meeting itself will further the training of graduate students, postdocs, and early career researchers.    Intellectual collaboration will be fostered by the international flavor of the workshop, including the Czech co-hosts.  The last, 1996, workshop included participants from France, Germany, the U.K., Italy, and the Czech Republic, and led to the RETREAT Continental Dynamics project.</AbstractNarration>
