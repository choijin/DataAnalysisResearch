<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a long-range vision that is designed to have an impact on students and teachers from elementary through graduate school. The primary goal is to improve learning by all students who take undergraduate physics. Related goals are to strengthen the preparation of teachers to teach physics and physical science by inquiry in the precollege grades, to guide graduate students in becoming effective teaching assistants, and to help current and future faculty develop the expertise necessary to introduce and sustain effective innovations. The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington works toward these goals through a coordinated, iterative process of research on learning and teaching, development of instructional materials, implementation in the classroom, and assessment of student achievement.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: In this project, the group is (a) enriching the research base on the learning and teaching of undergraduate physics, (b) expanding the range of research-based materials for undergraduate instruction, (c) disseminating the materials to other faculty, (d) promoting the development of faculty expertise in implementation, and (e) assessing effectiveness in a variety of instructional environments. The project builds on the prior experience of the group in research on student understanding of physics and the production and dissemination of two research-based curricula: Tutorials in Introductory Physics (Prentice Hall) and Physics by Inquiry (Wiley). Each forms the nucleus of an extended set of materials, collectively entitled Tutorials in Physics and the Physics by Inquiry Suite. The first includes a component for students in introductory physics who lack basic mathematical and reasoning skills and another component for students beyond the introductory level. The PbI Suite is intended for a variety of populations, including K-12 teachers, underprepared students aspiring to science-related careers, and students not majoring in science. A new component focuses on basic concepts and reasoning skills needed to teach science in elementary grades. Another helps prepare middle and high school teachers to teach modern physics. Although the main focus in this project is on Tutorials, some development of PbI is taking place.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact: The instructional materials have a direct effect on the learning of physics by undergraduates in: (1) introductory physics courses for science and engineering majors (calculus- and algebra-based), (2) lower and upper division courses for physics majors, (3) physics courses for future K-12 teachers, (4) physics courses for non-science majors, and (5) physics courses for students under-prepared in science and mathematics who aspire to science-related careers. The project is embedded in a larger overall effort that helps ensure an even broader impact.  The group is working with faculty at a wide range of institutions in the process of developing and assessing curriculum. These collaborations support and sustain wide adoption. User groups are also being formed for both curricula. Since PbI is intended for the professional development of both preservice and inservice teachers, K-12 students indirectly benefit. The project has a direct effect on graduate teaching assistants, who will gain experience with an instructional approach that engages students in active learning. In addition to contributing to the research base, the project builds the capacity for discipline-based education research through the professional development of graduate students, post-docs and visitors to the group.</AbstractNarration>
