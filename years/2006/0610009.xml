<AbstractNarration>0610009&lt;br/&gt;Welty&lt;br/&gt;Despite the growing footprint of urban landscapes and their impacts on&lt;br/&gt;hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, comprehensive field studies of urban water budgets are few.&lt;br/&gt;The cumulative effects of urban infrastructure (buildings, roads, culverts, storm drains, detention&lt;br/&gt;ponds, leaking water supply and wastewater pipe networks) on temporal and spatial patterns of&lt;br/&gt;groundwater stores, fluxes, and flowpaths are poorly understood. Any environmental observatory&lt;br/&gt;network must include efforts to understand critical processes in urban landscapes, and urban&lt;br/&gt;groundwater can fairly be characterized as a missing link in our understanding of the integrated&lt;br/&gt;functioning of the natural and built environment. The goal of this project is to develop expertise and&lt;br/&gt;analytical tools for urban groundwater systems that will inform future environmental observatory&lt;br/&gt;planning and that can be shared with research teams working in urban environments elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;Our work plan draws on a robust set of information resources in Maryland provided by ongoing&lt;br/&gt;monitoring efforts of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), USGS, and the U.S. Forest Service&lt;br/&gt;working together with university scientists and engineers from multiple institutions. Consent decrees,&lt;br/&gt;signed by both Baltimore City and Baltimore County with U.S. EPA to mitigate failures in the sanitary&lt;br/&gt;sewer network, are leading to increased deployment of rainfall, groundwater and wastewater flow&lt;br/&gt;sensors including wireless telemetry for real-time data collection. The proposed project will leverage&lt;br/&gt;these resources with strategic investments in monitoring, modeling and database development to&lt;br/&gt;establish protocols for quantifying groundwater systems in urban areas.&lt;br/&gt;A key concern is to bridge the gap between small-scale intensive field studies and larger-scale and&lt;br/&gt;longer-term hydrologic patterns using synoptic field surveys, remote sensing, numerical modeling,&lt;br/&gt;data mining and visualization tools. Using the urban water budget as a unifying theme, we propose&lt;br/&gt;to estimate the various elements of the budget in order to quantify the influence of urban&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure on groundwater. Proposed efforts include: (1) comparison of base flow behavior from&lt;br/&gt;stream gauges in a nested set of watersheds at four different spatial scales from 0.8 to 171 km2, with&lt;br/&gt;diverse patterns of impervious cover and urban infrastructure; (2) synoptic survey of well water&lt;br/&gt;levels to characterize the regional water table; (3) use of airborne thermal infrared imagery to identify&lt;br/&gt;locations of groundwater seepage into streams across a range of urban development patterns; (4)&lt;br/&gt;use of seepage transects and tracer tests to quantify the spatial pattern of groundwater fluxes to the&lt;br/&gt;drainage network in selected subwatersheds; (5) development of a mass balance for precipitation&lt;br/&gt;over a 170 km2 area on a 1x1 km2 grid using recording rain gages for bias correction of weather&lt;br/&gt;radar products; (5) calculation of urban evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith method&lt;br/&gt;compared with results from an eddy correlation station; (7) use of numerical groundwater model in a&lt;br/&gt;screening mode to estimate depth of groundwater contributing surface water flow; (8) data mining of&lt;br/&gt;public agency records of potable water and wastewater flows to estimate leakage rates and&lt;br/&gt;flowpaths in relation to streamflow and groundwater fluxes; and (9) evaluation of the CUAHSI&lt;br/&gt;Hydrologic Information Systems data modeling tools for application to urban environments.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The project will provide guidance for development of environmental&lt;br/&gt;observatories, which are envisioned as providing critical information not only for basic science but for&lt;br/&gt;management of vital resources affecting the future health and well-being of both human populations&lt;br/&gt;and ecosystems. The project also will contribute to the education of graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students. Graduate students will participate as research assistants during the summer field season,&lt;br/&gt;as coordinated through UMBC's Center for Urban Environmental Research and Education. We will&lt;br/&gt;emphasize recruitment of undergraduate student assistants from UMBC's Meyerhoff Scholars&lt;br/&gt;program, which has a national reputation for training of talented minority students committed to&lt;br/&gt;graduate education in science and engineering. Through the Baltimore Ecosystem Study LTER, an&lt;br/&gt;extensive outreach educational program managed by the BES education coordinator is already in&lt;br/&gt;place with inner city Baltimore schools and with suburban Baltimore County schools, which includes&lt;br/&gt;a hydrologic science module within the environmental science curriculum. Results from the&lt;br/&gt;proposed work can contribute to/enhance this ongoing curriculum development effort.</AbstractNarration>
