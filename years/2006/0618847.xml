<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this program is to broaden participation in the geosciences by increasing the number of African-American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic or Latino, female, and first generation college students who enroll and succeed in graduate school in atmospheric and related sciences.  The foundation of Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) is a ten-week summer research internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research or at laboratories of other SOARS sponsors.  A strong, formal mentoring program and a vibrant learning community support all participants.  An ongoing writing workshop is also part of the summer program.</AbstractNarration>
