<AbstractNarration>This project will enhance the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) Mobile Integrated Profiling System (MIPS) by (a) upgrading the 915 MHz wind profiler with a fully digital receiver and improved signal processing system, and (b) adding an X-band Profiling Radar (XPR) to provide high-resolution (1 s in time, 45 m in height) profiles of precipitation, boundary layer structures, clouds, and biological flyers. These improvements will produce a mobile profiling system with enhancements in clear air (boundary layer) profiling, in addition to excellent capabilities in precipitation profiling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgraded 915 MHz profiler, and new XPR, will be used along with other MIPS instruments to conduct both basic and applied research: &lt;br/&gt;  a) Characterize atmospheric boundary layer structures, discontinuities associated with various convergent boundary zones, and refractive index variations associated with Bragg scatter. &lt;br/&gt;  b) Provide very high resolution profiles of precipitation and vertical motion within a variety of mesoscale precipitation systems ranging from landfalling tropical cyclones to cold season precipitation bands; and serve as a calibration tool to scanning dual-polarization radars for improved QPE. &lt;br/&gt;  c) Retrieve particle size distributions within the rain and ice regions of stratiform precipitation systems. &lt;br/&gt;  d) Examine insect properties, primarily flight characteristics and their spatial and temporal variation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Research projects utilizing this equipment will improve understanding of (a) boundary layer processes, including convergent boundary zones, gravity wave phenomena, and convective initiation (CI); (b) kinematic and microphysical properties of precipitating systems, (c) and various mesoscale phenomena. Collaborative research on biological fliers will include both basic and applied components. This research will improve understanding of CI and its relation to convective boundary layer (CBL) growth, convergence, and water vapor enhancements above the CBL. The Principal Investigator and his team have acquired considerable experience (14 years) in maintaining and deploying profiling equipment for a variety of projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: It is anticipated that a number of atmospheric scientists and students will reap considerable benefits from the new MIPS instrumentation. The MIPS will be available to the atmospheric science community as an advanced mobile atmospheric profiling platform. This project will facilitate infrastructure improvements to profiling instruments at UAH, which are an integral part of several graduate courses. Real time and archived data derived from the instruments are utilized by the PI in two classes, Ground-Based Remote Sensing and Boundary Layer Meteorology. Real-time MIPS data are utilized by the Huntsville National Weather Service for in increasing variety of forecasting applications, including hazardous weather and quantitative precipitation estimation.</AbstractNarration>
