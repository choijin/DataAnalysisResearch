<AbstractNarration>The National Science Teachers Association will host two, one-day conferences on Science and English Language Learners, focusing on the urgent need to provide access and opportunity to learn science to this group of students who constitute the fastest growing segment of K-12 students in the United States.  These conferences will be presented in association with the NSTA Area Conference, scheduled for Baltimore in November, 2006, and the NSTA 2007 National Conference in St. Louis.  They will feature NSF-funded projects that address demographic, economic, sociocultural and professional perspectives on how science and learning English intersect and overlap.  A growing and promising body of research on student learning when science and English are taught in a mutually supportive environment will be presented, highlighting best practices for science education for English Language Learners.  An important and heartening impact of that research shows that science can be taught in ways that promote access and achievement for all students, but make the critical difference for students in linguistically and culturally diverse classrooms.  The audience at each conference is expected to be 400 K-12 teachers, science supervisors, school administrators and professional development specialists.  The conferences and the subsequent dissemination of their products will provide timely and much needed guidance to districts, schools and teachers on how best to prepare all students in our increasingly diverse classrooms to meet the science learning requirements of No Child Left Behind.</AbstractNarration>
