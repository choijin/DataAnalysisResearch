<AbstractNarration>The Third International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks, and Systems (BroadNets 2006), will be held in San Jose, California from October 1-5, 2006. BroadNets 2006 is an international conference focusing on broadband communications, networks, and systems and covers the entire gamut of next generation networks, communications systems, applications and services. The conference is co-sponsored by IEEE Communications Society (www.comsoc.org) and Create-Net (www.create-net.it), a research institute based in Italy. The conference consists of three symposia, the Optical Communications, Networks and Systems Symposium, the Wireless Communications, Networks and Systems Symposium, and the General Symposium as well as several workshops. This award assists up to twenty (20) United States-based graduate students to attend the conference. Participation by graduate students in conferences such as BroadNets provides valuable experience for the students, enabling them to interact with senior researchers, as well as exposing them to a broader range of research topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity consists of the exchange of information between the supported graduate students and other researchers attending BroadNets. Opportunities for the intellectual exchange of information will be provided in technical sessions, panels, tutorials, workshops, and keynote talks. By attending such events, students will be able to gain valuable insight into various topics and the state-of-the-art in the field of broadband networking from both an academic as well as industry perspective. BroadNets conference with three symposia and several workshops covering emerging trends in broadband networking, is expected to generate a significant amount of interest and intellectual discussion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed activity consists primarily of the valuable training and learning experience provided to the supported students. By presenting their work in technical sessions, students will gain valuable experience in educating others about their own research. The students will also benefit from their interaction with peers and leading researchers from other institutions, and they will be able to develop their own professional networks. Such experiences will enable the graduate students to prepare for their own careers in research and education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
