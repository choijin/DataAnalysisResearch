<AbstractNarration>EEC-0649079&lt;br/&gt;David H. Vaughn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award for an REU Site at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will provide and opportunity for undergraduate students to conduct independent research under the guidance of faculty in Biological Systems Engineering (BSE).  The research conducted by the REU participants will improve our basic understanding of biological systems: the effects of land use and management practices on water quality, and the development and production of industrial products from biological feedstocks. Students will work in teams including faculty, graduate students and staff, conducting research on current problems in BSE using state-of-the-art facilities, equipment, and instrumentation.  Students will practice the scientific method, enhance their thinking and reasoning abilities, develop their communication skills, and gain further appreciation of the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of problems.  Activities included in the experience will include: 1) individual reading and study; 2) group research activities; 3) experiential learning; and 4) social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site program will encourage students to pursue graduate study and then enter research careers with academic institutions, federal agencies, and industry.  These students will become the future leaders in engineering and their research contributions will provide sustainable development for our society. Recruitment efforts will be focused on students who are rising seniors in biological systems engineering and related engineering disciplines such as chemical, civil, food, biochemical, environmental, natural resources, agricultural, biological, and biomedical.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
