<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop software for three-dimensional simulation of the two-phase flow in a twin-screw extruder. Currently available analytical tools for design of twin-screw extruders are based upon simplified one-dimensional or two-dimensional analysis.  However, the two-phase flow in twin-screw extruders is complex; and predictions from these simplified analyses cannot reliably predict the velocity, pressure and temperature distribution. The proposed software for three-dimensional simulation of the two-phase flow will incorporate a proprietary constitute theory that takes into account both the shear viscosity and the elongational viscosity of the polymer. Since the flow in intermeshing region of a twin-screw extruder is highly elongation dominated, the predictions from the proposed software will be more accurate than those from currently available tools that ignore the effect of elongational viscosity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology will enhance the understanding of polymer flow in twin-screw extruders and will lead to developing innovative screw profiles.  The use of this software will also enable various companies including plastic material suppliers, twin-screw extruder manufacturers and plastic compounders to cut costs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
