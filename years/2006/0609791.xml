<AbstractNarration>0609791&lt;br/&gt;Duffy&lt;br/&gt;Hydrologic Observatory: The Susquehanna River Basin (SRB) is the largest tributary&lt;br/&gt;to the Chesapeake Bay. Without this flow the estuary could not sustain its extraordinary&lt;br/&gt;diversity and productivity of aquatic life. The dilemma of our water-resource legacy is to balance&lt;br/&gt;the competing societal and environmental needs placed on the Susquehanna's freshwater&lt;br/&gt;resources. In 2002, Penn State took the leadership role in forming a consortium of scientists,&lt;br/&gt;policy makers, and stakeholders drawn from 30 universities as well as from federal and state&lt;br/&gt;agencies to design and implement the Susquehanna River Basin Hydrologic Observing System&lt;br/&gt;(SRBHOS) (www.srbhos.psu.edu). SRBHOS has been initiated to address "How do humans&lt;br/&gt;and climate impact the sustainability of the water resources within large river basins? What role&lt;br/&gt;do large rivers play in the global climate system?".&lt;br/&gt;Overview of Research: This proposed research plan will advance the SRBHOS&lt;br/&gt;science agenda by investigating the three research themes: (1) Assessment of the significance&lt;br/&gt;of the regional water table, its role as a lower boundary condition to soil moisture, and the&lt;br/&gt;impact of water table status on hydrologic extremes (floods, droughts). We propose to develop&lt;br/&gt;the concept of a subsurface boundary layer (SBL), which we define as the depth beneath the&lt;br/&gt;land surface for which the local atmosphere and land-surface processes will affect the local flow&lt;br/&gt;of groundwater to streams. An algorithm will be developed to map the SBL using the SRBHOS&lt;br/&gt;digital data. (2) Integrated models that include vegetation water and energy dynamics will&lt;br/&gt;improve hydrologic forecasts at the basin-scale and are critical to resolving the relative&lt;br/&gt;importance of recharge to the shallow groundwater table and transpiration of soil moisture (3)&lt;br/&gt;Macropores have a significant affect on the hydroclimatic performance of watersheds during&lt;br/&gt;wet and dry cycles. We intend to develop new parameterization strategies to correct the&lt;br/&gt;regional soils database for macropore flow based on the Shale Hills testbed. Currently soil&lt;br/&gt;classification only considers "matrix" properties (conductivity and water holding capacity).&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this research will attempt to demonstrate how a unification of modeling, existing digital&lt;br/&gt;data, and new data collection strategies will advance our understanding of river basin water&lt;br/&gt;resources and support the design of hydrologic observatories.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The present proposal will unify early SRBHOS science efforts and&lt;br/&gt;address how a physical model and a-priori data can be used to promote scientific collaborations&lt;br/&gt;that: (1) will aid the SRBHOS community in formulating hypotheses and potential scenarios for&lt;br/&gt;hydrologic change within the basin; (2) will promote the development of new data-driven&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that enhance our ability to represent and predict water cycle dynamics; and (3) that&lt;br/&gt;will support a scientifically-based design for the future observatory's sensor network. Addressing&lt;br/&gt;these issues will aid SRBHOS scientists in assessing climate and human feedbacks across&lt;br/&gt;multiple scales as well as physiographical and ecological conditions. The tools developed in&lt;br/&gt;this research will contribute to improving our understanding of the roles of terrain, ecology, and&lt;br/&gt;geology in partitioning water and energy across the complex environmental systems that make&lt;br/&gt;up the SRB.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This proposed research will be disseminated broadly to the&lt;br/&gt;academic, state, and federal SRBHOS partners through a Susquehanna Data and Modeling&lt;br/&gt;Symposium, which will be organized by the PIs in conjunction with the Chesapeake Research&lt;br/&gt;Consortium. Funds requested in this proposal for the symposium will be leveraged with others&lt;br/&gt;sources of funding to maximize our ability to invite national leaders in river basin modeling and&lt;br/&gt;data systems to review the proposed tools developed in this research as well as contribute their&lt;br/&gt;own expertise and tools to the SRBHOS community modeling effort. All software and data&lt;br/&gt;resources developed in this project are dedicated to the "open source" framework and shared&lt;br/&gt;through the Chesapeake Community Modeling Program. Additionally, this research effort will&lt;br/&gt;exploit basin-wide collaborations such as the currently pending Susquehanna REU to promote&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate education and to recruit demographically and geographically diverse students&lt;br/&gt;currently underrepresented in hydrologic science.</AbstractNarration>
