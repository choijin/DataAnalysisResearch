<AbstractNarration>A long-term partnership for research and education in nanomaterials will be established between the Center for Advanced Materials at Tuskegee University and the Cornell Center for Materials Research, a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Cornell University, under the Partnership for Research and Education (PREM) program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The program, which builds upon a long-standing, productive relationship between the two institutions, has three principal components: collaborative research in nanomaterials, development of educational resources and curricula for undergraduate and graduate education in materials, and outreach to K-12 students and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cross-university research team will work collaboratively to develop fundamental understanding of both the chemical interactions between nanoparticles and polymers and the relationship between these nanoscale interactions and the mechanical properties of nanocomposite materials. This understanding will be used to rationally develop a new generation of nanocomposite structural materials that are amenable to conventional processing methods. The production of high performance textiles with improved strength and durability will be one focus of this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Faculty, graduate students and undergraduates from both institutions will be involved in all aspects of the research. This partnership will strengthen the undergraduate and graduate materials science education program at Tuskegee University. Educational materials, courses and best practices developed at Cornell University will be shared with faculty and students at Tuskegee University using a combination of distance learning, teleconferencing and cross-campus visits. Through a number of creative and effective outreach programs, the partners will introduce a pool of well prepared high school and community college students to materials research and inform the students of career opportunities in the field of materials science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This partnership will have national broader impacts. By attracting and educating a considerable number of undergraduate and graduate African American students, the partnership will significantly impact the diversity of the field of materials science. By educating students in an interdisciplinary area of increasing national need  nanostructured materials  the program will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers, which is necessary for continued economic growth. By developing a new class of high performance materials, the research program will strengthen U.S. competitiveness in a rapidly expanding field of international interest. In addition, the program will elevate public awareness of materials research and reach out to the broader community, thereby helping to attract more students into STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PREM program between Tuskegee UniversityÆs Center for Advanced Materials (T-CAM) and Cornell UniversityÆs Center for Materials Research (CCMR) is aimed to form a long-term collaborative research program aimed at strengthening Tuskegee UniversityÆs research capability in advanced materials and to develop collaborative education and outreach programs to ensure that there is an adequate number of minority students who are well prepared and motivated to study materials science and engineering at the graduate level.     Intellectual Merit  Investigations were carried out in three main areas over the period of the grant:     1) Surface Chemical Investigations of Inorganic Guest-Organic Host Binding (Leads: Rangari (TU), Hines (Cornell))  This investigation combines the strength of the Tuskegee team in the fabrication of nanocomposite materials with the spectroscopic capabilities of the Cornell team to study the nature and extent of covalent bonding between nanoparticles and their polymer host in structural composites. The ultimate goal is to develop procedures that maximize this bonding, thereby producing high-strength nanocomposites. Thermal and mechanical properties of POSS modified carbon nanotubes infused resin systems, and the influence of surface modification of the carbon nanotubes in epoxy matrix were determined. We hope that our contributions will lead to a new class of polymeric nanocomposites that can be commercialized.      2) Synthesis and Rheological Characterization of Non-Spherical Micro and Nanostructures (Leads: Floyd-Smith (TU), Archer (Cornell))   The objective of this study was to synthesize cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanocubes and study their rheological behavior in suspensions of low molecular weight polyethylene glycol. This system is of interest because suspensions of cubes are expected to exhibit enhancements over traditional spherical particles for applications such as liquid body armor.  These enhancements are realized because of the ability of cubes to pack more closely and uniformly based on their planar faces. Examples of particles that have been synthesized with this method include shapes like triangular, tetragonal, pentagonal and hexagonal. The technique has potential to produce non-spherical metal oxide particles as well. In the last one year, we have demonstrated the ability to synthesize composite particles and their derivative inorganics.     3) Studies on the Effect of functionalization on the morphology, cure kinetics, multifunctional properties, and fracture behavior of MWCNTs with thermosetting polymers (Hosur (TU), Netravali (Cornell))     In the study, we have studied the oxidation, fluorination, and amine functionalization and reported the effect on the mechanical, thermal, thermomechanical, electrical properties of the nanocomposites. In addition, effect of functionalization on the cure kinetics, decomposition kinetics of polymeric nanocomposites has been a unique contribution. In order to disperse CNTs in polymers we have adopted, for the first time, a multi-stage approach involving combination of sonication, non &ndash;contact mixing and three-roll mill mixing methods. This approach has shown improvement in dispersion resulting in enhanced properties. Effect of dispersion on the viscosity of nanocomposites has been quantified for the first time by our group. The work was also carried out to understand the effect of combining high strength and stiffness MWCNTs and polyether polyol on the performance of epoxy systems. While CNTs helped in increasing the strength and stiffness, polyol helped in increasing the toughness of the composites. This in turn resulted in a system that had increased energy absorption capability, which was up to about 100%.     Broader Impacts  Tuskegee and Cornell faculty involved with the PREM program participated in a number of outreach activities over the grant period. Cornell faculty and graduate students participated in these activities providing useful hands-on ex...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
