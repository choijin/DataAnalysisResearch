<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0630614&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sediment samples isolated from the Ganges-Brahmaputra are comprised of a tremendous amount of refractory organic matter. Studies have shown that ca. 20% to 60% of the total organic carbon (OC) remains after a 400 hour oxidation with potassium dichromate and sulfuric acid. Operationally, this residue is known as black carbon (BC). However, operational definitions such as BC, graphitic BC, and kerogen comprise a broad range of carbon functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funds from this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, an investigator at Binghamton University will participate in an upcoming cruise to isolate suspended and surface sediments discharged into the Bay of Bengal during the latter part of the monsoon season in 2006. The cruise, set for July 27 to August 15, 2006, will present a unique opportunity to catch the pulse of sediments discharged from the Ganges-Brahmaputra River system into the Bay of Bengal during high flow. The chemical composition of the labile pool of carbon in each sample will be addressed by subjecting the sample to hydrolytic pyrolysis. Using hydrolytic pyrolysis to elucidate the composition of labile and refractory pools of organic carbon will be a particularly novel and exploratory venture. Isolating and analyzing sediments from the Bay of Bengal and comparing the hydrolytic pyrolysis signatures to that of sediments in the lower river previously isolated by the PI will provide important information about the fundamental mechanism(s) responsible for ocean carbon storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this project will involve multiple research collaborations between the principal investigator, other US scientists, and their Indian and Bangladeshi colleagues. Such international collaborations will expose Indian and Bangladeshi scientists to state-of-the art analytical techniques and promote a fruitful exchange of scientific information in future years.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
