<AbstractNarration>This award supports development of a compact, integrated system for continuous separation of fluid-borne materials such as macromolecules, nanoclusters, colloidal particles, cell fragments and entire living cells. The device is based on optical fractionation, a recently discovered strategy based on differing interactions with light to distinguish and sort specified subpopulations of particles - for example, cells of differing size - within heterogeneous samples (complex mixtures). The device uses arrays of optical traps to selectively deflect materials into microfluidic channels for collection and processing. The basic principle has been demonstrated on the laboratory scale.  The current grant will support (1) development of the technology into a less expensive and more compact, turn-key system, and (2) development of protocols for optically fractionating different classes of biomaterials.   The optical fractionation instrument offers continuous sample sorting and separation with an unprecedented combination of accuracy, generality, ease of use and cost-effectiveness. Consequently, it should find widespread applications in biological research, ranging from laboratory purification of both synthetic and natural biomolecules to new modes of cell cytometry.  In addition to development of the instrument, the project is expected to provide the basis for two doctoral theses and three undergraduate honors theses in biophysics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
