<AbstractNarration>In collaboration with four area school districts, the Boise State University Robert Noyce Scholar Program is graduating 27 certified highly qualified math and science teachers for employment in schools identified as at-risk. The project is supporting a total of 15 undergraduate and 12 graduate students. Recruitment activities include local industries and involve the Center for Multicultural and Educational Opportunities. A Program Coordination Council consisting of faculty from Education, Mathematics, Geosciences, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering meets regularly with Noyce Scholars to assess student academic progress, assist with challenging issues, and develop support strategies. The Noyce Scholars have enriched academic support through learning communities that meet frequently to discuss issues such as innovative pedagogical practices and new research in STEM disciplines.  Access to academic support from both faculty and peers is providing Noyce Scholars, especially those who are historically underrepresented in STEM fields, an increased opportunity for success. Historically, factors that have negatively affected retention or successful program completion by students pursuing math or science education include financial limitations and a lack of connection to the university and advisors.  The Noyce Scholars receive financial support through scholarships or fellowships and mentoring support from faculty and peers, resulting in increased access to key faculty and the university support system. As first year educators, the Noyce Scholars obtain support from faculty and peers through an online networking system. Faculty advisors also mentor the new teachers during the first academic teaching year. After the first year of teaching, Noyce graduates continue to receive faculty support and access to the online networking system developed specifically for Noyce Scholars. An evaluation plan utilizes both qualitative and quantitative methodologies and includes an external assessment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
