<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Materials Science (57)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasingly diverse skill set required of materials scientists and engineers presents a formidable challenge for educators as they must impart a broad knowledge base within the span of an undergraduate experience.  By increasing the computational content and the use of information technology throughout the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) undergraduate curriculum, this project team is devising a more effective instructional process and improving the preparedness of materials engineers and scientists.  The approach involves: (i) using computation to enhance the cognitive process; (ii) strengthening the mathematical and computational proficiency of MSE students; and (iii) using computer-based instruction to accelerate information transfer.  In this proof-of-concept project, the core MSE course of thermodynamics of materials is targeted.  A team consisting of a Ph.D. student pursuing computational materials research, the course instructor, and an experienced evaluator from the institution's Center for Research in Learning and Teaching are developing and implementing computational learning modules designed to enhance student learning by (i) visually presenting fundamental concepts in MSE; (ii) actively engaging students in computer-based experimentation; and (iii) focusing student attention on algorithmic thinking and concepts in scientific computation.  The impact and effectiveness of these new techniques are measured through qualitative and quantitative evaluation, including feedback from quizzes, surveys and interviews.</AbstractNarration>
