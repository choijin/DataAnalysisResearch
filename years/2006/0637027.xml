<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL #: 0637027&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Carmen Latterell&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Minnesota Duluth&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: GK-12: Graduate Fellows in Science and Mathematics Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Graduate Fellows in Science and Mathematics Education, a GK-12 project between the University of Minnesota Duluth and four K-12 schools, focuses on defining the needs and limitations for improving STEM teaching and on creating innovative instruction for students using inquiry-based learning processes in mathematics, biology and geology.  Project activities include a summer workshop, a seminar series, as well as ongoing communication using ePortfolio and WebCT.  The intellectual merit of this project for fellows include 1) learning inquiry-based pedagogy to teach STEM knowledge and skills, 2) an appreciation of the challenges, rewards and needs of K-12 education, 3) developing and sharing effective methods of scientific communication to a non-technical audience and 4) becoming effective and critically reflective teachers of STEM.  K-12 teachers will 1) strengthen their STEM and technical knowledge 2) engage students in authentic science and math inquiry-based learning, 3) gain resources/equipment for authentic learning, 4) enhance their repertoire of teaching through mentoring the fellows, and 5) develop partnerships with the University faculty and graduate fellows.  The K-12 students will 1) learn about scientific and mathematics inquiry, 2) gain proficiency, confidence and interest in science and mathematics, and 3) be aware of the career choices for scientists and mathematicians.  This project includes efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented groups such as Native Americans.  Participants of the project will disseminate information and experiences with colleagues locally, regionally and nationally.  A strong working partnership will be developed between the University faculty, K-12 teachers, students and parents.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
