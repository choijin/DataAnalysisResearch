<AbstractNarration>The impact of particle beam, or accelerator science is extremely broad. Indeed, advances in many branches of science such as the material sciences, nuclear science, elementary particle science, to name but a few, are paced by advances in accelerator science and technology. The science of particle beams is rich and challenging. &lt;br/&gt;Particle beams can be considered as many body systems with specified distributions, exhibiting many collective instabilities and self-organizing phenomena when interacting with electromagnetic fields and plasmas. Studies of these transitions from one non-equilibrium state to another, has progressed rapidly in recent years, but much remains to be done. &lt;br/&gt;Much of the work in these areas has come to reside in the DOE National Laboratories. There is growing realization that universities have a unique and important role to play and that enhancing the university role will result in significant advances in accelerator science and development and in their broad impact on other sciences. In this proposal, important "physics of beams" research is proposed by a university group, using state-of-the-art equipment and diagnostics. This research has the potential of discovering new, useful, and exciting phenomena.</AbstractNarration>
