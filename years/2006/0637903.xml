<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will focus on studying the chemistry and properties of a novel polymeric nano-layer coating, which is very rich in hydroxyl groups and made out of interwoven mono-dimensional strands which are chemically bound to the surface and occasionally to each other. The properties of this layer can be modified by modifying the properties of certain sub-units of the monomer. Correlations will be developed between the chemical structure of the layer, the strength of its adhesion to the surface and its ability to retard the freezing of small droplets of water on the coated surface. In Phase II the performance of the nano layer as a retardant for ice formation will be studied in dynamic situation in an ice tunnel. When successfully developed, this technology will be useful for reducing or retarding the formation of ice on aircraft. Ice formation on aircraft has been the cause of multiple fatal accidents and loss of property and life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Additionally, the economic cost of icing of aircraft includes increased fuel consumption, pilot time, airports closures and delays and thus increased burden on the ailing air transportation and commerce industries. It is expected that successful application of this technology will retard ice formation and thus improve aviation safety and reduce the costs associated with icing.</AbstractNarration>
