<AbstractNarration>A wide variety of problems of multiplicative number theory will be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;The problem of gaps between sums of two squares will be tackled in a new way,&lt;br/&gt;which if successful could be developed into a major new tool for the study of&lt;br/&gt;the coefficients of automorphic functions in short intervals.  Sieve methods&lt;br/&gt;will be studied not by {\it ad hoc} choices of sifting functions but rather by&lt;br/&gt;allowing the sieve to reveal where its extremal configurations lie.  The goal is&lt;br/&gt;to determine, in all dimensions, the optimal upper and lower bounds.  The local&lt;br/&gt;distribution of zeros of the zeta function will be studied by locating optimal&lt;br/&gt;kernels to use in conjunction with pair correlation information.   &lt;br/&gt;Statistics relating to the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions as&lt;br/&gt;one averages over different arithmetic progressions will be determined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For several decades, Hardy and Littlewood maintained a list of research&lt;br/&gt;problems.  Among the problems remaining on their final list is to&lt;br/&gt;derive a better upper bound for the gap between numbers that can be expressed&lt;br/&gt;as a sum of two squares.  Here better means simply better than the trivial&lt;br/&gt;bound one obtains by the greedy algorithm.  This problem is to be attacked&lt;br/&gt;in a new way, and if the approach is successful, then the method may apply&lt;br/&gt;in greater generality.  As was pointed out by Selberg, the problem of sieving efficiently is&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally a problem of linear programming.  Existing sieves are&lt;br/&gt;somewhat ad hoc, and in most cases the bound obtained is either not&lt;br/&gt;optimal or at least not known to be optimal.  It is proposed to&lt;br/&gt;emphasize the linear programming aspect of the problem, and to identify&lt;br/&gt;extremals, for both the primal and the dual problems.  This is to be&lt;br/&gt;done first in the simplest of situations, and then in successively more&lt;br/&gt;challenging ones, so that eventually one will be able to identify&lt;br/&gt;extremals in realistic problems of great interest.</AbstractNarration>
