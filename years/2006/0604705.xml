<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0604705&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Alexander Givental&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gromov -- Witten invariants characterize global properties of&lt;br/&gt;phase spaces in Hamiltonian mechanics. It is our understanding&lt;br/&gt;that Gromov--Witten theory has entered a very productive period&lt;br/&gt;of its development. It is about to become a part of a more&lt;br/&gt;general framework based on ideas of conformal field theory.  Many&lt;br/&gt;key outstanding problems of the theory such as, e.g. Virasoro&lt;br/&gt;conjecture, or Witten's W_n-gravity conjecture are likely to&lt;br/&gt;get either resolved on the basis of this framework or at least&lt;br/&gt;advanced to a substantial degree.  Respectively, we are planning&lt;br/&gt;to continue our study of GW-invariants, their axiomatic&lt;br/&gt;structure, their generalizations, their relationships with&lt;br/&gt;integrable systems and symplectic field theory, methods of their&lt;br/&gt;computation including those associated with the mirror&lt;br/&gt;conjecture, and try to utilize the advantages that may come from&lt;br/&gt;conformal field theory.  A particular problem that gave the&lt;br/&gt;proposal its name is a long-standing conjecture about the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of Gromov-Witten invariants under symplectic reduction&lt;br/&gt;of target spaces by circle actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a more general prospective, problems we deal with in our&lt;br/&gt;research lie on the crossroad of two major pathways in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics of the last two centuries. One of them is the&lt;br/&gt;in-depth pursuit of the intricate properties of algebraic curves&lt;br/&gt;--- in the form inherited from works of Gauss, Abel, Jacobi,&lt;br/&gt;Riemann, Klein and Poincare. The other is the broad conceptual&lt;br/&gt;landscaping of mathematical physics dictated by the progress of&lt;br/&gt;classical and quantum mechanics and often associated with the&lt;br/&gt;names of Hamilton, Maxwell, Gibbs, Poincare, Hilbert, Einstein&lt;br/&gt;and Weyl.  It is string theory that in the search for the&lt;br/&gt;ultimate laws of nature places algebraic curves in the center of&lt;br/&gt;the modern landscape of fundamental physics, and generates new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical questions and points out plausible answers with an&lt;br/&gt;amazing pace and persistence.  Some of the problems we work on&lt;br/&gt;are motivated by such questions, some others hopefully provide&lt;br/&gt;the answers that string theory did not really anticipate.&lt;br/&gt;          &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
