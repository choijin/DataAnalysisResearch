<AbstractNarration>Engineering - 99&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing approximately 30 scholarships per semester to low income students in the College of Engineering and Computer Science which is providing the students with the funds to pay their tuition, fees and assisting with textbook costs.  Supplementing the financial support, the program is providing a holistic model of student support including guidance, mentoring, peer networking, financial assistance, and professional development, helping to ensure student academic success.  The program is also improving retention, shortening the time to graduation and providing increased access to professional level career opportunities after degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College is collaborating with the Cooperative Education Office, assisting students in obtaining paid job placement with an employer in the student's field of study, as well as providing a series of professional development workshops for the students, improving their professional skills.  The project is targeting its efforts to increase the number of women enrolled in the College.</AbstractNarration>
