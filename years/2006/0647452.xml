<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology, or CBEN, discovers and develops nanoparticles that enable new medical and environmental technologies. This mission is inspired by the unique ways that nanomaterials interact with and control biological systems. Located at Rice University, CBEN engages in collaborative, interdisciplinary research activities with over twenty participants from diverse departments. Its participants work to understand the wet/dry interface between nanomaterials, complex aqueous systems, and ultimately, the environment. This knowledge supports biological and environmental engineering efforts to integrate nanomaterials into systems that solve outstanding social problems. Our center-wide programs develop the technical workforce of the future, ensure efficient transfer of CBEN research into the marketplace, and communicate the implications of CBEN research to policymakers and media professionals.  The intellectual merits of our activities are illustrated by our diverse research accomplishments which have resulted in over 400 peer-reviewed papers to date, many of which have appeared in high impact journals such as Science and Nature Nanotechnology. Some highlights from our work include the application of immunotargeted nanoshells for improved cancer cell imaging in vitro (Drezek, West, Colvin, Hafner); the development of a method for stabilizing iron oxide and cadmium selenide nanoparticles in water (Colvin), the expansion of a pilot project to test nanomagnetite, fullerenes and nano-titania at a water treatment plant in Guanajuato, Mexico (Alvarez, Colvin, Li, Lou, Tomson) and the launch of an online repository of practices for handling nanomaterials safely. (Kulinowski).  The broader impacts of CBEN programs are substantial. This reporting year, 40 graduate and 8 undergraduate students have been involved in CBEN research. We achieved enrollments of 109 undergraduate and 164 graduate students in CBEN related courses for the 2011-2012 school year. To promote scientific literacy, educate about scientific career opportunities and serve under-resourced schools, we offer a summer Nanochemistry Academy in partnership with Project GRAD, by a corporate sponsor.
