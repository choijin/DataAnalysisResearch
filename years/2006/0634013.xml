<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  In this project, the investigators will examine existing &lt;br/&gt;indices for representing the results of regression analyses for meta-analysis, &lt;br/&gt;and will develop new methods for synthesizing results from regression analyses.  &lt;br/&gt;Currently, meta-analytic studies often omit regression results due to the &lt;br/&gt;difficulty in comparing results across different models.  The investigators will &lt;br/&gt;consider the appropriate standard errors for these study indices, which are &lt;br/&gt;fundamental to most combinations of study results. In addition, they will &lt;br/&gt;determine whether existing indices can be used to represent results of related &lt;br/&gt;analyses such as structural equation models and hierarchical linear models &lt;br/&gt;(HLMs), and will propose new indices if needed. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Several special cases will be considered in the research. In particular, results &lt;br/&gt;meant to represent group differences (i.e., slopes for dummy variables) will be &lt;br/&gt;considered, including cases where regression models contain several dummy &lt;br/&gt;variables to represent factors with multiple levels (e.g., two treatment groups &lt;br/&gt;and a common control group). Because meta-analysts also often wish to summarize &lt;br/&gt;across studies with different designs (e.g., HLM studies with regression &lt;br/&gt;studies), the proposed research will outline the conditions under which such &lt;br/&gt;cross-design combinations are reasonable.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  This study will have broad impacts on syntheses of research in &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and science education, and in many other areas (e.g., economics, &lt;br/&gt;political science) where regression models and other forms of the linear model &lt;br/&gt;are common. The methods provided by this research will enable reviewers to &lt;br/&gt;include regression results in meta-analyses together with simpler indices (e.g., &lt;br/&gt;correlations, standardized mean differences).  Special attention will be paid to &lt;br/&gt;synthesis work where subpopulation comparisons (such as within and across &lt;br/&gt;underserved group differences) are particularly important.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
