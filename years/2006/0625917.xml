<AbstractNarration>The underlying assumption behind currently available sparse direct&lt;br/&gt;solvers, namely that an individual solve in isolation should take&lt;br/&gt;minimal time, does not represent an optimal solution in the setting of&lt;br/&gt;an adaptive finite element method.  There, intermediate results, in&lt;br/&gt;the form of a factorization, from the solution of a current refinement&lt;br/&gt;can be updated when a local refinement occurs.  Two innovations&lt;br/&gt;underlie the project: an interface that allows applications to pass&lt;br/&gt;information about refinement to the direct solver library and a data&lt;br/&gt;structure, the Unassembled HyperMatrix, that allows sparse matrices&lt;br/&gt;and their factorization to be stored in an unassembled format that&lt;br/&gt;facilitates the updating of the matrix and its factorization.  In&lt;br/&gt;other words, this research is based on the ideas of inheriting the&lt;br/&gt;elimination tree from the refinement history of the domain and storing&lt;br/&gt;element matrices unassembled on all levels, assembling them only when&lt;br/&gt;necessary for the factorization. Since the resulting solver functions&lt;br/&gt;fully in terms of element matrices, dense submatrices are naturally&lt;br/&gt;exposed as part of the factorization which will allow high-performance&lt;br/&gt;kernels like the level-3 BLAS to be fully exploited.&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the research includes the design of an API that optimally integrates the&lt;br/&gt;solver into applications, the development of the Unassembled&lt;br/&gt;HyperMatrix infrastructure, and an investigation of stability and&lt;br/&gt;complexity, in particular the design of pivoting strategies for the&lt;br/&gt;indefinite case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational simulation has joined the two traditional methods in&lt;br/&gt;science, theory and experiment, as an equal partner.  For many&lt;br/&gt;applications, ranging from the similation of vibration in an&lt;br/&gt;automobile to the computation of the radar signature an airplane on&lt;br/&gt;radar, finite element methods are the computational method of choice.&lt;br/&gt;The best of these methods use adaptive approximations to balance&lt;br/&gt;accuracy against the time required for the solution.  Invariably, most&lt;br/&gt;time is spent in the solution of a system of linear equations.  It is&lt;br/&gt;the reduction of this solution time, in the specific setting of an&lt;br/&gt;adaptive application, that is the focus of this&lt;br/&gt;research.  The innovation that is the basis of this project consists&lt;br/&gt;in storing the linear system in a new format, the Unassembled&lt;br/&gt;HyperMatrix, that allows much of a past computation to be reused when&lt;br/&gt;an adaptation occurs.  Hand in hand with this theoretical innovation&lt;br/&gt;goes the development of an interface that allows an application to&lt;br/&gt;express adaptation to the solver library.  The new approach has the&lt;br/&gt;potential for reducing the cost of a solution related to an adaptation&lt;br/&gt;substantially.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
