<AbstractNarration>Nelson&lt;br/&gt;0639433&lt;br/&gt;Drought is a normal part of climate for virtually all regions of the United States. Recent droughts have&lt;br/&gt;highlighted the increasing vulnerability of all regions to drought-induced water shortages. Climate change&lt;br/&gt;and potential increases in the frequency, severity, and duration of drought episodes is further exacerbating&lt;br/&gt;water management issues and conflicts among users. With mounting pressure on finite water supplies from&lt;br/&gt;expanding and shifting population, urbanization, environmental degradation, and many other factors, it is&lt;br/&gt;imperative for the United States to consider a paradigm shift to a risk-based approach to drought&lt;br/&gt;management.&lt;br/&gt;Managing Drought and Water Scarcity in Vulnerable Environments: Creating the Roadmap for Change in&lt;br/&gt;the United States is the first national level meeting concerned with both the science and the policy of&lt;br/&gt;drought management that involves stakeholders from many disciplines and perspectives and that is&lt;br/&gt;convened for the purpose of creating a science- and policy-based briefing document. The goals of the&lt;br/&gt;meeting are to create an integrated, interactive forum for understanding and improving our management of&lt;br/&gt;drought and water scarcity in the United States, and to stimulate national debate through the publication&lt;br/&gt;and wide distribution of The Roadmap for Change, a science- and policy-based briefing document.&lt;br/&gt;The meeting, which is convened by the Geological Society of America and 22 meeting partners, is&lt;br/&gt;designed to promote collaboration between the policy and science communities. A variety of formats will&lt;br/&gt;encourage attendee participation: plenary and invited talks, panel discussions, interactive roundtables and&lt;br/&gt;breakout group discussions, and poster presentations of case studies and innovative research and outreach&lt;br/&gt;efforts. Invited speakers are among the best qualified in their respective disciplines, and represent a broad&lt;br/&gt;perspective on drought management. The key findings and recommendations of this meeting will be&lt;br/&gt;distributed in electronic format as The Roadmap for Change. This science- and policy-based briefing&lt;br/&gt;document will identify needed scientific research for a more reliable and usable technical basis for public&lt;br/&gt;policy decision-making, and identify successful, promising, and novel approaches to developing drought&lt;br/&gt;science-based policies and programs.&lt;br/&gt;It is important to have many perspectives represented, and many of the stakeholders will need financial&lt;br/&gt;assistance to travel to and attend the meeting. The purpose of this funding request is to provide travel and&lt;br/&gt;registration support to stakeholders who otherwise would not be able to attend, including underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;groups such as Native American and Hispanic people, and students. We will seek applications from these&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups through our web site and our network of contacts.&lt;br/&gt;What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;In the face of mounting pressure on finite water supplies, it is imperative for the United States to consider a&lt;br/&gt;paradigm shift to a risk-based approach to drought management. This meeting is unique in that it seeks the&lt;br/&gt;perspective of a range of stakeholders, including scientists, policy makers, and water users, to create a&lt;br/&gt;unique collaborative document, The Roadmap for Change. This science- and policy-based briefing&lt;br/&gt;document will identify the needed scientific research that can provide a more reliable and usable technical&lt;br/&gt;basis for public policy decision-making, and will identify successful, promising, and novel approaches to&lt;br/&gt;developing drought science-based policies and programs.&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative, interactive forum for understanding and improving our management of drought and&lt;br/&gt;water scarcity will serve as an example of a model for inclusive and integrated science and policy&lt;br/&gt;discussions. The Roadmap for Change will stimulate national debate on the challenges of drought and&lt;br/&gt;water scarcity in the United States, and will be useful in efforts to effect policy changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
