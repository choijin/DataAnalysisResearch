<AbstractNarration>     The investigator and his collaborators study the Smoluchowski&lt;br/&gt;equation arising in the kinetic molecular theory of nematic liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystalline polymers.  The intermolecular interaction of excluded&lt;br/&gt;volume effects, which is responsible for the isotropic-nematic&lt;br/&gt;phase transition, is modeled by a mean-field potential.  Both the&lt;br/&gt;Mayer-Saupe and the Onsager potentials are used.  The main purpose&lt;br/&gt;of the project is a rigorous study of the dynamics and rheological&lt;br/&gt;properties of such systems.  The problems to be addressed include&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation analysis of both the equilibrium and the shear flow&lt;br/&gt;case, and questions arising in the treatment of the equations by&lt;br/&gt;means of the classical theory of infinite dimensional systems. &lt;br/&gt;One of the central problems is the question of the existence of&lt;br/&gt;inertial manifolds on which the partial differential equation&lt;br/&gt;reduces to a finite system of ordinary differential equations, the&lt;br/&gt;so-called inertial form.  The starting point of the project is&lt;br/&gt;recent results in which the isotropic-nematic phase transition was&lt;br/&gt;resolved for the Smoluchowski equation using the Mayer-Saupe&lt;br/&gt;potential in the equilibrium case (no external flow), as well as&lt;br/&gt;the existence of absorbing balls (cones) in Gevrey spaces of&lt;br/&gt;analytic functions.  These questions remain open for the Onsager&lt;br/&gt;potential, and are addressed in the study.  In the absence of the&lt;br/&gt;flow, the Smoluchowski equation is a gradient system that&lt;br/&gt;preserves uniaxial symmetry, and as such it exhibits fairly simple&lt;br/&gt;dynamical behavior.  However, even a passive interaction with a&lt;br/&gt;symmetry-breaking shear flow introduces complicated dynamical&lt;br/&gt;features, such as different kinds of periodic solutions (tumbling,&lt;br/&gt;kayaking, log-rolling), and even chaos.  These are characteristic&lt;br/&gt;for intermediate shear rates.  At low and high shear rates flow&lt;br/&gt;aligning takes place.  A rigorous investigation of these dynamical&lt;br/&gt;features is conducted in the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The main goal of the project is a mathematical understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the transition that occurs in a class of polymeric materials&lt;br/&gt;containing anisotropic molecules known as mesogens to a so-called&lt;br/&gt;liquid crystal phase.  Due to their anisotropy, the molecules&lt;br/&gt;interact with each other, resulting in alignment.  This long-range&lt;br/&gt;orientational order resembles the one found in solid crystals,&lt;br/&gt;while, unlike solid crystals, the material retains fluidity due to&lt;br/&gt;the absence of the long-range positional order of molecules.  The&lt;br/&gt;transition to such a phase is induced by changes in the&lt;br/&gt;temperature and the concentration of the mesogens in the solution. &lt;br/&gt;The distribution of the molecules can be described by a partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equation known as the Smoluchowski equation, which is&lt;br/&gt;the main subject of this project.  It was already employed&lt;br/&gt;successfully to explain the transition to the liquid crystal phase&lt;br/&gt;under some very special conditions, with many unanswered questions&lt;br/&gt;still remaining.  The significance of these liquid crystalline&lt;br/&gt;polymers lies in the fact that crystal-like properties, combined&lt;br/&gt;with many of the useful and versatile properties of polymers, make&lt;br/&gt;these materials suitable for a wide range of important&lt;br/&gt;applications.  For example, liquid crystalline polymers are&lt;br/&gt;abundant in living systems such as DNA, polypeptides, and cell&lt;br/&gt;membranes.  Accordingly, they attract particular attention in the&lt;br/&gt;field of biomimetic chemistry.  An application of liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystalline polymers that has been successfully developed for&lt;br/&gt;industry is the area of high strength fibers.  Kevlar, which is&lt;br/&gt;used to make such things as helmets and bullet-proof vests, is&lt;br/&gt;just one example of the use of polymer liquid crystals in&lt;br/&gt;applications calling for strong, light-weight materials.  The&lt;br/&gt;optical properties of liquid crystalline polymers lead to&lt;br/&gt;applications in optical imaging and the display industry.  Liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystalline polymers can be used to coat drugs in the&lt;br/&gt;pharmaceutical industry.  However, as very complex materials,&lt;br/&gt;liquid crystalline polymers exhibit very complex behavior, and&lt;br/&gt;many of the actual and potential applications of these materials&lt;br/&gt;depend on multidisciplinary research.  A better mathematical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the process of aligning is essential for better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the behavior of liquid crystalline polymers. &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses some of the central questions regarding&lt;br/&gt;this process. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
