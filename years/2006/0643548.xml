<AbstractNarration>CBET-0643548  Papin     The main goal of this proposal is to increase our understanding of infectious disease processes by developing a multi-scale model of the human pathogen, Leishmaia major (L. major) based on the integration of intracellular networks. Through three specific aims, metabolic, regulatory and signaling networks will be reconstructed and integrated to develop a model linking genome-scale reconstructions of L. major and to tissue responses in host organisms.  The proposed research will form the basis of research projects for training students, for computational course development and the development of a web portal designed to facilitates systems analysis associated with the role of pathogenic organisms in infectious diseases. In the long term, this research will impact  the field of treatment of infectious diseases.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
