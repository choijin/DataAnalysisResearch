<AbstractNarration>0609570&lt;br/&gt;Moore&lt;br/&gt;The seasonal snowpack has a dominating role in physical, chemical, and biological&lt;br/&gt;processes occurring in most western North American watersheds. Snow is a natural water storage&lt;br/&gt;mechanism and is therefore the determinant of hydroelectric production, irrigation, and aquatic&lt;br/&gt;health. Snowmelt also triggers the growing season, and earlier snowmelt appears to initiate&lt;br/&gt;summer landscape drying, accentuating drought conditions and recently accelerating the&lt;br/&gt;frequency of major wildfire events. The inability of current methods to forecast (or even&lt;br/&gt;backcast) the temporal and spatial response of snow water dominated river basins to natural or&lt;br/&gt;human disturbances, including variations in climatic conditions, hinders our ability to fully&lt;br/&gt;understand and thus manage these watersheds. New approaches are needed to extrapolate snow&lt;br/&gt;water equivalent measurements over complex landscapes, model temporal and spatial basin&lt;br/&gt;water yields and predict ecologic and hydrologic response to local disturbance, regional climate&lt;br/&gt;change and extreme events. This project aims to understand fundamental relationships between&lt;br/&gt;climate change, snowpack, and runoff in the northern Rocky Mountains. The research approach&lt;br/&gt;presented is based on existing observations and theories about snow-dominated watersheds; both&lt;br/&gt;process-based research and hydrologic observatory design questions/hypotheses are posed. The&lt;br/&gt;research will use integrated physical and ecologic modeling to link three different hydrologic&lt;br/&gt;settings: 1) Paleo-Hydrology; 2) Historical to present hydrology, and; 3) Future Hydrology.&lt;br/&gt;The snow component of the work plan will emphasize estimating spatial variability of&lt;br/&gt;snowpack characteristics at the local to the regional length scale and developing a suite of&lt;br/&gt;time/space snowpack models, as input forcing to watershed models. Runoff trends will be&lt;br/&gt;analyzed with the goal of determining the amount of change and variability of the instrumental&lt;br/&gt;records. Runoff analysis will integrate snow data, automatic weather station data, and remote&lt;br/&gt;sensed data with field water quality data and runoff records to look at the continuum of processes&lt;br/&gt;releasing water from basins are several scales. Time and space scales of forcing/response will be&lt;br/&gt;elucidated using an integrated physical-ecologic model system (RHEESys). The model will be&lt;br/&gt;used to simulate watershed processes during the instrumental era, and past hydrologic and&lt;br/&gt;ecologic responses to known megadroughts, These modeling results will guide simulations of&lt;br/&gt;future change within this snow dominated watershed.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts from this project will be in three areas: formal education; informal&lt;br/&gt;education; and science experience for under-represented groups. University of Montana students&lt;br/&gt;will be involved in the research at the graduate to undergraduate levels and information from this&lt;br/&gt;work will be incorporated into numerous courses taught by the PIs. Because of the broad nature&lt;br/&gt;of this research it gives tremendous opportunity for teaching interdisciplinary concepts and tools&lt;br/&gt;in the formal university environment. In addition, the spectacular landscapes of the region draws&lt;br/&gt;at least two million tourists each year. We will reach this audience through presentations within&lt;br/&gt;Glacier National Park's public lecturing program, lectures to Park and other local educators and&lt;br/&gt;interpreters, and active participation with a regional science and management conference. We&lt;br/&gt;will also pursue a program to create and install interpretative display panels on climate change&lt;br/&gt;and the hydrologic cycle, from past mega-droughts to current and future changes. We will also&lt;br/&gt;expand our working relationship with both the Confederated Salish-Kootenai Tribe's hydrology&lt;br/&gt;program and tribal college. Tribal staff and student interns will be involved in field research and&lt;br/&gt;analyses. The long-term goal is to develop joint research on Tribal lands within the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
