<AbstractNarration>John Shareshian works on problems in algebraic, topological and&lt;br/&gt;enumerative combinatorics that have close connections with other areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.  Alone, in joint work with Michelle Wachs and in additional&lt;br/&gt;joint work with Philip Hanlon and Patricia Hersh, he studies group actions&lt;br/&gt;on homology of order complexes of various partially ordered sets, with&lt;br/&gt;applications to permutation enumeration and representation theory of&lt;br/&gt;symmetric groups and finite groups of Lie type.  In joint work with David&lt;br/&gt;Wright, he studies certain vector spaces with bases indexed by finite&lt;br/&gt;trees, which arise in the study of the Jacobian Conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports work in the area of combinatorics.  Roughly,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics is the study of discrete, usually finite, mathematical&lt;br/&gt;objects.  Combinatorial problems arise naturally in various scientific&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, including biology, computer science and electrical&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and in most areas of pure mathematics.  Most of the work&lt;br/&gt;specifically supported by this grant involves the study of symmetries of&lt;br/&gt;partially ordered sets.  A partially ordered set is a set in which some&lt;br/&gt;(but not necessarily all) pairs a,b of elements are related in a manner&lt;br/&gt;that mimics the relation a&lt;b on the set of real numbers.  (For example,&lt;br/&gt;if a,b are related and b,c are related then a,c must be related.)  A&lt;br/&gt;symmetry of a partially ordered set is a rearrangement of the set which&lt;br/&gt;sends related pairs to related pairs.  (For example, if we take the set of&lt;br/&gt;all real numbers with the usual &lt; relation, then the rearrangement&lt;br/&gt;obtained by sending each number x to x+1 is a symmetry, while the&lt;br/&gt;rearrangement obtained by sending x to -x is not.)  Partially&lt;br/&gt;ordered sets and their symmetries are of interest to mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;working in several areas of pure mathematics, including topology and&lt;br/&gt;algebra.  They have been used to attack difficult problems in theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
