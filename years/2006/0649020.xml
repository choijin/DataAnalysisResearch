<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title:  SGER:  Catalytic Oxygen Activation and Substrate-selectivity in Water via Novel Metallolipids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CTS-0649020&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:   Juan C. Noveron&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   University of Texas at El Paso&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would develop an innovative strategy for mimicking the functional activity and chemoselectivity of Cu-dioxygenases using metallolipid complexes in water.  The self-assembly of the metal complexes into lyotropic nanoscale phases in water will be exploited since phase transitions can be triggered by chemical and physical changes.  The project is high risk and exploratory because of the ability of the compounds to function in water.  The researchers will explore the ability to control the molecular environment beyond the first coordination sphere of the transition metals and the ability to pre-program transitions that allow for the separation of the catalysts from the products.  A cutting-edge approach will be used to guide the catalyst design through EXAFS characterization.  The scientific impact of the research could potentially be very high since a new strategy for substrate selectivity will be explored through the encapsulation of catalytic function within a molecular environment that could control substrate access based on partition coefficient properties.  The project also is high risk because dioxygen activation with Cu synthetic models has only been studied in organic media and at low temperatures.  Preliminary evidence regarding the microenvironment of metallolipids in water is promising, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader technological impact of the research could be significant, especially in the pharmaceutical area.  In terms of other broader impacts, the research will be conducted at an institution with a large number of students from under-represented groups including Mexican-Americans and Native Americans from the Southwest.  The principal investigator has also developed a unique media resource that presents the research story and the context behind the project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
