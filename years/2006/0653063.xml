<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is increasing the numbers of STEM graduates by developing innovative curricular, recruiting and mentoring strategies.  A unique focus of the project is on increasing the numbers of Native American STEM majors.  The project is identifying Native American students and involving them in research while they are in high school; mentoring and preparing the participants for their freshman year through a summer bridge program; providing a complete tuition waiver, mentoring and a support network through the student's undergraduate experience; and involving the participants in active and dynamic summer undergraduate research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is also refining an existing environmental science minor into a major field of study.  Faculty are developing new courses that are being team taught and focusing on interdisciplinary approaches to environmental studies.  Several of the courses are focusing on the institution's existing sustainability efforts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) STEP Program was funded in September 2007 as an Initiative to encourage the participation of Native Americans in the sciences as well as to build an Environmental Science major and strenghten STEM education at UMM. The first graduation under the grant was May 2008 and the first summer research program began in June 2008. Since the beginning of the program, the number of UMM science majors has increased from 397 to 680 by the fall of 2013 and the number of graduates increased from 71 in 2009 to 102 in 2013.  STEP initiative #1 - Environmental Science Major  The University of Minnesota Regents approved the Environmental Science major in October 2008. In fall 2009, the first "official semester" of the Environmental Science major, 16 students enrolled. The number of Environmental Science majors is now 58 &ndash; 34 are female, 24 are male, 15 are Native American and four are Asian. Eight students have graduated with a B.A. in Environmental Sciences (three female and five males); of the projected seven Environmental Sciences graduates for 2014 &ndash; four are female, three are male and three are Native American.  This new major draws predominantly from existing UMM courses, but some new courses have also been developed. These include: ESci 1131 &ndash; Renewable Energy with Biomass Gasification; ESci 3111 &ndash; The Evolution of the Minnesota Prairie; ESci 2200 &ndash; Environmental Challenges of the Italian Alps; ESci 3301 &ndash; Chemistry of Sustainable Energy; ESci 3401 &ndash; Polymer Chemistry and the Environment; ESci 4901 &ndash; Environmental Science Senior Seminar; Phys 2001 &ndash; Energy in the Environment; and Phys 2301 &ndash; Atmospheric Physics.  STEP initiative #2 - Encouraging Native Americans in Science  Efforts to increase participation of Native Americans in the sciences have also been successful. UMM Institutional Research metrics indicate the number of Native American STEM majors has increased from 33 in Fall 2007 to 94 in Fall 2013 (with a peak of 101 in fall 2012). The anticipated number of Native American Science graduates in 2014 is 14, significantly up from three in 2007.  The activities in support of the UMM STEP program involved: 1) active recruiting; 2) engagement in summer research; 3) continued mentoring beyond summer research; and 4) a summer program for Native American high school students.  Recruiting: Early recruiting efforts of the UMM STEP program were successful. The UMM Admissions staff has worked with the UMM STEP program to recruit Native American students; The P.I. telephoned uncommitted Native American "admits" with an interest in STEM fields and made visits to Pine Ridge, SD, Oglala, SD, Porcupine, SD, and Fond Du Lac Tribal Community College (MN). As a result of these efforts, we have seen an increase in freshman Native American Science majors from seven freshman science majors in 2007 to 36 freshman science majors in 2013.  Summer Research: The STEP summer research program funded 40 projects by 27 students. Projects included research in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Environmental Science and Psychology. The UMM STEP summer research projects have yielded both impressive research results (28 abstracts co-authored by STEP participants and presented at national meetings) and positive mentoring relationships between student participants and faculty mentors.  Wind-STEP program: The UMM Wind-STEP program is a two-week residential program for rising Native American high school juniors and seniors who are interested in STEM careers. Developed in 2010, the focus of Wind-STEP is wind energy and its application to the needs and wants of reservation communities. Participants learn about opportunities for careers in the sciences, discuss science ethics and interact with Native American college STEM majors. For the capstone project, Wind-STEP participants complete research using GIS to identify a potential site for a wind turbine on a nea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
