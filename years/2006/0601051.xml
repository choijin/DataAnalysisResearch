<AbstractNarration>Suslin proposes to investigate topics in motivic cohomology theory. These &lt;br/&gt;topics are of principal importance for the development of the cohomology &lt;br/&gt;theory of schemes and each has seen progress during the recent years in &lt;br/&gt;the works of Suslin and his collaborators. Firstly Suslin plans to eliminate the perfectness &lt;br/&gt;assumption in the basic requirements of motivic cohomology theory and to &lt;br/&gt;define the corresponding tensor triangulated category of motivic complexes over &lt;br/&gt;arbitrary fields. The second topic is an attempt to get a new and clearer &lt;br/&gt;proof of the main duality theorem which would work for schemes over &lt;br/&gt;arbitrary fields (and not only over fields of characteristic zero as the current proof &lt;br/&gt;does). Next Suslin plans jointly with A. Merkurjev to generalize the previous &lt;br/&gt;computation of the motivic cohomology of Severi-Brauer varieties to the case of generic &lt;br/&gt;splitting fields of higher symbols. Probably the most interesting and &lt;br/&gt;important part of the grant proposal is an attempt to compare the &lt;br/&gt;algebraic cobordism theory developed by Morel and Levin with the algebraic &lt;br/&gt;part of the cohomology theory constructed by Voevodsky. Here the plan is &lt;br/&gt;to use the machinery of framed sheaves developed by Voevodsky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of mathematics is to provide an accurate picture to the &lt;br/&gt;physical world or at least an appropriate approximation of that picture.&lt;br/&gt;From this point of view algebraic varieties are of principal importance,&lt;br/&gt;first they are relatively easy to understand since they are just defined &lt;br/&gt;by polynomial equations, next they usually give a rather accurate &lt;br/&gt;approximation to other shapes, most importantly they do appear naturally in quite a lot &lt;br/&gt;of subjects from theoretical physics to coding theory. That's why &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry - the theory of algebraic varieties is so important for &lt;br/&gt;the development and applications of mathematics. This project is devoted &lt;br/&gt;to the study of certain fundamental problems of motivic cohomology theory &lt;br/&gt;- a relatively new and very quickly developing branch of algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry. Geometry is blended with algebra and topology in this part of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, ideas and methods to be used come equally from all these &lt;br/&gt;directions. As part of the broader impact of this grant proposal let me &lt;br/&gt;point out that I intend to involve graduate students into the work over &lt;br/&gt;some parts of this grant proposal thus allowing them to get into a fast &lt;br/&gt;developing and quite important field of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
