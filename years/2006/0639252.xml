<AbstractNarration>The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment argued that biodiversity loss matters because it compromises the 'ecosystem services' on which human life depends at many different scales. The international biodiversity research program, Diversitas, explores the science behind the linkages between biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. BESTNet will bring the insights from this work to young researchers in the US through two research-training activities. First, research training workshops will address topics under discussion in Diversitas, including the valuation of ecosystem services, health and biodiversity loss, biodiversity information and community-based use of natural resources, and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Second, doctoral students will be funded to spend time in the labs of participating scientists in the US and abroad.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BESTNet will also make a wider contribution to the development of sustainability science and policy. It will (a) develop an interdisciplinary community committed to policy-relevant research into the links between biodiversity change and human activities; (b) enhance the capacity to undertake interdisciplinary research within existing life and social science departments in US universities; (c) synthesize research results on the local consequences of international biodiversity change; and (d) disseminate these results to decision-makers. In addition, it is expected that the network will substantially strengthen US scientific input into the global-change programs and other international initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last six years the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Training Network (BESTNet) has brought together 161 established and younger scientists in workshops focused on different aspects of the relationship between biodiversity change and ecosystem services.  The network was formed with three main objectives:  1) to support collaborative interdisciplinary research on the impact of anthropogenic biodiversity change on human wellbeing, 2) to engage younger researchers working on the problem and to expose them to ideas and methods of analysis being developed by the leaders in the field, and 3) to support the role of science in policy formation at multiple levels.  Collaborative interdisciplinary research on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services: Of the several problems addressed in BESTNet workshops, most have involved researchers from a number of disciplines.  Two problems have attracted special attention.   One is the relation between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and the production of ecosystem services (the benefits ecosystems provide to people). Results are reported in the volume Naeem, S., Bunker, D., Hector, A., Loreau, M. &amp; Perrings, C. (eds) (2009) Biodiversity, Ecosystem Functioning, and Human Wellbeing: An Ecological and Economic Perspective, Oxford University Press, and a number of synthesis papers including a highly cited paper in Nature: Cardinale, B.J. et al. (2012) Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity. Nature, 486, 59-67.   The other is the effect of the dispersal of pests and pathogens through trade and travel.  This includes both the problems of invasive species, and emerging infectious diseases.  Results are reported in the volume Perrings, C., Mooney, H.A. &amp; Williamson, M.H. (eds) (2010) Bioinvasions and globalization: ecology, economics, management, and policy, Oxford University Press, Oxford, and numerous scientific papers. Our work has shown how human behavior affects both the benefits and costs of changes in species richness and abundance. It has also shown when behavior has unanticipated negative consequences for human wellbeing, and what solutions are available to us.  Research training: A primary goal of BESTNet has been to expose younger researchers to the theory and methodology being developed by people working in the field.  Since the study of ecosystem services is necessarily interdisciplinary, workshop faculty have been drawn from several different disciplines. Workshops have also focused on different ecosystem types including dry and moist tropical forest systems (led by Rodolfo Dirzo, Stanford), freshwater (led by Robert Naiman, Washington), and agro-ecological systems (led by Louise Jackson, UC Davis).  The best measure of success of any training program is the performance of trainees.  Many former BESTNet Fellows are currently publishing in the field, and some played multiple roles in the collaborative research network.  One, for example, first participated in BESTNet as a finishing doctoral student, was later instrumental in establishing a working group at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological (NIMBioS), led a number of successful collaborative scientific papers on human behavior and infectious diseases, and was a Faculty member at the final BESTNet workshop. BESTNet has also made a point of encouraging diversity amongst Fellows. It has offered training to Fellows drawn from a number of countries, and from a number of minority groups within the USA.    The role of science in policy:  BESTNet has been associated, since inception, with the international program of biodiversity science, DIVERSITAS, and has supported DIVERSITAS efforts to enhance the role of science in international policy. During the life of the project, a proposal from the former President of France, Jacques Chirac, to develop an international body for biodiversity change that would parallel the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was brought to fruition. The new Intergovernmental...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
