<AbstractNarration>The Information Technology in Science Center for Teaching and Learning (ITS) at Texas A&amp;M University and The Center for Innovative Learning and Assessment Technologies (CILAT) at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette will develop five web-based modules for middle school science that engage students in student-directed inquiry and provide teachers with professional development in facilitating this inquiry.  These modules will immerse students in virtual environments for learning (VELs) where they will take on the role of scientists engaged in a complex task.  The virtual settings presented in the VELs will support students in designing and carrying out their own investigations.  Like scientists, students will identify questions, design and conduct scientific investigations, use virtual versions of the tools to gather and analyze data, develop products in which they use evidence to support their reasoning and collaborate with peers to analyze alternative arguments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each module will address the National Science Education Standards for grades 5-8 and will integrate grade-appropriate mathematical skills.  Each VEL will be designed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a scientist, a science educator, a district-based science curriculum specialist and an instructional designer.   Field tests will occur during the 2nd through 4th years progressively from grade 6 through 8.   At least 200 students and 15 teachers will be in the sample and an equivalent comparison population will be used.  Ultimately, the project will produce findings related to design features, protocols, professional development and instruction that supports achievement for all students and decreases the differences in achievement.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
