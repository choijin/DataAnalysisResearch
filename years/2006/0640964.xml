<AbstractNarration> Intellectual Merit.  &lt;br/&gt; The objective of this CAREER proposal is to array electrowetting microprisms and create a form of flat electro-optics that has not existed before.  Electrowetting microprisms voltage-modulate the contact angle between a saline liquid and a dielectric.  This contact angle modulation can then be used to reconfigure the saline meniscus geometry and consequently the refraction of light.  Specific research aims include: (1) silicon-integrate and stabilize long-channel devices; (2) array multiple devices into agile Fresnel optics and phase-continuous flat optics; (3) create novel AC drive schemes and feedback controls to increase accuracy.  Leading intellectual issues include: (a) enabling flat electrowetting optics via a breakthrough in cylindrical meniscus stabilization; (b) creating the first electro-optical 2p-phase profile without need for multi-electrode step-indexing; (c) developing advanced controls for accurate multiplexing of numerous electrowetting devices; (d) demonstrating new optical tools for investigating microscopic electrowetting non-idealities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  &lt;br/&gt; The educational aims are: (1) amplify 3 months of NSF-supported sophomore research experience into 18 months of co-op research experience at one of four industrial research partners; (2) elevate the K-college educational experience by creating a highly-visible resource center for electrowetting education/science.  &lt;br/&gt; Preliminary experiments support projections that electrowetting microprisms will provide performance leaps over liquid-crystal phased-arrays in the categories of steering angle (10X, &gt;30), transmission efficiency at all polarizations (2X, &gt;80%), and switching speed (100X, &gt;10 kHz).  These attributes are highly desired for applications such as beam steering for laser radar.  Broader impacts include electrowetting microprisms as an enabler for networked solar-lighting and for agile endoscopy.  The improved understanding provided by this project will allow the PI to expand electrowetting into projects such as switchable photonic crystals and ultra-accurate liquid sampling for lab-on-chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit.  This CAREER proposal achieved arraying of electrowetting microprisms and other electrowetting/electrofluidic optical devices to create several forms of flat electro-optics that had not existed before.  The project resulted in new ways to steer laser beams, sunlight, or other light sources using not mechanical means, but something purely electrical and as thin as a sheet of glass.  In addition, several powerful new display technologies, such as electrofluidic displays for e-readers emerged out of this work.  The project also advanced the materials knowledge in electrowetting devices in general, providing the most reliable low-voltage results to date, and key insights into the materials invariance of contact angle saturation.  This highly-successful CAREER project launched the PI into a level of international visibility in the field of electrowetting, flat-optics, and reflective display technology, and can be directly attributed in one way or another to &gt;$10M in follow-on funding. Broader Impact. The project was utilized to support several NSF-supported sophomore research experiences which then resulted in internships at corporate partners.  Half of the supported undergraduates also decided to go onto graduate school.  The project was also utilized to create a new educational module as part of an undergraduate laboratory.  This work inspired several other research groups to start work in electrowetting prisms, such as groups at the Univ. of North Texas, at Raytheon, at a University in Taiwan, at a University Japan, and at a company in Germany.
