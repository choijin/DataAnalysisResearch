<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Improving Network Operations with a View From the Edge&lt;br/&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kaleidoscope project is developing techniques, tools, and systems to&lt;br/&gt;facilitate network operations---a class of tasks that includes&lt;br/&gt;monitoring network conditions, detecting actionable problems, and taking&lt;br/&gt;steps to remediate them.  We focus on two areas of network operations:&lt;br/&gt;(1) network security (specifically, unwanted traffic) and (2) network&lt;br/&gt;monitoring, diagnosis, and troubleshooting.  The results from this&lt;br/&gt;project will both streamline today's network operations tasks and&lt;br/&gt;provide design insights for network operations in the next-generation&lt;br/&gt;Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kaleidoscope specifically focuses on improvements to network operations&lt;br/&gt;that rely on cooperation between users (or edge networks) and operators.&lt;br/&gt;Users and operators have common goals but, more importantly, they have&lt;br/&gt;complementary perspectives. Operators typically have broad views of&lt;br/&gt;network traffic but have little fine-grained information about&lt;br/&gt;compromised hosts or end-to-end performance.  End users possess&lt;br/&gt;fine-grained security and performance information, but they have neither&lt;br/&gt;visibility the into network internals (e.g., configuration) nor a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive perspective of network conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project involves performing measurements and&lt;br/&gt;analysis on the current Internet to better understand both the extent of&lt;br/&gt;network operations problems today and the degree to which cooperation&lt;br/&gt;between users and operators can mitigate them.  Based on these findings,&lt;br/&gt;the project will propose new approaches to network operations both for&lt;br/&gt;the current Internet and for future networks.  This research leverages&lt;br/&gt;recent advances in streaming data management, machine learning,&lt;br/&gt;economics, and privacy and may inspire new work in these areas, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
