<AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for the 2006 North American Memebrane Society Meeting (NAMS 2006)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this travel grant is to provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to present their research at the 17th Annual Meeting of the North American Membrane Society in June 2006. NAMS is the largest American meeting focused on this subject. The meeting will have 22 technical sessions covering the spectrum of leading-edge fundamental and applied membrane science and technology.  The meeting will feature 3 plenary lectures and 22 keynote lectures to bring the latest developments in the field to this meeting. An extensive student program has been developed for the meeting, including the Young Membrane Scientist Forum, Dining with the Legends, and a student poster competition. Four technical workshops will be&lt;br/&gt;offered just prior to the beginning of the meeting. These workshops are excellent venues for students to learn about fundamentals and advanced research topics in key areas such as: Measurement Methods for Membranes; Polymeric and Inorganic Membrane Materials and Membrane Formation; Gas Separation; and Membranes for Pharmaceutical Processing. Approximately 400 membrane researchers from all parts of the world representing industry, government and academic facilities will participate. This meeting is the principal scientific meeting for American researchers working in the area of membrane science and technology. The meeting has been announced worldwide through an electronic Call for Papers and a series of fliers. The meeting is also being advertised in the Journal of Membrane Science, the North American Membrane Society Membrane Quarterly, and their European, Japanese, and Korean counterparts. Information about the meeting is posted on the internet at www.membranes.org. In terms of broader impacts, the support will permit students to participate in a national meeting. Many students and senior researchers present their work in posters, and the less formal atmosphere of this session typically stimulates meaningful discussions between students and leaders in the field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
