<AbstractNarration>The project will test a learning progression for modeling that spans the elementary and middle grades.  Modeling instruction will be organized around concepts in life sciences that cumulate to a strong conceptual understanding of micro and macro evolution.  The work will take place in two districts with underserved children.  A curriculum strand will be created, assessments developed and a longitudinal research study conducted.  The project also includes an extensive professional development model and accompanying dissemination strategy.</AbstractNarration>
