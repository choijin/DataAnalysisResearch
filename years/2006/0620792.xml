<AbstractNarration>The research objectives of this collaborative project are to understand the velocity, stress and temperature fields around the tool cutting edge and to develop both numerical and analytical models to predict these quantities.  The approach involves (i) experimental quantification of the velocity and strain rate field around the cutting edge by digital image correlation of stereoscopic ultra high speed images, (ii) use of the velocity field to tune finite element models and obtain stress and temperature fields, (iii) use of the velocity and stress fields to develop a slip-line field model for the cutting edge effect that can be included into a prevailing model of metal cutting to predict the velocity, stress and temperature fields, and (iv) relating the velocity, stress and temperature fields to tool wear, phase transformations, and residual stress in the machined surface. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of the research will include (i) improved understanding of the deformation around the cutting edge in the form of slip-line field models grounded in fundamental mechanics principles that can be taught in both undergraduate and graduate courses, (ii) experimental results valuable for researchers interested in validating and improving analytical and finite element models of machining, (iii) analytical models for predicting tool life and part quality that can guide the design of cutting processes, tools and coatings, thereby helping improve tool life and productivity in industrial applications of metal cutting, and (iv) involvement of underrepresented students in this research.</AbstractNarration>
