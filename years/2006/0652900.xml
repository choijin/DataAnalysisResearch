<AbstractNarration>The proposed research has the overall goal of increasing our knowledge of how the interactions and statistics of quantum particles give rise to the rich phenomena observed in the diverse assemblies of such particles observed in nature. Emphasis is placed on nuclear systems both finite and infinite.  Our efforts will focus on the utilization of the framework of the self-consistent Green's function method (SCGF) to correlate large amounts of experimental data with the goal to make reliable predictions for nuclei with neutron number N very different from proton number Z that will be studied at future radioactive beam facilities. The SCGF method will also be employed for ab initio, microscopic prediction of the properties of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems. Quantitative microscopic description of nuclear systems, including neutron stars, nuclear matter, and finite nuclei, is the core purpose of the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mentoring of graduate assistants in the process and ethic of scientific research is an integral part of the project. Their contributions are critical to its success. Their development toward independence as original and productive scientists is a central objective of the program, a significant component being the integration of research training with meaningful experience in teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
