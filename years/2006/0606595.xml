<AbstractNarration>The plant cell wall plays a central role in many diverse aspects of plant biology, including organ growth and differentiation, defence against microbial pathogens, metabolism and transport of nutrients and responses to environmental stresses. In addition, the plant cell wall can be thought of as a vital compartment that acts as the interface with the environment and so substantial molecular signaling occurs in and across the wall environment. In accordance with its multifunctional nature, the plant cell wall houses a large and complex protein population, or proteome, including enzymes with a broad range of catalytic functions as well as structural proteins. However, it is increasingly evident that there is still a very limited understanding of the extent, composition and dynamic properties of the cell wall proteome, also termed the 'secretome'. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use an integrated approach to catalog the tomato secretome, coupling a suite of newly developed functional screens with sequencing of highly purified wall protein extracts, bioinfomatic tools and computational prediction. This infrastructure will be used to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative dynamics of the cell wall proteome during two biological processes that are intimately associated with wall biology: fruit ripening and plant defence responses. To this end, protein and mRNA expression will be studied in a standard experimental tomato genotype and contrasted with those in several non-softening tomato mutants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will generate a comprehensive catalog of the plant secretome in a range of tomato tissues and importantly, provide insights into the extracellular proteins that appear to contribute to, and play a role in, signaling during fruit ripening and in response to pathogen attack. The resulting information should allow important insights into how to improve fruit quality and agricultural productivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A publicly accessible tomato secretome database (SecreTom) will be developed to house the project data, to provide access to all associated computational tools, and to act as a hub for plant wall proteome research.  SecreTom will be accessible through the Solanaceous Genomes Database (SGN: http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/), which will also serve as the long-term repository for the project data. In addition, an annual summer Proteomics Workshop will be held, comprising a seminar series, poster presentations, and lab-based practical training. The participation of under-represented groups at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be ensured through the support of a network of existing Cornell programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Plant cell walls have numerous critical biological functions and play a pivotal role in growth, development, defense, metabolism and responses to environmental stresses. Additionally, cell walls provide the foundation for a growing portion of the biofuels industry, as well as the building blocks for a broad range of plant-derived products. Not surprisingly, given the central importance of the wall in many aspects of plant biology, a substantial portion of the total protein population (proteome) of plant cells is secreted into the cell wall. However, this æsecretomeÆ, is far less characterized than those of other plant subcellular compartments. The identification and functional evaluation of new suites of cell wall localized proteins therefore represents an exciting and relatively unexplored aspect of plant ægenome-scaleÆ biology.   This project involved the identification and characterization of the secretome of tomato, an agriculturally important crop species and a valuable experimental model for plant biologists. The broad goal was to identify protein populations in the cell wall, including novel cell wall proteins with diverse and currently unknown and unexploited functions, and to determine how those proteins contribute to important aspects of plant biology.      The approach to profile the tomato secretome involved coupling a suite of newly developed functional screens and sequencing of highly purified wall protein extracts, with computational tools and computational prediction. This infrastructure was specifically used to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative dynamics of the wall proteome during two biological processes that are intimately associated with wall biology: fruit ripening and plant defense responses.   In addition to substantial catalog of cell wall proteins and new information about the mechanisms of protein secretion, the molecular and bioinformatic tools that resulted from this project have been employed to study secreted proteins from many other species of plants, as well as fungi and animals.  As anticipated, each of these analyses has in itself led to new biological information in diverse phenomena spanning evolution, development and processes that have clear practical applications.  Examples include: a new understanding of how plants defend themselves against infection and mechanisms that microbes use to overcomes those defenses; insights into critical enzymatic processes that are used to synthesis the lipid and polysaccharide structural polymers that make up the cell walls and æskinÆ of plant surfaces; important observations regarding how cell wall proteins were important evolutionary adaptation to life on land in a desiccating environment and all the associated stresses.    The proposal has generated a valuable, publicly available resource in the form of a web-based plant secretome database (SecreTom), ensuring rapid public dissemination of the data. Importantly, this proposal took full advantage of, and enhances previous investments by the NSF in tomato genomics, providing a template for similar studies in other plant species, many of which are agriculturally and commercially important.     An important element of this proposal was the development of a strong education and training component. In addition to the expected training of graduate and undergraduate students, this took the form of two new programs: (a) a Plant Genome Research internship program that has been created as a Cornell-wide initiative to bring together a critical mass of undergraduate students, high school students and high school teachers on the Cornell campus each summer. These individuals participated in lab-based research and mentoring within the larger genomics-related community of plant scientists; (b) an annual summer Proteomics Workshop, comprising a seminar series, poster-presentations and lab-based practical training.
