    <AbstractNarration>0610495&lt;br/&gt;Ammar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a cooperative research between Dr. Reda Ammar, Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut and Dr. Ayman El-Dessouki, President, Electronics Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt. They plan to investigate the performance of Distributed Object-Oriented (DOO) applications, and to develop analytical performance models to study the performance of object-oriented (OO) software that runs on a shard/dedicated single-node or a distributed system. The target approach integrates software computation, communication activities among objects, object updating in DOO environment, and derives the performance of distributed objects, architecture properties and system operating conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Advanced information systems are often Distributed Object-Oriented (DOO) in nature. Pairing distributed systems with object oriented paradigms results in distributed objects. Choosing the most efficient distributed object design is a multicriteria decision problem. Performance is a key criterion that allows software developers to be able to select the object-oriented (OO) design that best fits their requirements and system limitations. However, investigating and evaluating the performance of DOO applications is challenging due to the complexity of interactions among objects. Required technique should capture the performance behavior of OO systems while preserving its OO properties. The restructuring techniques for DOO developed in this project will be of interest to many applications of science and engineering. In particular, this project is quite pertinent to advances in science and engineering focusing on innovation in performance modeling and designing efficient distributed OO computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: Advances made in this project will have an impact in many scientific and engineering communities, and in society. The analytical performance models and the restructuring algorithms will have broader impact on generating efficient design for many applications, such as in the development of efficient distributed computation for aircraft diagnosis and prognosis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
