<AbstractNarration>AST-0652742&lt;br/&gt;Phelps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forthcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will produce the largest non-proprietary data set in the world, which will be made accessible through the Virtual Observatory (VO).  The VO already contains large data sets, notably that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and this capability makes new research opportunities available for those without privileged access to their own telescopes, and with only very limited access to the largest facilities.  The current project will explore these new capabilities, firstly for a specific scientific research goal, in conjunction with pre-existing data on the open star cluster Melotte 66, and secondly to develop the skills needed to involve undergraduates in synoptic and time-series research in the LSST/VO era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work will also be carried out with the respective project staffs to understand better how to use the LSST/VO environment for research and education.  This will build capacity for future synoptic astronomy research at California State University-Sacramento (CSUS), a Primarily Undergraduate Institution that has recently applied for Minority Serving Institution status.  The study will also explore opportunities for greater cooperation between CSUS and the University of California-Davis on astronomy research and education, including showcasing the LSST in the CSUS "Science and Space Center."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is funded from the Galactic Astronomy theme of the Division of Astronomical Sciences, as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research.</AbstractNarration>
