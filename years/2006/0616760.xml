    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on the development of new synthetic methods and their applications in complex molecule synthesis. The methodology to construct annulated heterocycles through an electrochemical coupling, a route to saturated heterocycles involving an initial [4C+3C] cycloaddition followed by a ring-opening cross-metathesis reaction, and the application of halocyclopropenes as a three-carbon fragment will be studied. These methods will be applied for the total synthesis of several natural products including erinacine C, tricholomalide A, and phelligridin G. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Dennis L. Wright of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at University of Connecticut. Professor Wright's research efforts revolve around the development of efficient synthetic methods using heterocycles as the building blocks. The project is of considerable significance to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, as it could impact how organic molecules are prepared.</AbstractNarration>
