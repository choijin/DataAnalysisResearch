    <AbstractNarration>AWARD NO: AST-0607295&lt;br/&gt;PI: Thomas Ayres&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: The Oxygen Crisis&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The research to be undertaken here is focused on a significant controversy in solar&lt;br/&gt;physics and beyond - namely the value of the solar oxygen abundance. In the past few&lt;br/&gt;years, advanced 3D time-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the solar&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere and subsequent formation of forbidden O I and OH absorption features have&lt;br/&gt;pointed to a reduction in the recommended solar oxygen abundance of nearly a factor of&lt;br/&gt;two. This revision brings the solar value near that expected from the present-day&lt;br/&gt;interstellar medium and nearby B stars. However, because of the role of oxygen as a&lt;br/&gt;significant interior opacity source, such values are in severe conflict with models of the&lt;br/&gt;solar interior and their excellent agreement with helioseismology. Moreover, recent&lt;br/&gt;studies of carbon monoxide rovibrational bands in the thermal infrared have raised&lt;br/&gt;questions concerning the validity of the 3-D convection models in the mid-photosphere&lt;br/&gt;and support an oxygen abundance more consistent with previous high values.&lt;br/&gt;Here further independent observational tests of the photospheric convection simulations&lt;br/&gt;will be developed, primarily in the thermal infrared where the important continuum and&lt;br/&gt;line opacity sources have a different, simpler, but complementary character to those in&lt;br/&gt;the visible. A secondary objective is to continue exploration of the outer boundary of the&lt;br/&gt;photosphere, the so-called Magnetic Transition Zone, where plasma control in the deep&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere gives way to magnetic dominance in the higher layers. In this enigmatic&lt;br/&gt;region, the 4.66 micron CO bands indicate the surprising presence of ultra-cool (T ~ 3500&lt;br/&gt;K) gas protruding into what should be the warm, molecule-hostile chromosphere.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding this puzzle is essential to the full description of heat balance and energy&lt;br/&gt;transport in the outer atmosphere. New advances in solar IR spectral imaging technology&lt;br/&gt;will enable the observational studies that have been carried out in prototype for a decade.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, current thermal profile modeling will be extended to new tracers such as OH&lt;br/&gt;and Ca II, and a unique opportunity to coordinate IR imaging spectroscopy with a NASA&lt;br/&gt;solar UV sounding rocket flight will be exploited.&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance our knowledge of the Sun's atmospheric structure and energy&lt;br/&gt;transport, which is relevant to space weather. Beyond this, the composition of the Sun is a&lt;br/&gt;crucial baseline for many other areas of astronomy. Furthermore, the high-altitude&lt;br/&gt;COmosphere" provides a laboratory for the study of processes associated with&lt;br/&gt;molecular cooling catastrophes."&lt;br/&gt;The work here will provide graduate training and the associated instrument development&lt;br/&gt;will serve the broader National Solar Observatory user community. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;dissemination through professional publications and conference proceedings, a variety of&lt;br/&gt;outreach projects and community service activities relevant to the NSF mission will be&lt;br/&gt;carried out in connection with this work.</AbstractNarration>
