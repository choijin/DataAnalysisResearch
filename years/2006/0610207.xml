<AbstractNarration>Jemima Ingle, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 academic years.  Ingle's research examines the role of membrane surface properties in the development of supercritical CO2 separations.  Her service component is based on undergraduate mentoring and development for diversity in science and engineering.  She describes a "cascading peer network" where advanced undergraduates mentor younger undergraduates, the development of undergraduate research projects based at NC A&amp;T, and managing/creating opportunities for NC A&amp;T undergraduates to conduct undergraduate research at UNC and NCSU through the NSF Science and Technology Center for Environmentally Responsible Solvents and Processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.</AbstractNarration>
