<AbstractNarration>Leslie E. Sieburth&lt;br/&gt;IOB-0642118&lt;br/&gt;VCS and TDT reveal Developmental Roles for mRNA Decapping&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Plant leaves are the major organs that carry out photosynthesis, and so they provide essential roles in global carbon balance and agricultural productivity.  How the plant makes leaves, however, is still poorly understood. Two mutants, called varicose (vcs) and trident (tdt), are unable to produce normal leaves, and thus identify genes whose function is required for normal leaf development.  These genes encode components of the decapping complex, which is required for mRNA decay.  Decapping enzymes remove the 5'-most nucleotide of an mRNA (the cap), exposing a 5' end that is a substrate for the XRN4 exoribonuclease. The developmental defects shown by vcs and tdt mutants indicate that this mRNA decay pathway is required for normal development. The goal of this work is to understand the developmental roles of mRNA decapping, especially in the context of leaf development.  Genetic, molecular, and cell-biological approaches will be used to investigate roles in development and to identify additional molecules functioning in this pathway.  Because the Arabidopsis decapping complex is very similar to that of humans, while both the human and Arabidopsis decapping complexes differ from yeast, this genetic system is expected to provide insight into RNA decay pathways that will have broad scientific relevance to both plant and animal systems. Carrying out this research will provide interdisciplinary training to a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduates.  Undergraduate workers will be recruited through out-reach efforts focusing on underserved groups.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
