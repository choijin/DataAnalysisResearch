<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: CTS-0620437&lt;br/&gt;Institution: ECI&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Donald R. Paul&lt;br/&gt;Subject: Internatinal Conference on Advanced Membrane Technology III&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for travel grants to U.S. speakers, authors of papers, and young academic participants to attend the International Conference on Advanced Membrane Technology (III), be held in Cetraro, Italy, on June 11-15 2006. Membrane-based technology has grown to be a major technology within the last decade. Many of the recent developments were made in European countries and Japan. It is an important area for industrial competitiveness as well as collaboration. The purpose of the Conference is to discuss the latest advancement of the important membrane technologies. The researchers in the membrane fields have diverse background, mainly in chemical engineering, chemistry, material science, biomedical and environmental engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of participation in the area are explained in the following. It is crucially important to provide a needed forum through this conference to bring researchers with different backgrounds and from different countries together for disseminating and exchanging the latest scientific information. It will provide an excellent opportunity for developing international collaboration for the U.S. participants. The proposed budget of $10,000 will provide for 10 partial travel grant awards to young investigators from the U.S. to facilitate their participation as speakers in the Conference. Travel awards will be made based on the following considerations: (1) scientific or technological merit of the speakers/participants; (2) availability of other sources of travel funding; (3) professional&lt;br/&gt;qualifications relative to age and position; (4) institutional and geographical distribution. All awards will be made in full compliance with the Civil Rights Acts of 1964. NSF travel policies with respect to U.S. air carriers will be followed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
