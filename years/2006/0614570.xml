<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this project is to help geoscience departments thrive by networking and collaboration. There is not a single model for a strong department program as the goals of individual departments, as well as the challenges and opportunities they face, are highly dependent on the context of their institution. However, geoscience departments can benefit substantially from sharing information about key issues they face and the successful strategies they have developed to capitalize on opportunities and meet challenges in today's rapidly changing research and educational environment. This project uses topical workshops, activities at professional societies, and surveys as mechanisms for initiating widespread discussion of the key issues facing geoscience departments today. A website will be developed to disseminate the results of these discussions as well as specific examples of successful strategies and programs. This information will support departments in creating their own best practice based on a thorough knowledge of the experiences of other departments nationwide. The website will also feature searchable descriptions of geoscience departments that can be used to develop an integrated picture of geoscience departments nationwide and to characterize the activity within sub-groups of geoscience departments. An Advisory Board will create synthesis documents providing a voice for the community of geoscience departments that can be used by individual departments within their institutions or by the geoscience community as it speaks to national leaders regarding the role of geosciences in science research and education. Much work has focused on helping faculty maximize their potential as researchers and teachers. However, relatively little effort has gone into supporting departments in creating environments that allow these faculty to excel in their work. This project uses the techniques developed to support individual faculty via face-to-face activities and the web to develop a network of well-informed departments. Such a network and the information it provides are essential in today's era of rapid change to make good decisions in designing programs and to make a compelling case to faculty or administration for program support. This network will help to ensure that geoscience departments are not targeted for elimination and that the success stories that characterize thriving departments become more widespread. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
