<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)  The project team of mathematicians and biologists is creating materials and teaching strategies to promote dialog and learning between faculty and students in the mathematical and biological sciences.  This project is designed to attract and prepare students who intend to major in biological and health sciences to pursue research in these increasingly quantitative, computational, and data-driven areas.  The project has three primary goals, the first of which is the creation of a new biocalculus textbook and computer laboratory manual originating from existing biocalculus courses and associated computer laboratories at the host schools. Another goal of this project is to create a mathematics and biology seminar jointly administered by faculty at these schools. This seminar will be directed toward undergraduate students in the mathematical and biological sciences. Its goals are to make students aware of the connections between the mathematical and biological sciences, particularly in current and future research, to expose students to potential avenues for future research, and to foster interdisciplinary dialog between mathematics and biology faculty and students at both institutions. The third goal of this project is the assessment of the effectiveness of the new biocalculus courses, materials, and seminar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential for a broad impact since it is developing materials for a class of students who form a large percentage of those who pursue graduate work in the sciences. Also, the nature of this collaboration between mathematicians and biologists and between a four-year institution and a two-year institution can serve as a template for fostering interdisciplinary pedagogy and research at other such institutions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
