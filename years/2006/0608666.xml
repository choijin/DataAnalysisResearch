<AbstractNarration>This is a five-year project engaging science teachers in cutting-edge research at Department of Energy National Laboratories and at universities across the nation.  During the lifetime of the project 60 universities and laboratories from 28 states will participate.  Each summer 24 lead teachers, two from each of 12 "university science centers" will hold 8-week summer research appointments at Fermilab. At Fermilab they will work under the guidance of a physicist from a university or laboratory near their homes. All of the research will focus on research related to Fermilab and CERN experiments.  The following year these lead teachers and their mentor physicists will lead a year-long research program at each of the 12 centers for up to 10 local associate teachers.  These local programs include two components:  a 3-week research experience, and ongoing communications via e-mail and a website.  The website is the basic starting point for transfer to the classroom of the research experiences and access to near real time data.  It is expected that teachers will add to the website through adapting datasets to their needs and developing online experiments.  QuarkNet and the high-energy particle physics collaborations are committed to maintaining these centers and the accompanying 8-week summer research experience through the 15 years of the high energy particle physics experimental program with research and related sources of funding.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
