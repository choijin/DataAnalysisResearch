<AbstractNarration>The need to characterize the increase and distribution of greenhouse gases is a first order scientific goal of the atmospheric composition and climate communities.  The HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) program will provide global, meridional coverage, via vertical profiles throughout the depth of the troposphere enabling closure and inversion of global budgets of critical greenhouse gases (e.g. carbon dioxide, CO2; carbon monoxide, CO; and methane, CH4), and related long-lived tracers and ratios (e.g. the oxygen/nitrogen ratio, O2/N2).  This suite of chemical measurements, made from 80 N to 70 S, and repeated over approximately six monthly intervals, will provide a unique and definitive data set, to be used in inversion and other global modeling analyses of carbon cycle gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observed gradients in the hemispheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are critical to our ability to predict the fate of anthropogenic emissions of carbon gases.  Previous chemical transport modeling studies used to infer CO2 surface fluxes, sources and sinks have been generally constrained to using boundary layer CO2 concentrations.  The field experiments will thus take advantage of transformative capabilities newly available to the atmospheric science community provided by the use of the HIAPER G-V aircraft platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is supported under the NSF Carbon and Water in the Earth System solicitation, an interdisciplinary funding opportunity from the Directorate of Geosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Principle Investigator: Britton Stephens   Awardee: University Corporation for Atmospheric Research                 The HIPPO campaign completed its three-year global survey of greenhouse and related gases from the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) aircraft in September of 2011.  This landmark study has collected an extensive and highly detailed data set of over 80 atmospheric species measured from the surface to 14 km, and from 87 N to 67 S, in 5 campaigns spread throughout the annual cycle.  By all accounts the field efforts were highly successful and these unique measurements are providing valuable insights into the global carbon cycle and aspects of the climate system.  The entire data set has been made publicly available and promises to be a valuable community resource for years to come.              As part of the broader HIPPO project, ATM-0628388 supported the development and operation of the NCAR Airborne Oxygen (AO2) analyzer and the NCAR MEDUSA Flask Sampler which flew on the GV.  The measurements from AO2 have revealed detailed atmospheric O2 variations with systematic relationships to CO2 and other tracers representing the influences of photosynthesis, respiration, biomass burning, combustion of fossil fuels at varying oxidative ratios, oceanic exchange, and stratosphere-troposphere transport and mixing.  The flasks collected by MEDUSA have been analyzed for O2, CO2, Ar, and 13C and 18O of CO2 providing critical validation data for AO2 and new scientific insights on their own.              Latitude-height cross-sections show the influence of strong O2 outgassing from the Southern Ocean during austral summer, and strong O2 uptake in austral winter (Figures 1 and 2), and the vertical and horizontal extent of atmospheric transport of these signals.  We have compared the measured cross-sections to matching output from state-of-the-art global models of oceanic biogeochemistry and atmospheric transport in ways that critically evaluate the validity of their projections and provide guidance for areas of needed model improvement.             The atmospheric CO2 measurements made by AO2, MEDUSA, and the other systems on board the GV dramatically capture the vertical and latitudinal distribution of CO2 throughout the Northern Hemisphere at different times of year (Figures 3 and 4).  These data have been used to quantitatively estimate the total number of moles of CO2 that exchange with the Northern Hemisphere surface over the seasonal cycle, and reveal that earlier estimates of this exchange have been too low.  The improved numbers can be used as validation for global terrestrial ecosystem models, and can provide better constraints in model calculations of global carbon cycling.              Scientists supported by this grant mentored graduate students, helped to host outreach events at the various HIPPO field locations, gave presentations to high school and undergraduate students on the research goals and instrumentation, participated in networked press conferences during the campaign, and contributed to a number of educational videos (http://hippo.ucar.edu, http://vimeo.com/39648078).
