<AbstractNarration>AST-0607731&lt;br/&gt;Balsara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to its role in numerous aspects of modern astrophysics, from star formation to the evolution of both young and old galaxies, understanding the physics of the interstellar medium (ISM) is of fundamental importance.  Because of recent ground- and space-based observations, it is important to improve theoretical understanding of the hot and warm phases of the ISM, and of turbulent mixing in the ISM.  This project will address these needs with numerical modeling, now that modern systems are fast enough simulate sections of the ISM in a galaxy.  In many cases, one output will be simulated diagnostics for direct comparison with the observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will provide for a graduate thesis, undergraduate research training, school-targeted web sites, and a contribution to the 'Art to Science' program that takes science into K-12 classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
