<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molecular spins have a high potential of being used in future micron-scale devices dealing with either classical or quantum aspects of information technology. Recently it has been shown that "man-made" spins can behave quantum mechanically under specific conditions. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at the Florida State University is to investigate the quantum dynamics of molecular spins coupled strongly to resonant photons, with an eye on potential implementations in the information technology field. Spin detection will be accomplished by coupling the spin to an electro-magnetic field inside specially designed microscopic cavities. Achieving single spin sensitivity is an important objective, together with the understanding of decoherence mechanisms in molecular samples. Through association with the NHMFL a broad condensed matter community will interact closely with the proposed research. The specifics of the research will be benefic for the training of undergraduate and graduate students and part of the techniques will be integrated in a graduate course on experimental methods in physics. The program will sustain a recent NHMFL initiative to develop a nation-wide network called SuperNet which will provide high-schools with physics demonstration modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at the Florida State University is to investigate the quantum dynamics of molecular spins coupled strongly to resonant photons. Fundamental questions related to quantum macroscopicity or decoherence are at hand in these samples. Potential implementations in the information technology field will be investigated as well. In particular, the study will focus on: i) quantum non-demolition observation of an ensemble of spins, ii) observation of exotic multi-photon anti-resonances in quasi-harmonic spin states and iii) single spin sensitivity. These goals have important scientific significance and will bring light to the quantum dynamics of spins in the presence of a given environment. It is proposed to couple the total spin of a molecule to the B-component of a resonant electro-magnetic field inside microscopic cavities similar to the case of resonant cavities electrically coupled to atoms or superconducting qubits. Through association with the NHMFL a broad condensed matter community will interact closely with the proposed research. The specifics of the research will be benefic for the training of undergraduate and graduate students and part of the techniques will be integrated in a graduate course on experimental methods in physics. The program will sustain a recent NHMFL initiative to develop a nation-wide network called SuperNet which will provide high-schools with physics demonstration modules.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
