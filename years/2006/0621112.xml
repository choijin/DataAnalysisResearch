<AbstractNarration>This project, funded by the Ethics and Values in Science, Engineering and Technology component of the Science and Society Program, supports a conference in the spring of 2007 on questions lying at the intersection of space science, environmental ethics, and policy. The conference will revisit many of the themes first explored in a 1985 NSF-sponsored conference on "Environmental Ethics and the Solar System," the proceedings of which were published as Beyond Spaceship Earth: Environmental Ethics and the Solar System(1986), a book which for two decades has been a primary reference for discussions of ethical issues related to the space program.  The 2007 conference and subsequent edited volume will take into account the major changes that have taken place since the mid-1980s in direct relation to space science and space exploration, including President Bush's announced plans (January 2004) to create a base on the Moon and send a manned mission to Mars. It will include examinations of issues such as: risk and human health in manned exploration; the social, political, and economic dimensions of solar exploration, the problem of orbital debris; the building of a Moon base along with other private development on the Moon; asteroid mining and asteroid and comet deflection; planetary protection from biological contamination; plans for the manned Mars mission proposed by President Bush; issues related to the possible terraforming of Mars and other planets; the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the ethical issues that would be raised by the discovery of such life; the aesthetic beauty of the Solar System; the impact of space exploration on religion; and the privatization of space and space tourism.  The 2007 conference will be one of the initial projects of the new Center for Space Exploration Policy Research (CSEPR), a cooperative effort of the Department of Philosophy and Religion Studies at the University of North Texas and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) Department of Space Studies. The conference, which will be built around a core group of 18 invited scientists, engineers, philosophers, and policy thinkers from the academic, public, and private sectors, with expertise in astronomy, biology, business administration, chemistry, engineering, geology, history, landscape painting, medicine, philosophy, physics, professional writing, and theology, and will take place at the NASA-Ames Research Center in Ames, California. The conference will be open to the public. It will be cosponsored by the Center for Environmental Philosophy at the University of North Texas and the National Space Society.  The intellectual merit of this project is that it will stimulate reflection on the historical, social, political, philosophical, ethical, aesthetic, religious, and policy dimensions of space science and engineering in the context of space exploration. The broader social impact of this project is that it will contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding not only within the technical community concerned with carrying out the NASA missions, but also among concerned citizens and the general public. It will also enhance scientific and technological literacy, and provide the space science community with new means for promoting science and technology education and scientifically informed decision making. Products will include an edited volume of essays on the topics covered by the conference, one or more additional refereed articles, and educational outreach in cooperation with education specialists at NASA Ames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
