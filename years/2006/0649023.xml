<AbstractNarration>This award supports an REU site at Washington State University (WSU) to focus on performing&lt;br/&gt;fundamental research on systems far removed from ambient conditions of pressure and temperature. The ten week program will Involve research projects on various aspects of  extreme matter, a core strength of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Washington State University.  Specific systems include Bose-Einstein condensates, few-body physics at extremely low temperatures, quantum chaos, and matter subjected to large pressures.  Research projects will have well-defined goals that can result in peer-reviewed publications.  The students will benefit from state-of-the-art facilities, high mentor-to-student ratio, and extensive faculty experience in supervising undergraduates.  Students in their first or second year of college are especially encouraged to apply, as are students from four-year colleges that have limited research facilities.  The recruiting effort is aimed at bringing in a group that is diverse in every respect, including ethnicity, gender, academic preparation, and economic background.  In addition to participating in interdisciplinary, hands-on research, the students will benefit from a seminar series that highlights current topics in extreme matter research. Scheduled social events will also provide students with a collegial sense of community.  This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
