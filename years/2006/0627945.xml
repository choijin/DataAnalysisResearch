<AbstractNarration>In this project, the key meteorological aspects of the Pacific Atmospheric Sulfur Experiment (PASE) will be investigated, using available meteorological data and analyses, satellite images and other data, data from the NSF/NCAR C-130, and retrospective and climatological data.  These aspects include dynamical and thermodynamic controls on the structure of the convective boundary layer in which the sulfur flux and budget observations will be made, the basin-wide to synoptic scale wind distributions that control Equatorial upwelling and the resultant primary productivity which initiates the efflux of DMS, the structure and propagation of atmospheric waves that dominate the progression from cloud-free to cloudy conditions, and the occurrence and manifestations of the Southern Oscillation and El Nino.  The PI will also be the mission meteorologist for PASE, providing analysis and forecasting support to the investigators during the field campaign.  Meteorological charts, satellite images, and other needed products will be assembled and sent to the field site via the internet and/or facsimile transmission.  After the field campaign, a comprehensive meteorological analysis will be developed for the area of the observations, using data and techniques parallel to those enumerated above.  Also, a retrospective study of meteorological conditions during prior sulfur budget studies near Christmas Island will be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include support for a graduate student with interdisciplinary interests at the boundary between meteorology and atmospheric chemistry.  There will also be outreach efforts in secondary schools in Narragansett, Rhode Island and on the island of Kiritimati (Christmas Island).</AbstractNarration>
