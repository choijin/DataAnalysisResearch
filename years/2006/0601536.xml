<AbstractNarration>Objective - The objective of this research is to investigate the non-linear properties of nano-scale active regions of barium strontium titanate (BST) thin films, their dependence upon deposition and patterning processes, and their manifestation in macro-scale observables including capacitance-voltage behavior.  Important goals for this project include the development of non-linear computer-aided-design models and design techniques for BST circuits based on non-linear transmission line topologies.  The approach is to use planar capacitor (varactor) structures, layered on a BST film, as the building block for more complex devices.  The structures will be patterned using focused ion beam (FIB) milling to create nano-scale gaps.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - The varactors that will be developed have feature sizes on the same order of magnitude as the film's surface roughness - at this scale, the homogeneity of the film and resultant capacitance-voltage properties, switching speed and dielectric relaxation are not well understood.  The exploitation of BST for microwave signal generation will require a thorough understanding of the non-linear properties and advancements in modeling methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact - The devices that will be developed can have a great impact on society at large, as the functionality is integral to specialized systems such as military radar and many commercial telecommunications systems. Furthermore, the fundamental knowledge gained on non-linear behavior of BST will be useful to engineers and physicists working in related fields such as high-density memory.  The PIs have a track-record of involving under-represented minorities in their research activities and will recruit female and minority students to perform this work.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The technique is based on a method called electro-optic sampling, which entails placing an electro-optic probe whose permittivity changes with electric field, very close to the device under test.  As the signal from the device interacts with the probe, changes in the probe permittivity are determined by focusing a laser on the probe and tracking the reflected laser beam.  The system developed uses ultra-fast lasers and has the ability to resolve frequencies approaching 1 THz, making it feasible to measure device tuning speed in the picosecond range.  The key advantage of this method is that the electro-optic probe can be located directly at the output of the device, versus alternative methods that require additional cables and connectors. This in-situ measurement approach provides unmatched fidelity and resolution, and thus enables measurements of very fast tuning ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
