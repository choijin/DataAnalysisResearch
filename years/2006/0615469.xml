<AbstractNarration>This project will lead to a better understanding of a molecular nature of lipid rafts in model membranes. Liquid ordered domains of biological membranes enriched in specific lipids and proteins (so called lipid rafts) participate in a multitude of cellular processes.  Since biological membranes are very complicated systems, many studies of lipid rafts are performed on model membranes containing mixtures of phospholipids, sterols peptides and proteins. Last decade saw an explosion in number of studies that accumulated data on properties of model lipid rafts; nevertheless detailed information related to molecular level understanding of these rafts is still not available.  Computer simulations techniques can play a very important role in providing such information. Therefore, the main goal of the project will be to study molecular detailed nature of lipid rafts in model membranes by performing molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations are designed to be connected with recent experimental work performed on model lipid monolayers and bilayers. Novel calculations of free energy cost of removing cholesterol from different lipid monolayers and bilayers will be performed to study the cholesterol/phospholipids interactions and the relative importance of tail/tail and head/head interactions. Properties of systems that represent patches of liquid ordered domains and liquid disordered domains will be investigated and the role of hydrogen bonding in head/head interactions will be studied. Comparative simulations of monolayers and bilayers under corresponding conditions will be performed to understand the role of lipid-cholesterol complexes. Finally, novel simulations on asymmetric bilayers containing leaflets that differ in their lipid compositions will be done to study the interactions across bilayer leaflets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work on this project will provide essential training in biophysics of membranes for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Graduate and undergraduate students who previously worked in the laboratory are now continuing their study and research in biophysics in industrial and academic environments, including best research laboratories in USA. Data and results obtained from simulations will be disseminated through Internet facilities and presented at the meetings. The results of this research will be also included into a course called Biophysics of Membranes, which the PI is developing now and plans to teach as a module in the Molecular and Cellular Biophysics program at the University.   This project is jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
