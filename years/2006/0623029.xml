<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this research are to investigate the properties of novel peptide&lt;br/&gt;defense signals discovered in tomato and Arabidopsis plants that have important roles&lt;br/&gt;in amplifying the defense systems of the plants to strengthen the resistances against&lt;br/&gt;pathogens and insect pests. Until the discovery of the defense peptide called systemin&lt;br/&gt;in tomato leaves in 1991 by Ryan and colleagues, no peptide signals were known to be&lt;br/&gt;components of plant signaling. Over 20 peptide signals are now known that regulate&lt;br/&gt;both defense and development. A novel, rapid, and simple assay has been developed&lt;br/&gt;in the Ryan laboratory that can identify new peptide signals in plant extracts. This&lt;br/&gt;assay has allowed the discovery of several new peptide signals for both plant defense&lt;br/&gt;and development including a peptide called AtPep1 that enhances the innate immune&lt;br/&gt;responses of the plants against pathogens. The gene encoding the peptide is a&lt;br/&gt;member of a gene family that is found in species throughout the plant kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;Biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches will be carried out to understand the&lt;br/&gt;role of peptide signals using tomato and Arabidopsis plants as model systems. The&lt;br/&gt;localization of the peptides and their precursor genes in plants will be studied, and how&lt;br/&gt;the peptides are produced from precursor proteins and perceived by plant cells to&lt;br/&gt;activate defensive genes in response to herbivores and/or pathogen attacks will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated. The peptides that enhance plant defense responses have provided new&lt;br/&gt;insights toward an understanding of innate immunity in plants, which are the earliest&lt;br/&gt;responses of plants in response to most attacking organisms. The knowledge gained&lt;br/&gt;will contribute to the framework of the basic principles that govern peptide signaling in&lt;br/&gt;the plant kingdom. Such information will contribute to an understanding of defense&lt;br/&gt;peptide signaling in both plants and animals, and will be especially useful in breeding&lt;br/&gt;and biotechnological approaches to enhance yields in major agricultural crops. A major&lt;br/&gt;component of this grant is to train undergraduate and graduate students as well as&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellows and visiting scientists in fundamentals research that can be applied&lt;br/&gt;to agriculture and human health.  The PI's successful ongoing efforts to bring women and minorities into my laboratory will continue through the tenure of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
