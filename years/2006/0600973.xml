<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will deal with a variety of algebraic objects that have&lt;br/&gt;arisen recently in different areas such as Hopf algebra theory,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial representation theory,&lt;br/&gt;the theory of operads, free probability theory, and renormalization theory&lt;br/&gt;in mathematical physics. It should be regarded as an extension of the &lt;br/&gt;classical work on the theory of free Lie algebras and its interplay &lt;br/&gt;with the representation theory of the symmetric group.&lt;br/&gt;Through the eyes of operad theory, the objects we deal with are free &lt;br/&gt;algebras of various kinds. Addressing this property is fundamental in &lt;br/&gt;understanding the role&lt;br/&gt;played by these objects in the other theories.&lt;br/&gt;Freeness is also responsible for the rich combinatorics exhibited by these&lt;br/&gt;objects. Part of the goal of the project is to make the algebraic &lt;br/&gt;structure as explicit as possible, which often leads to interesting &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial constructions.&lt;br/&gt;Conversely, the project will make use of algebraic properties to unify &lt;br/&gt;and generalize important constructions in combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;Some of these free algebras have found&lt;br/&gt;applications in free probability theory, while others are at the basis of&lt;br/&gt;renormalization theory. All of them are closely related to symmetric functions&lt;br/&gt;and the representation theory of the symmetric group. A common feature is the&lt;br/&gt;existence of Hopf algebraic structures, which are often also free in one sense&lt;br/&gt;or another. Exploiting this structure is another central feature of the &lt;br/&gt;project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics provides a tool for handling subtle algebraic structures.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding these structures is important in various areas of recent &lt;br/&gt;interest&lt;br/&gt;both in pure mathematics (free probability theory, representation &lt;br/&gt;theory) as well as in mathematical physics (renormalization theory).&lt;br/&gt;This project plans to deepen our understanding of the rich combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;underlying various free algebraic structures.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will introduce graduate students to this area of research and make&lt;br/&gt;international contacts and collaborations in Europe, Latin America, and India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
