<AbstractNarration>Support from this grant will be used to continue a program of nuclear physics&lt;br/&gt;research focused on the fundamental properties of the nucleon.  The program is&lt;br/&gt;based at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) and is&lt;br/&gt;focused on two objectives.  The primary goal of this program will be to&lt;br/&gt;complete the construction of a tracking system for the Qweak experiment with&lt;br/&gt;the involvment of two students. The second objective will be to prepare a&lt;br/&gt;physics program as well as design and construct instrumentation for the JLab&lt;br/&gt;12 GeV upgrade. The Qweak experiment is a parity-violating electron scattering&lt;br/&gt;experiment designed to measure the weak charge of the proton.  A measurement&lt;br/&gt;of the proton's weak charge can be used to extract a fundamental quantity&lt;br/&gt;known as the weak mixing angle.  The current description of particle interactions,&lt;br/&gt;commonly referred to as the "Standard Model", predicts how the weak mixing&lt;br/&gt;angle changes with the amount of momentum that is transferred during an&lt;br/&gt;interaction.  As a result, a measurement of the proton's weak charge will evaluate&lt;br/&gt;the veracity of the Standard Model as well as be sensitive to competing theoretical&lt;br/&gt;descriptions involving new physics should the Standard Model fall short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this NSF-supported program will primarily construct a tracking system critical to&lt;br/&gt;the Qweak experiment, it will also continue to play a major role developing a physics&lt;br/&gt;program and instrumentation for the JLab 12 GeV upgrade.  The principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;is a co-spokesperson for a physics program to measure polarization observables of the&lt;br/&gt;nucleon at an energy upgraded JLab.  The measurements made will constrain the stark&lt;br/&gt;theoretical predictions describing these distributions at kinematic regions where&lt;br/&gt;the probed quark carries most of the nucleons momentum.  The PI is also supervising&lt;br/&gt;the design of a tracking system for the JLab energy upgrade.  The development of particle&lt;br/&gt;tracking systems for Qweak and the JLab 12 GeV upgrade is the means through which this program&lt;br/&gt;educates both graduate and undergraduate students thereby enhancing the intellectual&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure of our technology driven society.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
