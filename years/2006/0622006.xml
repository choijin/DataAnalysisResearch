<AbstractNarration>The project described in this proposal seeks to a develop a framework for generating robust&lt;br/&gt;computer vision algorithms for use in closed-loop systems. A principal goal of the research endeavour&lt;br/&gt;is to examine the role that control theory may play in enhancing closed-loop computer vision&lt;br/&gt;algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. As a sensor, the imaging system can be wrought with noise, either through&lt;br/&gt;the actual sensing process or through the geometry of the imaged scene. Consequently, the computer&lt;br/&gt;vision process can be interpreted as a signal processing task in the presence of noise and uncertainy.&lt;br/&gt;This is further compounded for closed-loop vision systems, because the control effort can induce&lt;br/&gt;additional disturbances.&lt;br/&gt;Through an analysis of the classical Luenberger observer for finite- dimensional systems, the PI&lt;br/&gt;proposes to systematically build up a similar framework for filtering of closed curves, which are the&lt;br/&gt;by-products of th e computer vision algorithms known as active contours. Essentially, this research&lt;br/&gt;endeavour involves the development of a Kalman filter algorithm for closed curves, and involves a&lt;br/&gt;principled predict and update scheme. The main investigative challenge lies in the fact that closed&lt;br/&gt;curves form an infinite-dimensional space which classical state-space observer theory is not capable&lt;br/&gt;of handling.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The successful consideration of computer vision algorithms as components of&lt;br/&gt;a control and dynamical system has the ability to tremendously increase their level of robustness,&lt;br/&gt;without severely complicating the nature of their processing. As a particular application demonstrating&lt;br/&gt;the potential impact and challenges of this research avenue within a specific area, the PI&lt;br/&gt;seeks to study the closed-loop control and estimation of bio-membranes at the mico-scale. The observer&lt;br/&gt;concept described herein has the capacity to improve the signal generated from vision-based&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that form the main information pathway of a closed-loop process.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed education plan incorporates many of these ideas into existing computer vision&lt;br/&gt;courses, as they are essential components in the use of computer vision for feedback-driven systems.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, summer research and senior-design projects are anticipated to motivate the importance&lt;br/&gt;of control and dynamical systems theory for computer vision.</AbstractNarration>
