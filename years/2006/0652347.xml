<AbstractNarration>EXO is a ton-class neutrino-less double beta decay experiment employing 136-Xe and is unique among such experiments as it utilizes a novel technique to tag the atomic species produced in the final state (Ba) of the double beta decay using laser spectroscopy.  This technique has the promise of drastically reducing radioactive backgrounds, providing a clean and un-ambiguous measurement with unprecedented sensitivity. In the last few years, EXO R&amp;D has been equally divided between the construction of a 200 kg intermediate scale detector (EXO-200) without Ba tagging and the development of the Ba tagging system. EXO-200 construction is now nearing completion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed here concentrates on Ba extraction from the liquid xenon (LXe) and identification. Some new ideas, presented here, have the potential of providing the key for the design of the full scale EXO experiment. Previous R&amp;D has resulted in an ion trap capable of clear single Ba ion detection in the presence of a cooling gas, and the initial experimentation with a number of Ba transfer techniques. The R&amp;D proposed here will revolve around three parallel themes, each to be developed by one of the three collaborating institutions. The conclusion of EXO Ba tagging R&amp;D, along with the successful operation of the EXO-200 detector, will result in the design of a formidable next generation double beta detector to be sited at an underground laboratory in the near future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques to be developed in this project span a broad range of topics, from nuclear and particle astrophysics, to AMO, surface physics and material science. This research, if successful, is likely to be applicable to other problems in science and technology, where the high efficiency transfer and identification of single atoms would be of interest. Examples include trace analysis for homeland security applications and the detection of rare phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit       One of the fundamental mysteries of the universe is why the basic elementary particles have the particular masses that they do.  Remarkably, the mass of one of those particles, the neutrino, is so small that it has not yet been determined.  A neutrinoless double beta decay experiment at the ton scale has the potential sensitivity to make this discovery if the residual background events in the experiment are eliminated by a method of "tagging" only the true decay events.        The goal of this research is to develop a novel technique for detecting, or "tagging", a single daughter 136Ba+ ion that results from a very rare double beta decay of a 136Xe atom in the next-generation EXO experiment at the ton scale.  Since essentially all background events in EXO would not produce a Ba+ ion, successful demonstration of single Ba tagging would make a zero background experiment possible and open up the highest discovery potential for neutrino mass.       The proposed tagging method involves grabbing a single 136Ba daughter atom or ion out of a large tank of liquid 136Xe by freezing it in solid xenon on a cryotip, upon which the Ba detection with a laser would take place.  Since almost nothing was known about Ba atoms and ions in solid xenon before the initiation of research on this method, an initial phase of physics and spectroscopy research on this system was required.  Completion of that physics phase and assessment of the prospects for successful Ba tagging were the goals of this particular grant.       The absorption and emission spectra of Ba and Ba+ in solid xenon have been recorded for the first time.  Optimal excitation and fluorescence detection wavelengths to be used in the tagging scheme have been found.  Even with modest "spectroscopy" conditions, strong signals are seen from small numbers of deposited Ba atoms and Ba+ ions.  One of the important discoveries was that the fluorescence signal in both species does not saturate at high excitation rates, but continues to increase linearly.  This implies high decay rates of metastable states in both cases.  The very good news from this is that single Ba atoms or Ba+ ions can be excited millions of times per second or more with one laser only.  The temperature dependence of the emission has been measured in both cases, and an initial understanding of the extent of neutralization of Ba+ upon entering solid xenon has been obtained, but the picture is not yet complete.       The results from this research are very positive.  The improvements needed for obtaining large signals from single Ba and Ba+, e.g., higher laser intensity and higher light collection efficiency, are now clear and straightforward as a consequence of the discoveries made in the research funded by this grant.  The conclusion from this research phase is that the proposed method is a viable Ba daughter tagging scheme.       In accord with this work being proposed and funded as collaborative work of three institutions within the EXO Collaboration, the PI has also traveled to Stanford often to help with a second promising Ba tagging method utilizing laser ablation and resonance ionization.  There he also contributed to the development of a single Ba atom/ion source based on alpha decay that will be used in the next phase of our work.  Broader impacts       Education and outreach have been major goals and activities during the grant period.  Graduate students, an undergraduate and a high school teacher have done the lionÆs share of the research, while furthering their education and experience with state-of-the-art laser, vacuum and detection systems. One graduate student supported on the grant, has finished his Ph. D. on Ba atom spectroscopy and detection, and a second student is writing his Ph. D. thesis on the Ba+ ion work.  An undergraduate student has worked three semesters on the project.  A high school teacher with us in summer, 2009, learned techniques and then carried out research on th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
