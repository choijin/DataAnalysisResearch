<AbstractNarration>The proposer proposes to study several topics in probabilistic and geometric&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics. These topics are related to theoretical computer&lt;br/&gt;science and other academic disciplines. The proposal is divided into two areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part I concerns the study of influences, threshold behaviors and Fourier Analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Influence of variables on Boolean functions and the related notion of&lt;br/&gt;pivotality are of central importance in combinatorics, various other&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics, computer science and other areas as &lt;br/&gt;game theory, reliability theory and statistical physics. &lt;br/&gt;What is the correct notion of power or influence in&lt;br/&gt;complicated social situations? or in complex computer networks? How does&lt;br/&gt;noise effect such systems? and what is the correct way of modeling noise?&lt;br/&gt;It turns out that these questions are related to a recent mathematical theory &lt;br/&gt;which involve combinatorics, probability and ``Fourier analysis''.&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will study some basic open problems in&lt;br/&gt;this area. This is closely&lt;br/&gt;related to the study of Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, and to noise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II concerns Helly type theorems and convex polytopes:&lt;br/&gt;One important theme in combinatorial geometry is to try to&lt;br/&gt;extract the combinatorial and topological content of various&lt;br/&gt;geometric theorems. The study of topological Helly type theorems is &lt;br/&gt;one example. Extending results from polytopes&lt;br/&gt;to simplicial and polyhedral spheres is another.&lt;br/&gt;Some of these problems are surprisingly&lt;br/&gt;easy to state and still they were not solved for many decades&lt;br/&gt;and any progress is expected to involve some deep new insights. &lt;br/&gt;These problems are related to the area of ``optimization'' and especially&lt;br/&gt;to ``linear programming''. Optimization - trying to find the best solution&lt;br/&gt;in a complicated situation with various constraints - &lt;br/&gt;is one of the most important applications of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;The proposer presented some problems in this direction that he intends&lt;br/&gt;to study.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
