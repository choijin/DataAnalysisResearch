<AbstractNarration>Deborah Illman, University of Washington, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2006-2007 academic year.  Illman's proposal is a science-writing and science bibliometric study related to the "Team  Science" conducted at NSF-supported Science and Technology Centers with chemistry or materials research focus.  Her project goals are to write and publish public science articles on NSF-supported research; to conduct bibliometric research on media coverage of team science; and to develop partnerships between the STCs and writing/journalism programs at their universities that will enhance the quantity and quality of media coverage of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.</AbstractNarration>
