<AbstractNarration>MATERIAL FLOWS FOR SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS FOR URBAN REGIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is part of the FY06 Materials Use: Science, Engineering and Society competition.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban centers contain a significant and growing fraction of population and material and energy flows associated with the use and disposal of products.  Re-engineering the flows of materials  particularly the patterns of their disposal  is critical to achieving sustainable systems within national boundaries, across international boundaries, and across generations.  Yet, the urban landscape and population, and their associated material flows, have been underrepresented in models of sustainable industrial system growth.  In developing models and tools to shape the next generation of industrial systems for materials mined from urban centers, the spatial distribution of these material resources must be integrated because successful design of sustainable systems cannot occur in a geographical vacuum.  In recognition of the symbiotic material flow relationship between manufacturing companies and urban regions, this multi-disciplinary collaborative research effort will develop a framework for modeling and assessing the impact of redesigning urban materials flows to advance the mutual goals of sustainable industrial and urban systems.  Our common focus is on mining specific products and associated materials from urban centers through new recycling networks and facilities for the Atlanta and Seattle metropolitan regions, and on modeling the economic development and environmental effects of different material flow scenarios on these regions.  In our work, we will connect Geographic Information Systems data to demographic data, to consumer behavior models, to product models with material information, to industrial recycling process models, to Input-Output and Social Accounting Matrix models, and to transportation and environmental impact assessment models.  The resulting framework and models will be applied to evaluate specific techno-economic- policy scenarios of interest to the Cities of Atlanta and Seattle in carpet and electronics recycling in terms of material flows, transportation, economic development, and environmental impact. Recognizing the global need for such models and analysis systems, our work includes a problem-based international educational component focused on the dumping of electronic waste in Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We expect the research insights generated by this project will help in closing the significant gap in thinking on sustainability that has resulted from treating industrial systems separately from urban systems.  Closing this gap is a necessary condition for fully mitigating the environmental impacts of industry.  Outcomes will include improved modeling of material flows for the urban scale that will help in developing market-based collection and recycling systems which take into account the impacts of consuming greenfields, inner city economic revitalization, and landfill reduction.  Thus, this research is intended to encourage new manufacturing activity via waste diversion in distressed areas -- a promising economic development strategy that promotes urban sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-managed by the Divisions of Civil &amp; Mechanical Systems and Bioengineering &amp; Environmental Systems in the Engineering Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
