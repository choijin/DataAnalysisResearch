<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate the geometry of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry. These spaces are important because they often play fundamental roles in the research of many branches of mathematics and in Super-String theories. Specifically, the Principal Investigator will work on moduli of stable maps and of stable sheaves on algebraic varieties. For the first, he will continue his earlier work on developing an effective theory of high genus Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds, a research direction directly influenced by Super String theory. For the moduli of sheaves, he will continue his work on investigating sheaves on surfaces, aiming to uncover new affine Lie algebra representations based on moduli of sheaves; he will develop a theory on degeneration of moduli of stable sheaves and the associated degeneration formula of their associated Donaldson type invariants. The later will open a new channel to the research of moduli of stable sheaves. In a research field bordering both, he will follow the recent leads from Super-String theory to investigate the BPS-state conjecture of Gopakumar-Vafa; this research in the long run will reveal a direct relation between moduli of sheaves with moduli of stable maps, and thus with that of curves, from a completely new horizon. In the long run, this project will serve to broaden mathematical research by understanding new ideas from theoretical physics and to contribute to the advancement of Super String theories by providing necessary mathematical foundation for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The listed individual projects are part of research in algebraic geometry, an active research branch in mathematics whose goal is to investigate the geometry, topology and arithmetic property of varieties that are solutions to polynomials. Since last decade, one research field in this branch progressed tremendously in part due to its application to theoretical physics and other fields in general science-it is to investigate moduli spaces of objects studied in algebraic geometry. Of many, a simple minded example is the space of all possible shapes of the surfaces of donuts. Another comparison is like studying space of all possible trajectories of a particle in space. This research project will work on  two of the most important moduli spaces in algebraic geometry-moduli of maps and moduli of sheaves; it will also work to explore the connection between these two moduli spaces, eventually developing a connection that will tie these spaces together. Some problems to be investigated are directly from research in theoretical physics, thus the potential impact of this project will go beyond mathematical research. This project will also promote teaching, learning and training students in many ways. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this period, the PI has been working on two directions: one is to generalize the categorification of Donaldson-Thomas invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds to the equivariant situation, aimed at developing a wall-crossing formula of such theory. The other is in developing a theory of Mixed-Spin-P (MSP) field theory, aimed at constructing recursive relations among Gromov-Witten invariants of quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds and the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants of Fermat quintic polynomial in five variables with group the fifth roots of unity.     Toward the equivariant setting of the categorification, the PI has completed the technical part of the theory; this project is expected to be finished shortly. The MSP fields is introduced by PI and his collaborators; this is a field interpolating stable maps to projective space with fields and the five-fields on five spin curves. The space of MSP fields admits an equivariant virtual cycles, which paired with the generator of the equivariant cohomology of a point, gives vanishing, whose expression using virtual localization gives relations, proved to be, among Gromov-Witten invariants of quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds and the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants of Fermat quintic polynomial mentioned. This theory has been taking shape during this period research. The PI expects that the first phase of this work will be completed for one more period of this research project.     The theory  of MSP fields is aimed at constructing recursive relations determining all genus Gromov-Witten invariants of quantic Calabi-Yau threefolds. As the constructive definition of such invariants is only known for genus zero and one, this theory potentially will unlock all genus Gromov-Witten invariants of quintics.     This project will play an integral part in the graduate program at Stanford University, in training graduate students and post-docs.
