<AbstractNarration>Kuchment&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0648786&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The series of a tutorial and three workshops is a part of a&lt;br/&gt;semester-long program at the Isaac Newton Institute for&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge, UK.  The program assembles a&lt;br/&gt;large international group of mathematicians and physicists&lt;br/&gt;interested in graph models arising in widely disparate areas of&lt;br/&gt;high practical and theoretical importance.   Analysis on graphs&lt;br/&gt;has been developing very quickly in the last decades, due to&lt;br/&gt;needs of number theory, algebra, probability theory, and spectral&lt;br/&gt;geometry.  This area has experienced recently a surge of new&lt;br/&gt;important applications, new methods, and new models.  New&lt;br/&gt;objects, such as quantum graphs (quantum networks) or&lt;br/&gt;differential operators on fractals, have emerged, which provide&lt;br/&gt;simplified models of complex systems and help with studying&lt;br/&gt;difficult issues such as, for instance, Anderson localization and&lt;br/&gt;quantum chaos.  All these developments have sparked the interest&lt;br/&gt;of experts in other areas of sciences and mathematics in analysis&lt;br/&gt;on graphs and in the diversity of methods employed.   The program&lt;br/&gt;starts with a tutorial workshop where young researchers and&lt;br/&gt;students are introduced to the basics of analysis on graphs,&lt;br/&gt;quantum graphs, and fractals.  Then two workshops follow devoted&lt;br/&gt;to spectral analysis and quantum chaos on quantum graphs and&lt;br/&gt;graph models for nanotechnology, chemistry, optics,&lt;br/&gt;microelectronics, and other areas.  The third workshop addresses&lt;br/&gt;algebraic aspects of analysis on graphs and fractals.  Besides&lt;br/&gt;workshop participation, longer term visits of both established&lt;br/&gt;and young researchers are arranged.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Analysis on graphs has experienced sharp growth in recent&lt;br/&gt;years, due to many new applications that sweep throughout a wide&lt;br/&gt;scientific landscape: computer graphics, information technology,&lt;br/&gt;Internet studies, nanotechnology, microelectronics,&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity, optics, chemistry, and material science. &lt;br/&gt;Researchers in these areas meet problems that are similar to&lt;br/&gt;those faced by mathematicians in areas like number theory,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, differential equations, and spectral theory.  The&lt;br/&gt;program facilitates the urgently needed communication and&lt;br/&gt;cooperation among researchers in different areas of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and sciences.  It thus accelerates progress in this new area that&lt;br/&gt;has extensive applications in crucial scientific and technology&lt;br/&gt;fields, such as nanotechnology, photonics, and material science. &lt;br/&gt;It alsos help to increase participation and visibility of US&lt;br/&gt;researchers in these fields.  Significant training for junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers and graduate students is provided, including&lt;br/&gt;specially designed tutorials, seminars, and open problems&lt;br/&gt;sessions.  A proceedings volume is planned to be published.   The&lt;br/&gt;grant supports US-based participants in the program, mostly US&lt;br/&gt;students, postdocs, junior faculty, women, and other&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
