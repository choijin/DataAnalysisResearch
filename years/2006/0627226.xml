<AbstractNarration>Golden Richard&lt;br/&gt;University of New Orleans&lt;br/&gt;0627226&lt;br/&gt;Panel:  P060969&lt;br/&gt;A Comprehensive Data Carving Architecture for Digital Forensics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important software techniques in digital forensics is &lt;br/&gt;file carving, which uses a database of characteristics about commonly &lt;br/&gt;encountered file types to search physical disks for files of these &lt;br/&gt;types.  File carving is a particularly powerful technique because files &lt;br/&gt;can be retrieved from raw disk images, regardless of the type of &lt;br/&gt;filesystem, even if file metadata has been destroyed.  File carving can &lt;br/&gt;find data associated with deleted files, in slack space, swap files, and &lt;br/&gt;data "hidden" outside the filesystem.  The goal is to identify the &lt;br/&gt;starting and ending locations of files in the disk images and "carve" &lt;br/&gt;(copy) sequences of bytes into regular files so their value as evidence &lt;br/&gt;can be measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, the scope of file carving is narrow and there are significant &lt;br/&gt;limitations.  Patterns for new file types are typically created &lt;br/&gt;manually, which is a tedious and error-prone process. &lt;br/&gt;Current-generation tools generate many false positives, carving files &lt;br/&gt;whose formats are incorrect.  This wastes the time of investigators, who &lt;br/&gt;already have overwhelming caseloads.  In addition, carving has not been &lt;br/&gt;applied extensively to volatile media such as memory and network flows. &lt;br/&gt;RAM carving is useful for low-level detection of installed malware, &lt;br/&gt;where high level detection (e.g., via OS facilities) might be thwarted &lt;br/&gt;by the malware.   Network data flow carving can help investigators &lt;br/&gt;determine whether specific documents were transmitted or whether &lt;br/&gt;versions of specific documents were transmitted.  This research explores &lt;br/&gt;techniques for better automatic identification of documents, by &lt;br/&gt;expanding on the header/milestone/footer search generally employed in &lt;br/&gt;current generation tools.  The research also expands the scope of data &lt;br/&gt;carving to include memory analysis and network flow analysis.   The &lt;br/&gt;entire architecture is be incorporated into the distributed digital &lt;br/&gt;forensics framework created by the PI and his collaborators at the &lt;br/&gt;University of New Orleans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
