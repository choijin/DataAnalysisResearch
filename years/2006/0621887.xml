<AbstractNarration>Low-dimensional Tunable Infrared Detectors Based on a Novel Mask-less &lt;br/&gt;and Self-aligned Process&lt;br/&gt;Hooman Mohseni, Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;0621887&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: It has long been predicted that low-dimensional devices should be able to produce mid- and long-wave infrared detectors that are wavelength selective, and can operate at or near room temperature. Therefore, significant research has been focused on quantum-dot-based infrared detectors. However, the difficulties involved in the processing of nanometer-size quantum dots have prevented successful demonstration of the predicted performance so far. The goal of this program is to develop a novel method for realization of electrically-tunable quantum dots that could avoid the above issues. A novel processing technique based on self-alignment and self-isolation will be used. Optimized devices will be evaluated, and the results will be used to fine-tune the processing over several cycles during the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: High performance mid- and long-wave infrared detectors that can operate at or near room temperature have significant impacts on many medical, industrial, and homeland security applications such as diagnosis of breast cancer, dental and thyroid diseases, fast detection of hidden cracks, and non-metallic landmine detection. Moreover, the method developed under this research program provides a unique approach to suppress phonon scattering and can significantly improve the performance of other devices including quantum cascade lasers and quantum computers. The novel processing methods proposed here should be applicable to a wide range of nano-devices. Also, the results of proposed nano-characterization methods will provide valuable information for the research community working on nano-scale optoelectronic devices.  Undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented and minority groups will be encouraged to take part in this research. The project will take advantage of Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professorate program at Northwestern University in this regard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
