<AbstractNarration>Organizations, government agencies, cooperation, research and education communities have increasing interest in sustainability engineering and science. Although much has been discussed about the concept of sustainability, there have been few opportunities to bring business, industry, engineers, scientists and government together to discuss the way forward to achieve sustainability. The 2nd International Conference on Sustainability Engineering and Science will be an excellent avenue to present some of the most recent achievements in sustainability and debate its application to the real world. This conference will be held at the Faculty of Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, February 20-23, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks further cooperation and facilitates sharing of knowledge, and experiences between US and other countries by supporting travel funds for US delegates to attend this conference. The intellectual merit of this proposal will arise from the overall outcome of the conference: the showcase and exploration of new products and processes, new systems, and new thinking in the field of sustainability engineering and science. The broader impacts include forging international partnerships, and promoting international collaboration between US researchers/educators and those in the Australia/Oceania Continent.</AbstractNarration>
