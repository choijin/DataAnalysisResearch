<AbstractNarration>In this project, we will study the dynamics of the human tear film via a hierarchy of mathematical models with increasingly challenging aspects of the tear film.  The hierarchy will include film surfaces with and without surfactant effects, with surface tension, and with slip on the eye surface.  The models are based on lubrication theory and the resulting high-order nonlinear partial differential equations will be solved using analytical and computational methods.  The results will be closely compared with in vivo measurements of the tear film thickness.  Currently, a finite-difference spatial discretization together with backward-differentiation-formula software for numerically solving ordinary differential-algebraic equations (Daspk) is being used to solve the simplest of our models; two new computational approaches will be developed as well.  One new approach will use radial basis functions as a basis for the method.  The other will modify a moving overset grid method involving the software package Overture, which interpolates between boundary fitted finite volume grids at the edges of the domain and a rectilinear grid in the interior of the domain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of 1998, up to 10 million Americans required the use of artificial tear preparations and dry eye syndrome (DES) accounts for a high percentage of visits to ophthalmologists.  Recent reviews on the subject call for a better understanding of the tear film to improve treatments and products for DES.  This project will develop new mathematical models for the human tear film and will develop new computational methods to solve these problems.  The computational methods will be developed jointly with mathematicians at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and University of Delaware professors and students.  The results will be closely compared with in vivo measurements of tear film thickness dynamics made in the College of Optometry at the Ohio State University.  The impacts of these results will be twofold.  First, we will provide new quantitative understanding of the tear film for optometrists and ophthalmologists; we hope it will help improve treatment for DES.  Second, the computational methods will be broadly useful in solving difficult time-varying problems in moving non-rectangular geometries.  In accomplishing these goals, we will train PhD students in multidisciplinary applications of mathematical modeling and computational mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported study of the dynamics of the tear film on the eye.  Every time you blink, a thin liquid layer is left on the surface of the eye.  The quality of this thin layer over the cornea affects your eyesight.  Problems such as those from dry eye may affect eye health as well.   The purpose this project was to better understand the dynamics of that thin film of tear fluid.  This award supported the work of two graduate students and their supervisors; both completed their PhD theses in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Delaware with at least part of the thesis on this subject.  The each developed mathematical models and computer codes to solve the problems.  One PhD graduate, Alfa Heryudono, solved a model for what happens in a simple approximation for tear film dynamics during the blink.  His model produced good agreement with in vivo measurements for a valley left in the middle of the tear film after a half blink.  The in vivo measurements came from the College of Optometry at The Ohio State University, and were made by Dr. P.E. King-Smith.  The other student, Kara Maki, studied several models for tear film dynamics.  Two of them were on eye-shaped domains; her papers on this subject are the first to solve problems on such domains to our knowledge.  She was able to compute flow patters that match observations made nearly 40 years ago made by putting lampblack (very fine soot!) into an eye and making crude observations with a slit lamp.  Lampblack particles were observed to go their separate ways with some traveling along the upper lid toward the nose.  Others woud go from the upper meniscus along the upper eyelid, around the outer canthus (corner of the eye) and then along the lower meniscus.  This phenomenon was captured in some of the computed results.  This work on eye-shaped domains was in collaboration with Dr W Henshaw of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory using the Overture computational framework developed there.  Dr Maki also studied the effect of reflex tearing in a model for the tear film. Reflex tearing occurs when the eye is irritated, e.g., when one cuts an onion or simply holds one's eye open too long.  The model computed the increase in thickness as it traveled down the eye surface.  The computed changes in the middle of the eye compared very well with experimentally measured values in the middle of the eye in vivo; the measurements were again made by Dr King-Smith and coworkers at The Ohio State University.  Dr Braun also began developing more complex models of tear film dynamics in order to understand more phenomena on the ocular surface.  Those models were under investigation when the grant ended.       Last Modified: 11/29/2010       Submitted by: Richard J Braun]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
