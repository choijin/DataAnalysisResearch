<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Page A&lt;br/&gt;The Louis Stokes Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation&lt;br/&gt;LSMAMP&lt;br/&gt;James Perkins-LSMAMP Project Director&lt;br/&gt;Jackson State University&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The LSMAMP institutions are focusing their collective resources on the rich pool of STEM&lt;br/&gt;students to motivate and mentor them toward BS, MS degrees and impact significantly on the&lt;br/&gt;number choosing the pathway to a STEM doctorate. The synergy that will result from these&lt;br/&gt;institutional interactions to increase minority Ph.D.s will transform the instructional,&lt;br/&gt;research and administrative aspects of cooperation among these institutions in ways never&lt;br/&gt;before envisioned. The requested support for continuation of the LSMAMP to Phase IV will&lt;br/&gt;accelerate this process and contribute to increasing the numbers of minority students&lt;br/&gt;entering the Ph.D. pipeline. The funding of the Phase IV program will continue to&lt;br/&gt;strengthen the foundation for institutionalization of the program in the state of&lt;br/&gt;Mississippi.&lt;br/&gt;The MAMP Bridge to the Doctorate program, coordinated by JSU for the alliance and&lt;br/&gt;supported by NSF, provides the resources to support 24 minority students to pursue&lt;br/&gt;graduate STEM degrees (MS) and then bridge to doctoral programs at MAMP institutions or&lt;br/&gt;other doctoral institutions across the nation. The MAMP Bridge to the Doctorate program&lt;br/&gt;was distinguished as being only one of two in the nation to place 100% of their Cohort I&lt;br/&gt;Bridge to the Doctorate students into doctoral programs. The program developed for Cohort&lt;br/&gt;I students will be shared with all MAMP institutions as a model to be replicated on each&lt;br/&gt;MAMP campus to leverage the NSF funding and increase the total number of undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;MAMP students targeting doctoral studies. Students? having undergraduate research&lt;br/&gt;experiences is fundamental to the success of the Bridge to the Doctorate program.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate research will be a major focus of the Phase IV MAMP program. Each MAMP sites&lt;br/&gt;will provide undergraduate research experiences for their students. MAMP sites will place&lt;br/&gt;students in research internship positions at MAMP institutions or at partner institution&lt;br/&gt;sites. MAMP students will present their research at the annual MAMP research symposium.&lt;br/&gt;Students will also be encouraged to present the results of their research projects at&lt;br/&gt;state and national conferences and meetings such as the Mississippi Academy of Sciences&lt;br/&gt;(MAS), the National Council on Undergraduate Research, the NSF JAM Conference, ABRCMS, and&lt;br/&gt;other professional conferences in their disciplines. The large number of minority students&lt;br/&gt;attending the MAS conference each year, and the steadily increasing number presenting&lt;br/&gt;papers, has benefited the students and has made an indelible impression on the Academy,&lt;br/&gt;fostering a climate of increasing diversity in the scientific environment of the state and&lt;br/&gt;region.&lt;br/&gt;The Phase IV MAMP will include a fresh approach to tracking students after they complete&lt;br/&gt;their BS. A robust website incorporating web-portal technology will be developed to&lt;br/&gt;support communications, networking and student tracking across the MAMP community.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The goal of the LSMAMP program is to establish a secure pathway for&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students to obtain BS, MS and PhD degrees in science,&lt;br/&gt;technology, engineering and mathematics. This proposed project will build upon existing&lt;br/&gt;relationships between MAMP institutions, and partnering institutions, e.g. University of&lt;br/&gt;California campuses, LBL, LLNL, AGEM and MRC to increase the number of minority students&lt;br/&gt;enrolling and matriculating in MS and Ph.D. STEM graduate programs within and outside of&lt;br/&gt;the state of Mississippi. Broader Impacts: The LSMAMP program will increase the number of&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. degrees in STEM areas awarded to minorities, especially African-Americans. We will&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Page A&lt;br/&gt;provide well-qualified and diverse faculty members for U S universities and colleges, as&lt;br/&gt;well as impact the number of scientists and engineers holding the doctorate for employment&lt;br/&gt;in the STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>
