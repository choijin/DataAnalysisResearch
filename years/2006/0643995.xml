<AbstractNarration>Neurons represent information about relevant biological signals in patterns of electrical spiking activity.  Statistical modeling and dynamical systems theory represent two distinct approaches to modeling the activity of neurons, which have largely been developed separately.  However, the neural code is both stochastic and dynamic.  This research and education program provides a link between modeling and data analysis by developing a robust framework for the statistical analysis of neural spiking data.  This research is partially motivated by the increasing recognition that dynamics related to rhythmic and oscillatory brain signals play an important role in many cognitive states such as attention, memory, perception, and language, while abnormalities in these rhythms are associated with neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental objective of this research is to develop a framework for the analysis of neural spike train data that incorporates dynamical state models of neural and other biological signals. This objective will be achieved by a combination of theoretical development of dynamical models and mathematical algorithms, and the application of this theory to the analysis of recorded neural data at multiple scales, including individual neurons, small microcircuits, and larger networks across brain regions.  The theoretical component of this research project will extend earlier results using point process methods to more accurately describe and more efficiently extract information from spike trains.  New stochastic neural models that include dynamic state variables will be explored, and estimation algorithms based on point process likelihoods and posterior distributions will be derived.  This framework will then be applied to problems of relating spiking activity to dynamic oscillatory signals in spiny stellate cells from the medial entorhinal cortex of the rat and in subthalamic nucleus in patients with Parkinson's disease.  The theory will inform the applications by providing methods for neural estimation and model evaluation, while these applications will inform the theory by promoting the development of new physiologically relevant neural models.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This work has helped us understand neural mechanisms of memory function and tasks like navigation.   We have also applied these methods to the study of human physiology and of disease processes. We have applied our statistical models to activity in deep brain structures related to movement in patients with ParkinsonÆs disease in order to understand the pathological activity that leads to motor deficits in this disease. We found that minor changes in the influence of past activity on the spiking probability in these structures that likely arise due to dysregulation of the brain network in these deep areas leads to pathological, uncontrolled rhythmic activity across a wide range of brain areas.

This research has provided the preliminary findings for a current study on ParkinsonÆs disease therapy with the goal of improving deep brain stimulation for the motor symptoms of ParkinsonÆs disease, by using recorded activity to improve electrode placement.   Recently, we have also used these methods to study how spiking activity in the sympathetic nervous system is used to control the cardiac rhythm. We have constructed models to characterize the precise spiking patterns associated with changing heart rate as a simple exercise is used to excite the sympathetic nervous system.  This research represents an important step towards understanding mechanisms of human sympathetic control of the cardiovascular system.   We have constructed models of neural connections in a subset of neurons from the crab stomach using their spiking activity. As opposed to standard modeling techniques, which have been previously shown to fail to capture the correct connectivity patterns and mechanisms for rhythmic activity in this system, we were able to accurately reconstruct known anatomical features and mechanisms within this system.   Finally, we developed a method to combine computational, mechanistic models of the activity of individual neurons with statistical techniques to estimate model components directly from data. Classically, mechanistic neural models are estimated through a laborious process of hand tuning. Our results suggest that this approach could be replaced in the future by automated methods that are able to successfully uncover ionic currents and mechanisms that lead to both heal...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
