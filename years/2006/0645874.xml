<AbstractNarration>The 2007 Biannual Meeting of The International Community of Teachers of Mathematical Modeling and Applications (ICTMA-13) will be held on Indiana University's Bloomington campus on June 24-28, 2007. ICTMA-13's theme is Modeling Students' Modeling Abilities  Focusing on Design Sciences. Because this theme emphasizes both mathematics and science, both content issues and learning issues, and both issues of theory and practice, it provides an ideal crossroads to promote profitable discussions among researchers who rarely cross paths at conferences associated with existing professional organizations in mathematics education, science education, engineering education, learning sciences, cognitive sciences, instructional technologies, mathematics, the natural sciences, or the life sciences.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks support to: (a) hold two interacting and specially targeted research workshops within ICTMA-13 and (b) hold a series of videoconference seminars to maintain working relationships among junior-senior researcher partnerships established at this meeting. One of the most important goals of the proposed project is to help lay the groundwork for progress toward the development of a new research community which draws on multiple research perspectives  and which focuses on the development of the kinds of knowledge and abilities that students will need for success in a global society, in knowledge economies, and in a technology-based age of information&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of these workshops and seminars can be found in the goals:&lt;br/&gt;o To establish strong working relationships involving researchers in engineering&lt;br/&gt;education and those focusing on K-12 mathematics education, and&lt;br/&gt;o To establish strong working relationships among specially identified pairs of&lt;br/&gt;junior and senior level researchers in the preceding fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of these workshops and seminars will be realized through the number of publications produced from the meetings, and by the pairing of internationally known senior researchers, from a wide variety of fields, with junior researchers who have been identified as having exceptional potential.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
