<AbstractNarration>Zheng&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0603859&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies the Euler equations modeling&lt;br/&gt;inviscid fluids, Cahn-Hilliard and Ginzburg-Landau equations in&lt;br/&gt;phase-field modeling of alloys, and nonlinear variational wave&lt;br/&gt;equations modeling liquid crystals.  His objectives are to gain&lt;br/&gt;both better understanding and simplifications of complexity&lt;br/&gt;(which includes complexity reduction for multi-dimensional shock&lt;br/&gt;reflection problems), of the effect of solutes on the enhancement&lt;br/&gt;of strength of alloys, and of the mechanism of singularity&lt;br/&gt;formation in air, water, and liquid crystals.  The methods&lt;br/&gt;include hard, soft, and asymptotic analysis, numerical&lt;br/&gt;computation, and techniques of mathematical modeling.  The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical issues are fundamental for the understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;respective subject areas.  For instance, a model is sought in&lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional shock reflection problems to reduce possible&lt;br/&gt;turbulence and thus bring the complexity to a comprehensible&lt;br/&gt;level and settle the von Neumann paradoxes (e.g., the paradoxical&lt;br/&gt;boundary between regular shock reflection and Mach reflection). &lt;br/&gt;The issue in the phase-field model of alloys is to provide a&lt;br/&gt;quantitative as well as qualitative foundation for manipulating&lt;br/&gt;solutes to strengthen the alloys.  Study of these mathematical&lt;br/&gt;issues (1) yields new understanding regarding alloys, liquids,&lt;br/&gt;gases, and liquid crystals, which are critical for the&lt;br/&gt;advancement of many engineering sciences such as solid solution&lt;br/&gt;hardening, aerospace engineering, robot designing, and energy&lt;br/&gt;efficient devices; (2) provides advanced training for graduate&lt;br/&gt;students or postdoctoral researchers; (3) enhances collaboration&lt;br/&gt;and cross-training between mathematics, material research, and&lt;br/&gt;physics, thereby establishing a foundation for training students&lt;br/&gt;in this broad area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies some applied mathematical problems&lt;br/&gt;in fluid dynamics (which includes the motion of air and water),&lt;br/&gt;modeling of alloys, and liquid crystal physics in material&lt;br/&gt;science.  Scientists and engineers have used mathematical&lt;br/&gt;equations, called partial differential equations, to model&lt;br/&gt;motions or evolution.  The turbulent nature of fluid flows,&lt;br/&gt;defects in materials, and the complexity of life show up in the&lt;br/&gt;form of singularities and instabilities in the solutions of the&lt;br/&gt;equations or in the complexity of the equations themselves.  In&lt;br/&gt;cases where the equations are quite simple, it is these&lt;br/&gt;singularities and instabilities that often spoil accurate&lt;br/&gt;numerical computations of the solutions.  The investigator uses&lt;br/&gt;analytical mathematical tools to study the structures of the&lt;br/&gt;singular solutions.  In the case of a compressible gas such as&lt;br/&gt;air, for example, he isolates typical singularities (hurricanes,&lt;br/&gt;tornadoes, shocks, etc.) and investigates their individual&lt;br/&gt;structures.  The result of the investigation is a clearer&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the worst possible -- most singular --&lt;br/&gt;solutions, or a drastic reduction of complexity, which quantifies&lt;br/&gt;our knowledge of the physics and offers guidance in&lt;br/&gt;high-performance numerical computations of general solutions. &lt;br/&gt;Such results influence scientific areas such as weather&lt;br/&gt;forecasting, alloys, liquid, gases, and liquid crystals, and&lt;br/&gt;provide critical knowledge for the advancement of many&lt;br/&gt;engineering sciences such as solid solution hardening, aerospace&lt;br/&gt;engineering, robot design, and energy-efficient devices.  In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the project provides opportunities for advanced&lt;br/&gt;training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and&lt;br/&gt;enhances collaboration and cross-training between mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;material research, and physics, creating a foundation for&lt;br/&gt;training students in this broad area. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
