<AbstractNarration>This research is focused at separating and sorting the microscopic particles found in many scientific and industrial processes.  Control over the size distribution and type of such particles is essential in the pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and scientific communities today.  The goals of this research are to (i) use advanced holographic optical traps as a non-invasive, non-destructive means of particle separation and manipulation and (ii) to develop the theory, currently lacking, for designing these processes.  The novelty of this work is that custom-tailored optical traps will be developed depending on the properties of the particles to be manipulated. Mathematical models, developed as part of the research work, will incorporate the basic input parameters such as the optical trap landscape, particle size, particle type, and temporal variation of trap geometry. These models will be validated by comparison with experimental results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will open the door for new clinical, manufacturing, and research applications for optical traps and lead to advances in many essential fields. Both graduate and undergraduate students will have the chance to participate in the research through research assistantships and a Purdue undergraduate fellowship. Also, a subsequent Research Experience for Undergraduates research will be written to the NSF to support a second undergraduate student on the project. The results of the research will be disseminated to both graduate and undergraduate students as learning units in Wereley's Micro/Nanoscale Physical Processes class and his Micro/Nano Fluid Mechanics class. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
