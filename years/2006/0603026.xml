<AbstractNarration>This MWN (Materials World Network) project is a joint research and education activity between Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Wales, in Swansea.  The project is centered around fabricating ordered nano/microporous organic materials, using a simple but elegant way to create macroporous structures with three-dimensional order from a variety of polymers in a very short time. This is based on the phenomenon of "breath figures", the result of moisture condensing on a cold surface.  The self-assembly and crystallization of water droplets to produce a very ordered array of two- and three-dimensionally packed holes in a polymer film will be used in applications ranging from picoliter "beakers" to scaffolds for tissue engineering. The chemical physics of phenomena involved during the self-assembly of breath figures--nucleation and growth, noncoalescence, surface tension driven instabilities, packing of spheres and heat/mass transport -- will be studied.  The goal of the research is to determine the growth laws for breath figures formed over a volatile fluid surface, and the mechanism that leads to noncoalescence of the water droplets.  These measurements will be made using a high-speed video microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, with emphasis on its integration with research, and an international collaboration providing both scientific and educational benefits. These include: interdisciplinary and international research opportunities, integrated research and education, and a "best practices" approach which will take advantage of the expertise and diversity of an international group at multiple educational levels.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
