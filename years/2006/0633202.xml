<AbstractNarration>Assessment/Research (91)&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;The Peer-Led Team Learning model (PLTL) has been in use for a decade in chemistry and for shorter periods in biology and physics.  While assessment data indicate that the PLTL approach is effective in reducing attrition and in raising average grades in introductory science courses, there is not a single published study of the process that makes PLTL such an effective learning environment in undergraduate science education. Evaluation data indicate that the Washington University PLTL program is effective at improving students' academic performance by, on average, one-half of a letter grade, in keeping with the national experience. This study is examining in detail what transpires within the PLTL sessions at Washington University, and how different dynamics might differentially affect student performance, by bringing to bear expertise in both chemistry education and in the study of collaborative discourse.  A better understanding of exactly what takes place in successful PLTL groups has potential to enhance peer leader training and improve the design of the sessions. Thus the initial objectives of this project are to: (1) investigate the conversational and group dynamics during the PLTL sessions between the students themselves and between the peer leader and the students; (2) identify potential correlations between different patterns of student-student discourse and different student outcomes in the general chemistry first-semester course; and (3) identify potential correlations between the patterns of interaction between the peer leader and other students and different student outcomes in the general chemistry first-semester course.  Using the results of this discourse analysis, the secondary objectives of this study are to refine and improve: the peer leader application process, the peer leader selection criteria, peer leader training, student discussion materials, optimal group size, and the organizational arrangements.  Additional objectives are to (1) increase the faculty's understanding of how group learning and active learning improve student understanding and performance in general chemistry and (2) provide undergraduates with the opportunity to obtain research experience in chemical education.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the proposed activities: The analysis of patterns of PLTL discourse is enhancing understanding of how PLTL works to improve student learning. This project is using that knowledge to inform instructors using PLTL how to improve peer-leader training and the design of the PLTL sessions.  This research is also contributing to broader understanding of what makes student collaboration an effective pedagogical tool. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of project:  Findings are being used initially to improve peer-leader training and PLTL design at the host institution. These findings are also being disseminated via talks and publications in both the chemical education community and the broader education community.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
