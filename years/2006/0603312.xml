<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating fully on-line versions of the college's Process Plant Technology and Power Plant Operations associate's degree programs.  The second and third semester courses requiring completion of laboratory courses and experiments using a wide variety of equipment are utilizing an Advanced Process Control Trainer that gives the ability to operate time sensitive process control equipment via internet.  This project is answering questions about the practicality and reliability of doing complex laboratory experiments over the internet.  An on-line collection of laboratory exercises and exams that can be completed off-campus is allowing users to complete requirements for several process plant technology courses.  A series of mini-exercises for current operators and maintenance personnel is allowing them to upgrade their skills on a new operating control system in a safe environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation consists of monitoring the project activities to ensure timely development of the educational materials and comparing on-line versions of the developed courses with the face-to-face versions to highlight differences in the quality of student learning.  Curriculum materials are being disseminated via the web, with free on-line mini courses available for downloading as well as CD-ROM distribution at the annual meeting of the Center for the Advancement of Process Technology.</AbstractNarration>
