<AbstractNarration>Northern Arizona University (NAU) will continue to train students from under-represented minority groups through the Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB) program. During the 2004-05 academic year, more than 18% of NAU's student body were Native American or Hispanic (1,300 and 2,200 students, respectively), providing an ample pool of talented students. About twenty faculty mentors, involved in six different research areas, are committed to work together in the UMEB program to achieve two main objectives: 1) recruit and retain talented students in environmental biology; and 2) prepare students for careers in environmental biology including entry into graduate programs. Northern Arizona University's UMEB program combines coursework, mentoring, individual research, and outreach activities.  All scholars enroll in the UMEB seminar: Foundations of Research (ENV 499).  During the first semester, students are introduced to all of the research mentors and the array of research opportunities from which to choose. At the end of fall semester each scholar selects his or her own mentor; and during the second semester, each one prepares a research prospectus based on his or her interest.  Past experience has shown that retention of UMEB scholars is greatly enhanced by engaging four layers of support: program staff, mentors, peer support, and university services particularly suited to provide culturally sensitive support for students (Multicultural Student Center, Native American Student Services, and the Department of Applied Indigenous Studies). The theme of the UMEB program: "melding science with traditional ways of knowing" is based on experiences gained during the first UMEB program. Native American students are often challenged to find a balance between modern science and the wisdom of ages. Mentoring these students has brought an increased understanding of the profound value of traditional knowledge, particularly for solving complex environmental problems.
