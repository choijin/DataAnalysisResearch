<AbstractNarration>This Materials World Network award to Case Western Reserve University is to promote cooperative research in materials between US investigators and their counterparts from two German institutions, namely the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics in Halle and the University of Paderborn, in the design, preparation and study of photonic crystals (PCs) with a dynamic or nonlinear band gap. This award, co-funded and managed by the Electronic Materials program in the Division of Materials Research, aims to create and study hybrid materials based on macroporous silicon and titania and consciously designed organic third-order nonlinear optical materials. These activities include: (i) the design, fabrication and characterization of ordered porous substrates and devices that form the basis for PCs with dynamic band gaps; (ii) the synthesis of tailor-made low-molecular weight and polymeric organic nonlinear optical chromophores which exhibit large optical nonlinearities and appropriate physico-chemical properties to wet and fill the porous substrates; (iii) the study of the infiltration mechanisms along with the investigation of the formation of mesophases inside the pores; and (iv) the optical characterization of the bulk properties of the nonlinear optical materials and devices based on inorganic/organic photonic hybrid systems. These structured materials are characterized by a spatially periodic variation of the dielectric permittivity and, due to the use of nonlinear optical materials, display variable optical properties. Materials with dynamic optical band gap may form the physical basis for ultra-fast optical switches, which are of considerable technological interest and could enable a plethora of applications that range from high-density optical data processing to adaptive optics to high-throughput communications systems.  This award is also co-funded by the Western Europe Program in the Office of the International Science and Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is at the interface of materials chemistry, polymer science and engineering, inorganic microfabrication, as well as optical and device physics. It contributes new and original ideas to the current international efforts focused on the creation of a new class of optical materials, the fundamental understanding of these systems and their exploitation in technologically relevant applications.  The award would result in new knowledge and materials that potentially will benefit society by the creation of new products and technologies. The research activities are designed to integrate research and education, to provide an exciting learning environment and to create teaching opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The interdisciplinary research approach and the planned exchange programs would have long-lasting beneficial relationship between US and German researchers at all levels. The proposed research draws on and supports research infrastructure assembled through federal and state grants at Case Western Reserve University. A partnership with the Cleveland Museum of Natural History promises to enhance the scientific and technological education of the public and outreach to children from inner city schools.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
