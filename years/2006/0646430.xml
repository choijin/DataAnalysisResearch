<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This SGER award supports a study focused on the architectural alternatives and research challenges of next generation Cyber Physical Systems (CPS).  Its goal is to stimulate a cross-disciplinary discussion and debate on CPS research topics and projects.   Cyber Physical Systems are carefully engineered mission-critical systems that interact with the physical world and whose operations are integrated, monitored, and controlled by an intelligent computational core. Many existing systems can be considered "first generation" (1G) CPS systems. Fly-by-wire aircrafts are an example of integrated CPS that operates mostly autonomously. Robot-serviced manufacturing production lines are an example of distributed CPS that requires careful coordination among its many components. Although these 1G CPS systems have contributed significantly to our economy and society, they have been built through expensive ad hoc methods and have difficulties adapting and evolving. Recent examples of such difficulties include new aviation technology, and the financial losses and transformation of the automotive industry due to aging manufacturing plants.  This CPS study is expected to contribute towards a long-term vision and agenda for Cyber-Physical Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
