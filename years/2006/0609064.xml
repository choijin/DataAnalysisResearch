<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This NIRT proposal focuses on development of innovative processes for fabrication of quantum and molecular devices use the novel horizontal 1-D AAO array nanotemplate. The research is divided into four main thrusts. In the first thrust, the PIs will refine the process for improving the 1-D horizontal AAO nanostructure, reduce the pore size of the 1-D nanotemplate down to 1 nm using atomic layer deposition, and grow a 1-D array of carbon nanotubes and nanowires aligned horizontally on the silicon substrate. In the second thrust, the PIs will fabricate single-electron transistor (SET) arrays based on the horizontal 1-D array of nanowires. In the third thrust, they will utilize the horizontal 1-D nanpore array for fabrication of in-wire molecular junction arrays and use the horizontal 1-D array of CNTs for fabrication of nanoscale electrodes to isolate single molecules. In the fourth thrust, they will characterize the horizontal 1-D array of nanopores and individual in-wire nanodevices using conductive AFM.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activities is to advance the self-assembled AAO template technique toward high-level and large-scale integration of devices compatible with the mainstream planar process technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed work include significant advancement of critical bottom-up self-assembly processes, enhancement of multidisciplinary research, education and training of tomorrows scientists and engineers in nanotechnology. The research proposed here will lay a foundation for high-density and large-scale integration of nanotube and nanowire-based quantum and molecular devices. This unique horizontal 1-D structure will find broad applications in basic understanding of transport of molecules, new fabrication procedures, and practical industrial applications. The proposed education activities will enhance the involvement of graduate students in the multidisciplinary environment and also impact Appalachian communities (economically depressed group) through focused education outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
