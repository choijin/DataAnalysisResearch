    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop nanostructured, flexible, inorganic-organic hybrid aerogel composite insulation materials. The proposed material will combine the typical advantages of organic polymers with the advantages of inorganic aerogels, exhibiting excellent flexibility, toughness, durability, and hardness, coupled with the low density and superior thermal insulation properties associated with nanoporous aerogels. The proposed flexible hybrid aerogel composites will provide superior lightweight, thermal insulation suitable for many commercial, aerospace, and military markets with specific applications in outdoor sports apparel, spacesuits, military uniforms, and firefighter suits working in harsh environmental conditions. The proposed hybrid aerogel composites will reduce the weight of conventional insulation materials, reducing fatigue of the wearer without sacrificing insulation performance. Furthermore, increasing the insulation factor of the garment will allow longer durations in harsh environments, offering longer and greater protection from the elements. Additionally, the proposed aerogel composites can be recycled for use as impact modifiers and/or fillers for conventional plastics.</AbstractNarration>
