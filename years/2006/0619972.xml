<AbstractNarration>Social displays such as courtship behaviors are the result of interactions of brain chemistry, hormones and social environment. Because the physiological mechanisms that control these behaviors can be quite complex a relatively simple animal model will be used to ask questions about fundamental neurochemistry and neural pathways that may underlie such important behaviors for all vertebrates. Male frog courtship behavior and calling behavior is an excellent model to study such brain-behavior interactions. Male frogs must call in order to attract females to mate and frog brains share anatomical similarities to many animals, including humans. The roles of dopamine, a neurotransmitter and arginine vasotocin, a neurohormone, will be used for modulating the calling behavior of frogs. Specific drugs will be used that will either activate or block the pathways associated with each neurochemical and quantify changes in the animals' behavior. Both arginine vasotocin and dopamine have independently been shown to be potent modulators of social behaviors in many animals, but little is known if they interact. The frog model is well suited to answer such questions. It is expected that these two important brain chemicals do interact and that the actions of one system will influence the actions of the other. This project will allow us to determine how these two chemical systems interact to modulate important social behaviors. The PI will conduct her research together with students from Spelman College in Atlanta Georgia, a historically black liberal arts college for women. These young women of color will gain a rigorous academic experience in neuroscience and behavior. Finally, as part of the PI's focus in integrating her research with her classroom teaching, many Spelman students will be provided with an opportunity to explore neuroscience and research-related career options. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
