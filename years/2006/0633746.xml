<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating a student-centered learning environment where students are challenged to think critically, to be effective team players, and to be self-directed lifelong learners.  To appeal to diverse learning syles, the investigators are developing instructional materials based on a hybrid of Problem-Base Learning (PBL) and Active/Cooperative Learning (ACL) techniques that incorporate both visual, interactive teaching methods and extensive use of modern computational approaches.  They are mapping the department's objectives and ABET outcomes to the electromagnetic courses to identify objectives and outcomes for each course.  Each course has a "Course Portfolio" with six or seven PBL modules containing instructional and assessment materials along with suggested teaching strategies. MATLAB-based interactive programs and in-class ACL activities are being developed and included in the material.  The evaluation effort, led by an local expert in evaluation, uses quantitative and qualitative techniques to assess instructional materials, the learning process, student learning, and retention. The materials and results are being disseminated through conferences, journal papers, and websites and through a faculty workshop.  The broader impacts include the dissemination of the materials and the involvement of a substantial number of Hispanic students at this institution.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The ratings for the course-specific objectives improved from 74% to an average of  80%.     In the light of the above mentioned activities, we conclude with the following points:  The integrated approach in designing and administering a course is a very powerful tool to enhance both the teaching and learning process.  A conducive learning environment is a prerequisite to any kind of learning. Combination of ACL and Team-based learning are powerful tools to stimulate and enhance the student learning. We are able to meet the course specific objectives reasonably well, although no statistical significance can be linked at this time. We believe that there does not exist a single strategy to maximize student learning; one has to take a composite, holistic, and broader approach. Formative assessment is a powerful tool if iteratively integrated into the course throughout the semester and across semesters. Student management teams are a powerful way to obtain feedback from class and to tak...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
