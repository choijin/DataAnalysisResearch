<AbstractNarration>During the past decade there has been tremendous interplay among&lt;br/&gt;discrete mathematics, theoretical computer  science, probability&lt;br/&gt;theory, and statistical physics.  This project brings together&lt;br/&gt;researchers from these various fields to explore topics at their&lt;br/&gt;interface, the field coming to be called Discrete Random Systems.&lt;br/&gt;The focus is on probabilistic algorithms and models that  arise in&lt;br/&gt;the study of physical systems and combinatorial structures, with strong&lt;br/&gt;themes running through these interactions including:  phase transitions;&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic combinatorics; Markov-Chain Monte Carlo and other&lt;br/&gt;random walks;  and random structures and randomized algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;A series of workshops will address properties of  large graphs, complex&lt;br/&gt;networks and applications, Markov chain sampling (theory vs. practice),&lt;br/&gt;and phase transitions in random structures. Focused working groups of&lt;br/&gt;researchers will concentrate on the interface between Markov chains&lt;br/&gt;and phase transitions, on heuristic and rigorous approaches to identifying&lt;br/&gt;and analyzing phase transitions in algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discrete Random Systems is a relatively new field that solidified&lt;br/&gt;during an interdisciplinary series of workshops held at the DIMACS&lt;br/&gt;Center and the Institute for Advanced Study ten years ago. Since then&lt;br/&gt;it has matured considerably, and the truly bilateral exchange between&lt;br/&gt;discrete mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists on the one&lt;br/&gt;hand, and probabilists and statistical physicists on the other, has&lt;br/&gt;radically impacted research directions and understanding in all of&lt;br/&gt;these fields.  The field explores algorithms and models that arise in&lt;br/&gt;both the study of physical systems and the mathematical structures&lt;br/&gt;arising from the fields of combinatorics and theoretical computer&lt;br/&gt;science, with an emphasis on analogous behavior such as phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions.  The current project seeks to foster and speed the&lt;br/&gt;development of this interdisciplinary field and to bring to it&lt;br/&gt;coherence as well as rapid scientific development.  The project will&lt;br/&gt;be organized around a series of workshops, tutorials, research working&lt;br/&gt;groups, and a visitor program, all intended to facilitate new&lt;br/&gt;interactions.  Workshops allow a cross-fertilization of ideas and&lt;br/&gt;techniques from the disparate disciplines.  Less formal groups of&lt;br/&gt;researchers will convene for concentrated collaborative research on&lt;br/&gt;specialized topics, and additional working groups will evolve during&lt;br/&gt;the project.  Exploration of new areas of application of Discrete Random&lt;br/&gt;Systems will be enhanced by parallel DIMACS programs in Biology,&lt;br/&gt;Epidemiology, the Social Sciences, and Homeland Security. The ideas&lt;br/&gt;developed in this project will have impact on a myriad of fields and&lt;br/&gt;create many new cross-disciplinary connections. A visitor program will&lt;br/&gt;encourage senior and junior researchers, including students, to&lt;br/&gt;participate in collaborative research spawned by the workshops and in&lt;br/&gt;the work of the working groups. Each workshop will have a fund for&lt;br/&gt;support of graduate students and postdocs and workshops will have a&lt;br/&gt;substantial educational component through significant tutorial&lt;br/&gt;components.  The topic lends itself well to undergraduate research and&lt;br/&gt;participating faculty will coordinate topics with an undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;research program (REU program) already in existence.  The project is&lt;br/&gt;expected to have a long-term impact well beyond its two year duration&lt;br/&gt;since the workshop, working group, visitor, and dissemination&lt;br/&gt;components of the project will allow the ideas developed to reach&lt;br/&gt;hundreds of people nationwide and worldwide.  The project should&lt;br/&gt;significantly influence the careers of a large number of outstanding&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers and it should play an important role in the&lt;br/&gt;training and development of scientists who are well-prepared to become&lt;br/&gt;leaders in the field of Discrete Random Systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
