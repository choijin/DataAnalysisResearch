<AbstractNarration>The project will revamp two academic programs in the department of Engineering Technology (ENGT) at Savannah State University in order to provide students and the community the opportunity to participate fully in the rapidly unfolding and dominant socio economic issues of energy and environment.  Specifically, Savannah State University will offer formal and focused education in alternative energy technology (AET) and environmental engineering technology (ENVET) within the Electronics Engineering Technology and Civil Engineering Technology degree programs. The project will result in the curriculum for certificates in Distributed/Alternative Energy Systems Technology, Environmental Restoration and Management Technology, and Energy and the Environment Studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical content of the curriculum to be developed will address contemporary societal/national problems such as, the energy crises, the impact of fossil fuel on the environment, and environmental remediation and waste management. The curriculum will produce graduates knowledgeable of alternative energy technologies for the rapidly emerging industry. The curriculum will consist of formal course work, undergraduate research training and internships. This curriculum will meet national standards as would be affirmed by TAC of ABET accreditation of the two degree programs in the department. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This curriculum will be accessible to students in the social sciences as well as the natural sciences who may wish to minor in any of the specific areas. The curriculum will thus be designed to reflect an interdisciplinary content and will address both the social and technical aspects of energy, and environmental issues. Most importantly, the new curriculum will offer Engineering technology students the opportunity to concentrate in one of the focus areas in their baccalaureate degree programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce a cadre of minority engineering technologists, scientists and social scientist with the competencies to participate in the alternative energy industry as technologists, decision makers, community/civic activists and better custodians of the environment. It will help to produce a diversified workforce for the alternative energy industry, and the environmental services industry as well as educate individuals from disenfranchised communities on the efficient use of energy and environmental responsibility.</AbstractNarration>
