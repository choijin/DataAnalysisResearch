<AbstractNarration>The U.S. ATLAS Operations Program aims to provide U.S. university scientists with access to the unique&lt;br/&gt;LHC science opportunities through a balanced program that encompasses: (1) the technical effort&lt;br/&gt;associated with maintenance and operation of the U.S.-built detector subsystems, essential in achieving a&lt;br/&gt;detailed understanding of the detector for physics results; (2) the maintenance and refinement of software,&lt;br/&gt;computing and physics analysis support, critical in allowing scientists at U.S. universities to fully exploit&lt;br/&gt;the physics potential of the LHC, in part through the establishment of university-based Tier 2 computing&lt;br/&gt;centers in the U.S. and the expansion of the existing worldwide grid of resources; (3) an R&amp;D program&lt;br/&gt;for detector upgrades, to maximize the physics output during the long period of running expected for the&lt;br/&gt;LHC and maintain U.S. intellectual leadership in accelerator-based particle physics; and (4) a strong&lt;br/&gt;education and outreach program. The ATLAS collaboration, consisting of 151 institutes from 34&lt;br/&gt;countries, is completing construction of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at&lt;br/&gt;CERN, and preparing for initial data taking in 2007. The 34 institutions of U.S. ATLAS, with the support&lt;br/&gt;of NSF, have made major and unique contributions to the construction of the ATLAS detector, and&lt;br/&gt;continue to provide critical support for the ATLAS computing and software program, and pre-operations&lt;br/&gt;tasks as the detector is commissioned at CERN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The goal of the U.S. ATLAS Operations Program is to empower U.S. physicists to&lt;br/&gt;address some of the most profound questions in particle physics today: what is the physical origin of&lt;br/&gt;mass? Do supersymmetric particles exist and will they shed light on the nature of dark matter? Does&lt;br/&gt;space-time have extra spatial dimensions? Answers to these questions would provide a major advance&lt;br/&gt;toward completing a unified view of the particles in nature, the forces with which particles interact, and&lt;br/&gt;their role in the past and future of our universe. This is a time when particle physics researchers have&lt;br/&gt;unusually compelling indications that the step to be taken by the LHC, leading to collision energies far&lt;br/&gt;beyond those available at existing facilities, will lead to especially important discoveries with&lt;br/&gt;implications over a broad field of fundamental science. This program rests on the especially strong&lt;br/&gt;scientific case for investigating the energy regime that will be accessed by the LHC, and benefits from a&lt;br/&gt;program in which the international community is providing a major part of the investment. The bold&lt;br/&gt;initiative of the NSF, in partnership with the DOE, to carry out a very significant portion of the&lt;br/&gt;construction and operations of the ATLAS detector has opened up this opportunity for U.S. scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This proposal will enhance the computing infrastructure for research, education and&lt;br/&gt;beyond. The LHC computing requirements are driving a paradigm shift towards global computing with&lt;br/&gt;potentially significant economic impacts, and our students will be at the forefront in using these new&lt;br/&gt;technologies. NSF-ATLAS groups continue to expand their education and outreach programs, with a&lt;br/&gt;particular focus on high school teachers and students (closely coordinated with QuarkNet), and on&lt;br/&gt;outreach to under-represented populations. We plan on strengthening and expanding our outreach efforts&lt;br/&gt;in the run-up to ATLAS data taking, including plans to help establish a computing center in Africa as part&lt;br/&gt;of our expanding network of worldwide grid facilities. This site will provide a platform on which to&lt;br/&gt;launch a program of Grid-based outreach in Africa. Starting in a few years the LHC will be the major&lt;br/&gt;accelerator-based program in which to train the next generation of physicists. Support for R&amp;D activities&lt;br/&gt;will lay the groundwork for new technologies that might be adopted by other fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
