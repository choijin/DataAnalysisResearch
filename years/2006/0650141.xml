<AbstractNarration>A Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;There are many challenging problems at the interface of computer science and many other&lt;br/&gt;fields. Recently computer scientists have contributed extensively to areas such as DNA&lt;br/&gt;sequence assembly, sequence analysis, protein-protein interactions and intra-cellular signal&lt;br/&gt;communication. However, there are many system-level biology areas which are ripe for&lt;br/&gt;inter-disciplinary approaches. This proposal explores one such area - the immune system.&lt;br/&gt;In response to a microbial infection, the immune cells which are highly specific to small&lt;br/&gt;structural components of the microbe get activated. The process by which this highly parallel&lt;br/&gt;search gets accomplished will be studied. Another challenging problem is the process by&lt;br/&gt;which the immune cells develop tolerance. Such a study will be useful in understanding how&lt;br/&gt;malignant cells become immortalized evading the immune cells.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide a theoretical foundation to very important immunological&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon. New search algorithms based on spatial and temporal aspects require&lt;br/&gt;development of new theoretical tools.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;New breakthroughs in cancer treatment will depend upon rapid advances in immunology.&lt;br/&gt;Even though generic treatments for cancer (radiation treatment for localized forms and&lt;br/&gt;chemotherapies for metastatic forms) will continue to play dominant roles in cancer treatment,&lt;br/&gt;more targeted antibody and other immunological modalities will become more widely&lt;br/&gt;used. These will have potentially fewer side effects compared to generalized chemotherapies.&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of the immune responses could result in new approaches for&lt;br/&gt;coping with spam, phishing and viral attacks of computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;A-1</AbstractNarration>
