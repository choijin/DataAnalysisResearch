<AbstractNarration>Let G be a complex semi-simple group, and let g be its Lie algebra.&lt;br/&gt;Our main object of study is the Kac-Moody extension g' of the loop&lt;br/&gt;algebra g((t)); more specifically, the category of representations of&lt;br/&gt;g' at the critical level, denoted g'_(crit)-mod. Our goal is to develop a&lt;br/&gt;localization theory for this category, i.e., to relate it to other categories&lt;br/&gt;that are constructed locally out of spaces, endowed with an action&lt;br/&gt;of the loop group G((t)), such as the affine Grassmannian. Ultimately,&lt;br/&gt;we believe that the structure of g'_(crit)-mod is governed by a pattern&lt;br/&gt;of local Langlands correspondence, i.e., its extrinsic structure can be&lt;br/&gt;described solely in terms of the space of local systems on the formal&lt;br/&gt;punctured disc with respect to the Langlands dual group.&lt;br/&gt;The second (and, so far, unrelated) part of the project is the development&lt;br/&gt;of representation theory for groups associated to G and 2-dimensional local&lt;br/&gt;fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of study of the current project is representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;Starting from the 1930's it was realized that there is fairly small list&lt;br/&gt;of types of possible fundamental symmetries that occur in Nature.&lt;br/&gt;These types are called "root data", and the corresponding concrete&lt;br/&gt;mathematical objects are called semi-simple groups. In order to have&lt;br/&gt;a representation theory one has to pick one of those semi-simple&lt;br/&gt;groups and couple it with a data of algebraic or analytic nature, such&lt;br/&gt;as what is known in mathematics as a "field" or "ring", e.g., real or&lt;br/&gt;complex numbers. Having a representation theory, the objects that&lt;br/&gt;one deals with look fairly complicated, and most of the questions that&lt;br/&gt;one can ask are not amenable to complete answers. However, we&lt;br/&gt;hope to find a point of view on representations, which, on the one&lt;br/&gt;hand, would answer some deep questions about their structure, and,&lt;br/&gt;on the other hand, will ultimately reduce to questions about  the&lt;br/&gt;initial data, i.e., the root system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project comprised several directions:     A. Representation theory of affine algebras at the critical level.  The goal of the project was to give an explicit geometric description of the category of representations, which are Iwahori-integrable and on which the action of the center is given by nilpotent opers. Such description was finally proved inthe paper "D-modules on the affine flag variety and representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras",  Representation Theory 13 (2009), 470-680.  In process of doing to, we have developed localization theory for modules at the critical level.   At the conceptual level, thinking about representations of the affine Kac-Moody algebra at the critical level has led us to the formalism of 2-categorical local geometric Langlands correspondence.     B. Quantum geometric Langlands correspondence.  This project is a far-reaching program that is intended to restore symmetry between the group G and its Langlands dual in both the local and global aspects of the theory. The work on this project requires developing the notion of 1-representation of an algebraic group, which in turn requires developing a lot of foundations in derived algebraic geometry.  The initial ingredient is a quantum version of the geometric Satake equivalence established in  "Twisted Whittaker model and factorizable sheaves", Selecta Math. (N.S.) 13 (2008), no. 4, 617-659.     C. Categorical global Langlands correspondence.  The hope of the categorical global Langlands correspondence was to establish an equivalence between the (derived) category D-mod}(Bun(G)) and the (derived) category D-mod(LocSys(G^)). However, it has been known for a while that the above equivalence is wrong as stated. However, recently,  we were able to find an appropriate modification of the right-hand side, so that the resulting conjecture survives the available tests.  I have undertaken the project of writing down the various ingredients of this theory as a series of informal notes available at  http://www.math.harvard.edu/~gaitsgde/GL/     D.
