<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the University of Alaska Museum (ALA) under the direction of Dr. Stefanie Ickert-Bond to incorporate 32,000 specimens of arctic and boreal plants from the J.P. Anderson Collection, recently acquired from Iowa State University. ALA has the largest collection of plant specimens from the Beringia Province. During the Pleistocene Ice Age, this region was free of ice, providing a refuge for terrestrial organisms on the Bering Land "Bridge" and a means by which plants could disperse between Asia and North America. This project will produce an online database with 190,000 digital images of herbarium specimens. Innovative digital tools will be used to automate the capture of data from labels on the herbarium sheets, and to implement an object-tracking system through the use of barcode labels. The data will be added to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, MorphBank, and GenBank. The University of Alaska Museum will organize a workshop for K-12 teachers and students to highlight the utility of living plants in the region as educational tools and to encourage an interest in plants through hands-on activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This  project supported the development of the University of Alaska MuseumÆs  Herbarium, which is one the WorldÆs major collections of far-northern  plants.  NSF funds were used to physically expand the archival space by  42%, and to get specimen-by-specimen data and specimen images from the  collection onto the Internet.   The  worldwide capture of digital data from biological collections, gathered  over centuries, is a goal that will expedite understanding of major  issues in biodiversity, but the backlog of digitally unrecorded  botanical specimens in the U.S is probably about ninety million.  Such a  number defies conventional methods of data capture, such as  keyboarding, and our project successfully demonstrated one approach to  expeditiously eliminating the global backlog.  While about 90,000 of our  herbariumÆs 185,000 specimens were already well represented and  accessible to students and researchers via the Internet, we still faced a  long and tedious task.  But in comparison with other biological  specimens, herbarium sheets (pressed plants) are of nearly uniform size  and essentially two dimensional.  These features make photography of  specimens efficient.  Also, labels are glued to the sheets, so most  specimen data is text within each photograph.    Three  undergraduate students, using a digital camera on a copy stand, plus an  attached computer and bar-code scanner, were able to photograph most of  the collection in a summer, with the work trailing off in the following  academic year.  During that first summer, 1000 to 1500 specimens were  photographed per day.  Some four terabytes of digital photographs are  now stored at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (U Texas, Austin) and  accessible through the Arctos online database  (http://arctos.database.musuem/uam_herb).  The 90,000 previously  digitized and online specimen records are now complimented by  high-resolution photographs, and 165,000 images have been processed with  optical-character-recognition (OCR) software, which attempts to  interpret text in each image.  Though the OCR product is of uneven  quality, it can be (and is) searched online, thereby providing fair  access to the previously un-digitized material, including their images.  Colleagues  at the University of Arizona are now using "natural language  processing" (NLP, a form of artificial intelligence and learning) in an  attempt to parse our OCR product into standard data fields.  This effort  benefits from having the OCR from the 90,000 already standardized  records.  The overreaching goal is to provide a complete protocol for  attacking the huge global backlog of un-digitized botanical specimens.  In  our original proposal, a purchase of 93 cabinets was budgeted.  We made  substantial savings by purchasing double-door cabinets over the  budgeted single-door cabinets, and we received a supplement to install a  high density storage system, which eliminates the need for permanent  aisles, thus allowing more floor space for storage.  This amounts to  room for 39 additional cabinets, or 42 % more space, and will provide  for fourteen years of continued collection growth, as compared to ten  without the compactor storage.  Our  product from this project constitutes a major publicly-accessible  resource on the botany of northern regions, which are taking the current  brunt of climate change. We have also demonstrated protocols which  suggest that the global backlog of un-digitized botanical material might  be eliminated within a meaningful amount of time.
