<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is the development of a printed optically transparent transistor technology for the realization of high-brightness, high-contrast displays at the low cost paradigms enabled by printing.  The approach is the development of the device and materials technologies necessary for realizing a printed transparent electronics technology using ZnO nanoparticles, a promising printable transparent semiconductor.  Initial demonstrations have already resulted in transparent transistors with performing specifications approaching those required for some display applications.  Further engineering at the nanostructural level is expected to result in additional performance improvement, and development of the associated conductor and dielectric technologies will allow the realization of fully-printed ZnO TFTs.  Within this work, the investigators will develop ZnO-based semiconductors and Al-doped ZnO conductors and will integrate these into a fully printed transistor process to realize all-printed transparent electronics for low-cost display applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is technically important since it will contribute to the development of a low-cost, flexible, flat-panel display technology.  With the continued penetration of information technology into everyday life, the availability of ubiquitous display capability at low-cost is crucial.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this proposal include mentorship of undergraduates in research, outreach to high-school students to facilitate their retention in science and engineering, and outreach to underrepresented minority groups through recruiting activities at historically black colleges and universities, with the goal of attracting underrepresented minority students into engineering research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
