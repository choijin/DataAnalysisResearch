<AbstractNarration>The U.S. National Committee (USNC) for the international Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) of the International Council for Science (ICSU) will lead and coordinate participation by the U.S. scientific community in the work of CODATA.  CODATA is concerned with all types of quantitative data resulting from experimental measurements or observations in the natural and social sciences and in the engineering disciplines.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objectives of CODATA are to: improve the quality and accessibility of data, as well as the methods by which data are acquired, managed, and analyzed; facilitate international cooperation among those collecting, organizing, and using data; and promote an increased awareness in the scientific and technical community of the importance of these activities and issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USNC/CODATA proposes to continue to advance these data management and policy objectives by organizing in-depth studies, national and international data conferences, bilateral symposia, federal data forums, Committee meetings at the National Academies, and related Web sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USNC will also identify and suggest ways in which the rapidly changing technological capabilities for creating, manipulating, disseminating, and using digital scientific and technical (S&amp;T) data can address new opportunities and challenges. The opportunities arise primarily in data-intensive research and applications, in the integration of heterogeneous data for new results, and in making vast amounts of factual information available for a broad spectrum of users. The inherent challenges are in effectively managing these data resources for optimal access and use, and for developing the appropriate policies and institutional models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Committee will: coordinate its activities within the National Academies with other data and information technology groups; build on its established relationships with federal and academic data centers, and professional organizations and experts in the United States; and promote U.S. data policies and practices internationally through its many contacts with foreign and intergovernmental scientific umbrella organizations and data activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Uhlir, Principal Investigator     The digital revolution has created new opportunities in the management and use of all types of research (and other) data and information. Most areas of scientific research are now data-driven and this has produced a broad range of quantitative and qualitative improvements in the research enterprise. The communication of research results in myriad forms, both formal and informal, has also increased and improved.

The rapid rate of technological change also has created many challenges in the effective and efficient exploitation of those digital research resources. Many of the organizational and legal models from the print era have been transferred to the digital network context without adjusting sufficiently for the qualitatively different research capabilities online. New models of scholarly exchange and knowledge production are emerging, but they are still poorly understood or not fully established and utilized.
