<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract - OCI  0627026&lt;br/&gt;Routine sharing of data, software, and intermediate findings is becoming an essential mode for&lt;br/&gt;international research teams as they move to Collaborative Team Science. The next generation of&lt;br/&gt;technology for controlling instruments, examining remotely-stored large 3D data sets, enabling high resolution video conferencing, and integrating global resources in real time has been demonstrated at meetings such as Supercomputing and iGRID. Yet, technological, cultural, language factors and disparate methods for sharing information, keep global collaboration and daily use of these technologies out of reach for many &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Established in 2002, the Pacific Rim Application and Grid Middleware Assembly [PRAGMA] is an open organization whose focus is how to practically create, support, and sustain international science and technology collaborations. Specific experiments are postulated, candidate technologies and people are identified to support these experiments, evaluation is performed in our trans-Pacific routine-use laboratory, and successful solutions are integrated into country-specific software stacks or GGF standards. The group harnesses the ingenuity of more than 100 individuals from 25 institutions to create and sustain these long-term activities. PRAGMA plays a critical role as an international conduit for professional interactions, ideas, information, and grid technology. Our multi-faceted framework for collaboration catalyses and enables new activities because of a culture of openness to new ideas. Their pragmatic approach has led to new scientific insights, enhanced technology] and a fundamental sharing of experiences manifest in their routine-use laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the P.I.s and others have made significant progress, the grid (or cyberinfrastructure) remains cumbersome on a routine basis. Underlying glue software changes rapidly, portability and/or interoperability among production grids are rare, and culturally, people are still trying to understand the sea change from "work independently" to "work collaboratively." Their role in PRAGMA has been catalytic in terms of providing enough people and organizational structure to enable progress. The P.I.s propose to continue this role and expand their impact to new application areas, increasing emphasis on data in their routine use laboratory, harness the potential of lambda grids, work with productions grids to achieve interoperations, and broader involvement of middleware developments from outside the Pacific Rim, with focus on the following four key areas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop new and deepen existing collaborations in specific application areas to focus their grid developments and to produce new scientific insight;&lt;br/&gt;2. Enhance and expand our routine use application grid laboratory to allow for middleware and&lt;br/&gt;applications codes to be tested, improved, and lessons learned to be advanced to others;&lt;br/&gt;3. Improve multi-way software dissemination pathways, to ensure access and use of software and middleware throughout the grid community and to promote standards;&lt;br/&gt;4. Strengthen and expand the Pacific Rim community of grid users and developers to broaden its impact on and interactions with new groups and efforts in and beyond the Pacific Rim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will lead to advances in a broader yet targeted set of scientific areas; strengthen the grid operations center and the routine use laboratory; improve essential&lt;br/&gt;middleware; interoperate with the lambda grids; create ties between large national resources; integrate more solid international middleware into the NMI and other middleware frameworks. The impact of the work will be in the strengthening and expanding the conduit and framework for collaboration to help ensure compatibility of international grid efforts; extending strategic US research investments (e.g. .OptIPuter, GEON, NMI, Teragrid, LTER) to other institutions, building a framework for new research and education activities, and incorporating insights/software from Pacific Rim and global partners into US and other global activities. As we continue to learn and disseminate our findings on how to make the grid usable on a routine basis, science and scientists will greatly benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ á The conduct of science is changing, becoming more distributed,  multidisciplinary, and international. Reflecting this trend, groups of distributed  researchers are choosing to work together towards common goals that go beyond their own labs, institutions, and countries. Their collaboration requires  sharing of expertise, instruments, data, analysis tools, and ideas.    PRAGMA, the Pacific Rim Application and Grid Middleware  Assembly, was established in 2002 through a series of workshops. It enables  small-to-medium size international groups around the Pacific Rim to make rapid progress in conducting research and education. PRAGMA develops international, experimental cyberinfrastructure to build long-term collaborations by:  Forging international ôscientific expeditions,öá teams of domain scientists and cyberinfrastructure researchers who solve specific scientific questions by creating usable, international-scale, cyber environments; Developing and improving a grassroots, international cyberinfrastructure components áthat enable both computer science insights and the áleveraging of software investments that go beyond the resources of a single agency; Infusing new ideas by developing new researchers who acquire critical experience in cross-border science, international engagement ofá strategic partners, and new multi-cultural awareness; Building and enhancing the essential people-to-people trust and organization through regular face-to-face meetings.     PRAGMA incubated new scientific networks like GLEON (Global  Lakes Ecological Observation Network, gleon.org) to understand the role of  lakes in providing ecosystems services;á helped form programs that train the next generation of cyber-scientists through research exchanges, e.g., PRIME (Pacific RIM undergraduate Experience, prime.ucsd.edu) in the US, PRIUS (Japan), and MURPA (Australia); enabled the international membership of more than 30 institutions to respond to various disasters or emergencies including SARS (2003) and the Japanese Tsunami (2011); created a persistent, international experimental cyberinfrastructure test bed for international cyberinfrastructure áto develop and test software and advance science.    PRAGMA researchers continually experiment with new technologies to understand how those changes can enhance scientific expeditionsÆ  defined goals.á In 2009, PRAGMA started an experiment to replace most Grid software technology that had powered its distributed test bed. The consortium began the process of building a multiple provider cloud infrastructure with virtual machines as the basic mechanism to enable PRAGMA expeditions to run complex software environments at and across multiple institutions' hardware infrastructure.á Two key insights drove this fundamental change: 1) Custom virtual create unique software environments that meet the diverse needs of different scientific groups (e.g. earthquake ground motion reconstruction, wildfire simulation, lake ecology modeling, and biodiversity modeling); and 2) Virtual machinesá (VMs) can be authored once and re-programmed to operate at a different physical sites, each with a different hosting environment.á The combination of author-once run everywhere allows a custom, purpose-built software stack to be ôprojectedö to any PRAGMA site.
