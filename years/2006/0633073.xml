<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Materials Science (57)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing and testing new classroom materials for the Introduction to Materials course within the engineering curriculum that utilizes an active learning, team-based approach.  These materials are based upon a pedagogical approach developed for chemistry under an NSF CCLI National Dissemination grant (DUE-0231120).  This pedagogy has been termed Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) and is based upon the learning cycle model.  Rather than sitting in traditional lectures, students work in teams to complete worksheets that guide them through the process of learning.  In this way students are actively engaged in processing the information and have the opportunity to utilize and develop important skills such as teamwork, communication, and critical thinking.  POGIL worksheets are being developed which contain the following components: 1) A model or data that illustrate a particular concept; 2) Critical thinking questions that guide the students to process the model or data and lead them to an understanding of the concept; 3) Exercises and problems that allow them to practice using the concept.  Assessment is being conducted, specifically focused on the differential impact of guided inquiry on women and minorities.  The materials are being disseminated for use at other institutions through the POGIL website (www.pogil.org) and one day workshops.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
