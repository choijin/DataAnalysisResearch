<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project tests the feasibility of creating a web-based system to provide intellectual property and technology transfer services to Limited Resource Institutions (LRIs) that are actively engaged in quality research. In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Doyle Act as an incentive for universities to engage in research that would produce innovative products, new drugs and medical devices, etc. for the advancement and benefit of society. Over the last twenty-six years, Bayh-Dole has worked well for America's large research institutions, but it has done the same for small to medium sized research institutions. These institutions lack sufficient funding to establish technology transfer offices to assist with the protection and commercialization of their developments. As a consequence, researchers at these institutions lack the infrastructure necessary to effectuate the development of new products and methods. The grant will be used to test the feasibility of creating a system that automates, streamlines and standardizes the technology transfer process at LRIs. The Virtual Technology Transfer Office (VTTO) will be an innovative web-based system that should significantly increase the number of invention disclosures processed, patents filed, licenses negotiated and spin-off businesses established as a result of technology developed by LRIs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The VTTO will be instrumental in advancing science and technology by bringing together university researchers, small businesses and technology transfer experts. The VTTO will be a tool designed to educate principal investigators about technology transfer as well as provide expert services to support university researchers. Limited Resource Institutions are universities receiving less that $80 million in external research funding. Underrepresented minority groups such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) will be specifically targeted as they are among the LRIs without sufficient on-campus technology transfer support services. The VTTO will provide infrastructure support both to the research administration and the principal investigators. The benefits of the VTTO will positively impact society as innovative products and services are placed on the market. Participation from the greatest number of American universities increases the likelihood that the investment in American schools will result in advances to science and technology. As such, the VTTO will be uniquely designed to manage the technology transfer activities for several institutions simultaneously without commingling the technologies or adversely effecting the confidential nature of the technologies processed by the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
