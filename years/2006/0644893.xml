<AbstractNarration>A Grant to fund Student Travel to Mobicom 2006 in Los Angeles, Sept 24-29, 2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Grant supports travel for students attending Mobicom 2006, in particular assisting  the students with  financial needs. The twelfth ACM International conference on Mobile Communications  (Mobicom 2006) takes place in Los Angeles, California,  September 24-29, 2006. Mobicom 2006 is a high caliber forum for research on systems issues in the area of mobile, wireless communications and computing . Mobicom topics span multiple disciplines, including wireless communication, vehicular communications, personal area networks, ad hoc networks, operating systems, distributed algorithms, data processing, scheduling, sensors, and signal processing. Mobicom provides a cross-disciplinary venue for researchers addressing the design of mobile computing in the context of an integrated system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this NSF Grant is to provide graduate students in the networking and mobile computing area the opportunity to attend Mobicom 2006, meet with leaders in their field and take part in discussions that are likely to shape their future careers. Besides technical paper presentations in the topics mentioned above, the venue offers a wide range of other stimulating activities including panels, tutorials, industry presentations, posters, demos, and keynote talks. Experience shows that the mere exposure to these technical presentations helps students fine tune their research topics and even find new ones, with important  long term benefits to the field at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
