<AbstractNarration>The VIGRE program at the University of Utah builds upon the success of activities initiated in the first round of funding, and launches new activities which will further increase the number of students obtaining leading-edge training and research opportunities in the mathematical sciences.  Over the long term, the Utah VIGRE program will produce and solidify structural changes which will strengthen and broaden the base of well-trained mathematical scientists in the United States.  The program consists of a multifaceted and carefully coordinated set of activities directed at pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral instructors.  The program provides early research experiences for undergraduates and graduate students, and ensures effective mentoring for students and postdoctoral instructors at critical stages of their careers.  The student research programs draw on the strength and breadth of research expertise in the department, and include in many cases interdisciplinary ties to other sciences, engineering, and industry.  A new undergraduate research course is designed to transition more students into research experiences.  The Utah VIGRE project emphasizes increasing diversity within the Mathematics Department at all levels, and strives to attract a broad range of students into careers in the mathematical sciences.  The theme of vertical integration is present in all aspects of the project, with healthy interaction and exchanges of ideas occurring between participants at all levels, from pre-college to faculty.  The program is designed to maximize the long-term effectiveness of VIGRE-funded activities, by striving for self-sufficiency and continuation of the main elements of the project beyond the funding cycle.  To maximize the impact of our programs, a substantial effort is made to broadly disseminate information about our activities, including video of VIGRE minicourses, and a variety of web-based resources for others interested in emulating our programs.</AbstractNarration>
