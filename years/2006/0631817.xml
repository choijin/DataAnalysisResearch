<AbstractNarration>The project is a direct result of a funded NST TCUP Planning Grant. It has been determined that recruitment,&lt;br/&gt;retention, and research are the greatest needs. Students at SCC will build its capacity to offer&lt;br/&gt;STEM disciplines through reformed STEM coursework, research, and internship activities. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed activity will yield data which will assist SCC in STEM enhancement. This approach&lt;br/&gt;will also provide facilitate matriculation of our two-year graduates into a four year institution of&lt;br/&gt;higher education or the job market. Faculty will develop a research base and research agenda,&lt;br/&gt;which will involve all SCC students, faculty members, and other tribal programs.</AbstractNarration>
