<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for the acquisition of a laser scanning Multi-photon Confocal Microscopy Facility&lt;br/&gt;(MCMF) that will support a core group of faculties at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) spanning eight&lt;br/&gt;departments and two colleges. The MCMF facility will include a point-by-point standard and resonant&lt;br/&gt;scanning module capable of acquiring images with high spatial and temporal resolutions, a multi-photon&lt;br/&gt;system consists of Coherent Chameleon XR Ti-Sapphire pulsed laser, and a fluorescence lifetime imaging&lt;br/&gt;microscopy (FLIM) module. Acquisition of a laser scanning multi-photon confocal microscope will fill a&lt;br/&gt;void in the existing imaging facilities at CMU by providing experimental capabilities that include&lt;br/&gt;fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and will have an&lt;br/&gt;immediate impact in numerous established and nascent research projects of senior and junior faculties&lt;br/&gt;investigating the structure and dynamics of soft materials. For example, MCMF will allow (a) direct&lt;br/&gt;visualization of phase transitions, self-assembly, defect dynamics, and morphology evolution in synthetic&lt;br/&gt;soft materials, (b) real-time imaging of cellular and sub-cellular localization of native and synthetic&lt;br/&gt;macromolecules related to fundamental biological discovery and disease therapy in biological soft&lt;br/&gt;materials, and (c) development of adaptive algorithms for efficient acquisition and analysis of complex&lt;br/&gt;biological images. The MCMF will also offer a unique opportunity for integration into classroom&lt;br/&gt;instruction and outreach activities by offering the possibility for students to gain direct, "hands-on"&lt;br/&gt;experience with microscale and smaller systems including cells, macromolecules and microdevices. Our&lt;br/&gt;goal is to use the proposed MCMF to bring together scattered and diverse researchers at CMU and local&lt;br/&gt;industry who will exchange ideas and expertise while working in close proximity and as a potent catalyst&lt;br/&gt;for nucleating new multi-disciplinary research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser scanning multi-photon confocal microscopes allows for the imaging of microscopic objects and their&lt;br/&gt;dynamics deep within a three dimensional sample with very little photo-damage. As a result, confocal&lt;br/&gt;microscopes have become indispensable tools to perform state-of-the-art measurements in soft materials.&lt;br/&gt;Visualizing the structure and dynamics of soft materials at the microscopic scale allows for better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of their self-assembly and macroscopic properties. The proposed laser scanning Multiphoton&lt;br/&gt;Confocal Microscopy Facility (MCMF) will enable an exciting array of diverse research across the&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) campus. For example, MCMF will enable the development of better&lt;br/&gt;composite materials, increase the understanding of cellular mechanisms related to aging and embryonic&lt;br/&gt;development, improve drug delivery studies, etc. We also plan to develop a course on Advanced&lt;br/&gt;Microscopy for graduate and undergraduate students that would utilize the proposed facility. The highly&lt;br/&gt;visual nature of the research and education enabled by the facility will attract and inspire undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;and high-school students to high-level science by making complex ideas more tangible. Using the MCMF&lt;br/&gt;we will develop age-appropriate modules intended to communicate concepts of visualization of microscale&lt;br/&gt;systems via established outreach programs at CMU that target K-12 students and teachers particularly in&lt;br/&gt;schools with large under-represented groups. The MCMF will also increase ties with industry, other&lt;br/&gt;universities and the public.</AbstractNarration>
