<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0603270&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Marc E. Culler, Steven Boyer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of 3-manifold topology has a long history of deep and&lt;br/&gt;interesting interactions with other parts of mathematics.  The&lt;br/&gt;complexity of these connections has increased with time, as the&lt;br/&gt;subject developed, and it has exploded in recent years.  The&lt;br/&gt;coincidence of this explosion with the recent solution of several&lt;br/&gt;of the major outstanding problems in the area make this a good&lt;br/&gt;time for reflection on its relationship to the rest of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.  This grant will support participants in a&lt;br/&gt;conference, to be held at CRM in Montreal, which aims to bring&lt;br/&gt;together a varied group of leading researchers whose work&lt;br/&gt;demonstrates deep connections between 3-manifold topology and&lt;br/&gt;other areas of mathematics.  The speakers will include leading&lt;br/&gt;researchers in areas such as: geometrization of 3-manifolds;&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial group theory and coarse geometric properties of&lt;br/&gt;groups; properties of random 3-manifolds and asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;properties of hyperbolic surfaces; Floer homology,&lt;br/&gt;Khovanov-Rozansky homology; 3-manifold invariants arising from&lt;br/&gt;contact structures; character varieties; and Dehn surgery.  The&lt;br/&gt;conference will honor Peter Shalen, whose work has been a major&lt;br/&gt;force in bringing many different aspect of mathematics to bear on&lt;br/&gt;the study of 3-manifolds, and in expanding the influence of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifold topology into other areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout history the interaction between mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;science has been characterized by the mysterious phenomenon that&lt;br/&gt;mathematical ideas which are developed with no specific&lt;br/&gt;application in mind turn out to be perfectly suited for future&lt;br/&gt;applications to science.  For example, differential geometry,&lt;br/&gt;which provided the ideal mathematical foundation for Einstein's&lt;br/&gt;general relativity theory, was developed much earlier by&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians who could not have anticipated the way in which it&lt;br/&gt;would be applied in physics.  On a smaller scale, there is a&lt;br/&gt;similar phenomenon involving different areas of mathematics.  A&lt;br/&gt;recent example of this, which is directly related to the topic of&lt;br/&gt;this conference, is provided by Perelman's proof of Thurston's&lt;br/&gt;Geometrization Conjecture.  This conference aims to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;these sorts of unexpected fruitful interactions between different&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics.  The central topic of the conference is the&lt;br/&gt;study of 3-dimensional spaces.  Speakers have been selected whose&lt;br/&gt;work involves significant new applications to this subject of&lt;br/&gt;ideas which originate from a wide range of other areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference web site is&lt;br/&gt;http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/cal/fr/mois200606.html.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
