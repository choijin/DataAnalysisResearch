<AbstractNarration>The Clark Atlanta University (CAU) Robert Noyce Mathematics Scholars Program for Teachers (MSPT), in collaboration with Atlanta Public Schools and Fulton County Schools (GA) is addressing the critical need for highly qualified and effective mathematics teachers for high need school systems. The MSPT Program is providing scholarships to 33 STEM majors and professionals holding a degree in a STEM discipline to complete the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) Degree Program for Secondary Certification in Mathematics.  This effort is increasing the number of highly qualified teachers, especially minority, with strong mathematics content knowledge and effective classroom management and pedagogical skills for diverse populations in high need schools. The MSPT includes a follow-up strategy to provide assistance and support to beginning teachers in collaboration with the partnering schools. A required internship, clinical experiences and follow-up components of the MAT Program provide the opportunity for reflective teaching with corrective feedback from CAU faculty and partnering school faculty. The project will be guided by an Advisory Board charged to assess the effectiveness of the program in preparing teachers for high need school districts.  The integration of research and technology is a common theme of the MAT program. Students in the MAT program are required to conduct action research in schools and communities for their clinical experiences.  A Network of Robert Noyce Beginning Teacher Scholars and quarterly teleconferencing through CAU's Academic Instructional Technology Center provide a support system to help the Noyce Scholars implement effective teaching strategies and classroom management techniques. A longitudinal study will be conducted, in collaboration with the partner schools, to determine the effectiveness of the recruitment, retention, and follow-up model. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
