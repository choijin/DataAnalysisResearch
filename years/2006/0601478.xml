<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to realize novel electronic devices based on semiconductor nanowires, including spin based field-effect transistors and quantum supercurrent transistors, and to explore solid-state based quantum information processing schemes. The approach is based on a clean one-dimensional hole gas system formed in chemically synthesized, molecular size germanium/silicon nanowires. The long mean free path, along with tunable strain and quantum confinement effects in the hole gas system offer unique potential including long spin relaxation length and gate controllable spin-orbit coupling effects. Electrical injection of spin into the semiconductor system will be explored. Qubits based on carrier spins in coupled quantum dots will also be studied. Read-out of the final qubit state will be implemented with a spin-charge conversion scheme using a radio-frequency single-electron transistor as the charge sensor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research, due to its unique combination of spintronics, quantum information processing, controlled growth of nanostructures, and utilization of technologically important group IV materials, is likely to have significant broad impact for society. The spintronics devices and qubits developed here will provide the society with new means of computation and cryptography, and affect numerous fields including electrical engineering, physics and chemistry. In the meantime, the knowledge gained during research will give insight into basic understanding of spin dynamics and quantum mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the research component of the activities described in this proposal will be closely tied to education at both the undergraduate and graduate student level, and other activities intended to broaden the impact of the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
