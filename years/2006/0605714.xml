<AbstractNarration>Mathematical models based on partial differential equations, the calculus&lt;br/&gt;of variations, and associated numerical techniques have had great success&lt;br/&gt;in image processing, especially in segmentation and denoising problems.&lt;br/&gt;This project will extend some of the most successful of these models, such&lt;br/&gt;as total variation based image denoising, to curve and surface denoising&lt;br/&gt;tasks that are of fundamental importance in computer vision and computer&lt;br/&gt;graphics applications. Accordingly, a central theme of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;find novel and natural ways to generalize models originally designed for&lt;br/&gt;processing images to processing curves and surfaces. This leads to&lt;br/&gt;curvature dependent functionals that need to be minimized over geometric&lt;br/&gt;objects. The project will draw on a variety of numerical techniques, such&lt;br/&gt;as the level set method, to develop algorithms for the solution of these&lt;br/&gt;challenging computational problems. It will also develop new variational&lt;br/&gt;image denoising and segmentation models that are more effective than&lt;br/&gt;current ones in multiscale decomposition of images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems addressed by this project form a crucial step in diverse&lt;br/&gt;applications of image processing, computer vision, and computer graphics.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, surface denoising is a preliminary first step in many&lt;br/&gt;automatic detection and recognition tasks that involve three dimensional&lt;br/&gt;shapes, such as face recognition and target identification. It is also an&lt;br/&gt;essential component of algorithms that fit surfaces to volumetric data,&lt;br/&gt;which is needed in many medical imaging applications. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
