    <AbstractNarration>This project is a collaboration of Salish Kootenai College (a Tribal College) and the University of Montana. It continues a successful UMEB program started in 2000 at the University of Montana. The program will provide research and mentoring opportunities for environmental science students enrolled at Salish Kootenai College (SKC). Students are identified for participation during their freshman year and the program provides a variety of activities including courses, enhancement workshops, and in-depth research projects. The goal is to prepare students to graduate from a 4-year biology curriculum and for eventual entry into graduate programs in biology. The University of Montana (UM) provides mentors, labs and equipment to enable students to conduct research under the mentorship of a UM faculty. Students conduct field work at the Flathead Lake Biological Station and receive extensive mentoring from peers, graduate students and faculty. A seminar series provides additional opportunity for students to interact with role models in environmental biology. Activities have been designed to increase the number American Indian students pursuing careers in environmental biology.
