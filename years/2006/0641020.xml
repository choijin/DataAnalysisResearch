<AbstractNarration>Dr. Phillip Power, Chemistry Department, University of California - Davis, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to explore the singlet diradical character of multiple bonded heavier main group compounds of the type RMMR (M = Al-Tl or Si-Pb). A range of new electronically modified terphenyl, amide, phosphide, aryloxide and thiolate ligands will be prepared and used to form RMMR and heteroelement RMM'R' complexes. The chemistry of these species will be investigated with a variety of reagents in order to determine if diradical behavior is encountered. In addition, the new compounds will be characterized by a variety of techniques including X-ray crystallography, solution and solid state heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy,  Moessbauer spectroscopy, electrochemical and computational studies. These results will be used to correlate bonding and electronic changes that are difficult to describe in traditional terms of valency, orbital overlap, hybridization and bond order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance the fundamental understanding of the bonding of the heavier main group elements. Multiple bonds play an exceedingly important role in the chemistry of, e.g., carbon. However, heavier cogeners do not easily form multiple bonds. This project is aimed at investigating the nature and chemical properties of multiple bonds of such elements as silicon, germanium, tin, and lead.  Graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral associates will receive excellent training and research experiences in a forefront synthetic inorganic chemistry program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
