    <AbstractNarration>This project builds on the College's recently-established Nanoscience Technology Associate Degree program. The program was developed based on prior NSF-funded projects at Pennsylvania State University, Dakota County Technical College, and University of Minnesota. Students presently need to enroll in a final capstone semester at University of Minnesota. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To serve the needs of students and industry in western Wisconsin better, this project brings together three institutions to develop a local capstone semester. By capitalizing on geographic proximity and focusing on what each institution does best, CVTC, University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire, and University of Wisconsin - Stout have developed an unusual, collaborative delivery system. Students attend classes at all three campuses in their final semester. Curriculum is being designed with significant input from regional industry. Industry representatives also benefit by access to local re-training and continuing education opportunities. In addition, the plan better serves individuals of underrepresented groups, by eliminating the need for an inconvenient and expensive relocation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes the following key activities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o Adaptation of University of Minnesota curriculum to better address needs of the current and projected regional workforce&lt;br/&gt;o Delivery of the capstone semester in the Nanoscience Technology Associate Degree program via collaboration of three post-secondary institutions&lt;br/&gt;o High school outreach activities to ensure continued interest in nanotechnology careers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the project is multi-faceted. Well-informed by prior work supported through NSF, the three institutions are advancing recent curriculum development for two-year nanoscience education. In addition, the project is making a new contribution in confronting logistical challenges of multi-institution collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project are due to the emerging nature of nanotechnology in western Wisconsin. This project represents just one facet of collaboration across the three post-secondary institutions. Other efforts include development of new articulation agreements, planned equipment purchases to avoid duplication, and creation of dual credit courses. In addition, CVTC is currently developing the NanoRite Center for Innovation, an incubation center for emerging companies utilizing nanotechnology and other advanced manufacturing. Western Wisconsin is expected to play a major role in the development of these industries. The three post-secondary institutions can best support this growth by working together.</AbstractNarration>
