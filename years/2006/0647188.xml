<AbstractNarration>Project Summary. A behavioral assay of magnetic 'compass' orientation in C57 BL/6 mice is being used to investigate the molecular and biophysical mechanisms responsible for sensing the geomagnetic field.  Two potential neural mechanisms have been shown to be sensitive enough for terrestrial animals to detect earth-strength (50 micro Tesla) magnetic fields: mechanisms involving particles of a ferromagnetic magnetite ("magnetite mechanisms") and mechanisms involving photoinduced biochemical reactions that form radical pair intermediates ("radical pair mechanism").  Genetic knockouts of the C57BL/6 strain of laboratory mouse are being used to investigate whether cryptochromes, proposed to play a central role in a radical pair mechanism-based magnetic compass, are an essential component of the mouse's magnetic compass.  The mouse assay is also being used to test: (1) a critical prediction of the radical pair mechanism hypothesis, which is that magnetic compass orientation should be disrupted by low-level, broad band (1-10 MHz) radio frequency fields, and (2) a critical prediction of the magnetite mechanism, which is that magnetic compass orientation should be disrupted by prior exposure to a brief, high intensity magnetic pulse.  Finally, the mouse assay is being used to determine the threshold for effects of radio frequency interference  on the magnetic compass response.  The potential impact of this work includes:  (1) characterizing the biophysical mechanism responsible for magnetic field sensitivity in a model mammalian system; (2) demonstrating sensitivity of a mammalian system to a new class of physical stimuli (i.e., radio frequency fields in the ~1-10 MHz range); (3) characterizing molecular components of the magnetic compass; and (4) developing biophysical and genetic techniques for manipulating access to magnetic information that can be used to investigate the role of magnetic stimuli in other behavioral and neurophysiological responses (e.g., behavioral and neural aspects of spatial memory in rodents).  Broader impacts of this work include exposure of undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to unique interdisciplinary training at the interface of neuroethology/sensory biology and cognitive psychology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit.  Sensitivity to the earthÆs magnetic field has been demonstrated in all of the major vertebrate classes (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals), as well as a variety of invertebrates.  Findings from multiple laboratories suggest that in animals such as amphibians and birds the magnetic directional or æcompassÆ sense is mediated by specialized photoreceptors.  The magnetic fieldÆs effect on the response of these photoreceptors is proposed to involve a light-induced biochemical reaction in a specialized class of photopigments (cryptochromes).   Absorption of light causes the cryptochrome to undergo an electron transfer reaction that forms a pair of radical intermediates, each with an unpaired electron that can interact with the external magnetic field.  Formation of the radical pair results in a æsignaling stateÆ in the cryptochrome photopigment that converts the light input into a neural signal. Certain alignments of an earth-strength magnetic field can alter the quantum spin state of the light-activated cryptochrome, increasing or decreasing the length of time this photopigment remains in the signaling state and, thus, altering the response to light. As a consequence, in animals in which magneto-photoreceptors are present in the retina (e.g., birds, and some mammals), the magnetic field may be perceived as a ævisualÆ pattern superimposed on the animalÆs surroundings.  Role of magnetic input in rodent spatial cognition.  Behavioral experiments using a nest-building assay developed by our laboratory (Muheim et al. 2006) indicate that the properties of the mouse magnetic compass are consistent with those of the photoreceptor-based magnetic compasses in amphibians and birds (Painter et al. submitted).  In an invited commentary (Phillips et al. 2010a),  we proposed that the 3-dimensional ævisualÆ pattern produced by a radical pair-based magnetic compass may serve as a spherical grid or coordinate system that helps to encode spatial and directional input from multiple sensory modalities.  We also identified an unusual class of "place" cells found in the subiculum of rats (subicular place cells) that is likely to carry the primary input of the radical pair-based magnetic compass to navigational centers in the rodent brain.   In related experiments, we have shown that laboratory mice tested in a water maze assay require only two brief training trials to learn a magnetic compass response (Stamper et al. in prep.).  These findings are consistent with the magnetic compass playing a role in the initial encoding of directional and spatial relationships in novel surroundings.  Identification of photoreceptors sensitive to the earthÆs magnetic field.  Behavioral studies carried out by our laboratory have shown that amphibians exhibit light-dependent magnetic compass orientation (Phillips &amp; Borland 1992, Deigo-Rasilla et al. 2010), and implicated extraocular photoreceptors in the pineal organ ("third eye") in mediating this response (Phillips &amp; Borland 1992, Deutschlander et al. 1999, Phillips et al. 2001, 2010b).  We have recently completed analysis of neurophysiological recordings from the frog frontal organ (an outgrowth of the pineal organ).   These recordings have identified for the first time a class of photoreceptors that are sensitive to the earthÆs magnetic field (Phillips &amp; Borland in prep.) and that exhibit properties closely matching those observed in the earlier behavioral studies (Phillips &amp; Borland 1992, Phillips et al. 2001).    Broader Impacts.  The radical pair mechanism is one of only two manifestly quantum processes proposed to mediate a major sensory system and, in some animals, and may result in the magnetic field being perceived as a 3-dimensional ævisualÆ pattern aligned with respect to magnetic north that plays a previously unrecognized role in spatial behavior and cognition (Phillips et al. 2010a).  Consequently, our research on the radical pair mechanism is of potential ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
