<AbstractNarration>The Summer REU Program in the Biochemical Sciences in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry at the University of Kentucky is a 10-week program that involves undergraduates in cutting edge biochemical research. The goal is to encourage student participants, recruited mainly from Appalachia and/or underrepresented minority groups, to pursue careers in the biochemical sciences. A wide variety of projects are offered, including research in structural biology, biophysics, proteomics, protein and nucleic acid chemistry, membrane biochemistry, and molecular biology. Participants will receive training in basic laboratory techniques and safety, and the nuts and bolts of research. Participants will also be exposed to the wide variety of career options available in the biochemical sciences. At the conclusion of the Program, all participants will present their research as both a short talk and a poster. Awards will be given for the best presentations. Undergraduate students in biology and chemistry who have little or no opportunity to participate in research in their home institutions and students from groups underrepresented in the biochemical sciences are strongly encouraged to apply. All student participants will receive a stipend and free housing, and reasonable travel costs will be covered. More information and application materials are available at http://www.mc.uky.edu/Biochemistry/REU/, or by contacting Dr. Trevor Creamer at 859-323-6037 or Trevor.Creamer@uky.edu.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
