    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Program of the Physics Division, Prof. Timothy C. Steimle of Arizona State University and his postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate research students will study the high resolution optical and microwave spectroscopy of metal-containing small molecules. Particular emphasis will be placed on investigating metal-hydrogen bonding in diatomic metal hydrides, as well as detailed investigations of Zeeman and Stark spectroscopies of small, metal-containing radical molecules. Many of the targets selected for study are of importance in efforts at measuring the electron dipole moment and in efforts at cooling and confining molecules to make Bose-Einstein condensates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the broader scientific applications of the proposed research to cutting-edge experiments in exciting areas of modern physics research, Prof. Steimle maintains a small but diverse research group, with whom he works closely to train in modern instrumental methods and sophisticated quantum mechanics. The group benefits from a number of collaborations -- both foreign as well as domestic -- which helps to provide his group members with valuable interdisciplinary experience that crosses international borders.</AbstractNarration>
