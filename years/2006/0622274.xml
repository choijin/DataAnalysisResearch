<AbstractNarration>The project, a partnership between the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Nebraska's six community colleges, is increasing the number of students that are successfully pursuing and obtaining baccalaureate degrees in engineering. The overall goal is to develop and institutionalize an effective pathway enabling community college students to complete several freshman and sophomore engineering courses and transfer seamlessly into the University's College of Engineering. Academic, financial, and social support is being provided to transfer students to ensure retention and encourage completion of a baccalaureate engineering degree in the traditional timeframe. The project's objectives are: (1) increasing the number of students transferring into engineering so that the percentage of transfer students choosing engineering is equal to the College's percentage of total students enrolled; (2) increasing by 100% the number of underrepresented minority students transferring into the College each year; (3) increasing by 100% the number of women transferring into the College each year; (4) retaining at least 80% of all transfer students; and (5) graduating at least 65% of all transfer students after three years of enrollment in the College. These increases in enrollment and graduation rates are being achieved through an expanded physical and administrative infrastructure that supports students transferring from community college programs to engineering. Specifically, the project is working to: (1) develop and implement four new introductory community college engineering courses along with corresponding articulation agreements; 2) establish a complementary set of student support activities that facilitate mentoring, community building, and retention, particularly among women and minority transfer students; and (3) facilitate paid internship opportunities to complement the high quality instruction students are receiving.  Internal and external advisory boards are guiding the project and an evaluation team is in place.  Broader impacts include an increase in the participation of students from underrepresented groups, the redefinition of the engineering transition process from community colleges to the University, and a broad dissemination of the project's results.</AbstractNarration>
