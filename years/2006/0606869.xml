<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0606869&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Rebecca Goldin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orbifolds are among the simplest type of singular spaces. They&lt;br/&gt;arise in symplectic geometry as reductions, in algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;(where they are called Deligne-Mumford stacks) as certain moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces, and in topology as quotient spaces. Algebraic invariants&lt;br/&gt;of these spaces, such as stringy Betti numbers, twisted Hodge&lt;br/&gt;numbers, and Chen-Ruan cohomology (also called orbifold&lt;br/&gt;cohomology) have recently gained interest because they are subtle&lt;br/&gt;enough to see the singularities, and in some cases describe the&lt;br/&gt;cohomology of a (crepant) resolution of singularities. This grant&lt;br/&gt;will explore new methods to compute the Chen-Ruan cohomology of&lt;br/&gt;an orbifold, following work done by the PI and coauthors in the&lt;br/&gt;case that the orbifold is a global quotient by a compact abelian&lt;br/&gt;Lie group. These methods should produce a new combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;fomula for the Chen-Ruan cohomology of a hypertoric variety (a&lt;br/&gt;hyperkahler reduction of quaternionic n-space by a compact&lt;br/&gt;torus), a formula for the K-theory of global abelian quotients,&lt;br/&gt;and the Chen-Ruan cohomology of non-abelian (Lie group)&lt;br/&gt;quotients. We hope to use these methods to discount or prove&lt;br/&gt;certain conjectures about or bifolds and crepant resolutions. In&lt;br/&gt;a separate undertaking, the PI is pursuing a general&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial formula for questions about the equivariant&lt;br/&gt;cohomology of manifolds with circle actions and isolated fixed&lt;br/&gt;points. We have found a topological formula for the restriction&lt;br/&gt;of certain canonical classes to any other fixed point, which has&lt;br/&gt;led to a kind of classification in 6-dimensions. In higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensions, we have found a "positive" restriction formula in the&lt;br/&gt;case that the manifold is Kahler and carries an invariant&lt;br/&gt;Palais-Smale metric (or has other rather rigid structure, such as&lt;br/&gt;being a GKM space). This work should lead to combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;formulas for the product structure in the equivariant cohomology,&lt;br/&gt;a topic of broad interest because it applies to flag manifolds&lt;br/&gt;and toric varieties, among other varieties. In a third project,&lt;br/&gt;we propose to investigate different formulae for the structure&lt;br/&gt;constants in Schubert calculus using methods developed on the&lt;br/&gt;calculus of Bott-Samelson manifolds. This should also generalize&lt;br/&gt;to fixed-point restriction formulas in the case of a symmetric&lt;br/&gt;group (the fixed points of an involution on G) acting on G/B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has roots in classical mechanics. Phase space,&lt;br/&gt;which consists of the position and momentum of a particle, is an&lt;br/&gt;example of a symplectic space, with an action by the symmetry&lt;br/&gt;group, also called a Hamiltonian action. Symmetry arises from the&lt;br/&gt;fact that the physics is the same for all observers. By&lt;br/&gt;"collapsing" a high-dimensional symplectic space by the&lt;br/&gt;symmetry, we can get a smaller space that is sometimes easier to&lt;br/&gt;work with. In a broad sense, this grant is concerned with&lt;br/&gt;describing these spaces with group actions, and their&lt;br/&gt;quotients. It will have impact on certain questions in physics&lt;br/&gt;that have arisen in string theory, as well as contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;discussion of how "rigid" our physical universe is by&lt;br/&gt;virtue of symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
