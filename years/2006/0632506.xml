    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0306947&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Gang Tian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal consists of three projects in integrable systems&lt;br/&gt;and calibrated geometry to be conducted by Emma Carberry. The&lt;br/&gt;first of these centers on complex tori in the nearly-Kaehler&lt;br/&gt;6-sphere. Isotropic surfaces in the 6-sphere have been&lt;br/&gt;classified by Bryant and include all rational examples. I&lt;br/&gt;propose to find an algebro-geometric description of the&lt;br/&gt;non-isotropic complex tori. This description will involve an&lt;br/&gt;algebraic curve called the spectral curve, and hence give rise to&lt;br/&gt;a natural invariant of the torus, namely the genus of its&lt;br/&gt;spectral curve. The existence of tori for each value of this&lt;br/&gt;invariant will then be investigated and the characterization used&lt;br/&gt;to produce examples. Cones over these tori are associative in&lt;br/&gt;the imaginary octonions, which provides additional geometrical&lt;br/&gt;motivation for their study. The second project concerns the&lt;br/&gt;energy of minimal tori in the 3-sphere. Ferus, Leschke, Pedit&lt;br/&gt;and Pinkall have an estimate for the energy in terms of the&lt;br/&gt;spectral genus, which provides exciting progress toward the proof&lt;br/&gt;of the Willmore and Lawson conjectures, but fails to say anything&lt;br/&gt;about these conjectures when the spectral genus is low. It is&lt;br/&gt;precisely the low-genus cases upon which we shall focus, using&lt;br/&gt;spectral curve techniques. The final project concerns the&lt;br/&gt;possible singularities of special Lagrangian 3-folds, a topic of&lt;br/&gt;considerable current interest due to its role in mirror symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, cones over tori will be studied and the question of&lt;br/&gt;whether the links may be real-algebraic will be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy is a fundamental quantity; physical systems seek to&lt;br/&gt;minimize energy or at least to find (possibly unstable) critical&lt;br/&gt;points of it. One typically studies critical points of energy,&lt;br/&gt;for example minimal submanifolds, which appear in all of the&lt;br/&gt;above proposed projects. These have a long and distinguished&lt;br/&gt;history in both mathematics and physics, and remain subject to&lt;br/&gt;much attention. Absolute energy minimizers are rare and&lt;br/&gt;difficult to locate. However one source of them is calibrated&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds, of which both associative and special Lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds are examples. Special Lagrangian submanifolds have&lt;br/&gt;other interesting applications to physics. In super-symmetric&lt;br/&gt;string theory, the universe is modeled as a ten-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;object, consisting locally of the familiar four-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space-time, and a six-dimensional space (a Calabi-Yau manifold)&lt;br/&gt;that is compact, and hence sufficiently 'small' that one does not&lt;br/&gt;observe it in everyday life. A popular approach to deepening our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these Calabi-Yau manifolds is to study their&lt;br/&gt;special Lagrangian submanifolds.</AbstractNarration>
