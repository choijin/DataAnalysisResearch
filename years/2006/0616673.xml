<AbstractNarration>By exploiting the principles of supramolecular chemistry, nature has mastered the ability to form remarkably complex molecular capsules on a widely varied scale.  This research is focused on understanding the principles upon which molecular capsules are constructed at all length scales.  The objectives include:  (1) the synthesis of new building blocks for capsules; (2) the engineering of functionality into such capsules; (3) the extension of length scales from the nano- to the micro-level; and (4) the understanding of the structural relationship of spheres (capsules) to tubes.  Success in these endeavors will afford nanocpasules for applications in drug delivery and catalysis.  &lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Jerry Atwood of the University of Missouri- Columbia whose research will increase our understanding of the principles governing the assembly of larger capsules that could provide insight into aspects of living systems.  The most immediate impact is expected in the area of drug delivery.  If drugs could be delivered by a nanocapsule with higher site specificity, even the amount of the drug needed for effective treatment may be greatly reduced. This research is expected to achieve major advances toward selective receptor binding of molecular capsules followed by drug release.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will receive excellent educational and synthetic training while pursuing the research proposed here. The work will advance science in the related areas of nanofabrication, green chemistry and organic materials.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
