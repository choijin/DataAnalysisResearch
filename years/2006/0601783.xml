    <AbstractNarration>Problems in two areas of probability are considered. The first &lt;br/&gt;is concerned with uniqueness for the solutions of stochastic&lt;br/&gt;differential equations arising from the areas of stochastic partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, measure-valued branching diffusions with branching&lt;br/&gt;and spatial interactions, equations that depend on the past, &lt;br/&gt;and equations corresponding to degenerate elliptic operators.&lt;br/&gt;These are typically infinite-dimensional systems of equations, often &lt;br/&gt;with coefficients that degenerate at a boundary. The second area of &lt;br/&gt;research concerns Harnack inequalities and heat kernel estimates. &lt;br/&gt;An attempt will be made to characterize the Harnack inequality in both &lt;br/&gt;continuous models and ones with jumps. In addition regularity of &lt;br/&gt;solutions to equations associated with non-local operators in bounded &lt;br/&gt;regions will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years researchers in mathematical physics, economics, and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical finance have realized that to adequately model real-world&lt;br/&gt;phenomena, the possibility of jumps must be allowed. For example, an&lt;br/&gt;unexpected discovery or unexpected regional conflict might cause a sudden jump&lt;br/&gt;up or down in stock prices. However, some of the very basic questions&lt;br/&gt;about models that incorporate jumps are as yet unanswered. One of the areas&lt;br/&gt;to be investigated is the regularity of such models. A typical question is:&lt;br/&gt;if the initial data is perturbed slightly, is it true that the behavior of &lt;br/&gt;the model at future times will also be only slightly perturbed? There are &lt;br/&gt;similar unanswered questions for certain models that originate in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;biology. In these cases the difficulty is not the presence of jumps, but&lt;br/&gt;the presence of huge numbers of individuals and the possible interactions&lt;br/&gt;between individuals.</AbstractNarration>
