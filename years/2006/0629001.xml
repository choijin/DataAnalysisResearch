<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0629001&lt;br/&gt;Kavraki, Lydia&lt;br/&gt;William Marsh Rice U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for Federated Logic Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1996, as part of the Special Year on Logic and Algorithms, DIMACS hosted the first Federated Logic Conference (FLoC). It was modeled after the successful Federated Computer Research Conference (FCRC), and synergetically brought together conferences that apply formal methods to computer-science problems. The second Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'99) was held in Trento, Italy, in July 1999, and the third Federated&lt;br/&gt;Logic Conference (FLoC'02) was held in Copenhagen, Denmark in July2002. It consisted of seven major conferences and 35 workshops, attracting about 900 participants. The fourth Federated Logic Conference, will be held in Seattle, Washington, in August 2006.  The following conferences will participate in FLoC'05:&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV)&lt;br/&gt;International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP)&lt;br/&gt;International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR)&lt;br/&gt;IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA)&lt;br/&gt;International Conference on Theory and Applications of&lt;br/&gt;Satisfiability Testing (SAT)&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The federated logic conference is a back-to-back event of all the major international conferences in the area of Formal Methods. While the participating conferences are normally held individually by their local conference organization on an annual basis, they all agree to this joint and federated event to be held every three-four years. The number of participants is near one thousand, and a third to one half of the participants are expected to be young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact:&lt;br/&gt;Enhancing the security, privacy, usability, and reliability of computing systems is widely accepted as one the grand challenges facing the computing-research community. Formal Methods have emerged as one of the primary approaches towards that goal. A federated conference provides an opportunity for accelerating research via synergy between the different strands of research in Formal Methods. It is also an outstanding training opportunity for young researchers, as it offers them a grand view of the whole area.</AbstractNarration>
