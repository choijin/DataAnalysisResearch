<AbstractNarration>A-1&lt;br/&gt;Louis Stokes Colorado Alliance for Minority Participation&lt;br/&gt;CO-AMP Phase III Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Colorado State University (CSU) in collaboration with the University of Colorado at Boulder, Fort Lewis&lt;br/&gt;College, Colorado State University at Pueblo, Metropolitan State College of Denver, the University of Colorado at&lt;br/&gt;Colorado Springs, the University of Colorado at Denver, Colorado School of Mines, Adams State College, Trinidad&lt;br/&gt;State Junior College, Pueblo Community College, Din College, AIMS Community College, four tribal nations, and&lt;br/&gt;industry constitute part of the CO-AMP consortium that was formed in 1995/96. The consortium is proposing COAMP&lt;br/&gt;Phase III that will undertake a comprehensive effort to address the following activities in connection with&lt;br/&gt;under-represented students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines:&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment, retention &amp; leadership programs &lt;br/&gt;Longitudinal tracking&lt;br/&gt;Summer outreach programs  Graduate school placement&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the LS CO-AMP Phase III Proposal is to continue increasing the number of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students successfully completing baccalaureates degrees in STEM disciplines in&lt;br/&gt;Colorado.&lt;br/&gt;Phase III of CO-AMP will build upon the momentum and the success of LS CO-AMP, which began in&lt;br/&gt;1995. The underrepresented students (Hispanic, African American, Native American, and Pacific Islanders) who are&lt;br/&gt;enrolled in the undergraduate STEM degree programs at the participating institutions will benefit greatly from the&lt;br/&gt;proposed activities. The efforts of the Consortium will extend from the pre-freshmen level to enrollment in graduate&lt;br/&gt;school programs. The CO-AMP consortium has been the major driving force at the institutions involved since 1995&lt;br/&gt;to encourage and motivate students to excel and graduate with a B.S. degree in the STEM fields. The enrollment and&lt;br/&gt;visibility of diverse students has increased at the participating institutions which is demonstrated by the 68%&lt;br/&gt;increase in the LS CO-AMP enrollment since its inception. Student performance in their respective disciplines has&lt;br/&gt;improved tremendously. A significant level of support, in addition to that from the NSF, has been provided by the&lt;br/&gt;central administrations, the Departments and Colleges of the Consortium institutions, Industry, and the Colorado&lt;br/&gt;Institute of Technology. Very importantly, the faculty and staff members of the Consortium institutions have&lt;br/&gt;provided essential support without which the activities of LS CO-AMP could not have been so successful. CO-AMP&lt;br/&gt;participating institutions, industry, tribal councils and the Colorado Commission on Higher Education are expected&lt;br/&gt;to continue their support of the project from 2006 to 2011. The success of this consortium will continue to be shared&lt;br/&gt;with the other LS AMPs in the nation. In addition, CO-AMP will work with the Alliance for Graduate Education&lt;br/&gt;and the Professoriate (AGEP) to place more underrepresented students in STEM graduate studies.&lt;br/&gt;By linking the resources of the Consortium institutions and partners and by continuing ongoing efforts to&lt;br/&gt;solicit funding from all available sources, LS CO-AMP will continue to promote institutionalizing the successful&lt;br/&gt;programs it has developed within the Consortium institutions. This is essential to assure that the benefits to&lt;br/&gt;students, which occur from these programs, continue after funding from the NSF is no longer available.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Colorado LS CO AMP is looking to continue increasing the number of underrepresented undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students graduating with a Bachelors Degree in STEM disciplines. In addition, LS CO-AMP Phase III is planning&lt;br/&gt;to matriculate underrepresented (UREP) students into graduate school to ensure a future balance of the&lt;br/&gt;representation of minority students in STEM graduate disciplines. During Phase III, the Consortium will work&lt;br/&gt;toward institutionalizing and sustaining its program activities after the NSF Funding expires. LS CO-AMP has had&lt;br/&gt;considerable success during Phase I and II, and the Consortiums success will be amplified during the proposed LS&lt;br/&gt;CO-AMP Phase III project. The anticipated successful collaboration with the Colorado Commission on Higher&lt;br/&gt;Education, the legislature, and congressional representatives, will strengthen the sustainability of LS CO-AMP in the&lt;br/&gt;State of Colorado.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Through the assessment of the activities and the collaboration of LS CO-AMP with other alliances such as&lt;br/&gt;AGEP, McNair Scholarships Program, and Rocky Mountain Middle School Math Science Partnership, LS CO AMP&lt;br/&gt;plans to increase awareness of cultural differences and necessary institutional changes to positively sustain support&lt;br/&gt;of UREP STEM undergraduate and graduate students after NSF funding expires. Moreover, the results of the Phase&lt;br/&gt;III programs and activities will add substantially to the understanding of the issues and the challenges of UREP&lt;br/&gt;students in graduate and undergraduate STEM disciplines. The focus of LS CO-AMP Phase III is to continue the&lt;br/&gt;recruitment and the retention activities of Phase I and Phase II, as well as to matriculate the UREP undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students into graduate school. This commitment to graduate education will produce more UREP STEM faculty&lt;br/&gt;members who, in turn, will help in bringing more diverse students to the classroom. It will also enable effective and&lt;br/&gt;sustainable institutional transformation to enhance diversity in STEM disciplines. In addition, this diversity&lt;br/&gt;commitment will improve the overall climate for UREP students in the State of Colorado and nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
