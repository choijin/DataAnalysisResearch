    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECS-0621874&lt;br/&gt;H. Hashemi, University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silicon based integrated multi-antenna systems have generated great research interest due to their advantages in improving the wireless communication system capacity and radio frequency (RF) imaging resolution at a lower cost. Phased arrays, special case of multi-antenna systems, form a narrow beam that can be steered towards intended directions. Higher bandwidth results in better range resolution for imaging systems. Ultra wideband (UWB) antenna arrays achieve both high scanning (azimuth) resolution and range (depth) resolution. Integration of a complete UWB antenna array transceiver in silicon results in substantial improvements in cost, size, functionality, and reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in the integration of multiple engineering fields such as integrated circuit design, electromagnetic theory, semiconductor devices, communications, and control systems to implement a high resolution integrated imaging antenna array. During the course of the proposed work, we will analyze, design, fabricate, and measure fully integrated UWB antenna array transceivers for high resolution imaging applications using standard silicon CMOS technology. Our study will include several active array architectures, building blocks, design methodologies, theoretical studies, and characterization methods for UWB integrated antenna arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon success, significant scientific, social, and economical return can be expected from this research. Examples of specific imaging applications of an UWB antenna array include biomedical such as cancer detection, intelligent transportation systems, environmental monitoring using weather insensitive imaging sensors, and through-wall imaging for security. The broader impact of the proposed research effort is also in its educational aspects and the expeditious transfer of technological results to the technical community.</AbstractNarration>
