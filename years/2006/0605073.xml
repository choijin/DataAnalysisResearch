<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Arone is interested in the interplay between calculus of functors, &lt;br/&gt;operads and geometric topology. He is investigating the Taylor &lt;br/&gt;approximations to spaces of smooth embeddings, and he has found &lt;br/&gt;formulas for these approximations in terms of spaces of trees and &lt;br/&gt;spaces of graphs. He also intends to show (in a joint work with P. &lt;br/&gt;Lambrechts and I. Volic) that the formality of the little cubes operad &lt;br/&gt;implies quite strong rational splitting results for spaces of &lt;br/&gt;embeddings of a manifold into a Euclidean space. These splitting &lt;br/&gt;results generalize to general embedding spaces some major theorems of &lt;br/&gt;knot theory (e.g., the collapse of the Vassiliev spectral sequence). In &lt;br/&gt;longer term, Arone would like to extend this work to the study of &lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphisms of manifolds. Roughly speaking, the first derivative of &lt;br/&gt;the space of diffeomorphisms is given by Waldhausen's A-theory, or &lt;br/&gt;alternatively by topological cyclic homology (TC), and Arone would like &lt;br/&gt;to find the higher analogues of TC, corresponding to the higher &lt;br/&gt;derivatives. The role played by the circle group in the definition of &lt;br/&gt;TC should in higher degrees be played by a category of graphs a fixed &lt;br/&gt;homotopy type, perhaps related to the outer space of graphs that has &lt;br/&gt;been used to study the groups of automorphisms of a free group. In a &lt;br/&gt;different vein, Arone is also interested in developing further the &lt;br/&gt;general theory of calculus of functors. For instance, he is interested &lt;br/&gt;in developing a theory of polynomial functors that would generalize &lt;br/&gt;Goodwillie's theory of homogeneous functor. Arone's understanding of &lt;br/&gt;the subject was given a boost by the work of M. Ching, which made clear &lt;br/&gt;the relevance of operads to this question. Arone is also interested in &lt;br/&gt;applying calculus of functors to mainstream homotopy theory. In a &lt;br/&gt;recent work with K. Lesh, he discovered a new filtration of complex &lt;br/&gt;K-theory and a rather surprising relationship between this filtration &lt;br/&gt;and the calculus of functors. The paper ends with a series of &lt;br/&gt;conjectures about the precise nature of this relationship, and he would &lt;br/&gt;like to pursue these conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arone believes that the proposal will shed new light on active areas of &lt;br/&gt;current research in mathematics and will lead to important new &lt;br/&gt;insights. The proposed research should cast an important part of &lt;br/&gt;geometric topology in terms familiar to algebraic topologists, and &lt;br/&gt;conversely bring the power of homotopy theory to geometric topology. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity involves an exciting interplay of ideas from &lt;br/&gt;algebraic topology, combinatorics, group cohomology and geometric &lt;br/&gt;topology. The PI hopes that eventually it will impact the thinking of &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians from fields other than topology. It should also generate &lt;br/&gt;exciting new ways to introduce important topics in topology to &lt;br/&gt;students. It is already beginning to generate a number of PhD theses in &lt;br/&gt;mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
