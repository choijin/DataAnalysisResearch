<AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: 0635983&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Irene Fonseca&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Center for Nonlinear Analysis: Research and Training in Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Nonlinear Analysis (CNA), founded in 1991 in the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, is&lt;br/&gt;a center for research and training in applied mathematics supported by&lt;br/&gt;the National Science Foundation. The continued funding of the CNA from&lt;br/&gt;the RTG program will allow it to recruit strong US graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;postdocs and expose them to the wealth of expertise in nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;analysis, computation, and interdisciplinary activity&lt;br/&gt;that exists across Carnegie Mellon research units.  The goals of the CNA&lt;br/&gt;include:&lt;br/&gt;-- To identify  cutting-edge mathematical questions in science and&lt;br/&gt;    engineering, including materials science and biotechnology, to&lt;br/&gt;highlight emerging and&lt;br/&gt;new areas in mathematics deriving from applications, and to develop new&lt;br/&gt;applications of mathematical sciences;&lt;br/&gt;-- To maintain and sustain its leadership in the areas of Calculus of&lt;br/&gt;    Variations and PDEs;&lt;br/&gt;-- To promote collaborations between applied mathematicians and&lt;br/&gt;allied scientists;&lt;br/&gt;-- To continue to develop international partnerships&lt;br/&gt;   and cooperation agreements, which play a vital part in&lt;br/&gt;the CNA program and in the enhancement of the&lt;br/&gt;scientific  training and research activities of the Center;&lt;br/&gt;-- To maintain its position as a worldwide asset in the education&lt;br/&gt;of young investigators cognizant of research opportunities at the broad&lt;br/&gt;interface between mathematics and physical sciences and engineering;&lt;br/&gt;-- To continue the valuable work of the Summer Undergraduate Applied&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics Institute (SUAMI), which targets minorities and women with&lt;br/&gt;the goal of recruiting them to pursue graduate study in applied mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past 15 years the CNA has trained more than 52 postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;fellows. The CNA is very proud of its trainees: Several former CNA&lt;br/&gt;postdocs are now scientific leaders in their own right at research&lt;br/&gt;institutions in the US and abroad, and many others are ripe to assume&lt;br/&gt;leadership roles in the near future. The imprint of the CNA in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and scientific community is large and growing.  The&lt;br/&gt;collaborations of CNA members with experimentalists, theorists,&lt;br/&gt;physical scientists, and bioscientists, render this group one of the&lt;br/&gt;strongest research and training groups in applied mathematics in the&lt;br/&gt;US and in the world. Investigators associated with the CNA have been in&lt;br/&gt;the front ranks in integrating the discovery of new mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical ways of understanding with other modes of scientific&lt;br/&gt;investigation, particularly in materials science.&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to develop first-rate mathematical science in&lt;br/&gt;ways that have a healthy and exciting relation to emerging areas of&lt;br/&gt;importance in the physical and biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
