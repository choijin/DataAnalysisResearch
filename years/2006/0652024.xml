<AbstractNarration>0652024 &lt;br/&gt;Jayasuriya&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to develop injectable microparticles based on a natural biopolymer, chitosan, and calcium phosphate, seeded with mesenchymal stem cells in combination with either macrophages or their secretory factors (which have been shown to increase the osteoblast phenotype). The long-term goal is to achieve a new approach for regenerating natural bone tissues, thereby overcoming limitations of current bone grafts.  A strength of this research is the incorporation of activated macrophages into the microparticles to act as a source of bioactive factors for osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration. This approach would allow the cell-based delivery of multiple factors, and potentially avoid complicated pharmaceutical formulations. It also has the potential for injection of the microparticles that has key advantages over large prefabricated biomaterial scaffolds.  Multiple exciting training, mentoring, and outreach activities are planned.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
