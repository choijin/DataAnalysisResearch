<AbstractNarration>IOB-0641319&lt;br/&gt;Robert B. Day, Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Understanding the dynamic structural and signaling mechanisms of NDR1-dependent disease resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the mechanisms by which plants recognize and respond to pathogens is crucial in developing breeding strategies aimed at increasing the agricultural output of crop systems.  While the diversity of biotic stresses (e.g., bacteria, virus, fungal and insects) to which plants are exposed to is great, many of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms of disease resistance in plants are conserved, regardless of the stress they encounter.  Using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, this project seeks to understand the complex signaling network in plants which triggers resistance in response to pathogen perception.  Using the model plant-pathogen system, Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae, the long-term goal of this work concerns the following questions: How do plants perceive pathogens?  How is this signal transduced?  And finally, how does the plant "decide" the appropriate course of action, specific to the type of stress? Results from this study will provide insight into the molecular-genetic "switches" that turn on/off resistance responses in plants.  In particular, the work focuses on the function of a protein called NDR1, which is thought to transduce signals that arise from the initial perception of a pathogen to downstream effectors that mediate resistance responses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to advance our understanding of the perception and activation of resistance signaling in the Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas interaction, but also seeks to further our knowledge of the mechanisms which govern the dynamic processes controlling the activation of innate immunity and stress tolerance in plants.  This research will also contribute to the education and outreach activities of Michigan State University through the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists.  As an added component of this research, Dr. Day will work towards the advancement and development of high school curriculum and teacher training efforts aimed at integrating plant biology as a mechanisms of teaching complex topics in biology, physiology, chemistry, genetics and disease.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
