<AbstractNarration>The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) will see full operations in early 2007 at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory basecamp of Mt. Hopkins, AZ. The four-telescope array of Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) will observe Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-rays above an energy threshold of 50 GeV emanating from exotic sources throughout the galaxy and extra-galactic space. With an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over previous generations of ground-based IACTs, VERITAS will probe the extreme physics inherent in gamma-ray sources such as the jets of Active Galactic Nuclei, Supernovae Remnants and microquasars. VERITAS is expected to greatly expand the catalog of Northern Hemisphere gamma-ray sources and be a key component in observing campaigns organized across the spectrum including radio through optical, UV and X-ray. VERITAS will be an important complement to GLAST, NASA's lower energy gamma-ray satellite expected to launch in 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for base support of the Adler Planetarium &amp; Astronomy Museum science staff involved in the VERITAS efforts over the next two years. The Adler group's efforts will focus on the implementation of an optical pointing monitor and associated systems to improve the effective resolution of the VERITAS telescopes. Their analysis efforts will be in studies of Active Galactic Nuclei and the support of multiwavelength studies complementing the TeV data obtained by VERITAS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the VERITAS key projects would benefit from an improvement in the pointing accuracy of the four telescopes. Such an improvement would allow the determination of more accurate source positions, improve the sensitivity to point sources, and enhance the imaging of extended sources. Tests of the pointing accuracy of the first VERITAS telescope show that an active pointing monitor is needed to achieve this level of accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI for this proposal is also the project lead for the overall VERITAS Education and Outreach activities. Adler scientists participating in VERITAS will be closely involved with the design and development of materials related to VERITAS science and technology. The Adler group will be involved in creating content for a general audience website, as well as materials for on site demonstrations and exhibit kiosks and will participate in providing on-site public tours of VERITAS and will work with Adler's Space Visualization Laboratory to develop a full-dome "research short" utilizing gamma-ray shower simulations for Adler's planetarium theater . &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
