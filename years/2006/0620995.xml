<AbstractNarration>Summary: International Workshop on Historic Scientific Instrument Collections in Universities&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks partial support for an international workshop to bring together working scientists&lt;br/&gt;in universities and colleges with historians of science, museum curators, and archivists. The workshop is&lt;br/&gt;a follow-on to the international conference on Scientific Instrument Collections in Universities (SICU)&lt;br/&gt;held at Dartmouth College in June 2004. SICU was an ambitious first attempt by this nascent community&lt;br/&gt;to find hidden instrument collections and to assemble a wide spectrum of people with common interests&lt;br/&gt;in formalizing university collections. As a first step, SICU was successful in bringing to light some&lt;br/&gt;important collections and in organizing an interested group of more than 80 international scholars.&lt;br/&gt;However, much remains to be done to effectively promote interactions between these scholars and&lt;br/&gt;scientists and curators involved with university collections.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed workshop is to take the next steps in the process of getting scientists and&lt;br/&gt;historians of science to communicate and collaborate on conducting research and education based on&lt;br/&gt;historical scientific instruments. Specifically, three main needs for an intensive gathering of interested&lt;br/&gt;practitioners have been identified: access, security, and utilization of collections. The scientific&lt;br/&gt;community needs to be more involved in the effort, as they have the background and understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;science concepts that many of these collections were created to teach. There are many more collections&lt;br/&gt;of varying dates that have not yet become accessible to the scholarly community, and often, only&lt;br/&gt;university scientists know about these collections. Security of collections involves developing an&lt;br/&gt;understanding of their value and a practical resource base for their proper care. Effective utilization of&lt;br/&gt;these instruments for scholarship, science education, and public outreach requires a broad effort of&lt;br/&gt;awareness and an accessible reference guide to their intended purposes. Meeting these three needs is the&lt;br/&gt;overarching goal of this workshop.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project comes through the extension of the resource base for scholars&lt;br/&gt;focusing on the material culture of science beyond the major museum collections that have been used and&lt;br/&gt;documented for many years. The workshop will divulge the wealth of historically significant scientific&lt;br/&gt;equipment that may still exist in most major colleges and universities founded prior to the 1950's. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, a network of researchers will be developed that would jointly work to establish a context and&lt;br/&gt;background for any unknown instruments found in newly accessed collections and contributed by&lt;br/&gt;historians, curators, and scientists. Solutions and descriptions to these mysteries would be published in&lt;br/&gt;the open literature.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project derives from the fact that participants will work cooperatively to&lt;br/&gt;develop a community-wide compendium of scientific instrument collections online that would meet the&lt;br/&gt;needs of scientists, historians of science, museum curators, and science educators. As conceived, the&lt;br/&gt;compendium would include significant aspects of the instrument: science, history, inventor, instrument&lt;br/&gt;maker, references, videos, and demonstration contexts. It will also serve as a practical resource guide for&lt;br/&gt;stewards of these collections. Such a compendium will require interdisciplinary involvement and&lt;br/&gt;collaboration between the science, history, education, and curatorial communities; the workshop format&lt;br/&gt;will be used to establish guidelines for the development of this resource. This compendium will have far&lt;br/&gt;reaching impacts for the history of science, science education, and public outreach through the increased&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of, access to, and utilization of these significant university resources.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held at the University of Mississippi, home to the Millington-Barnard&lt;br/&gt;Collection of 19th Century Natural Philosophy  Demonstration Apparatus. This 500-piece collection&lt;br/&gt;was acquired by the University in 1852-1860 and narrowly escaped destruction during the Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;Pieces from the top instrument makers in the U.S., France, Germany, and England were used for&lt;br/&gt;instruction in Physics and Astronomy for more than 150 years and are now exhibited in the University&lt;br/&gt;Museum. . Approximately 100 participants are anticipated at the workshop from outside the University of Mississippi.</AbstractNarration>
