<AbstractNarration>This project identifies a new class of stochastic programs referred to as&lt;br/&gt;"Distributed Stochastic Programs," and develops computational approaches&lt;br/&gt;for their solution.  The methodology to be studied involves a marriage of the&lt;br/&gt;"Lagrangean Decomposition" method of Guignard and Kim with the "Stochastic&lt;br/&gt;Decomposition" methods of Higle and Sen.  The primary motivation is the study of&lt;br/&gt;integrated models and solution methods for enterprise-based decision making &lt;br/&gt;under uncertainty.  An enterprise-based model is one that couples a variety of &lt;br/&gt;component problems that are associated with different entities within the &lt;br/&gt;enterprise. Of necessity these component problems, which will typically reflect &lt;br/&gt;operational concerns,are finely detailed.  Their individual solutions often &lt;br/&gt;require highly specialized computational approaches that challenge current &lt;br/&gt;computing resources.  As a result, their direct incorporation within an&lt;br/&gt;enterprise-based model would likely lead to a model that greatly exceeds&lt;br/&gt;current computational capabilities.  To remedy this situation, this&lt;br/&gt;project advocates the use of surrogate models of the component problems&lt;br/&gt;that reflect the uncertainty associated with the day-to-day operations,&lt;br/&gt;and are combined in a manner that permits guidance for strategic decisions.  &lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of this project is the development of solution methods for &lt;br/&gt;the resulting class of problems based on decomposition schemes that exploit &lt;br/&gt;the general structure of the enterprise model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past few years, the need to incorporate uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;within complex business environments has become increasingly&lt;br/&gt;obvious.  Many firms have invested a great deal of time and&lt;br/&gt;resources in developing models that can be used to assist with&lt;br/&gt;operational decision making.  For example, airlines typically use&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated models to assist with their air fleet assignments, crew&lt;br/&gt;scheduling, maintenance schedules, etc.  In addition to these&lt;br/&gt;types of operational decisions, firms also undertake strategic, or&lt;br/&gt;long-term, decisions, such as when an airline determines&lt;br/&gt;what markets it will serve.  In general, these strategic decisions&lt;br/&gt;impact the operational decisions, although neither this impact nor &lt;br/&gt;the uncertainty associated with day-to-day operational decisions is&lt;br/&gt;typically captured within the enterprise's strategic decision model.  &lt;br/&gt;This project involves an exploration of integrated models and &lt;br/&gt;solution methods for enterprise-based decision making under uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
