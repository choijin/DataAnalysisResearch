<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception in 1962 the Aspen Center for Physics (ACP) has provided a unique physical andscientific environment ideally suited for stimulating interactions, collaborations and innovation in physics research. For four months every summer more than 500 leading international researchers, freed from the usual constraints and distractions of their home institutions, come to Aspen to engage in research at the forefront of their fields. Research is conducted (a) in the context of workshops in areas at the forefront of physics research; (b) in small groups focused on specific projects; or (c) by individual investigators carrying out their own research. The scientific programs emphasize open problems at the cutting edge and are designed to maximize informal interactions within each area and cross-fertilization between different areas. While continuing to provide leadership in the central areas of physics (particle physics, astrophysics and condensed&lt;br/&gt;matter physics) the ACP has been open to new directions in physics as well as to science at the interface between physics and other disciplines (biology, chemistry, engineering, material science, and mathematics). The ACP alsoorganizes between four to six one-week Winter Conferences that bring together 35 to 80 researchers in areas of current interest in physics and inter-disciplinary physics research. The ACP makes an effort to ensure age, gender, race, socio-economic, institutional and geographic diversity and has an increasingly rich and visible public outreach program. This consists of (a) public lectures that introduce the public to the most exciting directions of current scientific research as well as to issues concerning science policy; (b) Dialogues on Physics, informal get-togethers where leading esearchers discuss their current research interests in a relaxed setting during which questions and discussions between the speaker and the public are strongly encouraged; and (c) tutorials on various areas of physics. In recent years the ACP has enhanced its presence in the Aspen Community by establishing closer ties and collaborations with the Aspen Institute and the newly created Aspen Science Center. Support for the Aspen Center for Physics will be provided through the Divisions of stronomical Sciences, Materials Research, and Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and through the Biological Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Each year, the ACP also organizes five to seven one-week Winter Conferences, bringing together as many as 100 researchers each week to respond rapidly to breaking developments in areas of current interest in physics and interdisciplinary research.  During the last 5 years, the ACP held 59 summer and 25 winter programs. These programs have collectively helped change the direction of whole sub-fields of physics. The total number of person-weeks attended during this period was 2570 in particle physics, 2543 in condensed matter physics, 2308 in astrophysics, 923 in biology, and 910 in strings/mathematical physics, respectively. This last category represents a fast increasing fraction over the 2006-2010 timeframe. Aspen provides a unique environment in which the next generation of physicists is informed and inspired, seminal ideas are germinated, and new collaborations are forged. Its signature approaches to facilitating the cross-fertilization of ideas and fields, in an environment that fosters contemplation and creativity, distinguish it as a unique resource upon which the physics community, and increasingly the broader scientific community, has grown to rely. Over the past 5 years, the Center has run highly successful workshops and conferences in the core area of quantum condensed matter physics; has greatly expanded its presence in æsoftÆ (classical) condensed matter physics; has established itself as an important center of activity in the field of quantum computing; has furthered the new developments linking condensed matter, biology, high energy and atomic physics; and has forged a new set of interactions between physicists and mathematicians in the area of geometry and packing problems and between physicists and computer scientists in the area of algorithms. Particle physics workshops and conferences at the ACP have reflected the exciting developments in the Energy, Intensity and Cosmic frontiers.  Hundreds of papers begun and/or finished at the Aspen Center for Physics describe path-breaking research in theoretical high-energy physics that have resulted from collaborative efforts either initiated or pursued at these summer workshops and winter conferences. The last 5 years in astrophysics at the ACP have included diverse topics such as planet formation, galaxy formation and evolution, astrophysical jets, stellar winds, gamma ray bursts, black hole formation, the evolution of large-scale structure in the Universe, and cosmology from the early to late universe. Areas of biophysical research explored at Aspen range from the molecular origin of disease, and systems biology at the cellular, tissue, and organismal levels, to new techniques applied to protein structure and evolutionary analysis of genomes and systems. Superstring theory, constructed in Aspen in the early 1970s, continues to bring physicists to the Center with workshops in three of the five past summers, and a winter string theory conference held in 2011. In particle, condensed matter, and astrophysics, the Aspen Center for Physics has established itself as one of the most unique and productive r...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
