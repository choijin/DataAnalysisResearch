<AbstractNarration>Technical:  This project seeks to understand the mechanism of operation of ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) configured as solid-state electroluminescent devices. These materials can have efficiencies (10 Lm/W) and brightness (300 cd/m2 ), and can be fabricated using a single layer of organic material processed from solution. Contrary to mainstream organic light emitting diodes, they do not require low work function electrodes, and as a result offer potential for electroluminescent devices with reduced encapsulation requirements that can be deposited on practically any substrate. Additionally, iTMCs enable unique device fabrication paradigms, such as by soft-contact lamination, as well as the development of large-area illumination panels that do not require patterning of the organic layer. However, in order to realize this potential, advances in understanding and functionality are needed. Namely, their color gamut needs to be extended to the blue part of the spectrum, and their lifetime is practically untested. A goal will be to synthesize novel iTMCs that show blue emission and improved stability in devices. The aim is to obtain deeper understanding of the device physics of mixed conductors, and elucidate device-relevant degradation pathways for transition metal complexes. The project will also address device fabrication with improved stability under minimal encapsulation conditions, and emission that covers the visible part of the spectrum. The research is expected to impact other materials classes, such as ceramics, and other technologies, such as fuel cells and photovoltaics.&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical: This project provides integrated education and research training to graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary field including chemistry, engineering, materials science and physics. This project brings together faculty from the Departments of Materials Science &amp; Engineering of Cornell University, the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University, as well as from the Departments of Physics and Chemistry at Simmons College. The partnership between Cornell and Simmons (a predominately undergraduate women's college) will involve over 35 undergraduate students in research. In addition, the Chemistry and Physics Liaison (a student organization for chemistry and physics majors) will incorporate a new demonstration highlighting light emitting diodes into its yearly outreach activities for middle school and high school classrooms. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
