<AbstractNarration>Inorganic chalcogenide glasses (ChG's) are promising candidates for both optical and electrical applications as they possess excellent transparency in key spectral regimes, widely varying (tunable) electrical properties and are amenable to on-chip manufacturing processes.  However, their long-term stability is often unacceptable.  Recent efforts by our research team have suggested that such limitations can be overcome by the partial replacement of the primary chalcogen (S or Se), with oxygen.  Preliminary data suggest that key optical properties of such oxy-chalcogenide (OChG) glasses can be superior to terminal ChG or oxide glass compositions.  In the proposed NSF-EU program, three U.S. research teams in partnership with two French research sites will collaborate to synthesize and evaluate the optical and electrical properties of these new OChG materials.  The program aims to (i) maintain the attractive features of ChG's but blend the beneficial attributes found in oxides; (ii) create glasses with improved mechanical, thermal and transport properties and long-term stability; (iii) utilized key learnings in optical and electrical modifications associated with oxygen substitution to produce materials amenable to photo-induced modification resulting in novel device structures.  Glass compositions to be evaluated include modified GeO2-GeS2 compositions and Ag doped:OChG; these materials will be compared to their parent oxide and ChG materials, for optical applications; thio-nitride and thio-oxynitrides will be evaluated for Li:battery applications. Resulting OChG will be assessed for their photosensitivity and the potential for further enhancement of properties using light-induced structural changes.  Successful candidate bulk materials will then be transferred to use in film and fiber form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assemblage of glass science, chemistry and optical science expertise among the researchers, brings a proven track record of educational outreach and mentoring, and it is expected that the international team of students and faculty will extend key scientific and technological know-how to both sides of the partnership, while furthering the success of our established international collaboration.  The Division of Materials Research (Ceramics) and the International Office (Western Europe) will support this program involving researchers from the University of Central Florida School of Optics, Iowa State University and Lehigh University working with researchers at the Univeristies of Bordeaux and Rennes in France.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
