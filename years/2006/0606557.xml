<AbstractNarration>Earth Systems Science (40) This project is creating and testing three modules that use a Geographic Information System (GIS) to investigate socially relevant Earth and environmental hazards. These resources fill a pressing need for data-rich student investigations that use contemporary technology in a pedagogically sound manner. The modules being developed will have students investigate the 1994 Northridge, California earthquake, the 1999 and 2003 tornado outbreaks in the US mid-continent, as well as the tsunami, earthquake and volcanic hazards threatening Seattle, Washington. Instructors at institutions currently using the NSF-funded SAGUARO investigations are field-testing these new materials. In addition, workshops are being offered at national meetings to introduce more instructors to the resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design philosophy of teaching with GIS-not about GIS-reflects PI research results on how students learn with GIS technology. As students use GIS to investigate and visualize data they develop critical problem solving and GIS specific skills. These case studies are being used successfully in large and small enrollment lecture or laboratory courses and in distance learning environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: We have created new instructional resources and models of how to effectively integrate technology-based inquiry exercises in introductory Earth and environmental science courses. We are also providing data on how students learn with GIS technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project helps in developing and maintaining a scientifically literate society and competitive workforce, actively contributes to the professional development of college-level Earth and environmental science faculty, and enhances the use of research-based educational materials in the classroom. Dissemination through the DLESE and in professional development workshops targeting community colleges and smaller universities is broadening the use of technology by underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
