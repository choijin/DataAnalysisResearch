<AbstractNarration>PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Hong Hua&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No. 0644446&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many applications, from planetary sciences to medicine, require practitioners to correlate and understand complex datasets through a range of dimensions, scales, resolutions, and temporal dynamics. Such complex nature is referred to as data heterogeneity. Clearly, how we organize, visualize, and correlate these heterogeneous datasets will influence the effectiveness of information interpretation and decision-making, and ultimately reflect on the success of a task.&lt;br/&gt;Many technical challenges persist in effectively dealing with complex visualization tasks involving large-scale heterogeneous data. To address some of the challenges, the PI aims to develop a heterogeneous display environment integrated with versatile data visualization and user interaction capabilities. The design of the visualization system is guided by a theory where the various aspects of complex controls on 3D visualization and user interaction are viewed as a multidimensional continuum space. The proposed system can potentially facilitate the process of visualizing and correlating large-scale heterogeneous data. Particularly, the PI will evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technology using scenarios directly related to scientific activities underway by researchers in NASA's Mars Exploration Program. The system will also offer a platform to refine the continuum theory and investigate methods that could improve the effectiveness of complex data visualization and user interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI further outlines a comprehensive plan for developing interdisciplinary education opportunities tightly integrated with the proposed research agenda for a wide range of learner groups. Examples include training opportunities embedded in research activities for diversified learner groups, curriculum development to address the educational needs for students in interdisciplinary areas of research; and the development of short courses and hands-on projects for summer schools and community outreach events. The PI will also explore the value of 3D visualization techniques in science and engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of these plans will set up a solid foundation for the PI to achieve her life-long goals of establishing first-class interdisciplinary research and educational programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Driven by the guidelines developed through usability studies and domain knowledge through field studies, the team developed a heterogeneous display environment integrated with a rich range of data visualization and user interaction capabilities.

The system offered a platform for investigating theory and methods that could help to tackle the challenges of creating effective data visualization and user interaction techniques. Through the course of the project, the team utilized the developed infrastructure to study and develop a range of 2D and 3D interaction techniques that facilitate a small group of users effectively exploring, interacting with, and collaborating on multiple heterogeneous datasets in coherent and intuitive manners.   One significant outcome of this grant was its impact on a new application domain, which is the Mining Safety Training Program developed by graduate student Leonard Brown collaboratively with the Department of Mining and Geological Engineering.  Overall, the sponsored research activities output nearly 20 publications, a work in-progress PhD dissertation, and 4 patent applications.  Besides the research outcomes, a wide range of educational activities were carried out, including the creation of interdisciplinary educational opportunities embedded in research activities for a wide range of learner groups, curriculum development to address the educational needs for students in interdisciplinary areas of research; and the development of short courses and hands-on projects for summer schools and community outreach events.

Additionally, two undergraduate students (Optical Science) and one undergraduate senior from a minority school participated in the projects as undergraduate research assistant or summer intern for research experience training.  On the aspect of curriculum development, the PI developed a new graduate/undergraduate course on the topic of "Introduction to Display Science and Technology." The course was offered every year to both local graduate/undergraduate students as well as to distance learning students.
