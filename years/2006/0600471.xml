<AbstractNarration>Sidman proposes two main lines of investigation.  The first involves &lt;br/&gt;lexicographic Groebner bases and the other has to do with properties of &lt;br/&gt;secant varieties.  The goal of her work on lexicographic Groebner bases is &lt;br/&gt;to use the notion of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity to produce concrete &lt;br/&gt;statements about the complexity of the lexicographic term ordering and the &lt;br/&gt;geometry of projections that would explicitly confirm long-held beliefs &lt;br/&gt;about their behavior.  She also proposes to work on several problems in &lt;br/&gt;which computational and combinatorial methods are applied to the study of &lt;br/&gt;secant varieties.  Interest in secant varieties has arisen in diverse &lt;br/&gt;areas including algebraic geometry, coding theory, computational &lt;br/&gt;complexity, and algebraic statistics.  Recent applications of secant &lt;br/&gt;varieties in algebraic statistics have brought both new techniques and new &lt;br/&gt;questions to the forefront. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the undergraduate mathematics curriculum the objects of so-called &lt;br/&gt;"modern" algebra, groups, rings, fields, and modules, have a reputation &lt;br/&gt;for being very abstract.  Indeed, the names "modern algebra" and "abstract &lt;br/&gt;algebra" are often used interchangeably.  The power of the abstraction &lt;br/&gt;only becomes evident when one sees how these ideas enable us to discuss an &lt;br/&gt;increasingly large variety of applications in a common framework.  &lt;br/&gt;Computational algebra is an area that is useful to pure mathematicians in &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.  It is also able to bridge the &lt;br/&gt;divide between abstract algebra and many concrete applications including &lt;br/&gt;integer programming, enumeration problems in statistics, and geometric &lt;br/&gt;modeling.  Sidman's first project connects computational algebra with &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry.  The questions she proposes to study related to secant &lt;br/&gt;varieties are also related to algebraic geometry, but were motivated by &lt;br/&gt;work in the emerging field of algebraic statistics.  Thus, the proposed &lt;br/&gt;work reflects the ways in which pure and applied mathematics influence &lt;br/&gt;each other, often in unexpected ways.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
