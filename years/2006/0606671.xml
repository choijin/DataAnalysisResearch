<AbstractNarration>Wang&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0606671&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and colleagues study the impact of using&lt;br/&gt;simplified models as well as the effect of noise on uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;propagation in terms of statistical solutions in several fluid&lt;br/&gt;systems.  The physical problems under investigation are large&lt;br/&gt;Prandtl number or small Ekman number regimes in Rayleigh-Benard&lt;br/&gt;convection, large Prandtl-Darcy number or small Darcy number&lt;br/&gt;regimes in convection in fluid saturated porous media, and&lt;br/&gt;stochastically forced quasi-geostrophic systems with random&lt;br/&gt;noise.  Model reduction in the parameter regimes for the&lt;br/&gt;convection problems leads to singular limit problems involving&lt;br/&gt;multiple time and spatial scales.  One of the goals here is to&lt;br/&gt;investigate what kind of statistical properties can be&lt;br/&gt;approximated using the statistical properties of the simplified&lt;br/&gt;models derived via singular limits.  In the case of systems with&lt;br/&gt;random noise, which are modeled by stochastic partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, the investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;investigate possible noise-induced statistical stabilities, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;stability of statistical properties with respect to initial&lt;br/&gt;condition and parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     There are abundant uncertainties in nature.  For instance,&lt;br/&gt;prediction of the path of a hurricane is influenced by&lt;br/&gt;(imperfect) information about the initial distribution of&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric and sea surface temperatures, wind, and the&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric jet stream, as well as by the imperfect model itself. &lt;br/&gt;The climate (long-time behavior) of the earth may be influenced&lt;br/&gt;by the ozone layer, concentrations of carbon dioxide, and other&lt;br/&gt;factors.  Transport of contaminants in ground water is influenced&lt;br/&gt;by porosity and permeability of the media, which are random. &lt;br/&gt;Studying the influence of various uncertainties on the&lt;br/&gt;geophysical flows considered here helps us better understand the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the flows. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
