<AbstractNarration>This project intends to focus on several aspects of this development: self-improving algorithms; online data reconstruction; sublinear algorithms; dimension reduction; low en-tropy data structures, nonuniformly priced computation; and data analysis. The scope of the proposed research is intentionally wide-ranging. Indeed, it is the PI's belief, backed by his preliminary investigations, that progress on these topics will rely on the emergence of common threads and broadly applicable methods.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is to lay down the foundations for a systematic study of data-powered algorithms. The eort will involve theoretical investigations coupled with extensive computer experimentation. The principal beneciaries of data-powered algorithms come from engineering and the natural sciences, and this is where the broader impact of this proposal will be sought; specically, via the PI's ongoing research collaborations with biologists and physicists and, on the educational front, his joint effort with them to develop a year-long algorithms-based course for quantitative scientists.</AbstractNarration>
