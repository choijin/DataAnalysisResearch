<AbstractNarration>Ribosomes are macromolecular complexes composed of three different ribosomal RNAs and over 50 different ribosomal proteins. These complexes can be assembled, in vitro, under carefully defined conditions. During the assembly process, complex changes in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) structure occur as proteins are added, transforming the complexes into functional ribosomal subunits. The individual steps in this process, as each protein is added, will be analyzed by assessing the availability of portions of the rRNA to modification using dimethyl sulfate. This will be done in millisecond time frames following the addition of certain ribosomal proteins to the rRNA. This novel technique, termed rapid non-equilibrium probing, will provide significant insight into transient structural changes occurring in the rRNA that are necessary to develop functional ribosomes. Such insight is critical to understanding protein/RNA interactions, since it is clear that the process of binding the proteins involves structural changes in the rRNA. In addition, further development of the rapid non-equilibrium probing technique promises widespread impact on many fields, since it can be applied to virtually any system as it functions, including nucleic acid-protein interactions and protein-protein interactions, providing the modification reaction time scales are suitable. Additionally, with the continued development of the powerful software described in this proposal, it will be possible to develop kinetic models of such interactions in atomic detail. A broader impact of this project is that students will be able to participate in the development and expansion of a novel approach in the study of protein/RNA interactions which will involve "hands-on" preparation of ribosomes, ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNA and primer extension sequencing techniques. In addition, there will be excellent opportunities to develop additional computer modeling software to model the structural changes that occur as the ribosome is assembled.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Title: Probing Ribosome Assembly  PI: Walter Hill  Awardee: University of Montana  Award Number: 0614824 Award Expires:07/31/2011       PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT  Ribosomes are found in all living cells and are the place where proteins are made according to the instructions given in the genetic message.  Ribosomes are composed of ribonucleic acid (ribosomal RNA &ndash; rRNA) and 50 or more different proteins (ribosomal proteins).  Ribosomes always have two, unequally sized subunits, both composed of rRNA and proteins.  The structure and details of the function of these particles have been studied intensively for over 50 years in an effort to understand how the complex process of protein biosynthesis takes place.  It has been found that the rRNA and proteins are interspersed in a very specific manner, and that the process of putting the rRNA and proteins together is very complex.  Our effort has been to study the changes in the structure of the rRNA as specific proteins are added.  To do this we have devised a method called time-dependent chemical probing.  We use a chemical, dimethyl sulfate (DMS), which places a methyl group on specific portions of the nucleotides, of which the rRNA is composed.  These methyl groups will only attach to specific atoms on these nucleotide bases.  When those atoms are exposed, methyl groups are attached.  When they are hidden, the methyl groups cannot be added.  We can identify the positions of the methyl groups by sequencing the rRNA.  We use a quench-flow instrument which allows us to mix two samples for a brief time and then modify the mixture with DMS to identify those bases that are available or hidden.  We look for bases that become more or less modified by DMS as time progresses, suggesting structural changes occurring at those sites.   As we have applied this method over the period of this study, we have seen definite structural changes occurring in the rRNA as a result of one or more proteins being bound.  We have identified these, and have published the results in two significant papers [1, 2].  During the process we found a certain region of the rRNA in the small (30S) ribosomal subunit that behaved in an erratic manner (helix 11 loop).  As we further characterized this small loop region, we ascertained that it performed an important bridging function between two ribosomal proteins, S17 and S20.  We recently found that when an elongation factor (EF-G) was added to the ribosomes, this region became very active with respect to DMS modification, even though it was quite distant from the binding site of DMS.   These finding have led us to postulate that this region acts as a spring between these two proteins.  During protein translation, as EF-G is bound, it appears that protein S17 is moved, opening the distance between protein S17 and S20, allowing increased methylation of this helix 11 loop region of the rRNA.  This finding suggests a mechanism in which the ribosome performs some of the functions occurring during protein biosynthesis.  These finding have been accepted for publication {Hedrick, Tanner, Baig &amp; Hill &ndash; J. Mol. Biol.)  In this paper we have proposed a mechanism in which this region of rRNA is activated.  This is shown in Figure 1.  Thus, the results obtained from this study went far beyond the original scope, giving much insight into the movements of the rRNA as proteins were added and during translation.  It appears that the ribosome is very much a "fantastic machine," with many moving parts [3].  Further studies using this time-dependent probing approach are essential to provide additional understanding of the details of this biomechanical wonder!     1.         Hedrick, E.G. and W.E.
