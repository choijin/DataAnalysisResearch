<AbstractNarration>Research in the life sciences is undergoing a radical transformation.  With the complete genome sequences of many organisms now available, scientists can begin to tackle fundamental questions that were previously intractable. Where do new genes come from?  Which genes make us uniquely human? What functions are associated with different regions of the genome?  Genomics will reshape biological research in the next twenty years and have a profound impact on medicine and human health, agriculture, engineering, our understanding of the origin of life and of the relationships among living organisms.  Research in this new area requires the coordinated interaction of scientists with diverse backgrounds.  To address this need, an Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program in Genomics was established at the University of Arizona five years ago.  In recognition of the changing directions of the field, four new activities will take place in this renewal: (1) a lecture and computer laboratory course on comparative genomics, in which all students will learn the foundations of genomics including the skills to participate in (2) a hands-on  class on reserach in genomics, (3) teaching and outreach at a local science magnet high school with 70% minority enrollment, and (4) annual symposia with invited speakers from other institutions.  The program will also build on existing strengths, including interdisciplinary advising, research rotations, seminars, training in ethics, discussion groups, and internships at other academic institutions or in industry.  The impact of this training program will be to equip the next generation of biologists with the tools to tackle the challenges of genome-scale research.  This program to date has been highly successful, having trained Ph.D. students in 37 labs from 14 departments at the University of Arizona.  A key new component of the renewal is the plan to involve IGERT students in high school science education. This will bring science in general, and genomics in particular, to a wider community, and will encourage minority students to enter careers in science at an early stage of their education. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
