<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Patricia McAnany, Eleanor Harrison-Buck will analyze data gathered from archaeological excavations of Maya settlements in the Sibun Valley of Belize. This valley is notable for its position as a frontier zone, politically contested by two competing core areas"the Peten to the west and Yucatan to the north. During the Late-to-Terminal Classic transition (A.D. 700 - A.D. 900), Peten centers in the "Maya heartland" declined and the regional center of Chichen Itza extended its power base beyond northern Yucatan through an expanded trade network along the Caribbean. In the Sibun Valley and elsewhere along the eastern coast, circular-shrines were constructed, resembling smaller versions of those at Chichen Itza. Ceramics bearing northern attributes either were locally produced or imported from the north. At some locales, obsidian from northern procurement sources (including Central Mexico) has been identified. Harrison-Buck's research in the Sibun examines group identity in a frontier zone through technological analyses of Yucatec-style architecture and artifacts. This study aims to clarify whether changes in architecture and material culture are purely stylistic"pointing to local elite emulation of northern styles"or represent a fundamental shift in the social and economic organization, perhaps as a result of northern groups entering the valley at the end of the Classic period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent archaeological studies of identity in frontier zones suggest that crisp social boundaries in the material landscape are difficult to define. To address the complexities of social identity in a frontier zone, artifacts from three Sibun Valley settlements with circular architecture"Pechtun Ha, Oshon, and Obispo"will be subjected to an extensive program of analysis. Typological analysis of the ceramics and local clay sampling conducted by Harrison-Buck forms the basis of a mineralogical and chemical study using petrography and Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA). Together, the results offer information regarding stylistic and technological changes and a basis for differentiating local and foreign-made pottery. The nature of exchange patterns is further evaluated by sourcing a large sample of obsidian. Chronological refinement of the Late-Terminal Classic transition in Maya Lowland archaeology is achieved through intensive radiocarbon dating of different levels of excavation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has significant intellectual merit, shedding light on the movement of goods and ideas, as well as people in a frontier zone, while advancing our general understanding of ancient Maya society during a period of profound social change. The application of chemical and compositional analyses answers the call for a more sophisticated approach to understanding social identity and interaction in frontier archaeology. The methodological approach developed, which explores important relationships between social identity, style and the fabric of technological production, can be applied to other study areas throughout the world. All results posted on the web will allow for comparative study and broaden the public visibility of the project. Participation in professional conferences and publication in refereed journals will communicate the results to the wider academic community. The author as well as graduate students at various institutions will gain valuable training in the methods of analysis mentioned above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
