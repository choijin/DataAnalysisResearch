<AbstractNarration>The purpose of the proposed project is to build the capacity of Historically Black Colleges and&lt;br/&gt;Universities (HBCUs) in the teaching and practice of evaluation, with a focus on STEM&lt;br/&gt;education programs. The goal is to diversify and build leadership in the field, as well as&lt;br/&gt;strengthen evaluator skills in assessing academic programs focused on STEM with multiethnic&lt;br/&gt;and underrepresented populations. This will be accomplished through three major activities: (1) a&lt;br/&gt;conference of HBCU faculty evaluators and evaluation consultants to assess their current program&lt;br/&gt;evaluation and related research and teaching activities and to identify effective models of&lt;br/&gt;evaluation capacity building and networking, (2) the creation of a communications network and&lt;br/&gt;mechanism for information sharing regarding evaluation instruction and practice among HBCUs&lt;br/&gt;and between HBCUs and other higher education institutions, and (3) a meeting with key leaders&lt;br/&gt;from agencies and organizations that promote diversity in evaluation across a variety of&lt;br/&gt;educational levels, disciplines and contexts to share the results of the discussions and networking&lt;br/&gt;outlined above (NSF, AEA, AERA and APA). The project outcome will be the development of&lt;br/&gt;an action plan with recommendations for building evaluation capacity at these institutions and&lt;br/&gt;increasing minority faculty and students in the evaluation profession.</AbstractNarration>
