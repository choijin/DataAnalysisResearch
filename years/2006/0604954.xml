<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analysis of massive data sets now commonly arising in scientific investigations poses many statistical challenges not present in smaller scale studies. Many of these data sets exhibit sparsity where most of the data corresponds to noise and only a small fraction is of interest. In such situations mixture models can provide an effective and  convenient framework for a wide variety of problems. The investigators propose to develop a comprehensive methodology  for mixture models in sparse settings. There are four main goals to be pursued in  moderately sparse and  super sparse environments. The first is to make precise how well sparsity can be estimated as well as to develop a general methodology for estimating sparsity. A second goal is to develop a data dependent thresholding rule which with high probability yields a collection of cases almost all of which correspond to signal. The investigators also plan to develop a theory which makes precise the possible tradeoffs between discovering signal and including noise. A third goal is to develop a theory of optimal detection for sparse mixture models. A final goal is to provide a theoretical basis for connecting mixture models with sequence models another useful framework for analyzing sparse data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research on sparse inference will provide technical tools as well as methodology, to researchers in other scientific fields who collect and analyze large data sets with sparse signals. These fields include astronomy, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and genetics. The  procedures and algorithms will be implemented in Splus or Matlab and made available on the Internet along with the associated research reports so as to facilitate comparisons with other approaches.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
