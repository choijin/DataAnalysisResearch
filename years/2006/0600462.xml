<AbstractNarration>AST-0600462&lt;br/&gt;Devlin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cosmological and astrophysical value of measuring the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and polarization is well known.  Unfortunately, many details of possible polarized foreground signals are still unknown, and this is expected to be the single most significant obstacle to accurate measurements of the CMB polarization.  This trial project will use the Green Bank radio telescope to measure the high frequency polarization of a carefully selected sample of some 35 galaxies, in order to decide on the feasibility and usefulness of a much larger future survey.  Such measurements are necessary because prior extensive data are only available for low frequencies, where depolarization effects in transit are significant.  Whatever the conclusion about the continued survey, this pilot study will produce useful data on galaxy properties, and will introduce two promising undergraduate students to research with an experienced team.</AbstractNarration>
