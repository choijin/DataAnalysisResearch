<AbstractNarration>The Cedar Creek Long-Term Ecological Research project would use long-term experimentation, observation and theory to examine (1) the impacts of human-driven changes, especially loss of biodiversity, climatic variation, N deposition, land cover and use change, changes in fire frequency, elevated CO2, and exotic species, on community dynamics and ecosystem structure and function; (2) how the traits and evolutionary heritages of species influence community assembly, ecosystem dynamics, biogeochemistry and the invasiveness of exotic species; (3) how predators, pathogens and diseases influence species and ecosystem dynamics; (4) the causes of multi-species coexistence; and (5) how the quantity and economic value of services produced by ecosystems depends on ecosystem species composition, diversity and management. These questions would be pursued in a coordinated series of large-scale, long-term field experiments, related long-term observational studies, and theoretical analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overriding goal of this research is to provide deeper understanding of the processes&lt;br/&gt;and principles that govern the dynamics and functioning of communities and ecosystems. This research centers on the interplay among experimental results, observational data, and the predictions of theory. Each constrains, modifies and inspires the other, providing deeper understanding of the dynamics and functioning of the grassland, savanna, and forested ecosystems of the region. The research combines studies of numerous species in several trophic levels with studies of ecosystem processes and of the feedbacks between species and the ecosystem processes. It combines and synthesizes the often disparate approaches of ecophysiology, population, community and ecosystem ecology. The new and continuing work proposed would build on the rich knowledge base that has accumulated at the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project achieves broader impacts because results of the proposed studies would&lt;br/&gt;improve understanding of the long-term societal implications of human impacts on ecosystems. For instance, the research would help elucidate both the factors that control biodiversity and the effects of the loss of biodiversity on ecosystem services such as the removal by ecosystems of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the long-term sequestration of this carbon in soil. In addition, results would be communicated to the media and government organizations; K-12 teachers, K-12 students, journalists and the general public would be taught about scientific research and recent results; undergraduates would gain research experiences; and graduate students and post-doctoral researchers would receive advanced research training. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

From 2006 to 2013 more than fifty new ecological research projects were initiated. These projects, and many long-established experiments, have provided unique insights into how and why biodiversity loss, nitrogen deposition, climatic warming, elevated CO2 and other variables impact the functioning of ecosystems.

The current Cedar Creek data catalog contains more than 400 unique data sets. Cedar Creek has also contributed data to many large-scale repositories such as the National Phenology Network, GenBank (NIH genetic sequence database) and the TRY global plant traits database.   Some Key Outcomes:  Ecosystems are increasingly being valued for the multiple services that they can provide. Results of our biodiversity experiment show that local diversity was sufficient to maximize some ecosystem services, but that diverse landscape mosaics were needed to assure the provisioning of multiple services.  Our 30 year old nitrogen enrichment experiment has uncovered a plant diversity "regime shift." In particular, we found that the effects of a decade of nutrient enrichment were not reversed by 20 years of cessation of N addition. Rather an alternative low-diversity state had been created that persisted despite decreases in soil nitrate and annual supply of seeds from nearby high-diversity plots.  It has long been suggested that plants will show a tradeoff between competition and defense. NutNet research found no support for a competition-defense tradeoff in 500 species subjected to identical fencing and nutrient addition treatments at 39 sites around the world. Further, we found that there is a strong general tradeoff between species growth rates and defense.  In a grassland experiment that manipulated atmospheric CO2, soil nitrogen, and summer rainfall for five years, elevated CO2 increased plant biomass by &gt;33% when summer rainfall and/or nitrogen supply were at higher levels. However, elevated CO2 did not do so when rainfall and nitrogen supply were low. These results suggest that large stimulation of biomass by rising CO2 may be unlikely when water is limiting.  In a cross-site comparison of five grassland sites, elevated inputs of nitrogen increased decomposition of fast-cycling soil carbon, but slowed decomposition of slow-cycling carbon, mirroring effects of nitrogen found previously for litter decomposition and suggesting that effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on ecosystem carbon sequestration will depend on the balance between these opposing processes.  Preliminary results suggest that, while many urban yards contain different naturally regenerating species, those different species are closely related to one another and have similar leaf morphologies. This suggests that the same kinds of species live in different cities throughout the US, and that US urban plant communities are becoming homogenized. However, the plants within the cities are different to those we find in more natural areas surrounding them.
