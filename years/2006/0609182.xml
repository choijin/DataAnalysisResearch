<AbstractNarration>0609182&lt;br/&gt;Langer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative NSF 05-601 category NIRT A. The objective of this research is to nanofabricate biologically interfacing materials with well defined surface morphologies. Through controlling the surface features of biocompatible polymers on the nanoscale, and through systematically developing an understanding of how nanotopography influences adhesion to biological tissues, a new class of self-adhesive nano-structured biomaterials will be developed. Using nano-molding techniques, pillars resembling hairs or spatulaeon the palms of geckos will be created which will substantially increase the surface area and render these materials adhesive through increased van der Waals and capillary interactions. Through using soft flexible materials, the nanostructured surfaces should easily conform to irregularly shaped surfaces, such as those encountered in the body, thereby maximizing molecular interactions at the interface. It is anticipated that these materials will be readily transferable into a wide range of minimally invasive medical treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering potential applications in daily surgical practice, these materials may decrease surgical complications, such as infection, by reducing traumatic tissue handling, reducing excessive bleeding, and reducing operating times. Through providing new methods to quickly seal tissues and to bond tissues together, this work may impact society by reducing complications associated with many common medical procedures thereby improving the quality of life. In addition to surgical applications, the proposed technology is potentially useful in areas from tissue engineering of replacement organs, where adhesion between various tissues is essential for proper function. As a primary component or our outreach program, undergraduate students will assist in the development of a website to increase awareness of nanotechnology in medicine. To foster integration of research and education, key results from this work will be presented to rural and intercity high school students and to the general public at the Boston Museum of Science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
