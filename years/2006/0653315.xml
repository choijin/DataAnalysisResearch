<AbstractNarration>Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the currently accepted theory of&lt;br/&gt;the strong nuclear force which binds quarks and gluons together to form&lt;br/&gt;hadrons, such as the proton and neutron.  Understanding hadron formation&lt;br/&gt;is a long standing problem in nuclear/particle physics.  A major objective&lt;br/&gt;of this proposal is to use large-scale computer simulations with QCD&lt;br/&gt;formulated on a space-time lattice to carry out ab initio determinations&lt;br/&gt;of the mass spectrum of hadrons expected from the QCD theory.  The novel&lt;br/&gt;feature of the proposed activities is the use of large sets of spatially&lt;br/&gt;extended hadron operators in order to study more-massive excited hadron states,&lt;br/&gt;not just the lightest states.  These states are currently of great interest &lt;br/&gt;to experimentalists, exemplified by the Hall B N-star program and the GlueX&lt;br/&gt;experimental program in the proposed Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National&lt;br/&gt;Accelerator Facility, as well as the CLEO-c project at Cornell.  Understanding&lt;br/&gt;the physics of quark confinement within hadrons is also an important &lt;br/&gt;intellectual challenge; in fact, the Yang-Mills mass gap is one of the &lt;br/&gt;seven so-called Millenium Prize problems announced by the Clay Mathematics &lt;br/&gt;Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The proposed research incorporates &lt;br/&gt;the participation of two graduate students, and possibly one or more &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students, whose educations will be enhanced not only&lt;br/&gt;by involvement in scientific projects at the forefront of nuclear theory,&lt;br/&gt;but also with high-technology training in the use of state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;parallel computing resources.  Students will be funded to participate in&lt;br/&gt;international conferences.  The broader impacts of the proposed activities&lt;br/&gt;will be strengthened through articles in popular publications and by posting&lt;br/&gt;results with simplified background information on publicly accessible web pages.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
