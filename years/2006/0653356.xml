<AbstractNarration>This project addresses certain basic aspects of the electroweak and &lt;br/&gt;strong interactions reflected in the properties of mesons and nucleons &lt;br/&gt;(particles found inside atomic nuclei) and their interactions at low &lt;br/&gt;energies.  The strong and weak interactions are responsible for the &lt;br/&gt;structure of matter at the smallest known scale, a femtometer (size of &lt;br/&gt;the hydrogen nucleus) or less.  The research is motivated by the fact &lt;br/&gt;that the present comprehensive theory -- the Standard Model (SM) -- is &lt;br/&gt;known to be incomplete. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The rare decay of the pi-meson (pion) into an electron and a neutrino, &lt;br/&gt;occurring once in about ten thousand ordinary pion decays, provides a &lt;br/&gt;theoretically extraordinarily clean window to certain possible &lt;br/&gt;extensions of the SM, at a very large mass scale not directly &lt;br/&gt;accessible at any existing or planned accelerators.  The PEN &lt;br/&gt;experiment, mounted at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, by an &lt;br/&gt;international collaboration of seven institutions led by the &lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia (UVa) group, builds on the success of the &lt;br/&gt;PIBETA experiment which improved by about an order of magnitude the &lt;br/&gt;accuracy of several rare decay modes of the pion and muon (a massive &lt;br/&gt;relative of the electron) in a series of measurements from 1999 &lt;br/&gt;through 2004.  A new project, encompassing experiments "Nab" and &lt;br/&gt;"abBA," has been initiated at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak &lt;br/&gt;Ridge National Lab in Tennessee, with the aim to measure precisely and &lt;br/&gt;simultaneously several of the decay parameter of the neutron beta &lt;br/&gt;decay.  Through their precision, these experiments will explore &lt;br/&gt;similarly interesting possible extensions to the SM. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;During the past five years this program has resulted in four doctoral &lt;br/&gt;degrees at UVa.  Two UVa Ph.D. students are currently working towards &lt;br/&gt;their theses, plans call for a third to join the group soon.  Each &lt;br/&gt;year typically one to two undergraduate students are engaged in &lt;br/&gt;research on this project, thus gaining practical laboratory &lt;br/&gt;experience.</AbstractNarration>
