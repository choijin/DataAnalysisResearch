<AbstractNarration>Fire exerts a strong influence on vegetation patterns and ecosystem function.  It is a key process in some ecosystems, where periodic burning is essential for the long-term maintenance of vegetation structure and species composition.  In much of the U.S., fire exclusion over the twentieth century contributed to declines in the abundance of fire-associated vegetation.  The extensive oak (Quercus L.) and pine (Pinus L.) forests that cover the dry uplands of the central Appalachian Mountains are thought to have developed under a regime of frequent burning.  Currently, following several decades of fire exclusion, the dominant species in these ecosystems are declining in abundance, and fire-sensitive trees and shrubs are encroaching. Little is known about past fire regimes of the Appalachian Mountains or about the consequences of altered fire regimes for vegetation change.  This doctoral dissertation research will use dendroecological techniques to (1) characterize past and present fire regimes (i.e., frequency, severity, and seasonality of fire) in dry pine- and oak-dominated stands in the central Appalachian Mountains, (2) identify and quantify the climate forcing mechanisms that lead to temporal variability in fire regimes at annual to decadal time scales, (3) evaluate current age structure of the stands to assess potential links between fire and species establishment and (4) assess the successional trajectory of the stands in the absence of fire. The study will use fire-scarred cross-sections from yellow pine trees to characterize fire history. Fire-climate relationships will be assessed using superposed epoch analysis (SEA). Age structure analysis using tree-rings will be used to explore tree establishment and stand development in relation to fire events. Current tree species composition will be sampled to characterize the successional status of the stands and to develop a baseline for monitoring changes that result from succession or prescribed fire. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A considerable body of fire history research has been developed for some coniferous forest ecosystems in western and northern North America, but little such work has been conducted in the eastern U.S.  Previous fire history research in the central Appalachian Mountains has been limited to a few small studies based on = 20 fire-scarred samples from individual sites.  This research will use over 200 fire history specimens collected from three sites distributed across the central Appalachian Mountains to capture more of the variability in fire regimes than has been possible in previous studies.  Most previous studies of fire history have focused solely on coniferous forests, and therefore this project will make a unique contribution to fire history research.  Another important aspect of the work is that linking fire history data with age structure analysis will clarify the influence of past fires and subsequent fire suppression on stand-level vegetation change.  Moreover, the study will provide a scientific basis for prescribed burning programs in the central Appalachian Mountains.  The decline of fire-dependent species, such as Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens Lamb.), and the widespread lack of oak regeneration have stimulated a growing use of fire for resource management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
