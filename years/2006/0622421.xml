<AbstractNarration>There is a nationwide shortage of graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields in the U.S.  This project is helping to address this shortage by increasing the number of students graduating in the Biological Sciences area.  The following retention activities are being implemented: 1) one credit freshman seminar classes that teach students how to study science effectively; 2) one credit Applications courses for each of the four Biology courses that majors take in the first two years of the program that allow students to learn to apply difficult concepts in a small group; 3) monetary incentives to stay in the Biology program; 4) engagement of students in intensive research with faculty mentors; 5) expansion of group activities to increase the sense of community; 6) inclusion of scientists from underrepresented groups to serve as role models; and 7) increased interactions with minority student campus services.  The new recruiting strategies that are being implemented include: 1) increased communication with high schools and community colleges; 2) increased personal contacts between faculty and potential students; and 3) increased activities for high school students from surrounding areas.  The effectiveness of these recruitment and retention activities is being assessed and communicated to STEM disciplines at various institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Currently there are insufficient numbers of students graduating in the STEM disciplines such as biology in the United States to meet the needs of our economy in future years.  The major goal of this proposal was to increase the number of students majoring in biology and graduating with a degree in biology through the implementation of new recruitment and retention processes.    For this purpose we conducted various activities including the following: 1) We developed advertising brochures, posters, and presentations, 2) We  communicated with high school students by distributing recruitment literature; giving presentations; talking to high school counselors and science teachers; and making personal contacts with individual students and parents, 3) We have communicated with community college and tribal college students by distributing recruitment literature; giving presentations; talking to community college advisors; etc., 4) We have communicated with undeclared students of good standing at UNC by giving presentations, distributing literature at the advising center, and making personal contacts with the students, 5) We have developed streamlined procedures to matriculate undeclared students, non- STEM students from other majors, and transfer students into the biology degree programs, 6) We have awarded stipends to freshman biology majors to encourage them to major in biology and complete their biology degree, 7) We have developed and implemented a two semester Freshman seminar course (Bio 102, and 103, 1 credit each) that orients students to the university and school, helps students learn how to study, etc., 8) We developed and taught the following three 1 credit courses: Bio 112 Applications of Biological Principles, Bio 113 Applications of Organismal Biology, Bio 211 Applications of Cell Biology, and Bio 221 Applications of Genetics. These classes are taken the same semester that the students enroll in the courses required of all Biology majors for the first two years (Bio 110, Bio 111, Bio 210, Bio 220). These courses allow for student and professor interactions in a smaller group, further exploration of course concepts, application of the principles to problem solving, and critical thinking, 9) We have developed and implemented new academic/social activities to foster a sense of community among the biology students, and 10) We have funded students to pursue an extensive undergraduate research experience with a faculty mentor and present their findings at a scientific meeting.  In the Biology program at UNC, the average number of students enrolled per year for the five years prior to this grant was 297 and the average number that graduated per year in the four years prior to this grant was 50.  As of the most recent year report (July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012) there were 422 biology majors and 63 biology graduates.  Therefore we increased enrollment in the biology degree by 42% and increased the number of graduates by 26%.
