<AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Sciences, through the Ocean Studies Board (OSB) of the Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources will continue providing guidance on major ocean science and policy issues to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies. The Ocean Studies Board monitors the status and needs of ocean science community and assists NSF in developing and maintaining strong programs of ocean research responsive to scientific opportunities and national interests. OSB will: 1) contribute to the advancement of scientific understanding of the ocean by maintaining continuous oversight of the health of ocean sciences and stimulating their progress; 2) foster the application of scientific knowledge to the use of the ocean and its resources; 3)provide leadership for the formulation of national and international marine policy and to clarify scientific issues that affect ocean policy; and 4)address scientific issues involved in cooperative international oceanographic research, and to improve technical assistance. The OSB also serves as the U.S. National Committee for the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR). In this role, it assists in the development of U.S. positions on international ocean-related questions. Several other agencies also contribute to these activities and provide support for focused studies undertaken by the OSB.</AbstractNarration>
