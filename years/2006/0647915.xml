<AbstractNarration>The goal of this engineering education project is to develop a software package, InTEL (Interactive Toolkit for Engineering Education), for a Statics course that maps images from real world environments to abstract diagrams for 2D and 3D equilibrium problems.  Specifically, this project will test the efficacy of computer-based manipulable models for learning the engineering approach to problem solving, which is characterized by model-based reasoning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital technology offers the potential to provide both the scaffolding of model-based reasoning and the contextualization of abstract problems. This project will create, and iteratively test InTEL System which is expected to allow students to manipulate models and to move from real world objects to free-body diagrams to mathematical equations. The PIs will test student's ability to predict the outcome of a mechanical configuration, to create appropriate models on paper as well as on the computer, and to connect mathematical formulae with complex models. The results of the research are expected to refine our understanding of how engineers learn and will provide understanding regarding the kinds of representation that best scaffold their learning. The outcome is expected to be the creation of tools and a methodology that can be adapted nationwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty in model-building can cause a lack of confidence and a diminished sense of self-efficacy that is particularly problematic when amplified by gender and underrepresented minority (URM) issues. Women and minorities are also more likely to do well when problems are placed in a context of real world usefulness. An approach to teaching and learning Statics that effectively scaffolds students' efforts at model building and connects abstract problems with multiple real world applications will benefit all students and particularly help to promote diversity in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
