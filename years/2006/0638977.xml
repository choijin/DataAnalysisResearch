<AbstractNarration>The University of Central Florida is conducting a 48-month project with the Museum of Discovery and Science (MODS) in Ft. Lauderdale and with Simiosys, Inc. to develop augmented reality (AR) "scientific virtualizations" for the museum's 27,000 square-foot EcoDiscovery Center expansion.  The new wing has a science content focus on the Everglades, with experiences that allow visitors to explore questions about this ecosystem across the major variables of space, time, and scale.  A Web portal site is also being developed that includes science-related games and contests.  A key audience for the deliverables is adolescents.  They are part of the project's advisory committee and are being enlisted to assist with the project's formative evaluation processes and to recruit their peers to the exhibit and Web portal. The project is positioned as a model for other museums on the use of embedded augmented reality simulations, and a component of the evaluation plan is to ascertain the feasibility of diffusing the model to other institutions. The Orlando Science Center is participating as a prototype center in the earlier stages of the project.  Evaluation faculty at UCF are overseeing formative evaluation.  The Institute for Learning Innovation will carry out the summative evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ WaterÆs Journey through the Everglades explores time, place and scale as museum learners explore the most unique habitat in the world, the Florida Everglades.  Visitors have the opportunity to learn FloridaÆs Water Story as they manipulate surface sheet flow, how storms manifest differently in wet or dry seasons, and what the Hydrologic Cycle really means.  They explore an Augmented Reality Live Otter Habitat to discover how human development has devastated the other large mammals in Florida (the panther, bear and deer), and how Invasive Species brought by humans are changing the Everglades ecosystem in very negative ways.  Learners can play against their friends in the Hurricane Simulation, where they learn how to best prepare their house for a hurricane, and what factors influence the power and destruction of those annual storms.  They also travel back in time to see large-scale animations of Prehistoric Florida, better understanding the large and small creatures that were once here but no longer inhabit Florida.  Project outcomes are interactive simulation experiences, developed by E2i Creative Studio at the University of Central Florida in partnership with the Museum of Discovery and Science in Ft. Lauderdale, that enhance museum learning in a new EcoDiscovery wing at the museum. The multiple stations allow learners to explore the past, present and future health of the Florida Everglades and the impact of humans on the environment and the availability and flow of water.  Project impacts are adolescent learners and their families will gain a greater awareness of how water impacts the environment, from the local to the global. They will gain a clearer understanding of the time scales and scope of environmental change. Their confidence level in their ability to understand the relevance of science will rise.
