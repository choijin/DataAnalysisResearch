<AbstractNarration>California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly), along with Lucia Mar Unified School District (LMUSD), Santa Maria Bonita School District (SMBSD), and Santa Maria Joint Union High School District (SMJUHSD), are working together to implement a Noyce Scholars program that is attracting exceptional students and professionals, thereby preparing credentialed teachers who are committed to teaching in high-need school districts. The four-year program is providing 12 mathematics majors with two-year scholarships to support the final year of their undergraduate studies and their one-year credential program. Similarly, 12 current STEM professionals are being recruited to receive a one-year scholarship to support their work in the credential program at Cal Poly. In total, 24 Noyce scholars are being directly supported through this program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the Noyce program, Cal Poly is recruiting exceptional mathematics majors and current STEM professionals into a quality teacher preparation program. Noyce Scholars are being mentored by university faculty and local teachers who are challenging them to excel in the classroom. Scholars are being supported through seminars and coursework that allow them to consider educational issues on their way to receiving a single subject secondary teaching credential. This support is continuing through attendance at summer workshops as they begin careers as mathematics teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
