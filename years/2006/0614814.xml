<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We request that will be used to contribute to participate costs for the 10th symposium on Study of Earths Deep Interior (SEDI). The meeting will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from July 9-14, 2006.Intellectual Merit SEDI is an international scientific organization dedicated to the Study of the Earths Deep Interior. The ultimate goal SEDI is an enhanced understanding of the past evolution and current thermal, dynamical, and chemical state of the Earths deep interior and of the effect that the interior has on the structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth. The deep interior is generally considered to be the core and lower mantle, but interest may extend to the surface, for example, in the study if mantle plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earths deep interior, composition, structure and dynamics of the outer core, dynamo energetics, structure of the inner core, core cooling and the core-mantle boundary region, core-mantle boundary shape, coupling and the rotation of the Earth, lower mantle: structure, convention and plumes, nature and location of deep geochemical reservoirs, etc.Broader Impact this proposal will contribute to interdisciplinary education of US graduate students and young researchers by fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop style meeting. The international format complements efforts by US national groups such as CIDER and will be very useful to those funded under or seeking funding from the NSF CSEDI program. The structure of SEDI is intrinsically interdisciplinary, providing many opportunities for intra-and international collaborations on a range of topics that our understanding of the deep earth and other planetary interiors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
