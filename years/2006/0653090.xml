<AbstractNarration>The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program - University Partnership (NU STEP-UP) is a partnership between Northeastern University, two NSF-supported research centers and three Boston-area community colleges (Massachusetts Bay Community College, Middlesex Community College, and Northern Essex Community College) to increase the number of students receiving degrees in STEM disciplines. NU STEP-UP is focused on developing a sustainable STEM model that provides a seamless transition between two- and four-year institutions. Using research as the catalyst for engagement, NU STEP-UP is: (1) creating a sustainable STEM partnership between the university's STEM departments and local community colleges, (2) creating a Partner Faculty Network, with representatives from all stakeholders, (3) providing community college faculty the opportunity to immerse themselves in a research environment, (4) providing community college students access to extensive research experiences, (5) developing a transfer bridge program for community college students transitioning to Northeastern University; and (6) providing academic mentoring and research activities for all STEM students throughout the partnership. Participants in the Partner Faculty Network are involved in working seminars helping them implement the latest pedagogical approaches in their own classrooms. They are sharing innovative STEM instructional models and practice and collaborating to bring STEM courses at community colleges in alignment with comparable courses at four-year institutions. A multi-faceted approach to program evaluation aims to assess progress toward achieving established benchmarks, as well as to understand the contribution of various program elements. The evaluation plan includes: (1) tracking student transfer rates, retention rates and student performance, (2) surveys of stakeholders, including students, faculty and alumni, (3) focus groups with transfer students and with faculty, and (4) cohort analysis of transfer students. Results and outcomes are being disseminated through publications, a project web site, and presentations at regional and national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program - University Partnership (NU STEP-UP) was a partnership between Northeastern University (NU) and three Boston-area community colleges (Massachusetts Bay Community College, Middlesex Community College, and Northern Essex Community College).  The core project objective was to increase the number of students receiving degrees in STEM disciplines through several new programs and pathways. Over the course of the grant period, STEM enrollment has increased at all institutions.   (1) The project successfully created a sustainable STEM partnership between NU's STEM departments and partner community colleges.  Partnership efforts stimulated additional programs such as the replication of a newly developed introductory Engineering Course, High Tech Tools and Toys, at two of the three partner institutions.    (2) NU STEP-UP provided community college faculty the opportunity to immerse themselves in a research environment in addition to providing supporting professional development opportunities informed by the National Research Council work, "How People Learn".  These sessions laid the foundation for continued site specific professional development.  (3) NU-STEP-UP provided community college students access to research experiences both locally and internationally, allowing students the opportunity to stimulate and sustain interest and persistence in STEM.    (5) Provided professional development and support to launch Summer Bridge programs at all partner Community Colleges.   (6) Provided professional development and funding to launch Supplemental Instruction (SI) in addition to other academic mentoring and research activities. Supplemental Instruction has led to increased student persistence and success in targeted STEM courses at several partner institutions, most notably at Northern Essex Community College.   The NU STEP-UP grant laid the foundation for continued collaboration between NU and Community Colleges across Massachusetts. Participants in the Partner Faculty Network continue to share innovative STEM instructional models and practices in addition to bringing STEM courses at community colleges in alignment with comparable courses at four-year institutions. Partners increasingly are providing studentsÆ access to research opportunities in addition to having institutionalized academic support programs such as Supplemental Instruction.
