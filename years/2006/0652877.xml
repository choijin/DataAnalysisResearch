<AbstractNarration>Quantum information science promises great advances in the theories of communication, computation, and precision measurement.  There remain, however, substantial challenges inherent in taking theoretical concepts from quantum information and realizing them in practice, even under idealized laboratory conditions.  This research program will address the growing divide between quantum information theory and experiment by developing new, physically accessible approaches to quantum measurement.  Particular attention will be devoted to those measurements most likely to improve precision metrology (such as sensing extremely weak communication signals) beyond current capabilities. Mathematical techniques, such as quantum filtering theory, and real-time feedback, will be harnessed to address the problem of simulating quantum measurements, i.e., using feedback to force the statistics of one quantum measurement to mimic those of another. Doing so will offer a concrete path to balancing the need for theoretical optimality in communication and computing applications with the experimental feasibility of those methods.   Laboratory implementation of quantum noise-limited state discrimination procedures based on closed-loop methodologies will be conducted. This research will contribute to the foundations of quantum information theory and lead to a better understanding of fundamental uncertainties in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will seek out the most promising graduate and undergraduate students in the current generation of young scientists.  It aims to educate researchers in a new and rapidly-developing field, provide first-hand experience in both advanced mathematical techniques and experimental methods likely to play crucial roles in next-generation technology, and train young scientists to be creative, responsible, active members of the scientific community.  Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, from design and planning to the dissemination of results.   By pursuing research that develops theoretical and experimental methods simultaneously, our group will help to erode some of the lingering, but artificial, barriers that traditionally divide theory and experiment. Outreach and education, in partnership with other academic institutions, industry and the national labs, will be promoted via the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) Network.  And, an effort to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science will proceed in conjunction with the New Mexico EPSCoR program in nanotechnology.  Nanotechnology, where quantum mechanical effects can have a pronounced effect, has been identified for its potential to enhance the New Mexico economy; this program contributes toward that goal.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
