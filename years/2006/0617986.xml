    <AbstractNarration>Genetic differences between two individuals can be manifested in differences in the individual's physical characteristics and functions. The term "epigenetics" refers to the fact that two organisms, or two cells within the same organism, can have identical genetic information (the same DNA sequence) but have very different characteristics and functions. Epigenetic controls are essential in establishing the hundreds of distinct cell types (e.g., skin, muscle, liver) in complex organisms such as humans. Cells within an organism have the same DNA, and therefore identical genes, but can assume unique morphologies and functions by establishing unique patterns of gene expression, expressing some genes while turning others off. The DNA in our cells is organized into structures known as chromosomes. A key mechanism for controlling whether genes are on or off is by altering the structure of the chromosome. Once established, these alterations can become a stable, heritable part of the chromosome. The nature of these structures and the manner in which they are inherited is not clear. To understand how epigenetic mechanisms work, this project is focused upon the study of a simple organism, budding yeast. Yeast uses an epigenetic gene repression mechanism, known as "silencing" to control the genes responsible for determining cell type. The fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation and cell growth are remarkably similar in yeast and human cells; however, as it is far easier to perform many types of experiments using yeast, the project is expected to progress more rapidly using the yeast system. Of particular interest is determining if the cell machinery responsible for duplicating and partitioning chromosomes as cells divide also has a role in establishing and maintaining silenced chromosomal structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research pursuits described in this project will be closely integrated into the educational mission of Wesleyan University, an undergraduate-oriented liberal arts university. Studies on epigenetics will be incorporated into MB&amp;B 294 Advanced Laboratory in Genetics and Molecular Biology, an advanced lab course required of undergraduate majors in Biology. This course is designed to familiarize undergraduates with the methods and approaches of our field in the context of pursuing novel research questions. Additional undergraduate level courses in molecular biology and genetics, as well as a non-major genetics course, will also be offered regularly. The project leader will supervise a research lab training a group of three undergraduate and three graduate students. Finally, the laboratory will provide opportunities for high school biology teachers to work in the research lab in summer months toward the goal of developing lab exercises suitable for use in secondary schools.</AbstractNarration>
