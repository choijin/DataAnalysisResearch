<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium on Control of Mechanical Systems (SCMS) will be held on June 19-20, 2006 at&lt;br/&gt;the University of California, Berkeley in Honor of Professor Masayoshi Tomizuka. The&lt;br/&gt;conference, chaired by Professor Roberto Horowitz (University of California, Berkeley)&lt;br/&gt;will bring leading researchers and practitioners from academics, industry, and government&lt;br/&gt;agencies to interact on the latest advances in modeling and control of mechanical systems.&lt;br/&gt;SCMS will bring together leading researchers in the field to assess the current state of&lt;br/&gt;research and areas for future research and application. Participation is open and the&lt;br/&gt;Symposium has been announced in important conferences and in relevant electronic media.&lt;br/&gt;SCMS draws upon many disciplines, including system theory, control theory, computer and&lt;br/&gt;communication networks, signal processing, and a wide array of application areas. A total&lt;br/&gt;of approximately 120 attendees are expected to participate in this conference, of which 60&lt;br/&gt;will be students. An amount of $20,000 is requested to support this conference. The funds&lt;br/&gt;will be used to partially pay for the travel expenses of a number of graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students that will be selected from among the students that attend this&lt;br/&gt;symposium and apply for travel support and for student dinning expenses. The remaining&lt;br/&gt;funds will be used to partially support the travel expenses of some of the invited&lt;br/&gt;speakers, who have retired and do not have other sources to support their travel.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The purpose of this workshop is to bring leading researchers and&lt;br/&gt;practitioners from academics, industry, and government agencies to interact on the latest&lt;br/&gt;advances in modeling and control of mechanical systems. The primary goal of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;is to seek financial support from NSF to invite approximately 60 students to the symposium&lt;br/&gt;and expose them to current advances in the control of mechanical systems and its&lt;br/&gt;applications. The invited students will present posters or orally in the workshop. We&lt;br/&gt;also seek financial support to fund some of the invited speakers who have retired and do&lt;br/&gt;not have other sources to support their travel. A book will be published, which will&lt;br/&gt;contain the symposium memories and will include a series of tutorial and survey chapters,&lt;br/&gt;written by many of the symposium presenters, in diverse subjects of mechanical systems&lt;br/&gt;control, including adaptive, repetitive, nonlinear and optimal control ad estimation, as&lt;br/&gt;well as state of the art applications.&lt;br/&gt;Travel support for student attendees will be advertised nationally. Women, minorities, and&lt;br/&gt;disabled students will be especially encouraged to apply.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Undergraduate and graduate students who attend the conference, present&lt;br/&gt;papers, and participate in student-oriented activities are likely to pursue careers in the&lt;br/&gt;field of control theory and its applications. The book that will be published as the&lt;br/&gt;memories of this symposium will be a valuable reference and learning tool for many&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students, who may be pursuing or considering entering the field&lt;br/&gt;of mechanical systems control.</AbstractNarration>
