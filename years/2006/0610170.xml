<AbstractNarration>A highly publicized report by the American Cancer Society noted that cancer has&lt;br/&gt;surpassed heart disease to become the number one killer of adults under the age of 85&lt;br/&gt;in the United States today. At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is&lt;br/&gt;eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute,&lt;br/&gt;system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For&lt;br/&gt;example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to&lt;br/&gt;discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed&lt;br/&gt;across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar/low-nicotine&lt;br/&gt;brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to&lt;br/&gt;understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the&lt;br/&gt;entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have&lt;br/&gt;made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable&lt;br/&gt;collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network&lt;br/&gt;(TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in&lt;br/&gt;discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have&lt;br/&gt;prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral&lt;br/&gt;tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration&lt;br/&gt;system.&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop, deploy and assess social networking tools to enhance&lt;br/&gt;collaboration among members of TSEEN using the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed project brings together researchers in information science, social science, and&lt;br/&gt;public health who have established strong collaborations with government partners on&lt;br/&gt;the development of networks to support transdisciplinary research in public health. The&lt;br/&gt;researchers have assisted the government partners in formulating the challenges and&lt;br/&gt;envisioning solutions; hence the research team is will positioned to leverage the&lt;br/&gt;substantial financial and human resources being invested by NIH National Cancer&lt;br/&gt;Institute and its partner government agencies in the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed project is a pioneering effort at incorporating social&lt;br/&gt;network referral tools as an integral part of collaborative systems within the context of&lt;br/&gt;digital government. First, the proposed project will extend theoretical understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the emergence of collaboration network structures involving multidimensional networks,&lt;br/&gt;where nodes may be individuals, documents, data sets, services (such as&lt;br/&gt;visual-analytic tools), or keywords/concepts. Second, it will pioneer theory development&lt;br/&gt;and testing about the influence of network referral systems on collaboration outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the proposed project will assess the extent to which collaboration outcomes&lt;br/&gt;are influenced by (i) different theoretically-derived structures of network referrals, (ii)&lt;br/&gt;different incentive structures provided to users of the network referral system, (iii)&lt;br/&gt;different types of network data used to generate referrals, and (iv) different information&lt;br/&gt;visualizations used to represent network referrals. Third, the research will extend the&lt;br/&gt;exponential random graph modeling techniques that have been largely used to estimate&lt;br/&gt;structural dependencies in relatively small (typically no larger than 500)&lt;br/&gt;one-dimensional networks. The proposed project will extend these techniques to&lt;br/&gt;multidimensional networks containing over 10,000 nodes.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: As cyberinfrastructure is deployed to support collaboration among&lt;br/&gt;large communities in government and elsewhere, it is increasingly obvious that social&lt;br/&gt;network tools have immense potential. In this project the researchers will seek to&lt;br/&gt;respond to the refrain 'if only the Tobacco Surveillance Epidemiology Evaluation&lt;br/&gt;Network knew what it knew.' Generalizing the relevance of this same refrain to a wide&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of other contexts is suggestive of the broader impacts of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately&lt;br/&gt;generalizable to the design and deployment of social network referral tools to support&lt;br/&gt;collaboration among other digital government efforts within public health and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;Further, the government and non-government partners in this project are exceptionally&lt;br/&gt;well-equipped to incorporate into their regularly scheduled education, training, and&lt;br/&gt;outreach workshops the skill sets of collaborative fluency afforded by the judicious use&lt;br/&gt;of network referral systems. Finally, by definition, social network referral systems have&lt;br/&gt;the potential to increase the likelihood of drawing in more diverse constituents within the&lt;br/&gt;public health community (in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, seniority, disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;perspectives) than heretofore possible. This extended network will also offer&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for mentoring of previously disadvantaged members within these&lt;br/&gt;communities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
