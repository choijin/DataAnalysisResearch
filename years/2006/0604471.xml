<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0604471&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Xiaofeng Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the principal investigator proposed to study the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and stable vector&lt;br/&gt;bundles over a Riemann surface. These moduli spaces are the&lt;br/&gt;center of many branches of mathematics and physics. Continuing&lt;br/&gt;his previous works, the PI first proposed to prove the Mumford&lt;br/&gt;goodness of several canonical metrics including the Ricci metric&lt;br/&gt;and the Kahler-Einstein metric on the moduli space of Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. The goodness of these metrics will allow one to apply&lt;br/&gt;Chern-Weil theory to these moduli spaces which are&lt;br/&gt;noncompact. The PI hope to develop a method to study the&lt;br/&gt;intersection theory on the moduli spaces via differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry by using the goodness. To study the goodness of the&lt;br/&gt;Kahler-Einstein metric, except for the continuity method, the PI&lt;br/&gt;proposed to investigate the Kahler-Ricci flow on the moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces. More generally, the PI proposed to study the Kahler-Ricci&lt;br/&gt;flow on non-compact and quasi-projective manifolds where the&lt;br/&gt;potential function of the initial metric is unbounded with mild&lt;br/&gt;growth. The PI proposed to prove that the Kahler class and the&lt;br/&gt;goodness of the initial metric are preserved under the&lt;br/&gt;Kahler-Ricci flow. Also, the long time existence and convergence&lt;br/&gt;of the Kahler- Ricci flow will be studied. Furthermore, the PI&lt;br/&gt;proposed to investigate the negativity of various metrics on this&lt;br/&gt;moduli space and harmonic map theory which will lead to various&lt;br/&gt;vanishing and rigidity theorems. The PI also proposed to extend&lt;br/&gt;his methods to the moduli space of stable bundles and study&lt;br/&gt;vanishing theorems by using canonical metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of moduli space of Riemann surfaces has many&lt;br/&gt;application in mathematics, physics and computer graphics. The&lt;br/&gt;intersection theory on the moduli spaces is one of the key parts&lt;br/&gt;in the modern string theory. Furthermore, it leads to significant&lt;br/&gt;improvements in image recognition, compression and&lt;br/&gt;decompression. The traditional method is to triangulate a surface&lt;br/&gt;by picking millions of vertices and record the combinatoric&lt;br/&gt;data. Thus a huge amount of calculations are needed. In&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry, the Torelli theorem tells us that the&lt;br/&gt;complex structure of a surface is determined by its Hodge&lt;br/&gt;structure. Thus one only need to record the data of the Hodge&lt;br/&gt;structure of a surface in order to reconstruct the surface. The&lt;br/&gt;size of the data of the Hodge structure is much smaller than the&lt;br/&gt;size of the data from triangulation. Thus a numerically efficient&lt;br/&gt;method to link a surface and its Hodge structure will&lt;br/&gt;dramatically simplify the procedure of image processing and&lt;br/&gt;improve its efficiency and accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
