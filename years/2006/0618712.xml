<AbstractNarration>This project is conducting a detailed examination of the organizational, curricular, pedagogical, and cultural factors that produce graduates with the attributes of "The Engineer of 2020." The study has three phases, each with its own distinctive set of activities.  In Phase I it is analyzing those factors in 40 institutions, using a database developed as part of the recently completed study "Engineering Change: A Study of the Impact of EC2000." The goal of Phase I is identification of six institutions that have performed at the highest levels in producing graduates with at least three of the attributes of "The Engineer of 2020:" design and problem-solving skills, interdisciplinary competence, and contextual competence. Four of the six institutions are being selected because they have been strikingly effective in educating women and students from historically under-represented minority groups. In Phase II, it is producing detailed case studies of these six institutions, analyzing the organizational, curricular, pedagogical, and cultural features that seem to facilitate or sustain their high performance in producing graduates with high levels of the three competencies. In Phase 3 it is working to quantitatively validate the case studies' findings through the companion study, "Prototype to Production," a 36-institution study designed to develop a portrait of the current condition of engineering education in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: To produce the engineers of 2020, faculty and administrators must understand how ideal attributes and skills can be developed in diverse student populations. This comprehensive study is identifying the curricular, pedagogical, cultural, and organizational conditions that promote strong learning and skills outcomes in key areas. The mixed methods approach being used negates two common critiques of case studies of best practices, namely their lack of generalizability and the absence of comparison groups. This study is providing systemic understanding, not simple explanations. It is conceptually broader than most other studies of engineering education, specifying how students' experiences inside and outside the classroom influence their development of knowledge and skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  By focusing significant attention on institutions that are particularly effective in educating women and students of color, this study is addressing a critical concern in engineering education, providing nuanced guidance on how the persistence and success of diverse students can be enhanced. The case studies are being designed to enable a comprehensive understanding of program and pedagogical features with the most promise for producing engineering graduates who will excel in the competitive global economy of 2020. The case-study information being developed in this study, linked to the quantitative surveys being conducted at the same time in the "Prototype-to-Production Study," is deepening understanding of the breadth and depth of changes and transformations that will be needed - and can be engineered - to produce the engineer of 2020. The project is also contributing to the development of a community of engineering education scholars by engaging five new STEM researchers in learning qualitative and quantitative research methods.</AbstractNarration>
