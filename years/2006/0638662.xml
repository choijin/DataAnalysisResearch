<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0638662&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Donna M. Chamely-Wiik&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Florida Atlantic University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Project ChemBOND: The Next Generation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, which is a partnership between the Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and the Palm Beach County School District (PBCSD), will focus on incorporating Project ChemBOND into the high school science classes (grades 9-12) through the GK-12 program. The ChemBOND initiative has been successful at the university level. The project will develop, adapt, and adopt conceptually based, hands-on chemistry activities (ChemBOND Modules) in both the classroom and laboratory, to create a seamless environment that fosters learning and understanding. Each year the project will recruit 8 STEM graduate fellows and 8 teachers. Together they will serve approximately 40 classes in 4 PBCSD schools. Modules for chemistry and related sciences will be developed and implemented collaboratively by graduate fellows and teachers. Relationships established between the PBCSD and FAU will result in permanent positive changes at all institutions and foster sustainable interactions. The principal investigators will work with external evaluators to evaluate the effectiveness of the project. The intellectual merit includes implementation of ChemBOND at the high school level. The broader impacts include providing the opportunity to a diverse population of high school students and teachers to increase their science content knowledge and engage in scientific inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Within this program, both graduate students and high school teachers engaged in professional development through participation in summer workshops and graduate courses designed to improve both their knowledge of the learning process and their skills in communicating science to a broader audience.  The intellectual merits and broader impacts of this program were multi-faceted.  Benefits to the graduate students included:  Improvement in their ability to explain their research and communicate complex scientific concepts to a general audience Relevant experience in developing curricular materials and conceptual activities for use with and to enhance K-12 education through outreach to the schools Development of skills for working in interdisciplinary teams and within communities of research scientists Greater awareness and appreciation for the scientific process Acquisition of professional skills through presenting their work at national meetings and participating in graduate courses in science education   Benefits to the high-school teachers included:  A greater appreciation and understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of science and scientific research Enhancement of their understanding of how students learn An introduction to cutting-edge research projects Opportunity to develop conceptually rich curricular materials focused on active learning Acquisition of professional skills through presentations at professional meetings and participation in graduate research courses in science education   Other project participants also benefited. The high-school students were mentored by the graduate students with regard to career advice and college choices. They were also exposed to cutting-edge research, and had the opportunity to visit FAU labs and conduct summer research.  They also benefited from the curricular activities developed by the participating faculty, teachers and graduate students.  The FAU faculty team enhanced their understanding of the theoretical framework of how students learn science and utilized that to construct meaningful, engaging curricular activities. They acquired experience in managing a large, diverse project involving multiple stakeholders.  They gained a greater appreciation of the challenges facing high-school students as they transition to a college setting and those of the graduate students as they transition from their academic research to a career.  Project outcomes included:  Development and publication of a theoretical framework for scientific demonstrations Demonstrated improvements of the scientific communication skills of the graduate students who participated in the program  Dissemination of our findings through numerous presentations at regional and national scientific meetings on the various facets of this project New classroom activities that promote student engagement and understanding of the scientific process A high success rate of participating graduate students in obtaining advanced degrees and transitioning into meaningful careers in science, research and science teaching   Overall, this project serves as an example of how institutions of higher education can work collaboratively with school d...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
