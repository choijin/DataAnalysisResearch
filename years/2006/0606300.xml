<AbstractNarration>Sage&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0606300&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Typically, physical properties of composite materials are&lt;br/&gt;strongly dependent on microstructure.  However, in exceptional&lt;br/&gt;situations, exact relations exist that are&lt;br/&gt;microstructure-independent.  These express fundamental&lt;br/&gt;invariances in a given physical setting.  Exact relations have&lt;br/&gt;been extensively studied, but the classical approach has been&lt;br/&gt;heavily dependent on the physical context.  In the late 1990's,&lt;br/&gt;an abstract theory of exact relations was originated by Grabovsky&lt;br/&gt;and greatly extended by Grabovsky, Milton, and the investigator. &lt;br/&gt;It has proved to be enormously powerful.  Indeed, by reducing the&lt;br/&gt;search for exact relations to a purely algebraic problem&lt;br/&gt;involving group representation theory, it has led to complete&lt;br/&gt;lists of all rotationally invariant exact relations for&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional thermopiezoelectric composites, which include&lt;br/&gt;all exact relations for elasticity, thermoelasticity, and&lt;br/&gt;piezoelectricity as special cases.  This new approach has been&lt;br/&gt;responsible for a great leap forward in this area of material&lt;br/&gt;science.  However, the theory is by no means complete.  The&lt;br/&gt;purpose of this project is to complete the theory of exact&lt;br/&gt;relations by addressing the three remaining major open questions. &lt;br/&gt;First, previous work has given complete lists of exact relations&lt;br/&gt;only in relatively simple physical contexts.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies highly coupled problems with the ultimate goal of finding&lt;br/&gt;an explicit parameterization of exact relations for the physical&lt;br/&gt;problem with any number of temperature, electric, and elastic&lt;br/&gt;fields.  The second project is the exploration of the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between lamination and homogenization for exact&lt;br/&gt;relations.  The basic question is whether there exist exact&lt;br/&gt;relations that are stable under lamination, but not under&lt;br/&gt;homogenization.  Third, the investigator undertakes a detailed&lt;br/&gt;study of the algebraic structures associated with exact&lt;br/&gt;relations.  In particular, questions about exact relations may be&lt;br/&gt;reformulated in terms of algebraic objects called Jordan&lt;br/&gt;algebras.  This approach seems very promising, and it is&lt;br/&gt;considered to be crucial for progress on the two problems&lt;br/&gt;described previously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Composite materials are everywhere in the modern world. &lt;br/&gt;They are used in the manufacture of products ranging from skis to&lt;br/&gt;airplanes and from tennis rackets to cell phones.  It is&lt;br/&gt;accordingly of great technological importance to understand how&lt;br/&gt;physical properties (such as conductivity and elasticity) of a&lt;br/&gt;composite are related to the properties of its constituents. &lt;br/&gt;This is difficult in general because the way in which the&lt;br/&gt;constituents are put together strongly influences the end result. &lt;br/&gt;For example, take two materials, one soft and one hard.  If the&lt;br/&gt;hard material is embedded in the soft substance, the composite&lt;br/&gt;will be compressible.  On the other hand, if the soft material&lt;br/&gt;lies in a matrix of the hard material, the composite will be&lt;br/&gt;rigid.  However, in certain situations, this typical variability&lt;br/&gt;is greatly reduced.  The goal of this project is to understand&lt;br/&gt;and classify these situations.  From a practical point of view,&lt;br/&gt;the project establishes "impossibility theorems" in engineering,&lt;br/&gt;i.e. results showing that a composite with desired properties&lt;br/&gt;cannot be constructed from a given set of starting materials. &lt;br/&gt;The proposal thus has significant implications for industrial&lt;br/&gt;research and development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
