<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;CHE-0616795&lt;br/&gt;Bruening/Michigan State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the group of Professor Merlin Bruening at Michigan State University is developing methods for selectively capturing proteins and peptides for analysis by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization mass spectrometry.  The biomolecules are captured directly on the plate used for sample introduction, avoiding time-consuming separation techniques and associated sample loss.  Specifically, controlled growth of polymer brushes on the sample probe and derivatization of these brushes with Fe(III) complexes will be tested for enabling selective binding and highly sensitive analysis of phosphorylated peptides.  Methods for selective capture of methionine-containing peptides on sample plates will also be developed.  Control over the density, thickness, composition, and swelling of polymer brushes on sample plates will be vital for achieving low detection limits in both areas.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identification and quantitation of protein phosphorylation is vital for understanding processes such as cell regulation and diseases such as cancer.  Selective binding of the methionine-containing peptides will decrease the number of signals from a digest mixture but still provide effective protein coverage.  This is expected to greatly simplify the analysis of complex biological samples.  Work on this project will be performed by students at all levels including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, providing a broad perspective on important biochemical and analytical research areas.</AbstractNarration>
