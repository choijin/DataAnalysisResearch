<AbstractNarration>This project is directed at increasing the number of students entering, graduating, advancing to graduate studies and/or pursing professional careers in STEM disciplines.  The School of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) continues to explore improvement strategies for recruitment, instruction, hands-on laboratory and research experiences, and mentoring, as well as a number of other academic reinforcement programs for STEM majors. A valuable, plentiful and inadequately tapped resource for increasing the number of students entering STEM majors and obtaining STEM degrees at the College is the "Undecideds."  Undecideds refer to students who enter the College without a declared major, many of whom have a genuine interest and curiosity of STEM, but select other majors at a rate of 75%. Since no organized effort existed in the environment to expose Undecideds to the wonder, challenge, reward, fulfillment and diversity of careers in STEM, this project is undertaking the implementation of an innovative recruiting approach.  In addition, to help ensure successful matriculation of the STEM recruits and improve the overall retention of all STEM majors, a program that focuses on improving science and mathematics skills and enhancing the overall STEM experience is underway.  The project represents a joint effort of School of STEM administrators, department chairs, discipline coordinators, faculty, and upper class students. In addition, this effort is presented in collaboration with the Benedict College Student Support Service Unit.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project includes the following strategies in order to promote an increase in the number of students pursuing and obtaining STEM degrees: (1) Got STEM? A year-round recruiting initiative that targets undecided majors and introduces them to the excitement and benefits of STEM careers; (2) STEM Success Units. A cohesive hybrid unit design that integrates faculty mentoring and advising, peer-to-peer mentoring and tutoring and team building in a manner that promotes students success and provides a support system for each STEM recruit. (3) Ready for Success. An orientation (freshman) and reorientation (rising sophomores) to begin the first and second academic years, respectively, in a ready for success mode which includes a formal math and science study skills development program, mini courses, non traditional and new STEM experiences, an early introduction to research, being marketed and offered to undecided majors, as well as freshman and sophomore STEM majors; and (4) Mentorship training for faculty and upper class student peers.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project promises to broaden impact with the following objectives: (1) A target increase of 15 STEM graduates per year; (2) A cohesive hybrid unit model to be assessed, documented and disseminated that may be used in other environments to positively affect STEM students nationally; (3) Increased number of opportunities for students to engage in STEM skills enrichment, spending additional time and interacting in smaller class settings for exploring the laboratory and research environment; and (4) Increased number of trained faculty and student peers who can promote interest and success in STEM within the student body, thereby increasing the number of traditionally underrepresented students graduating with STEM degrees.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BENEDICT COLLEGE  STEM Focused Engagement of Undecided and Average Students  Project Outcomes Report     The primary objective of the NSF Project, "STEM Focused Engagement of Undecided and Average Students" at Benedict College was to tap into an underutilized source for recruiting potential STEMists and retaining them through graduation.  Moreover, the project was designed to facilitate focused exposure to STEM careers while engaging students in experiences intended to heighten their interest and hone the essential skills needed for successful matriculation, graduation, and entry into graduate programs and/or employment.  Intellectual Merit   Of significance to funding agencies is the determination of "what works."  The STEM Focused Engagement of Undecided and Average Students project has contributed to the body of knowledge about what works in terms of moving undecided and perhaps, uniformed, students along a continuum of academic and co-curricular experiences designed to pique their interest, and move them toward successful matriculation, in STEM disciplines.  Under the project, students were exposed to different interventions during their freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior years.  These interventions encompassed field trips, research, mentoring, and lecture experiences. The project components and outcomes underscore the significance of multi-faceted injections throughout the undergraduateÆs academic life.  The project supports the practice of parts of a whole working together to insure a well-developed product.   Broader Impacts  Initiatives under the STEM Focused Engagement of Undecided and Average Students project embraced all Benedict College students of all academic classifications, students of neighboring K-12 school districts, Benedict College STEM faculty, and business and industry partners.  Several "impacts" are stated below:  STEM Success Units were created and were instrumental in developing, nurturing, and preparing students for research opportunities, presentations, scientific awareness, and peer-to-peer mentoring. STEM students experienced increased opportunities to engage in research with STEM faculty. STEM student attendance and presentations at conferences increased. Since the inception of the Project, Benedict College has experienced a 24.7% increase in students enrolled in STEM majors.      Also, it should be noted that as a result of the STEM Focused Engagement of Undecided and Average Students project, a STEM Peer Tutorial Center was established at Benedict College.  This project outcome will impact and enhance the scope of learning available to students.          Last Modified: 10/03/2011       Submitted by: Negash Begashaw]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
