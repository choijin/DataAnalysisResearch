<AbstractNarration>AToL for Gymnosperms: Resolving the Phylogeny of Seed Plants&lt;br/&gt;An award is made to Sarah Mathews (Lead PI), Jianhua Li (Co-PI), Harvard University; Reed S. Beaman (PI), Nico Cellinese (Co-PI), Yale University; Christopher S. Campbell (PI), University of Maine; Richard C. Cronn (Collaborator), USDA Forest Service; Sean W. Graham (Co-PI), University of British Columbia; Stefanie M. Ickert-Bond (PI), University of Alaska; Dean G. Kelch (PI), University of California-Berkeley and California State Herbarium; Aaron I. Liston (PI), Oregon State University; Linda A. Raubeson (PI), Central Washington University; Gar W. Rothwell (PI), Gene Mapes (Co-PI), Ohio University; Andrea E. Schwarzbach (PI), University of Texas-Brownsville; Dennis W. Stevenson (PI), New York Botanical Garden; Ruth A. Stockey (Co-PI), University of Alberta to construct sequence-based phylogenetic hypotheses for all living gymnosperms and for seed plants overall, and morphology-based hypotheses to include ALL living species of gymnosperms (conifers, cycads, Gingko, and Gnetales) including examples from the fossil record, along with exemplar angiosperms (flowering plants). Nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial sequences will be utilized in the analysis along with the morphological characters to allow the rich record of fossil gymnosperms to be included.  All of the data (molecular, morphological, voucher, etc.) will be submitted to standardized and accessible databases through an enhanced version of the web-based informatics tool TOLKIN (Tree Of Life Knowledge and Information Network, www.tolkin.org). The evolution of the seed marks one of the most important innovations in the history of land plants and led to greater mating control and to enhanced survival and dispersal capabilities.  Seed bearing plants dominate the landscape; today, forests and grasslands are among our most important resources.  Understanding the origin(s) of seeds is basic to understanding seed plant phylogeny.  Obtaining the needed phylogenetic framework is not a trivial undertaking and the multi-faceted approach is designed to address the inherent complexity of the problem, incorporating approaches not considered by all projects (e.g., including all gymnosperms, serious attention to the fossil data).  While phylogenetic inference will be the main focus of the project, data will bear significantly on the understanding of historic patterns of biotic change at the global level, and will provide insight into the origins of many important plant traits, including those that are the basis of breeding programs in horticulture and forestry. In addition to training students, workshops for K-12 teachers will be held at several botanic gardens.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Dennis StevensonÆs part of the National Science Foundation Grant  # 0629817 entitled, "Collaborative Research: Gymnosperms on the Tree of Life: Resolving the Phylogeny of Seed Plants" Nation Science Grant, was too conduct research on the cycads, Cupressaceae and Podocarpaceae in part, collecting gymnosperm tissue for DNA samples, and to participate in developing a data base on the anatomical structure of the gymnosperms.  The cycads are a group of ancient gymnosperms comprised of 300 species all of which are listed as endangered and trade etc. and are regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).  In this project, tissue samples were collected for 282 (94%) of the species.  The DNA sequences have now been used to create a DNA Barcoding data base for identifying cycads and individual cycad species that are being removed from the wild with over all identifying features removed to prevent accurate identification by authorities and conservation agencies and smuggled across borders.  This database is now used for accurate successful DNA analysis and identification and thus helping to reduce illegal collection and removal from wild populations worldwide.  In collecting tissue samples, five new species of cycads were discovered in South America.  Twenty-nine papers were published ranging form the discovery of new species to floristic treatments for the cycad genus Zamia including a monograph of the species from Mega-Mexico, to papers on fossil cycads from Argentina and Antarctica to using DNA barcoding for species identification.  Besides the concentration on cycads, tissues were collected for 150 (77%) species of the family Podocarpaceae and important group of conifers in the cooler regions of the worlds tropical areas. An anatomical database has been developed that allows us to see the distribution of attributes throughout the gymnosperms, but most importantly in the economically and ecological important conifers.  This database will allow us to utilize the information to better concentrate resources for important ecological and economic species, to identify alternative species to those that are becoming endangered through over harvesting or habitat loss, and successfully develop these alternatives both in an economic sense and to be ecologically sustainable.      Five undergraduate students worked on this project. During the project all of them were trained in plant anatomy, morphology and molecular techniques.
