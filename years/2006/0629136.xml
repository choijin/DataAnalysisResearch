<AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry, the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Office of Multidisciplinary Affairs jointly fund this award to the University of Texas at Austin to establish an Undergraduate Research Collaborative within the University of Texas at Austin College of Natural Sciences. The PI for this project is Mary Ann Rankin, who will be assisted by Co-PIs Ruth Shear, Sarah Simmons and Scott Stevens. One hundred twenty students from the CNS entering freshman class will be recruited to participate in an Undergraduate Research Collaborative experience that will introduce the student to critical thinking, data interpretation, hands-on experimentation, and also increase interaction with research faculty and includes peer mentoring. After their training, students will be experienced in a broad range of techniques in the areas of chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, or nanotechnology and will be either matched with individual faculty laboratories or placed in research internships in industry to further their research training. The UT-URC model incorporates research as a means of teaching large numbers of students with the goals of (1) recruiting and retaining students in chemistry and allied sciences, (2) engaging large numbers of students in publishable research, (3) improving the success of undergraduates in their education goals and engendering lasting interest in science and research, (4) training students in research early in their undergraduate experience by incorporating authentic research experiences into a teaching setting, (5) cultivating an expanded research culture on the UT campus, (6) driving curriculum reform at the College and University levels and (7) enhancing collaboration to promote education through undergraduate research. Assessment and evaluation of the UT-URC will provide quantitative and qualitative data from both students and faculty, using control groups from within CNS. Longitudinal success of student performance will be followed using student centered survey tools and assessment rubrics that have already been developed. Special efforts will be made to reach student populations that are currently underrepresented in science and mathematics through close cooperation with the UTeach and TIP programs. When fully implemented in five years, the UT-URC will impact 2,000 students annually.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A quick rundown of the first half-decade of the NSF-initiated Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) at The University of Texas at Austin reads more like a college administratorÆs wish list than like an actual university program.  More than      500 first-year students doing original scientific research every year. More than 25      unique, faculty-led, year-long "research streams," which engage students      in original research on topics like Computational Intelligence in Game      Design, Brain Tumor Pathology, Exploring the Universe with White Dwarf      Stars, and Nanomaterials for Chemical Catalysis. Better retention      of students across all ethnic groups, economic strata, and at-risk      categories. Increased      participation in research by Hispanic and African-American students. More than 100      papers published in peer-reviewed academic journals, co-authored by      undergraduates. More      students proceeding to advanced degrees in the sciences, with particularly      striking increases in the numbers of women and first-generation students.   When FRI director Sarah Simmons tells colleagues at other universities about the program, its scale and ambition is so out-sized that they often donÆt get it right away. They assume that itÆs similar to research-based classes at other universities.  "At first, most people donÆt believe weÆre actually doing it," says Simmons, assistant dean in the College of Natural Sciences. "They say, well, lots of places are doing large-scale undergraduate research. But if you look more closely, you see that whatÆs unique about FRI is that it involves large numbers of first-year students, drawn from all backgrounds and preparation levels, who are given a multi-semester experience thatÆs integrated into their degree plan and involves real faculty-generated research projects."  The program is unique in that science and math students entering the university start working right away on faculty-led research projects. They work in small groups in labs on a list of projects that continues to grow every year.

This young program is already serving over 25 percent of the entering freshman class, around 600 students each year &mdash; a sizable army of fresh-faced scientists pounding away on real-world research problems.

"We have to confront the fact that teaching content knowledge, especially in technical fields, isnÆt enough anymore to justify the expense of going to a place like UT.
