<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the integration of novel micrometer and nanometer scale Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) devices and materials into the lithographically fabricated micro-fluidic systems. Such miniaturization and implementation of NMR systems on a micro-fluidic platform will lead to the highly parallel chemical analysis of smaller volumes of bio-chemically important solutions with significantly greater sensitivity than previously possible. Reducing the size of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) devices on a chip will also lead to the non-destructive imaging of biological cells with an unprecedented spatial resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit Micro-fluidic chip-based NMR systems will be designed and fabricated implementing (a) components for application of large gradient magnetic fields, (b) permanent magnet-based devices that provide high local fields, and (c) micro/nanometer scale electro-magnetic coils that will significantly improve the sensitivity and resolution of NMR and MRI.  This research will offer new tools for the study of individual cells, enabling both spectroscopic and imaging observation of changes in cell metabolism triggered by the micro-fluidic controlled environmental changes. Furthermore, the micro-fluidic NMR chips will provide the ability to manipulate pico-liters of solution and perform highly parallel NMR biochemical analysis. Fundamental limits of miniaturization and integration of NMR micro-technologies within the elastomeric micro-fluidic chips will also be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact This program will foster collaboration between a Ph.D. granting institution (Caltech) and a large, urban, minority serving non-Ph.D. granting university (CSULB). The Ph.D. and Masters students from both institutions will be exposed to the multi-disciplinary techniques from engineering, physics, and biochemistry, while being trained in micro-fabrication, fluidics, sensor design, and magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy techniques. The research that students perform is expected to find many other applications where small samples have to be analyzed and imaged within an inexpensive portable chip-based platform with particular emphasis towards disease diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
