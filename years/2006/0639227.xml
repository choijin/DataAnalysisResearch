<AbstractNarration>This REU Site, a partnership of the North Dakota Association of Tribal Colleges and the University of North Dakota, will provide hands-on research experience in neuroscience for 9 students each summer (8 the 1st year). Students from Tribal and rural colleges will be recruited to participate in the program. All students, including those with scholarships provided through the North Dakota Association of Tribal Colleges, will be paired with faculty mentors and perform their research at the University of North Dakota. The primary objectives of the program are to (1) foster academic and social independence, (2) promote an interest in research and science careers, and (3) encourage professional development for student participants. Students will initially receive one week of training in cell, molecular and imaging techniques and then develop their own research projects under the mentorship of faculty. Students will attend weekly professional development sessions that will include instruction in oral and written presentations, data analysis and proper research conduct. Students will be expected to present their findings at an end of session symposium, which will prepare them for professional scientific presentations at a regional or national meeting. Salary and room and board will be provided for all students. The hope is that participating American Indian and rural students will choose to pursue graduate degrees in the sciences and return to their communities to help strengthen science education, research and literacy. Applications and other relevant information are available at http://www.und.nodak.edu/instruct/spyle, or from Drs. Bennett (bbennett@ndatc.org), Van Doze (vdoze @medicine.nodak.edu) and Sally Pyle (sally.pyle@und.nodak.edu). Students may call or write Linda Harmon, (701-777-2621, PO Box 9019, Grand Forks, ND 58202-9019) for mailed application materials.</AbstractNarration>
