<AbstractNarration>A symposium-workshop is proposed on&lt;br/&gt;Landslide Ecology - A perspective from Tropical Mountainscapes that has three main goals:&lt;br/&gt;First, to expose ecologists to a conceptual model that emphasizes deep connections between&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem and geomorphic processes, and the resulting large-scale dynamics of tropical&lt;br/&gt;mountains mediated by landslides.  Bringing together experts with diverse backgrounds to think&lt;br/&gt;about their own landslide work in a broader context is a first step towards breaking down barriers&lt;br/&gt;within and among disciplines. Second, to share the limited, yet diverse work on landslide ecology&lt;br/&gt;with an audience coming from nations in which landsliding is a relevant process. The ecologists&lt;br/&gt;participating in this symposium-workshop use diverse techniques (field and lab work, tree ring&lt;br/&gt;analysis, remote sensing, GIS, and modeling) to examine a diverse array of questions in&lt;br/&gt;mountain systems world-wide. Lastly, to outline a strategic program that will contribute to a&lt;br/&gt;sustained growth of the field of landslide ecology, and more broadly speaking of emerging fields&lt;br/&gt;linking biology with geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts - The proposed symposium-workshop will bring together for the first time&lt;br/&gt;students and faculty investigating the influence of landslides on tropical and subtropical montane&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems, catalyzing at the same time the establishment of a network of collaborators. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the symposium-workshop is meant to challenge ecologists to think of ways in which&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems influence this geomorphic process by exposing them to the physical aspects&lt;br/&gt;underlying the formation of landslides. This symposium-workshop has been programmed as part&lt;br/&gt;of the annual meeting of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation, Kunming,&lt;br/&gt;China, and therefore it is expected to have a multiplicative effect. In fact, this meeting attracts an&lt;br/&gt;audience for which mountains and landslides are important. The results of this symposiumworkshop&lt;br/&gt;will be published, and in addition, the summaries will be posted on a web page&lt;br/&gt;(http://ursula.cnnet.upr.edu/landslides/) that will focus on landslide ecology. Overall, this&lt;br/&gt;symposium-workshop will highlight the contribution that ecologists can make to understand a&lt;br/&gt;large-scale geomorphic process with evolutionary, ecological, environmental, and societal&lt;br/&gt;implications.</AbstractNarration>
