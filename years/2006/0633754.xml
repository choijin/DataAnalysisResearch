<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Phase 1 CCLI Exploratory project is developing thermal and fluid dynamics modular laboratory exercises based on everyday technology such as bicycle pumps and hair dryers. Experiments on these items are resulting in more relevant learning experiences as students are being confronted with their misconceptions about how and why these objects work. The project is also guiding students to develop correct models for the behavior of the system under investigation. Students are using low-cost, USB-based data acquisition equipment to make exploratory measurements to develop preliminary, empirical models of system performance. Students are then attending regular lectures and returning to the lab to perform additional measurements and exercises. The project is evaluating students' increase in factual knowledge, their ability to recognize misconceptions, and their change in attitudes toward laboratory work. Evaluations of learning outcomes are being published in conference papers and relevant journals. All teaching materials, detailed design of laboratory hardware, student worksheets, homework assignments and exams are being made freely available via the web. The simplicity and low cost of the laboratory hardware are making these products feasible for wide spread adoption.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
