<AbstractNarration>0609968&lt;br/&gt;Graham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Watersheds are dynamic. Consequently, answers to critical science&lt;br/&gt;questions about watersheds require observations of watershed characteristics and depend on&lt;br/&gt;developing new engineering capabilities to sample data at high temporal frequency and spatial&lt;br/&gt;density; to assess the optimal frequency and density of sampling; and to analyze those data for the&lt;br/&gt;improvement of mechanistic understanding of processes. Examples of fundamental timedependent&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of watersheds that require improved sampling and analytical&lt;br/&gt;capabilities include the magnitude of mass of water, nutrients, sediments, and energy in stores;&lt;br/&gt;the residence time in the stores; fluxes between the stores; and flowpaths among the stores. This&lt;br/&gt;proposed work develops new engineering approaches to address science questions about the&lt;br/&gt;spatial and temporal variability of regulators of nitrate load in watersheds; how geologic setting,&lt;br/&gt;land use and terrain influence loading and delivery dynamics; the relationship between flow&lt;br/&gt;mixtures and nitrate loads; and the feasibility of using surrogate measures for estimating basin&lt;br/&gt;scale nitrate dynamics in space and time. The engineering approaches are two-pronged. (1)&lt;br/&gt;Commercially available nitrate, conductivity, temperature, and pressure sensors will be installed&lt;br/&gt;in an array that will sample at sub-daily frequencies and communicate via cell phone technology&lt;br/&gt;in real time to a central computer. (2) Existing data will be used to develop a probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;algorithm based on information theory to identify minimum spatial and temporal spacing of&lt;br/&gt;sampling necessary to reduce uncertainty to a prescribed level; this algorithm will be validated&lt;br/&gt;with the newly collected data.&lt;br/&gt;The study site is the Santa Fe River watershed in north-central Florida. The Santa Fe&lt;br/&gt;River is a major tributary to the Suwannee River which has been cited as a potential location for&lt;br/&gt;CUAHSI-CLEANER WATer and Environmental Research Systems Network. The Santa Fe&lt;br/&gt;River has similar characteristics to the Suwannee River Basin, but at a smaller scale, making it an&lt;br/&gt;ideal test-bed for developing new sampling and analytical capabilities required to advance&lt;br/&gt;watershed science and engineering. Both rivers cross the Cody escarpment, which marks the&lt;br/&gt;boundary between geologically confined and unconfined portions of the Floridan aquifer, and the&lt;br/&gt;change from a surface water to ground water dominated system. The entire region is undergoing&lt;br/&gt;a transition from minimal anthropogenic impact to multiple stressors from land-use practices&lt;br/&gt;including population increase and consumptive use, proposed water diversions, and accelerating&lt;br/&gt;development making predictive basin-scale science essential.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Development of the sensor network and probabilistic algorithm represent a&lt;br/&gt;good initial test at a small scale of how to develop water and environmental research networks.&lt;br/&gt;The communication ports will be configured for testing of any newly developed or off-the-shelf&lt;br/&gt;sensors, and outside users will be welcome to test instrumentation at these sites. The probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to be developed as part of the work will be sufficiently generic that they will be useful&lt;br/&gt;for planning sensor deployments in any watershed. This generic characteristic will make them&lt;br/&gt;useful for analyses of the uncertainty of predictability of variables in addition to nitrate. Human&lt;br/&gt;resources will be impacted through support of two PhD-level graduate students (and a post&lt;br/&gt;doctoral researcher). Data collected and collated for the work will be archived in an ArcHydro&lt;br/&gt;geodatabase to be made available to non-local researchers. These data will also be demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;for use in AP Environmental Science classes at the high school level, Environmental Science and&lt;br/&gt;Hydrologic courses at the college level, and as a an interactive exhibit at the Florida Museum of&lt;br/&gt;Natural History in Gainesville.</AbstractNarration>
