<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project seeks to 1) understand and manipulate electrical conduction in nanostructures, and 2) attract under-represented groups to physics by exposing them to cutting edge nanoscience. Experiments will be performed on three materials - carbon nanotubes, Indium-Arsenic nanowires, and graphene. These have all demonstrated novel physics and are considered leading candidates for nanoscale electronics applications. The research will use innovative fabrication and measurement techniques, such as local electric fields and substrates that can be controllably strained, to understand what factors most influence electron transport in nanoscale materials. The proposed research will also lay the groundwork for novel electronic devices. Education and research are integrated through a focus on recruiting and involving women and minorities in research activities. Specific educational tasks include mentoring under-represented undergraduates in research projects, and organizing special nanoscience sessions at conferences targeting women and minorities. The project will train talented scientists and help improve the science knowledge base of our society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this CAREER project are to 1) significantly improve the understanding and manipulation of transport properties in nanostructures, and 2) recruit under-represented groups to physics by exposing them to cutting-edge nanoscience. Experiments will be performed on three scientifically and technologically relevant materials; carbon nanotubes, InAs nanowires, and graphene. The research will utilize local probes and novel tuning parameters to answer basic questions about transport in nanostructures, particularly regarding the interplay between electron-electron interactions, band structure, spin and charge distributions, and disorder. Innovative measurement and fabrication tools - such as quantum point contacts to detect spins, tunneling probes to measure energy distributions, and electric fields and flexible substrates to tune conductance and band gaps - will be developed to allow for precise studies of fundamental properties and also to lay the groundwork for novel tunable devices. Education and research are integrated through a focus on recruiting and involving women and minorities in research. Specific educational tasks include mentoring under-represented undergraduates, and organizing nanoscience sessions at major conferences and meetings targeting women and minorities. The plan will thus help increase the future pool of talented scientists and help improve the scientific knowledge base of our society.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Graphene is a sheet of carbon that is a single atomic layer thick; carbon nanotubes are sheets of graphene that have been rolled into tubes one billionth of a meter in diameter. The extreme nano-scale of these materials gives them superlative electrical and mechanical properties, and they are considered leading candidates for next-generation electronic elements.

We developed a technique for making multi-probe, non-invasive contacts to carbon nanotubes, by protecting the tubes with a thin insulating layer (deposited via atomic layer deposition). We used this technique to perform an energy-dependent "spectroscopic" measurement of a carbon nanotube that had single electrons passing through it; in this way, we could characterize a carbon nanotube "single-electron transistor".  The results led to a greater understanding of nanotube single-electron transistors, and paved the way for new probes of carbon nanotubes and similar delicate nanostructures.   A parallel thrust of this grant involved studies of how graphene interacted with a grooved substrate.
