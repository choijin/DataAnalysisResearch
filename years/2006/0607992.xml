<AbstractNarration>Landscapes in Southeastern United States often consist of floodplains subject to periodic flooding and nearby drier uplands. Plant species that occur in both habitats may consist of populations that are specialized to one environment or plants that grow equally well in both habitats (generalized) because of adjustments in morphology and physiology according to the habitat they experience. This study examines these two alternatives in a native blueberry. Floodplain and upland plants will be transplanted into both habitats to determine whether they grow best in their "home" environment or perform equally well in both locations. The field studies will also be complemented by laboratory experiments. Genetic exchange between plants in both habitats through pollinators or seeds is important to the evolution of specialization or generalization. The investigators will therefore measure genetic exchange using molecular studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide an understanding of how plants are broadly distributed across environments or limited to few habitats. This knowledge is valuable to restoration of degraded lands and to conservation. Specialized populations will not be a good source of plants for restoration of different habitats.  Additionally, with specialization, conservation should be directed at protecting populations from all habitats. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
