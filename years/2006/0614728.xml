<AbstractNarration>0614728&lt;br/&gt;White&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO) of the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of Science (NAS), which functions as the U.S. National Committee to the International Council for Science (ICSU), and serves as the focal point for ICSU-related activities in the United States.  It manages U.S. membership in ICSU and has oversight of many of the national committees that serve as liaisons to unions, committees and programs federated under the ICSU umbrella. BISO's primary goal is to support effective U.S. participation and strong leadership in the ICSU network in response to growing needs in international science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICSU which was founded 75 years ago, initiates, designs, and coordinates major international interdisciplinary research programs and works on matters of common concern to all scientists, such as science education and capacity building, data access and exchange, science and technology in developing countries, ethics, and freedom in the conduct of science.  ICSU facilitates the exchange of scientific information, forges international agreements on standards and measurements, acts as a scientific adviser to intergovernmental agencies, and promotes the right of all scientists to participate in their activities without political or any other form of discrimination.  ICSU has 102 adhering nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 5 years continuing award will enable the NAS/NRC (the U.S. adhering organization to ICSU) to continue to manage U.S. participation in ICSU.  The award provides dues payments to ICSU, and costs associated with the support and management of the U.S. National Committee to ICSU and organizational activities of adhering U.S. committees representing the diverse disciplines that participate in ICSU activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the U.S. national member of the International Council for Science (ICSU).  ICSU is a non-governmental organization, created in 1931 to advance, serve, and enable science throughout the world.  ICSUÆs membership provides a wide spectrum of scientific expertise, enabling members to address major international, interdisciplinary issues.  Some of the issues currently being addressed are global climate change, urban health and well-being, disaster risks, science education, and scientific mobility and responsibility.  In its role as U.S. national member of ICSU, the NAS provides input to ICSU's programs by reviewing and commenting on specific documents, nominating candidates for committees and panels, and hosting workshops on topics of international interest.  In April 2011, with support from this grant, the NASÆ Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO), and the Board on Research Data and Information, in consultation with ICSUÆs Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the Conduct of Science, held a 2-day international symposium addressing the international sharing of scientific data with a focus on developing countries.  Every three years, ICSU holds a General Assembly in which all member nations and scientific unions participate.  The last was held in October 2011 in Rome, Italy.  This grant supported a four-person delegation from the United States.  In preparation for the General Assembly, BISO suggested a number individuals for leadership positions, and provided feedback to ICSU on its foresight analysis, draft strategic plan for 2012-2017, science education report, weighted voting recommendation, revision of Statute 5 (concerning the freedoms and responsibilities of science), and the Urban Health and Well-being initiative.  Many of BISOÆs suggestions were incorporated into the final documents presented to the General Assembly.  The grant also provides funding for BISOÆs advisory board meetings.  Two are held each year.  These meetings allow in-depth discussion and planning for U.S. engagement with ICSU and other international science programs.   The NAS is also the U.S. adhering member to a number of international scientific organizations, called unions.  U.S. involvement in these scientific unions is coordinated through a set of corresponding U.S. national committees.  BISO also provides oversight to 17 U.S. national committees (USNCs) that work directly with the international scientific unions.   Every 18-24 months, BISO convenes a meeting of the USNC Chairs to foster interaction and increase communication among the committees and across disciplinary boundaries.  These meetings also provide a venue to discuss issues in international science of interest to multiple committees.  Topics addressed at the June 2011 meeting included effective use of new technologies, working with union leadership, developing globally-engaged early career scientists, improving connections with scientists in Latin America, maintaining strong linkages with professional societies, broadening support for the USNCs, and affecting international science diplomacy.   Evaluation and assessment is important to BISO.  In 2010, BISO developed a set of quantitative and qualitative tools to assess the impact of its activities and practices across its committees. In 2011, it validated and started the implementation of some of the standardized tools and commenced data analysis (i.e. travel fellowship and delegate surveys). Measurement of BISO and USNC activities is now an ongoing task geared towards the continuous improvement of our activities.
