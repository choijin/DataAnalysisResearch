<AbstractNarration>The Biology Department at the University of Massachusetts Boston is offering a ten-week summer REU Program, which provides opportunities for undergraduate students to become immersed in exciting and intensive research experiences. Each student carries out an independent research project under the close guidance of a faculty mentor. Student research projects span a diverse array of problems in biology. The theme of integrative and evolutionary biology encourages students to consider biological problems using different levels of analysis and to appreciate the value of cross-disciplinary approaches in research. Projects are designed to help students develop an understanding of, and independence in, research as well as a deeper appreciation of a specific field of biology. In addition to carrying out research projects, students participate in enrichment activities designed to promote a sense of community, enhance communication skills, help students understand broader issues surrounding the practice of science, and prepare students for advanced study. These experiences occur during weekly discussions and workshops that focus on both practical and ethical aspects of research.  The program also features field trips in and around Boston Harbor and final research presentations. The program will serve a culturally and ethnically diverse student population, thus broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in science.  Close mentoring relationships, as well as collegial interactions among participants, are key components of the experience.  The program is designed to stimulate and support interest in biological research and to equip students to pursue research careers.
