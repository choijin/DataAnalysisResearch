<AbstractNarration>A fundamental function of the auditory system in humans is to process speech. Both &lt;br/&gt;speech sounds and social vocalizations of other animals are complex in that they &lt;br/&gt;are comprised of many frequency elements that vary over time. When these sounds &lt;br/&gt;are first encoded by the cochlea in the inner ear, they are broken down into their &lt;br/&gt;individual frequency elements and single neurons respond to individual &lt;br/&gt;frequency elements. However, to enable perception of the whole sound, neurons in &lt;br/&gt;the auditory system must recombine the individual frequency elements in the&lt;br/&gt;appropriate temporal order. In other words, individual neurons must integrate &lt;br/&gt;multiple frequency elements over time. The first site in the ascending auditory &lt;br/&gt;system where individual neurons integrate across frequency elements in complex &lt;br/&gt;sounds is the inferior colliculus (IC). The objective of this research is to determine &lt;br/&gt;the role of frequency and temporal integration in encoding complex sounds in the IC. &lt;br/&gt;In this project, responses of individual neurons in the IC to spectrally and temporally &lt;br/&gt;complex sounds, including natural vocalizations, will be obtained. The project focuses &lt;br/&gt;on characterizing neuronal responses that display nonlinear interactions to the&lt;br/&gt;combination of two sounds with energy in different frequency bands. The project then &lt;br/&gt;examines how these "combination-sensitive" neurons encode natural sounds by &lt;br/&gt;presenting natural mouse vocalizations. Neural responses elicited by the entire &lt;br/&gt;vocalization, individual frequency elements and combinations of elements with different &lt;br/&gt;temporal relationships will be compared. The hypothesis tested is that neurons in the &lt;br/&gt;mouse IC show nonlinear frequency interactions to signals that contain biologically &lt;br/&gt;important frequency elements in the appropriate temporal order, and that these &lt;br/&gt;combination-sensitive interactions are a mechanism for encoding natural&lt;br/&gt;vocalizations. The strength of this proposal is in utilizing naturally occurring, &lt;br/&gt;biologically relevant vocalizations in an awake mouse model to study neural &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms underlying the processing of complex sounds. Because mouse &lt;br/&gt;vocalizations have similar structures to the vowels of human speech, and &lt;br/&gt;similarities exist between the perception of multi-harmonic communication calls &lt;br/&gt;in mice and humans, this project will be an important step towards identifying &lt;br/&gt;the neural mechanisms of speech processing. The research activities in this &lt;br/&gt;project have an impact beyond the scientific findings. Dr. Portfors has established &lt;br/&gt;a diverse and committed record of educating students and the community. These &lt;br/&gt;activities include engaging minority students through research opportunities, &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students through integration of research and teaching activities, &lt;br/&gt;and members of the local community through teacher training workshops, &lt;br/&gt;public lectures, and the local media. Dr. Portfors is regularly engaged in &lt;br/&gt;numerous  activities outside the laboratory and classroom that have broad &lt;br/&gt;impact on the community. In a typical year, she and her students give &lt;br/&gt;10-20 presentations to schools and community groups. This project will &lt;br/&gt;continue to foster interaction of undergraduate and graduate students in the &lt;br/&gt;laboratory and provide outreach to the community through presentations on &lt;br/&gt;auditory neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
