<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prairie View A&amp;M University (PVAMU) seeks to acquire a 10 milliKelvin Dilution Refrigerator System with integrated Tunnel Diode Oscillator (TDO) capabilities.  TDO measurements are a contactless means of measuring sample resistivity by observing  the changes in skin depth.  The Refrigerator and TDO will provide the resolution needed for extensive probing of the electronic and magnetic properties of inorganic and organic materials and heavy fermion systems.  It will further permit extensive fermiological studies to be carried out and the investigation of angular magnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO).  In addition, the dilution refrigerator will extend the capabilities of standard  techniques such as DC electrical transport, magnetization, specific heat and pressure by allowing them to be conducted in an extreme temperature environment.  The dilution refrigerator system coupled with the tunnel diode oscillator will allow us to  extend the phase boundaries of previously studied materials and firmly establish the phase boundaries of new systems.  &lt;br/&gt;This system is ideal for heavy fermion systems being currently grown by our collaborators from North Carolina A&amp;T University, Los Alamos National Lab and Greece.  It will also help  us to continue our Junior Physicist Experience Program which allows high school juniors and seniors to gain valuable laboratory skills at Prairie View A&amp;M University.  This program will help increase the number of underrepresented scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dilution Refrigerator is a unique instrument which is used to achieve temperatures below -459 oF  (the lowest possible temperature, called absolute zero, occurs at  -459.67 oF).  The lower temperatures act as a magnifying glass of sorts allowing researchers to observe, in more detail, new and interesting properties of the materials being measured.  A Tunnel Diode Oscillator station allow measurements to be performed without having to attach wires to the sample.  At low temperature samples that are exposed to magnetic fields undergo phase changes which are electronic and magnetic in nature.  This is analogous to the phase changes of matter which occur with the addition or removal of heat..  The Tunnel Diode Oscillator is extremely sensitive to these changes and ideal for such measurements.  The combination of a Dilution Refrigerator and a Tunnel Diode Oscillator will allow a contactless means of measuring material properties at ultra low temperatures.  Understanding these properties is important to producing the next generation of synthetic materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of this equipment will greatly enhance academics, research and outreach at my university.  It will afford students the opportunity to learn its operation and maintenance, while improving the quality of thesis and dissertations.  Furthermore, we have forged collaborations with several national and international researchers which will increase the exposure of Prairie View A&amp;M University students and faculty to world class scholarship and research.  The immediate benefits of the system will be for the existing Physics, Chemistry and Materials Programs and current outreach to local area high schools.  The acquisition of this equipment will also provide a 'hands-on' component for current advanced courses and will lead to the introduction of new courses at the university.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
