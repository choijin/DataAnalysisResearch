<AbstractNarration>In the past decade, robotic systems have moved from stand-alone units to more complicated&lt;br/&gt;systems that exhibit certain capabilities of interactions with human beings and/or&lt;br/&gt;environments. This development coupling with the recent re-organization of the Information&lt;br/&gt;and Intelligent Systems Division (IIS) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) into a&lt;br/&gt;cluster-research environment has prompted the necessity of organizing this workshop to&lt;br/&gt;discuss and explore the future research trends of robotics in a cluster-research environment.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the proposed workshop aims to address this problem with top-down and bottomup&lt;br/&gt;approaches:&lt;br/&gt;A) Top-down approach: Given that the IIS/Robotics program will be clustered with other&lt;br/&gt;IIS programs into cluster-research on Robust Intelligence, what are the potential&lt;br/&gt;innovative research areas that robotics researchers should look into so that future&lt;br/&gt;robotic systems will exhibit better mobility, intelligence, adaptation, and autonomy?&lt;br/&gt;B) Bottom-up approach: Given that many robotics researchers have their individual&lt;br/&gt;research areas that do not fit into this cluster-research Robust Intelligence theme, what&lt;br/&gt;should these researchers explore in order to propose more pertinent projects for future&lt;br/&gt;IIS competitions?&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits. This workshop will bring together researchers in the robotics&lt;br/&gt;community, including the principal investigators (PIs) currently supported by the NSF/IIS, to&lt;br/&gt;explore innovative robotics research areas in this cluster-research Robust Intelligence theme.&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will explore the benefits of synergistic integration of robotics, computer vision,&lt;br/&gt;artificial intelligence, and other appropriate technical areas into future robotic systems to&lt;br/&gt;achieve intelligence and flexibility in reaction to dynamic and changing environments.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The workshop will have significant and broader impacts on the robotics&lt;br/&gt;community. Through the workshop, researchers will broaden their views of future research&lt;br/&gt;for advancing Robust Intelligence in general, and robotic science and technologies in&lt;br/&gt;particular. Traditional single-PI-focused research areas such as dynamics, kinematics,&lt;br/&gt;control, motion planning, actuators, etc. will give way to a cluster of technologies in&lt;br/&gt;perception and cognition, and learning and intelligence. Equipped with this new vision,&lt;br/&gt;researchers will have better ideas in proposing innovative robotics research to investigate&lt;br/&gt;methodologies and technologies that will provide answers to design and develop future&lt;br/&gt;robotic systems that exhibit better autonomy, mobility, and intelligence.</AbstractNarration>
