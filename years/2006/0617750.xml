<AbstractNarration>Proposal  No:  0617750 &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  U of MD College Park &lt;br/&gt;NSF Program:  ECONOMICS &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Haltiwanger, John &lt;br/&gt;Title:  Conference on the Analysis on Firms and Employees: Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers from different fields have used different data collection methods, ranging from observations based on firm site visits to the collection and integration of large scale administrative data sets on firms and workers, to analyze the organization of the workplace and how it relates to firm performance.  Each approach has unveiled  interesting results, but it is becoming increasingly clear that it is necessary to combine different data collection methods in order to understand how the human resource practices and organization of production relates to firm performance and how these relationships translate into broader economic and social outcomes. New technological and theoretical developments has made easier to combine different data collection methods and this is changing the field of economics that is defined by the nexus of labor economics, industrial organization and industry studies, a development that should be should be formally encouraged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference is designed to bring together researchers who use linked employer-employee data, industry studies researchers, researchers who have conducted case studies, researchers who are using new methods of data collection for the interactions of businesses and workers and confidentiality researchers to define and &lt;br/&gt;establish this emerging field of research employer-employee data matching and its use. In particular, the conference will (i) identify how combining different study approaches data and using innovative data collection methods will improve our understanding of how the organization of the workplace relate to firm performance, (ii) address methodological and technical challenges associated with new data collection methods, and (iii) address confidentiality protection and privacy issues that arise when combining detailed data on workers and firms. In addition to bringing in experienced researchers to present papers, the conference will make special attempts to bring in graduate students and junior researchers who will be helped and encouraged to use these data sets for research as well as develop new methodologies for matching such data sets.  By offering to extend the methodologies of matching employer-employee data and broadening the base of users for these data sets, this conference will contribute significantly to economic science with impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
