<AbstractNarration>This research is focused on developing accurate and efficient numerical&lt;br/&gt;methods for the simulation of astrophysical flows. This project will build&lt;br/&gt;on a class of high-resolution shock-capturing methods that have in the&lt;br/&gt;last few years gained popularity in astrophysics. Several numerical&lt;br/&gt;challenges will be investigated including computing high Lorentz factor&lt;br/&gt;flows; maintaining divergence-free magnetic fields as dictated by Maxwell's&lt;br/&gt;equations; incorporating space-time curvature for general relativistic&lt;br/&gt;flows; including radiative cooling physics; and accurately simulating&lt;br/&gt;multi-component flows. Adaptive mesh refinement techniques will be&lt;br/&gt;incorporated into the simulations in order to resolve regions of the&lt;br/&gt;flow where the solution is rapidly varying, and conversely, to use&lt;br/&gt;less resolution in regions where the solution remains nearly constant.&lt;br/&gt;Special attention will be given to two application problems: the special&lt;br/&gt;relativistic problem of the interaction of pulsar wind nebulae with&lt;br/&gt;supernovae remnants and the general relativistic problem of accretion&lt;br/&gt;onto a rotating black hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astrophysics, much like weather prediction and climatology, is a field of&lt;br/&gt;science in which observations are possible, but direct experimentation is&lt;br/&gt;not. Therefore, direct experiments are replaced by computer simulations. In&lt;br/&gt;order to carry out these simulations, sophisticated tools from computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics are required to approximately solve the nonlinear system of&lt;br/&gt;equations that model astrophysical flows. Examples of such flows include the&lt;br/&gt;formation of pulsar wind nebulae and the accretion of matter into a black hole.&lt;br/&gt;A feature of these flows, and consequently the equations that model them, is&lt;br/&gt;that they can lead to complicated solutions with sharp discontinuities. Over&lt;br/&gt;the past few decades, an important class of computer methods has been&lt;br/&gt;developed to accurately and efficiently approximate such solutions. More&lt;br/&gt;recently these methods have been applied to astrophysical fluid dynamics. This&lt;br/&gt;research will focus on developing and implementing generalizations of these&lt;br/&gt;methods and also on the application of these methods to specific astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;problems. The P.I. is actively involved in collaborations between researchers&lt;br/&gt;in both the Mathematics and Astronomy Departments at the University of Michigan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
