<AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Mathematics (website: http://www.math.lsu.edu/REU/) at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge strives:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To engage a group of twelve nationally selected, highly motivated undergraduates in current mathematical research around Graphs, Knots &amp; Dessins in Topology, Number Theory and Geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To create an environment that nurtures intellectual creativity and encourages mutual support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To promote the discussion, communication and dissemination of mathematics and mathematical ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To advise participants on how to apply to graduate school and to support students making presentations at conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematics Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at Louisiana State University is targeted at mathematically mature upper level undergraduates and centered about the theme: Graphs, Knots &amp; Dessins in Topology, Number Theory and Geometry. We recruit nationally;  house the participants on the LSU campus in suites of apartments; provide week-end social activities and daily afternoon teas to foster the interaction of all participants and promote group cohesion. After a week of introductory lectures and individual meetings with each mentor, the students group themselves into clusters of four, each cluster working with one mentor; the students in each cluster  work on individual but closely-related projects; each student gives a ten-minute project presentation in the second week, delivers a final presentation, and submits a written paper in a form suitable for publication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphs, knots and  dessins  lie at the intersection of many currents of mathematical research connecting geometry, number theory, topology. We are introducing the new generation to this exciting area and to help provide scientific and technological capable persons for our workforce.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
