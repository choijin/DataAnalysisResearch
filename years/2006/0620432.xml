<AbstractNarration>The Copernican Revolution From Below&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to turn upside down the traditional account of the "Copernican&lt;br/&gt;Revolution" by examining the work of a wide variety of mathematical practitioners from&lt;br/&gt;across Europe that has remained essentially unstudied by previous historians. These&lt;br/&gt;printers, physicians, surgeons, astrologers, instrument makers, city officials, and "lovers&lt;br/&gt;of astronomy" (as they called themselves) produced hundreds of editions of annual&lt;br/&gt;calendars, prognostications and practica in the century following Copernicus. To prepare&lt;br/&gt;these periodica, the authors had to decide whether to compute planetary positions from&lt;br/&gt;the medieval Alfonsine Tables or from more recent tables derived from Copernicus,&lt;br/&gt;Tycho Brahe, or Kepler. Many of them explicitly discussed the choices they faced.&lt;br/&gt;From this vantage point, the Copernican Revolution becomes less a matter of natural&lt;br/&gt;philosophy, religion or realism debated at universities and more a matter of numeracy,&lt;br/&gt;empirical evaluation of astronomical predictions, medical practice, clock-making and the&lt;br/&gt;competitive business of printing in the everyday bustle of towns from London to Vienna.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;With its approach to mathematical astronomy from below, the monograph&lt;br/&gt;resulting from this project will provide yet another story of how ordinary people helped&lt;br/&gt;make the Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Extending the&lt;br/&gt;work of historians like William Eamon, Harold Cook, Paula Findlen, Pamela Smith,&lt;br/&gt;William Newman and Mario Biagioli, my book will investigate the lives of more than&lt;br/&gt;400 rather marginal practitioners of astronomy who gained authority and legitimacy not&lt;br/&gt;by their elite (Latin) learning, place at courts or noble birth but rather by their&lt;br/&gt;computational skills and the perceived reliability of their annual prognostications. This&lt;br/&gt;project will thus expand our view of the origins of modern science by considering users&lt;br/&gt;as well as makers of astronomical knowledge, and by viewing the content of astronomical&lt;br/&gt;knowledge as comprised by computational practice as well as theory.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;By writing a monograph of modest length, in non-technical language, the PI&lt;br/&gt;hopes to produce a book that will appeal not only to historians of science but also to the&lt;br/&gt;general public and (as a textbook) to graduate and undergraduate students. And by taking&lt;br/&gt;a perspective from below, the PI hopes to foster an awareness of science as an activity in&lt;br/&gt;which both lay and learned people have shaped the content, values and social legitimacy&lt;br/&gt;of the enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
