<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Near-Field-Controlled Nanoscale Coating of Functional Thin Films for Nanodevices&lt;br/&gt;University of Nebraska-Lincoln &lt;br/&gt;Lu, Yongfeng - 402-472-8323 &lt;br/&gt;=========================================================&lt;br/&gt;The Objective of the proposed research is to develop a novel surface process employing near-field photochemical process for self-controlled deposition of functional thin films on nanodevices. The project objectives are to 1) simulate nanoscale local light enhancement by nanodevices; 2) detect near-field-enhanced photochemistry; 3) deposit diamond-like carbon (DLC) films on nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) devices using laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition; and 4) characterize tribological performance of DLC-coated NEMS.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is to utilize optical near-fields as local energy sources for chemical reactions. It is a controllable surface process which extends surface coating to 3-D nanostructures. Fundamental understanding of nanoscale material deposition by highly spatially confined EM wave is of major scientific interests. It is a technique directly addressing the needs for coatings on sharp tips and edges of nanostructures, especially as self-lubricating and protective coatings for extensive wear applications at nanometric levels. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This research will benefit the society by revolutionizing the efficiency, cost, and positioning accuracy of coating functional thin films on 3-D nanostructures which have wide applications such as semiconductor, photonics, electronics, and consumer products. Research outputs will be disseminated via a website and through different conferences. Students from underrepresented groups will work on the proposed project. The research results will be integrated into an existing undergraduate/graduate course "Introduction to Nanotechnology." An animation kit showing the applications of NEMS and basic ideas on the thin film deposition at the nanoscale will be developed and distributed to K-12 teachers and students in annual public seminars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
