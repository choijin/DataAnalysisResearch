<AbstractNarration>The objectives of the project are to develop a divergence free H(div) finite &lt;br/&gt;element method for the Navier-Stokes equations and provide divergence free &lt;br/&gt;subspace bases for the three dimensional H(div) elements for the method.  The &lt;br/&gt;finite element formulations using H(div) conforming elements for the &lt;br/&gt;incompressible flow problems have been studied by the PI and other &lt;br/&gt;researchers. The H(div) finite element methods have the advantage that the &lt;br/&gt;incompressibility constraint is satisfied exactly. Furthermore, if a basis of &lt;br/&gt;the divergence free subspace for the H(div) element is available, the velocity &lt;br/&gt;can be approximated in the divergence free subspace. This eliminates the &lt;br/&gt;pressure and the whole incompressibility constraint from the large complicated &lt;br/&gt;system. As a result, the computational cost is reduced significantly.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore construction of the exactly divergence free subspaces bases for the &lt;br/&gt;H(div) elements has theoretical and practical significance. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;research will lead to an efficient and accurate algorithm for a large class of &lt;br/&gt;the problems with a special feature: the divergence free condition is &lt;br/&gt;satisfied exactly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial differential equations may arise in all fields of science and &lt;br/&gt;engineering. The study of numerical solutions for solving partial differential &lt;br/&gt;equations is extremely important in practice. A large class of the partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations derived from different fields has the constraint that &lt;br/&gt;some interesting variable is divergence free.  For example, such equations &lt;br/&gt;arise in the study of incompressible flow problems.&lt;br/&gt;Many numerical methods have been developed for solving this kind of problem. &lt;br/&gt;However, very few of them satisfy the exact divergence free condition. The &lt;br/&gt;proposed research will provide engineers with a promising numerical algorithm &lt;br/&gt;for the problems arising from computational fluid dynamics and other fields &lt;br/&gt;where the divergence free constraint arises. The proposed project pays &lt;br/&gt;intensive attention to promoting teaching, training, and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
