<AbstractNarration>Phillips&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0604839&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleague analyze mathematical&lt;br/&gt;models, described by nonlinear partial differential equations, of&lt;br/&gt;soft matter systems, namely liquid crystalline and&lt;br/&gt;superconducting materials.  They focus on electro-magnetic,&lt;br/&gt;optical, and mechanical interactions as well as thermo-mechanical&lt;br/&gt;exchanges within them.  They seek to identify qualitative&lt;br/&gt;features in the solutions for these models including phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions, the nature of defects, and their development. &lt;br/&gt;Techniques from mathematical modeling, partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, the calculus of variations, and finite elasticity are&lt;br/&gt;employed.  The models are highly nonlinear and expressed in terms&lt;br/&gt;of nonconvex, second order energies.  Developing analysis and pde&lt;br/&gt;methods to address these features is part of the project.  For&lt;br/&gt;liquid crystals a major goal is to carry out a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analysis for the event of electrically driven optical switching&lt;br/&gt;between bistable ferroelectric states in a smectic C* material. &lt;br/&gt;A second goal is to carry out an analytic study of the defect&lt;br/&gt;structure that appears in liquid crystals brought on by applied&lt;br/&gt;stresses and phase transitions.  In elastomers the investigators&lt;br/&gt;study electrically and thermally driven mechanical deformations&lt;br/&gt;in dry and swollen elastomers.  In superconductivity they examine&lt;br/&gt;current patterns characterized by the formation and evolution of&lt;br/&gt;vortex filaments within them.  For low temperature materials they&lt;br/&gt;investigate both stationary and dynamic features of vortex&lt;br/&gt;filaments in three dimensional bodies, using the time-dependent&lt;br/&gt;Ginzburg-Landau equations.  For high temperature&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity they study the vortex structure in stationary&lt;br/&gt;solutions to a d-wave model as well as current patterns in&lt;br/&gt;solutions for the layered Lawrence-Doniach model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Understanding physical interactions in soft matter systems&lt;br/&gt;is central to the design process where one strives to make&lt;br/&gt;smaller, faster, and more accurate devices.  Liquid crystals are&lt;br/&gt;used to make optical switches, nano devices, and displays. &lt;br/&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers have been proposed by physicists to&lt;br/&gt;model artificial muscles and other biological applications. &lt;br/&gt;Superconductors are used for small scale sensors such as squids&lt;br/&gt;(superconducting quantum interference detectors) and to make&lt;br/&gt;powerful magnets.  The approach the investigators undertake is to&lt;br/&gt;analyze mathematical models that describe soft matter systems in&lt;br/&gt;terms of nonlinear partial differential equations.  The work&lt;br/&gt;leads to predictions of qualitative features that the actual&lt;br/&gt;materials should possess and insights that should be useful for&lt;br/&gt;the design process as well as for the implementation of numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations.</AbstractNarration>
