<AbstractNarration>0601453&lt;br/&gt;McNamara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to explore the use of gas pumps (compressors and vacuum pumps) for MEMS applications.  The approach is to develop two types of gas pumps, the Knudsen pump and the accommodation pump, and to demonstrate the advantages of these gas pumps for pneumatic actuation.  The Knudsen pump features no moving parts, is thermally driven, uses the principle of thermal transpiration as the basis of its operation, and utilizes sub-micron features to operate at atmospheric pressure, making it a perfect match for MEMS technology.  The accommodation pump is also thermally driven and, although the efficiency is lower than that of a Knudsen pump, features no theoretical lower pumping limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This research will permit the development of many devices, including better biomedical devices and miniature gas sensors.  The biomedical devices will use on-chip pneumatic pumps to manipulate blood and tissue samples, resulting in better medical diagnosis.  The theoretical efficiency of these pumps is sufficiently high that the results can be directed toward developing more energy-efficient pumps, enabling more efficient air conditioners and refrigerators.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The PI takes an active role in recruiting and preparing a new generation of scientists and engineers by mentoring high school students at several local high schools, and directing research projects for both undergraduate and graduate students.  The results of the research will be widely disseminated in presentations at conferences and by publication in peer-reviewed journals, as well as by incorporation into courses taught at the University of Louisville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
