<AbstractNarration>This international collaborative materials research program details the investigation of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles that are hierarchically ordered, imbedded, and grafted to p-conjugated polymer matrices via self-assembly methods. It is a synergistic project between two active materials research groups in Singapore and the US. The first goal is to design self-assembly and directed-assembly protocols for the formation of hybrid conjugated polymer and nanoparticle assemblies both by in-situ and ex-situ synthetic methods in 2-D and 3-D motifs. This includes the use of layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition, surface initiated polymerization (SIP), and precursor polymer approaches. An international collaboration with National University of Singapore (NUS) and the University of Houston (UH) is a key component to investigating these new materials. The Valiyaveettil group, NUS, has expertise in the synthesis of conjugated polymers and the Advincula group, UH, in the area of polymer thin films and hybrid materials. By a synergistic combination of their efforts, new materials and phenomena will be discovered.  By assembling the two materials in 2-D and 3-D hierarchical ordering as thin films, new phenomena and properties can be systematically investigated based on exciton formation (polymers)-conduction band (nanoparticle) matching or surface plasmon effects including donor-acceptor systems. An important research thrust is to develop structure-property correlation of electron transport and energy transfer properties with different: composition, nanoparticle size-shape, nanoparticle-polymer interface, polymer microstructures, layer ordering, and local field effects in ultrathin films. A deeper understanding of the nature of this relationship will lead to harnessing new phenomena for potential applications, e.g. devices based on semi-conducting, photoconductivity, energy transfer, and charge transport properties.  The project follows a detailed plan and timeline to incorporate the training of students and interaction with academic and industrial collaborators. The most important impact is the education and training of talented students and their involvement in mentoring activities. They will be trained in a unique environment to investigate new polymer materials synthesis and device fabrication in an international collaborative setting between the Advincula Group and the Valiyaveettil Groups. In addition, this will allow them to harness scientific and technological skills towards a technology-minded global society. The project is jointly funded by the East Asia and Pacific Program (EAP) of the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Polymers Program of the Division of Materials Research (DMR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
