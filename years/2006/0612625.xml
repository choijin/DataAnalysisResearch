<AbstractNarration>Regularization methods are numerical techniques based on exact &lt;br/&gt;solutions of partial differential equations that are derived in the same &lt;br/&gt;way as fundamental solutions when the Dirac delta is replaced by a &lt;br/&gt;smooth approximation, such as a Gaussian.  The vortex blob method is &lt;br/&gt;an example.  The resulting solutions of the PDEs are bounded approximations &lt;br/&gt;to the fundamental solutions.  This project advances the theory, the &lt;br/&gt;computational implementation and the application of these methods &lt;br/&gt;to problems of Stokes flows. Regularized high-order elements, such as &lt;br/&gt;doublets and quadrupoles, are systematically derived, the required &lt;br/&gt;properties of blobs are proposed and families of blobs with such properties &lt;br/&gt;are developed. The regularized fluid velocity expression forms the basis &lt;br/&gt;of new numerical methods, whose convergence and efficiency properties are &lt;br/&gt;analyzed. Performance-based guidelines for choosing the numerical parameters &lt;br/&gt;are provided.  Finally, several applications of the methods include the &lt;br/&gt;dynamics of microorganism populations and the large-scale flow patterns they &lt;br/&gt;generate, the motion of cilia as they beat to generate an organized net flow, &lt;br/&gt;flows across permeable walls, and more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator develops mathematical tools necessary to design new reliable &lt;br/&gt;ways to generate computer simulations of biological phenomena involving &lt;br/&gt;microorganisms in a liquid environment.  These include the motion of bacteria &lt;br/&gt;in the human body, the synchronized motion of cilia in the lungs, the transport &lt;br/&gt;and filtration of chemicals transported by blood, and other biologically &lt;br/&gt;important situations.  The computer simulation of these phenomena complement &lt;br/&gt;experimental studies done in medical laboratories and are extremely useful, &lt;br/&gt;particularly for understanding the behavior of the human body under circumstances &lt;br/&gt;that cannot be tested in vivo. Often, computer simulations can detect responses &lt;br/&gt;that occur when parameters are outside the range typically used in the laboratory, &lt;br/&gt;and thus point to new experiments that should be pursued.  The methods developed &lt;br/&gt;in this work increase our understanding of how E. coli may move around the body &lt;br/&gt;or how defects in the lung cilia can translate into decreased functionality and &lt;br/&gt;possibly disease. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
