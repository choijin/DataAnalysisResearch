<AbstractNarration>Probably the most important mechanism of glacial erosion is quarrying:&lt;br/&gt;the growth and coalescence of cracks in subglacial bedrock and&lt;br/&gt;dislodgement of resultant rock fragments. Although evidence indicates&lt;br/&gt;that erosion rates depend on sliding speed, rates of crack growth in&lt;br/&gt;bedrock may be enhanced by changing stresses on the bed caused by&lt;br/&gt;fluctuating basal water pressure in zones of ice-bed separation. To&lt;br/&gt;study quarrying in real time, a granite step, 12 cm high with a crack in&lt;br/&gt;its stoss surface, was installed at the bed of Engabreen, an outlet&lt;br/&gt;glacier of the Svartisen Ice Cap, Norway. Acoustic-emission sensors&lt;br/&gt;monitored crack-growth events in the step as ice slid over it. Vertical&lt;br/&gt;stresses, water pressure, and cavity height in the lee of the step were&lt;br/&gt;also measured. Water pressure was manipulated by pumping water to the&lt;br/&gt;lee of the step. With repeated pump tests, the crack on the stoss face&lt;br/&gt;grew until the step's lee surface was quarried indicating that&lt;br/&gt;fluctuating water pressure caused stress thresholds required for crack&lt;br/&gt;growth to be exceeded. To fully comprehend quarrying mechanisms, another&lt;br/&gt;field effort will measure quarrying rates as a function of sliding speed&lt;br/&gt;during the spring melt season when sliding speed is expected to increase&lt;br/&gt;by a factor of 2 to 3. Acoustic emissions will be correlated to sliding&lt;br/&gt;speed and also to natural water-pressure fluctuations. Results will&lt;br/&gt;allow an assessment of the relative effects of sliding speed and&lt;br/&gt;water-pressure variability on quarrying. By providing the first&lt;br/&gt;measurements of crack growth in subglacial rock, this project will&lt;br/&gt;provide the necessary data to correlate glaciological variables to&lt;br/&gt;quarrying rates, removing the ambiguity that exists presently in&lt;br/&gt;landscape evolution models which are grounded on uncertain erosion&lt;br/&gt;rules. The field data will be combined with a theoretical model of&lt;br/&gt;glacial quarrying. The culmination of this work will be a quarrying rule&lt;br/&gt;that can serve as a basis for large-scale erosion models.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
