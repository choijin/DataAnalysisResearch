<AbstractNarration>Using 4He/3He thermochronometry to quantify the rate and timing of Canadian Shield&lt;br/&gt;fjord incision&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - The relationship between topographic relief development and climate&lt;br/&gt;change has emerged as a critical topic in earth science. Linking relief generation to climate&lt;br/&gt;change, e.g. the onset of the Quaternary ice age, relies on a quantitative understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;pattern and timing of glacial erosion. Although alpine glacial erosion in active orogenic belts has&lt;br/&gt;been the focus of recent research, fjorded continental margins, arguably the sites of the most&lt;br/&gt;intense glacial incision, in which fjords &gt;1 km deep have been inserted since the ice ages began,&lt;br/&gt;have yet to be examined in detail. The rates and spatial patterns of fjord insertion, and the&lt;br/&gt;feedbacks between ice sheet dynamics, topography, and glacial erosional processes are important&lt;br/&gt;components of Quaternary climate and landscape change. The aim of this research is to quantify&lt;br/&gt;the temporal and spatial evolution of a fjord inserted into the northern Canadian Shield by the&lt;br/&gt;Laurentide Ice Sheet. The research team will apply a novel tool, 4He/3He thermochronometry, to&lt;br/&gt;quantify the rate and pattern of formation of Clyde Inlet, a fjord on Baffin Island typical of&lt;br/&gt;dozens of other fjords rimming the Canadian Shield, and representative of fjords around both&lt;br/&gt;Greenland and Norway.&lt;br/&gt;Samples for 4He/3He thermochronometry will document the thermal history of Clyde Inlet,&lt;br/&gt;which in turn will constrain the long-term incision history of the fjord. Both fjord cross-section&lt;br/&gt;and fjord long-profile sample sets will be collected, which will potentially quantify both vertical&lt;br/&gt;exhumation and headward propagation rates of the fjord. The results of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;represent a critical step toward the team's longer-term goal of improving the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the feedbacks between ice sheet dynamics and landscape evolution. The erosional history of the&lt;br/&gt;fjord is the key observational constraint for numerical ice sheet simulations aimed at solving the&lt;br/&gt;complex feedbacks between topography and ice sheet behavior. The erosional history of fjords&lt;br/&gt;exerts a significant control on ice sheet thickness and configuration, the locations of major ice&lt;br/&gt;streams and their onset zones, and the overall stability and configuration of marine-based&lt;br/&gt;margins of ice sheets.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - This research will train one early-career scientist (Briner) and will expose&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students at the Universities of Buffalo and Colorado to novel&lt;br/&gt;applications and exciting earth science problems. Research activities under this award will be&lt;br/&gt;made accessible to indigenous peoples by translating the goals and eventual results into Inuktitut,&lt;br/&gt;making posters that describe the research, and by offering public lectures in Iqaluit, the capital of&lt;br/&gt;Nunavut, and at Clyde River, our proposed field base. The team will continue their tradition of&lt;br/&gt;working with the people of Clyde River, including guides, the Hunter's and Trapper's&lt;br/&gt;Association and high school students. In addition, Anderson will continue his efforts to educate&lt;br/&gt;the broader public about glacial landscape evolution through involvement in ranger training&lt;br/&gt;programs at US National Parks in which glaciers have played significant roles in sculpting the&lt;br/&gt;landscape, and in generation of simulations that can serve both as educational tools in K-12 and&lt;br/&gt;college classrooms, and as dynamic content in National Park displays.</AbstractNarration>
