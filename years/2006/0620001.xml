<AbstractNarration>Increasing the proportion of carbohydrates partitioned to storage organs is a long-standing goal of plant research. The problem is that carbon allocation is highly integrative and influences all aspects of plant growth; a battery of molecular mechanisms dictates how carbon is apportioned at the whole plant level. Transcription Factors (TFs), as master regulatory proteins, are able to influence complex biological processes; it is hypothesized that they may be involved in determining whole-plant carbon flux.  This research will initiate an investigation of the molecular networks and mechanisms used in tomato to regulate the partitioning of carbohydrate between source (leaves) and sink (fruit) tissue.  Metabolomics, proteomics, and computational analyses will be used to perform a full assessment of carbohydrate metabolism in transgenic tomato leaves and fruit, measure the flux of labeled carbon into source and sink tissue, and initiate a systems biology approach using multi-parallel transcript and metabolite analyses of leaves and fruit of transgenic tomatoes. The use of tomato cDNA microarrays will allow a systematic analysis of genes synchronously expressed with alteration of carbon flux. In addition, the use of multiple lines differently affected in resource allocation may allow the identification of common as well as distinct mechanisms after hierarchical clustering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Through established relationships with several diversity recruitment and retention programs at UC Davis and Los Rios Community College, students from under-represented groups will be taught the theoretical basis of techniques being utilized and perform a range of cutting-edge as well as basic techniques that include biochemistry, physiology, molecular biology, transcriptomics, and metabolomics.  In addition, students trained in non-biological disciplines, e.g. with mathematics and engineering backgrounds, will be recruited, as well. It is anticipated that these students will make intellectual inputs into the project, which will enhance the cross-disciplinary training of all participants. Moreover, students will learn, first-hand, the use of genomics to understand fundamental biological processes, be introduced to the concept of systems biology, and have opportunities to interface with industry, academia, and collaborative aspects of science.  Further, the PI plans to involve students from Davis High School and the UC Young Scholars Programs in her research program. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
