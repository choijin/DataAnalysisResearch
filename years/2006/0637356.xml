<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project develops an advanced, high-accuracy signature verification system based on a novel handwriting dynamics signal processing of two-dimensional waveform - the x- and y-coordinates of the pen's acceleration. The key innovation of the research is the development of special signal processing techniques that convert the non-stationary, dynamic handwriting dynamic signal to a stationary one. This facilitates a matched-filter solution, and subsequently overcomes the long-standing bottleneck of insufficient accuracy of signature verification techniques, which has forestalled its application to broader markets. The proposed approach makes possible the implementation of a matched- filter for signature verification, which is the theoretically optimal method for the evaluation of statistical similarity of a signal pair. The core problem with existing techniques lies in their reliance on the mean characteristics of an individual's signatures as a template for identification. However, these mean characteristics have significant dispersion that degrades the accuracy of the systems. The application of matched filtering concept to signature verification has been impeded for long time due to the handwriting dynamic signal's non-stationarity, resulting from random milliseconds-long time delays during the handwriting process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of the proposed project is to create a convenient reliable biometric identifier for security and privacy protection. The proposed device has a great potential commercial value. The broad customer categories include: Federal Bureau Investigations, Central Intelligence Agency, other law enforcement agencies for cyber security, as well as for security of physical access to sensitive and restricted areas, such as nuclear and chemical plants; passport control; medical providers and insurance companies for protection of medical records. The commercial sector applications include security of financial transactions, e.g. electronic fund transfers, on-line banking and other financial transactions, and card access to automated teller machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
