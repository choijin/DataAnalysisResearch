<AbstractNarration>Goal 1 Increase enrollment in STEM classes by establishing a summer math/science institute for&lt;br/&gt;high school juniors and seniors with research interns assisting in the planning, promotion, and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of the institute. These participants will serve as feeders to the internship program&lt;br/&gt;and to the STEM courses. Further, the interns will work with high school students in the lab setting&lt;br/&gt;monthly and become mentors to these students. A Career Day and recruiting of non-traditional&lt;br/&gt;students who are working in STEM fields will also assist.&lt;br/&gt;Goal 2 Increase retention of Native American graduates from STEM fields through implementation&lt;br/&gt;of a series of STEM lectures with lecturers from four-year colleges as well as visits to BCC of&lt;br/&gt;former BCC STEM graduates to expose their successes. Key to the success of this goal will be&lt;br/&gt;follow-up visits to Montana colleges to trace BCC STEM graduates.&lt;br/&gt;Goal 3 Strengthen STEM research infrastructures will involve developing partnerships with&lt;br/&gt;institutions/organizations which can do scientific testing for our research when the college lacks the&lt;br/&gt;equipment and moving beyond wind energy to alternative energies. The grant will encourage the&lt;br/&gt;broadening of research at BCC by BCC STEM faculty becoming more involved in the research&lt;br/&gt;activities. This will be accomplished by assisting them in developing a research component to their&lt;br/&gt;courses and/or a research capstone course.&lt;br/&gt;Goal 4 Improve technology by offering a GPS-GIS summer workshop for BCC students, build a&lt;br/&gt;mini math lab for the math department and involved in data collection for both TSET and RSI.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
