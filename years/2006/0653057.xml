<AbstractNarration>A multi-faceted program of advanced research will be conducted to search for bursts of gravitational waves from anticipated astrophysical sources with the network of interferometric detectors operating around the world.  Research and development for LIGO data analysis will be carried out in two main areas.  First, coherent data analysis methods will be developed and applied to search for specific sources of un-triggerd gravitational wave bursts.  In particular, searches which target detection of merger signals from binary black hole systems will be developed and executed. Second, coherent detection strategies will be developed for externally triggered sources of GW radiation.  Searches for gravitational waves associated with Gamma Ray Bursts will be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;The search for gravitational waves from binary sources is one of the main goals of the LIGO Project. Once discovered they will provide rich information about relativistic gravity in highly non-linear and highly dynamical regimes.  LIGO is one of the most advanced experimental endeavors ever undertaken.  Its complex design and sophisticated data analysis provide fantastic educational and research opportunities for students in all areas of physics.  On this project, they will be involved with sophisticated methods for extraction of signals from noise, computational schemes for manipulation of large data sets and modern astrophysical theories.  The research program addresses problems of gravitational wave detection with the worldwide network of gravitational wave detectors.  Participation in the joint data analyses conducted in collaboration with multinational teams will give students a unique research experience and exposure to the diverse cultural approaches in conducting research and pursuing science.  It will thus enable them to prepare for and access a wide spectrum of career opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
