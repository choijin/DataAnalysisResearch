<AbstractNarration>Hybridization between species has been hypothesized to lead to rapid adaptation to new environments. Many invasive organisms are hybrids, yet the role of hybridization in invasion is unclear. This research will test the hypothesis that hybridization increases the success of introduced species, allowing them to rapidly adapt to their new environment.  The study examines the economically devastating noxious weeds Centaurea maculosa and C. diffusa and their hybrids. Using molecular and ecological approaches, the performance of the parental species and the hybrids will be compared to assess whether hybrids may be able to invade new habitats. Additionally, this research will evaluate the susceptibility of hybrids and their parent species to an introduced specialist biological control agent through preference and performance tests.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has direct implications for land managers. For example, if hybrids are found to have higher performance, then hybrid populations can be targeted for control. In addition, the basic principles regarding invasion and hybridization can be applied to other systems. This grant funds the project of a female graduate student who is dedicated to being a positive role model to young women interested in science and is committed to disseminating the findings of the research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
