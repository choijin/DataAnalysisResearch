<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In this five-year proposed CAREER project, newly developed ultra low-power chemical and&lt;br/&gt;turbidity sensors will work alongside low-power commercially-available temperature, pressure&lt;br/&gt;and flow sensors to provide high-density remote sampling of the watershed environment in&lt;br/&gt;eastern Kentucky.&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goal of this project is to build and use a low-cost sensor platform for real-time&lt;br/&gt;water quality monitoring. Original research will be conducted into ultra low-power chemical and&lt;br/&gt;turbidity sensors. These micro- and nanofabricated components will be integrated into a&lt;br/&gt;macroscale sensor network using off-the-shelf wireless networking hardware and open-source&lt;br/&gt;software that has recently become available. Wireless communication nodes will each connect to&lt;br/&gt;dozens of low-power submersible sensors at different depths; since depths and sensor types&lt;br/&gt;depend on the application, a standard electrical and mechanical sensor interface will allow users&lt;br/&gt;to easily customize the network. The end result will be a new set of low-cost research tools&lt;br/&gt;available to help environmental and geological researchers ask new scientific questions, backed&lt;br/&gt;by the ability to carry out watershed monitoring projects with greater data resolution than ever&lt;br/&gt;before.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact/Educational Activities:&lt;br/&gt;Educational activities focus on using the sensor network to monitor water quality in eastern&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky. Due to the rugged Appalachian terrain, previous studies of the region's water quality&lt;br/&gt;have not been carried out at high resolution. Mining, agriculture, and natural events contribute to&lt;br/&gt;both degradation of water quality and changes in the hydrological dynamics of ground and&lt;br/&gt;surface water flow, yet the impracticality of accessing a remote streambed during a storm, and the&lt;br/&gt;low spatial density of conventional sampling, have made it difficult to pinpoint the source of a&lt;br/&gt;change in water quality without after-the-fact laboratory techniques. The broader impact of these&lt;br/&gt;remote access real-time water quality maps will be an improved ability to monitor, understand,&lt;br/&gt;and mitigate sources of pollution affecting human and ecological communities.&lt;br/&gt;Two groups of Kentucky students, one in urban Louisville and another in rural eastern&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky, will participate in the project's educational activities. Sensor fabrication and testing&lt;br/&gt;will be conducted at the University of Louisville by first-year students in our Introduction to&lt;br/&gt;Engineering curriculum. Because this project fits into the larger context of improving the natural&lt;br/&gt;environment, it may attract students who have not previously considered majoring in electrical&lt;br/&gt;and computer engineering due to unfamiliarity with the purpose and variety of career options in&lt;br/&gt;the field. These underrepresented students come disproportionately from the female and minority&lt;br/&gt;population.&lt;br/&gt;This project will also establish a collaborative link between the engineering school at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Louisville and Eastern Kentucky University, which does not have an engineering&lt;br/&gt;department. Field testing, data collection, and analysis will be conducted by students at Eastern&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky University via the Eastern Kentucky Environmental Research Institute, which was&lt;br/&gt;created in 2005 with funds from the National Science Foundation's Experimental Program to&lt;br/&gt;Stimulate Competitive Research (NSF-EPSCoR). Its purpose is to foster interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research into understanding the effect of environmental function on eastern and central&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky's land, air and water, and to encourage both undergraduate and graduate student&lt;br/&gt;participation in the design and execution of research projects, particularly field-based research&lt;br/&gt;activities. Early in the project, professors, students and community members will specify sensors&lt;br/&gt;to best complement the monitoring methods they are currently using. In return, they will obtain&lt;br/&gt;new research instruments, and hands-on experience with cutting-edge wireless sensor network technology.</AbstractNarration>
