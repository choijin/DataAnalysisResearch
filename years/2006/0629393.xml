<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Michael Davis, Illinois Inst. of Technology ;  Alan Feinerman, Univ. of Illinois-Chicago&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 0629416 / 0629393&lt;br/&gt;Ethics and Values in Science, Engineering and Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made under Ethics Education in Science and Engineering (NSF 06-524).&lt;br/&gt;There are three major approaches to ethics education in engineering and science:&lt;br/&gt;(1) free-standing courses in ethics; (2) large scale education ethics modules,  and (3) micro-insertions&lt;br/&gt; of ethics instruction into technical courses. This project proposes an innovation in&lt;br/&gt;the application of micro-insertion. It will focus on the micro-insertion approach in graduate education of engineers. Because labs are central to graduate education in both engineering and science the comparison of the effectiveness of micro-insertion in the classroom with micro-insertion in the lab will be studied. A nanotechnology lab will be included because graduate students' engagement with practical projects in an emerging technology should provide illuminatingly new micro-insertion problems, useful questions related to them, and useful insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are: 1) to demonstrate an efficient way to teach faculty and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students how to develop micro-insertion problems that are suitable for use in&lt;br/&gt;graduate engineering curricula, both courses and labs; 2) to assess the effectiveness of the&lt;br/&gt;micro-insertion in graduate engineering curricula, comparing its effects in the classroom&lt;br/&gt;with its effects in a nanotechnology research lab; and 3) to create an electronic resource for&lt;br/&gt;disseminating micro-insertion problems to engineering faculty worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will contribute in at least two ways to the field of&lt;br/&gt;engineering ethics. First, the multi-year assessment data that the project team will gather and&lt;br/&gt;analyze will not only provide insights into the micro-insertion method but will also lay the&lt;br/&gt;groundwork for later comparative research with other methods. Second, it will prepare&lt;br/&gt;graduate students to produce micro-insertion problems, allowing the determination of whether&lt;br/&gt;grad students can assist faculty in integrating ethics into engineering courses (a proof of&lt;br/&gt;concept).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will both advance understanding and promote teaching and&lt;br/&gt;training at the graduate level in engineering ethics. The project team and participating universities&lt;br/&gt; include underrepresented groups and will ensure that the Ethics In-Basket meets&lt;br/&gt;accessibility standards for users with physical and cognitive disabilities. Research results will be&lt;br/&gt;reported in a series of articles and conference papers directed at researchers and educators in three&lt;br/&gt;interrelated fields: engineering, ethics, and technical communication.</AbstractNarration>
