<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research is to fabricate and study the magneto-electric interactions in novel one-dimensional ferromagnetic-ferroelectric nanostructures, and to exploit them for innovative device applications. The program is motivated by theoretical models that suggest much stronger interactions in such nanostructure geometries than in standard thin films and laminate structures. The approach is to synthesize nanowire and nanotube composites consisting of ferroelectric materials, such as lead zirconium titanante or barium titanate, with ferrimagnetic nickel- or cobalt ferrite. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive research program is planned consisting of the following components: sample fabrication, structural characterization, magneto-electric interaction studies spanning a wide frequency range, device studies, and theoretical modeling. Efforts will focus on the creation of novel nanostructures using innovative processing methods and examine their use for a new class of microwave devices that are both electric and magnetic field tunable. At the University of Alabama, the PI will lead the sample fabrication, structural characterization and device fabrication efforts; while the physical property measurements, theoretical studies and device applications will be led by the PI at Oakland University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The efforts will bring together a multidisciplinary team of investigators that will make significant contributions to scientific knowledge, education outreach and infrastructure, and potentially lead to a host of next-generation devices for the national defense and consumer electronics.  The program will provide support for graduate and undergraduate students, including underrepresented minorities, and contribute to their broad interdisciplinary training. Project personnel will collaborate with local schools to facilitate participation by high school students in research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

On the other hand, strong room-temperature magnetoelectric coupling has been achieved via the stress mediation in two-phase composite multiferroics that consist of a ferroelectric and a ferromagnetic (ferrimagnetic) constituent.  The strain induced by an electric field in the ferroelectric phase can be transmitted on to the ferromagnetic phase in the form of magnetostriction, resulting in a change in magnetization.

The results have resulted in 11 journal publications, four of them in collaboration with Prof. Srinivasan.
