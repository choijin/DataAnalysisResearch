<AbstractNarration>Our emphasis is on supporting the "whole" student -- acknowledging that in the rural and Native American culture, relationships among families, extended families, and clanships as well as the relationships with the environment are critical in the process of learning for the individual and community. This proposal addresses the importance of providing students, their families, and the communities with ways to further value math and science, both as a vital component in their daily lives and a career choice.&lt;br/&gt;Three Goals of O[ta'7 shohn7zingo d00 binaanish yaanidiy8'go 0hoo[aah: Taking a Math and Science Pathway:&lt;br/&gt;. Increasing STEM student recruitment by (1) engaging Middle (6-8 grades) and High Schools (9-12 grades) (2) increasing the availability of science laboratory instruction at the college and (3) creating certifications to encourage STEM workforce development (4) by recruiting interested freshman, undeclared majors and liberal arts majors into a science cohort program&lt;br/&gt;. Increasing STEM student retention by (1) enhancing the relevancy of STEM to family and community (2) improving math placement tools (3) STEM academic content reinforcement and (4) better academic advising.&lt;br/&gt;. STEM Faculty Development involving (1) more relevancy in course content for students (2) broader instructional options for teachers (3) more course delivery methods and (4) faculty career development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF PATHWAYS Project at Din&eacute; College 2007 &ndash; 2013   OlhtaÆ&iacute; shohn&iacute;zingo d&oacute;&oacute; binaanish yaanidiyiÆgo &Oacute;hoolh'aah:  Taking a Math and Science Pathway   This project was funded through the National Science FoundationÆs Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP), which provides awards to Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native-serving institutions, and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions to promote high quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, research, and outreach.  Din&eacute; College was awarded $2,500,000 for the period from February 1, 2007 through January 31, 2013.  Goals were:  Increasing STEM student recruitment by (1)  increasing the availability of science laboratory instruction at the college, (2) creating certifications to encourage STEM workforce development, and (3) recruiting interested freshman, undeclared majors and liberal arts majors into a science cohort program Increasing STEM student retention by (1) enhancing the relevancy of STEM to family and community, (2) improving math placement tools, (3) STEM academic content reinforcement, and (4) better academic advising. STEM Faculty Development involving (1) more relevant course content for students, (2) broader instructional options for teachers, (3) more course delivery methods, and (4) faculty career development.    ACCOMPLISHMENTS   Science Laboratory Infrastructure: A new science lab was created at the Tuba City campus of the college, including room modifications to allow for lab benches, fume hood, and standard equipment needed to offer a year of biology and a year of chemistry and other courses.  With this improvement the college moved a faculty position to that campus, resulting in large increases in student enrollment in science courses.  See inserted graph.  Science Laboratories (chemistry, biology, geology, environmental science) at three of the collegeÆs largest campus sites were enhanced with infusions of major equipment and supplies to provide more current lab experiences and to permit their use in research projects.  Data Management Enhanced: The CollegeÆs Data Management System software underwent a major enhancement (conversion to an improved interface) to improve access to student record information and allow more comprehensive reporting of student information. Student Retention Approaches Piloted: A new cohort approach to recruitment and retention of students in science was implemented and evaluated. [See inserted picture.] Students were supported with stipends, peer tutors, common classes, and a variety of enrichment experiences.  Advanced students were recruited, trained, and paid competitive wages to provide tutoring in several disciplines.  Over the six years of the program the approach was evaluated annually and modified, eventually becoming a multiyear internship program with refined selection criteria to maximize student success. Many research projects of relevance to local communities in areas of environmental science engaged student efforts and attracted other supporting funding to the college.  Research internships were available to students at the three largest campuses, as well as some research opportunities that supported students at university and other institutional research programs. Math Software/Curriculum Innovation: For several semesters faculty conducted trials of accelerated math coursework, and enhancement of math courses through use of software.  One outcome is widespread use of computer software for homework and drill in all developmental math courses.  Faculty are now seeking further support for computer labs dedicated to math instruction. Learning Center:  The Shiprock Campus Learning Center was enhanced with computers and system-wide support for Accuplacer placement testing.   Piloting of Summer Institutes: Each of four summers a student enhancement program was designed and conducted for 15 - 20 students.  Each summer program...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
