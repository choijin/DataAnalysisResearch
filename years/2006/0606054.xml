<AbstractNarration>Technical: The goal of this project is to achieve greater understanding and the ability to create systematic surface modification strategies to improve charge transport between organics and inorganics. Organic/inorganic composites represent a new class of electronic materials that exhibit novel properties that can be modified for specific applications through design and control of constituent structural and electronic functionality. The organic/inorganic interface is critical to the performance of such composites, however. The lack of understanding of the role of interfacial microstructure on charge transport currently limits the performance of these materials. The approach focuses on the first layer of organic molecules, strategies for creating beneficial layers, and for characterizing and optimizing the interaction of the organic layer with the inorganic surface. Research will be directed at developing surface molecular layers on semiconducting oxides, with special emphasis on ZnO/polymer blends. Emphasis is on materials science of the interface, and how it changes as interfacial molecular layers are changed. The overall aim of this work is on achieving new knowledge and understanding that can be applied to a broader class of oxide interfaces and organic constituents, aiding future development of organic/inorganic composites. Optical, structural and electronic characterization techniques will be applied to develop an understanding of the properties of the specific functionalized surfaces under study, and to define a systematic approach to uncovering the interfacial electronic properties of organic/inorganic hybrids.&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities for potential next generation electronic/photonic devices. Organic/inorganic composites have the potential for creating electronic materials with entirely new functionality in energy efficiency, biological, medical, and environmental applications. This project will accelerate the development of these materials by providing fundamental understanding of one of the key issues limiting performance. The proposed project directly integrates research with education. Students and faculty will work with an existing outreach program at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) aimed at Denver middle schools with large populations of under-represented groups. Modules which explore connections between microstructure and materials properties will be introduced into the middle schools. Assistance and guidance in developing the modules will be provided by colleagues at the IBM research division, and approaches developed during the project will be included in a summer middle school science recertification program taught by one of the Co-PIs. The project will also include unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate training in a highly interdisciplinary field. The students will work on a daily basis in an integrated team with their advisors, collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) which is located in close proximity to CSM, and with scientists at Los Alamos. Involvement of undergraduate students in research, a focus on communication skills, and developing skills for work in a team environment are integral parts of the project. This project is co-funded by the DMR Solid State Chemistry and DMR Electronic Materials programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
