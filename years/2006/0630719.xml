<AbstractNarration>Engineering - 59&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing scholarships to undergraduate students in all majors within the College of Engineering and Applied Science.  Initially distributing the scholarship funds across all academic levels, the project is maintaining a cohort of undergraduate students from the freshman through senior academic standing.  In addition to scholarship support, the project is providing a network of advising, mentoring and other academic support from an extensive student support network that been developed over the past 10 years.  The project is engaging a significant number of economically disadvantaged and underserved minority undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long term goal for this project is increasing the degree production in STEM majors, assisting the Long Island Region meet a critical need for high technology and engineering employees.  The program is also incorporating an internship program as well as industrial mentoring through a network of university alumni employed in high tech companies.</AbstractNarration>
