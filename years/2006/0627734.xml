<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Sanjit Seshia&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research:  CT T  Towards Behavior-Based Malware Detection&lt;br/&gt;0627734&lt;br/&gt;Panel P060975&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malware is code with malicious intent that can adversely affect the&lt;br/&gt;host on which it executes or the network over which they are&lt;br/&gt;transmitted.  A malware detector classifies a program as malware or&lt;br/&gt;benign. Malware writers continuously test the limitations of malware&lt;br/&gt;detectors in an attempt to discover techniques to evade&lt;br/&gt;detection. This leads to an arms race, where malware writers find new&lt;br/&gt;ways to create malware that are undetected by commercial malware&lt;br/&gt;detectors, and where researchers working on malware detection respond&lt;br/&gt;by devising new detection techniques. Attackers create new malware&lt;br/&gt;using two main approaches: program obfuscation and evolution. There is&lt;br/&gt;strong evidence that malware writers are using obfuscation and&lt;br/&gt;evolution because the number of new malware families is growing at a&lt;br/&gt;much slower rate than the number of malware instances. For example,&lt;br/&gt;according to Symantec threat reports, in the first half of 2005 there&lt;br/&gt;were 10,866 new virus and worm variants but only 170 new families of&lt;br/&gt;malware. This data also indicates that signature-based techniques for&lt;br/&gt;malware detection will not be able to cope with the increase in the&lt;br/&gt;number of malware instances. Recent results by one of the PIs also&lt;br/&gt;suggests that current commercial malware detectors are not resilient&lt;br/&gt;to obfuscation and evolution techniques used by malware writers. All&lt;br/&gt;this evidence clearly suggests that we need a new approach to malware&lt;br/&gt;detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to explore behavior-based malware detection: our algorithm&lt;br/&gt;focuses on detecting malicious behavior (such as mass-mailing behavior&lt;br/&gt;used by certain worms) rather than searching for syntactic&lt;br/&gt;patterns. We specify malicious behavior in a formal language and then&lt;br/&gt;perform static analysis on the code to determine whether it contains&lt;br/&gt;the specified behavior. Prior work by the investigators demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;that this behavior-based malware detector can detect families of&lt;br/&gt;malware using a single specification. However, there are challenges&lt;br/&gt;that need to be addressed in the context of behavior-based malware&lt;br/&gt;detection. We propose tasks to address these challenges.  Solutions to&lt;br/&gt;the proposed tasks will lead to malware detection techniques that will&lt;br/&gt;resist evasion techniques used by malware writers better than existing&lt;br/&gt;malware detectors. Behavior-based malware detectors can also detect&lt;br/&gt;new malware that are variants of old malware..  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
