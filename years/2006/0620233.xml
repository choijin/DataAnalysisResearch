    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will achieve higher retrieval accuracy for shape-based search for both the web and the enterprise. The proposed work in Phase II is to achieve higher retrieval accuracy supported by three key components: 1) pose determination for 3D models: bridging the space gap between 2D and 3D shapes by finding three intuitive and robust orthogonal orientations for 3D models; 2) 2D orthogonal view generation: representing a three orthogonal views along the pose orientations; 3) similarity measurement between 2D shapes: finding 2D and 3D shapes based on the user's query. A framework will be developed by focusing on three important modules: 1) 2D constraint detection and use of implied constraints with initial application in 2D and 3D views; (2) Enhanced multiple level-of-details in 3D representations, and (3) Human assisted system classification of large datasets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional options of finding part suppliers using catalogs, trade shows and prior business relationship limit the choice of suppliers. Current text-based search to find suppliers face challenges, such as context and language sensitivity, and is inadequate in overcoming the technological challenges posed by variations in how product or part information is specified across a global supply chain. The current effort proposes to use shape, which is the lowest common denominator, to link the OEMs and suppliers. This technology can also aid the current trend among companies in aerospace, automotive, medical equipments and other industries towards 3Ddata standards for fast retrieval, as it can provide a significant leap in terms of accuracy, speed and relevance in the search and retrieval of information. If successful, this technology can contribute significantly to research in areas where shape is important, such as bio-technology and pharmaceutical sectors, where rapid identification of molecules and their docking features help reduce time and cost involved in drug development. For the medical industry due to increased usage of CT scans and 3D imaging technologies, 3D shape search can be used for local feature identification in colonoscopy or other exploratory procedures, brain angiography, reconstruction, projection of malformation or location of polyps and ensure better and rapid diagnosis of disease. Development of methods for automatically parsing human sketches and determining constraints will enable many other research activities and broadly help in a more natural human machine interaction.</AbstractNarration>
