    <AbstractNarration>0607292&lt;br/&gt;Clack&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the development of a novel mercury emissions control process called a virtual sorbent bed (VSB). The study aims to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of particle-gas transfer in turbulent flows and develop a novel control system for mercury emissions from combustion gas streams using the VSB. The project integrates experimental and modeling methods to obtain new knowledge of gas-particle mass transfer in turbulent flows to use in designing an effective mercury removal process. Instead of improving the characteristics of the sorbent, this project seeks to increase the mass transfer of mercury from the bulk gas flow to the sorbent surface. If the project were successful, it could yield an economic alternative to mercury control without expensive retrofits. The PI and co-PI have the background and qualifications to conduct the research. The potential benefits of the proposed work are high because mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants are a significant source of mercury, and the electric power industry is facing major regulatory requirements to decrease mercury emissions. Costs of existing emission control technologies are high. The project will include research opportunities for students through a program at IIT called Engineering Collectives, which integrates research teams of 3-6 students (high school, undergraduate and graduate students) to explore a research topic.</AbstractNarration>
