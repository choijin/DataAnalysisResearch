<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During June 13-17, 2006, The University of North Carolina at Asheville &lt;br/&gt;will host the 30th annual Summer Symposium in Real Analysis. The intellectual merit of this project is due largely to the dissemination of current ideas in real analysis.  The focus of the Asheville Symposium will be lectures by both leading experts and energetic new researchers.  The program of principal lectures includes hour long talks by Yang Wang of Georgia Tech, Miklos Laczkovich of Eotvos Lorand University, Manav Das of The University of Louisville and Alicia Miller of The University of Louisville. Together these researchers have made important contributions to harmonic analysis, fractal geometry, and topological dynamics.  There will also be time for a number of shorter 20-minute presentations and time set aside for collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summer Symposium in Real Analysis has broader goals than the &lt;br/&gt;dissemination of mathematical research.  In particular, the conference has traditionally been a warm environment for young researchers and teachers. This is one reason the list of invited speakers strikes a balance between senior researchers of outstanding credentials and promising, young researchers.  We will also hire several undergraduates to assist in a variety of matters and who will attend the conference themselves.  This broad impact extends internationally.  Indeed, the past dozen years has seen an increasing vibrance in Real Analysis coupled with greater international correspondence; the Summer Symposium has played a central role in these developments.  The broad importance of the topic has historically attracted considerable participation from liberal arts colleges, as well as research institutions.  It seems that the Summer Symposium is a very natural candidate for this specific type of grant.</AbstractNarration>
