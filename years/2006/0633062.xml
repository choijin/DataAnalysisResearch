<AbstractNarration>Life Science Biological (61) This project is developing three advanced laboratory courses to engage undergraduate students in original research on enzymes involved in the protection of eukaryotic cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS). Students perform original research projects in a sequence of three upper division lab courses: cell biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Activities in all three courses focus on methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs), enzymes that repair proteins damaged by ROS, using the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as the experimental model. Growing evidence suggests that Msrs, in addition to protecting cells against oxidative stress, play important roles in cell signaling, aging and disease. S. cerevisiae is a particularly well-suited eukaryotic model for this project, because techniques for its culture and genetic manipulation are easily adapted to the undergraduate classroom. In addition, molecular clones and engineered yeast strains are available through the yeast genome project. In each course, students formulate hypotheses, design and conduct original experiments, critically evaluate data, and formulate conclusions that serve as the basis for further experimentation. Different skill sets from biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology are taught in each course and applied to original research conducted by teams of students. Results are communicated in oral and written reports and in student poster sessions. Experimental results collected from the three courses over a period of years is providing novel information about Msr physiology and biochemistry that will lead to manuscripts with student co-authors submitted to scientific journals. Reports on the basic-research approach to upper-division lab education for large numbers of undergraduate students who would not otherwise be able to participate in original research will be published in journals focused on college science education. A broader impact of the project is to develop laboratory experiences to engage large numbers of undergraduate students with original research and to contribute to the scientific knowledge base.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
