<AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI), jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Zacatecas, Mexico in June 2007 on "Electronic states and excitations on nanostructures." Organized by Dr. Sergio E. Ulloa of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ohio University, the institute will involve approximately 50 students and 20 lecturers from all over the continent.  Lecturers for the PASI will be selected by an international advisory committee from among the top researchers in the field, including experimentalists and theoreticians, and will come from a broad selection of countries and institutions in the Americas.  The PASI will maximize the interaction of participants from all countries and at all levels by the use of lectures, workshops, and poster sessions.  An email list and workshop and lecture announcements and notes will be available at a website to enhance dissemination to the scientific community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of new and more powerful supercomputers has resulted in significant theoretical and computational developments. New methods emerge constantly, which together with the large number of significant advances in experimental methods at the nanoscale, allow scientists to join efforts in a common objective: the generation of new science and technology from enhanced understanding at the fundamental atomic level. This PASI will facilitate the gathering of experts in different fields to share their knowledge in these areas with junior scientists and student participants, and will serve as a catalyst for new ideas and future collaborative projects.  This award will be jointly funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering of NSF.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
