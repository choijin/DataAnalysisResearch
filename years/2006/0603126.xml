<AbstractNarration>Technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;High magnetic fields can perturb condensed matter to reveal or alter properties while neutrons can provide detailed information about nano-scale structure and dynamics. This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program -Major Instrumentation Project (IMR-MIP) program supports a conceptual and engineering design (CED) study of a high field magnet for probing matter in magnetic fields above 30 Tesla through neutron scattering. The project may lead to the construction of a world-class facility that combines these techniques to create a powerful new tool for a wide range of materials science. Two recent technological advances make this possible. The increased brightness of the Spallation Neutron Source enables experiments on small samples under extreme thermodynamic conditions and NSF investment to develop a new hybrid high field technology at the National Magnetic field Laboratory makes it feasible to bring a neutron beam into a &gt;30 Tesla DC magnet and operate it cost effectively at the duty cycle of a neutron source. The facility to be designed will provide unique materials research capabilities in areas including quantum magnetism, correlated metals, molecular magnetism, nano-structured magnets, superconductivity, metallurgy, macro molecular crystallography, hydride structure determination, and neutron excited nuclear and electronic magnetic resonance. This research has the potential to impact technological areas such as high-density magnetic information storage, quantum computing, superconducting power transmission, steel processing, pharmacology, and hydrogen based energy distribution. By involving student and post docs in designing the facility and developing the research program this project will also build new expertise in high field technology and instrumentation development for materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research provides support for the design of a world-class tool for materials science that enables neutron scattering experiments in ultra-high magnetic fields, more than twice as large as now possible. High magnetic fields are of interest to scientists because they offer a controlled means of altering materials properties. Experiments at the National High Magnetic Field laboratory over the last decade show that by studying the response of materials to high magnetic fields it is possible to derive unique insight into the origin of useful or interesting materials properties. Neutron scattering on the other hand provides a time resolved window on the nano-scale world which is of growing importance to advanced technologies. By combining these techniques it will be possible for the first time to probe nano-scale structure and dynamics under ultra high magnetic field conditions in excess of 30 Tesla. Such experiments will advance research aimed at producing materials that conduct electricity without resistance at room temperature, they will help to explore new classes of magnetic materials for information storage, quantum computing, and electrical motors, and they will help to develop stronger, lighter metal alloys through high magnetic field processing. The facility will also offer exciting new possibilities for determining the structure of materials that contain hydrogen atoms. By aligning the nuclear spin associated with hydrogen in high magnetic fields, neutrons can better resolve their position in biological materials and in materials for hydrogen based energy distribution. By involving students and young researchers and through outreach activities the project will also help to develop expertise an interest in neutron scattering, high magnetic fields and their application in materials science. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
