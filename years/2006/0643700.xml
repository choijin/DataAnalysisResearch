<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Design Methodologies for Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits&lt;br/&gt;PI: W. Rhett Davis, &lt;br/&gt;INST: North Carolina State University, Raleigh NC 27695-7911&lt;br/&gt;Proposal no: 0643700&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The semiconductor industry has succeeded in shrinking transistors on integrated circuits for more than 40 years, giving us dimensions now in the tens of nanometers and a market that expects new, faster chips every year.   Although quantum-mechanical limits of shrinking have not yet been reached, the cost of manufacturing equipment is becoming prohibitively large, and industry experts are struggling to find ways to justify this cost.  One promising approach is to stack chips vertically, thereby meeting the market's demands and re-using existing equipment to sell more chips.  This process of stacking, often called three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs), has been shown in prototype circuits to successfully increase the number of transistors on a chip, but it has not yet been shown to give significant improvements in speed.  Theoretically, 3D ICs can increase the speed of circuits by a factor of two to five, depending on the application.  The goal of this work is to experimentally discover and document the design techniques that will enable these speed improvements for 3D ICs in three ways: improved memory design, improved analysis of heat flow, and a search for applications that are especially well suited for 3D ICs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to scientific discoveries, this project seeks to improve engineering education by developing a free design-kit for the latest integrated-circuit technology.  All design-kits developed since 1998 have strict intellectual property controls, limiting educators' ability to use and expand them.   This sub-project, called the FreePDK project, will build on the latest, most successful free design-kit with a thorough literature search and collaboration with industry, providing a much-needed boost to education and small businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, an outreach partnership with a local community center and national education foundation will promote interest in low-cost electronics among disadvantaged students.  A nationally distributed workshop curriculum to build crystal radios and a wirelessly-controlled robot will be developed tested each summer with forty middle-school and high-school students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project researched the best design practices for the emerging field of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs), which are stacks of traditional integrated circuits.  Such 3D stacks are already common today with interconnections at the boundaries of the stack, but many have theorized that improvements are possible with the addition of connections within the stack, called "through silicon vias" (TSVs).  Most of the effort of this project went towards developing state-of-the art design methodologies with TSVs.  The greatest impact by far of this project has been through an open-source process design-kit (PDK), which mimics the kit given by a commercial foundry when an agreement is reached to design a chip.  Such a kit is needed to investigate 3D-ICs, but requires legal agreements that are difficult to negotiate.  Basing this research on such a commercial kit would therefore place the results beyond the reach of most people.  Therefore a free 45nm kit was developed, called the FreePDKTM, so that other researchers could use and re-produce the results.  More than 1300 individuals worldwide have downloaded the kit, and many instructors use it for VLSI education.  In addition, it has made an impact on scholarly works.  There are more than 90 scholarly publications that reference the FreePDK.  In collaboration with the Nangate company, which created an open standard-cell library based on the FreePDK, it has become a foundation for quantitative digital architecture research, including its use in the Fabscalar project from Eric Rotenberg, an effort to create an open-source superscalar microprocessor.   The FreePDK has also become a cornerstone for interactions between electronic design-automation companies and their customers.  Comments by engineers at Cadence, Synopsys, and Mentor Graphics indicate that it is the preferred method for exchanging data with their customers, due to its simple licensing.   The 3D-IC design methodologies targeted by this work are also starting to make an impact.  One of the most significant is a thermal analysis technique called high-definition power blurring, which shows how abstract "full-chip" temperature analysis relates to individual transistors.  This is important, because thermal effects on-chip are computationally extremely expensive and difficult to simulate.  This work shows how the thermal effects in the vicinity of the transistor (called "self-heating") relate to the thermal effects in the rest of the chip (called "hot-spots").  The power blurring technique shows how these effects can be superimposed.  The key to the approach is to find the "thermal response masks" for a transistor on the integrated circuits on each level of the stack (called tiers), as shown in the figure.  Based on this knowledge of how heat flows in 3D-ICs, we also undertook to develop a method to study digital architecture in this new technology.  We developed a method to perform electronic system-level (ESL) simulations using SystemC, combined with our thermal simulator in a "relaxation simulation loop".  The result allowed us to perform transient thermal simulations, such as the ones shown in the figure.  During this project, another research group independently developed the same method and was the first to demonstrate it, but this work was able to study the effect in a modern 3D-IC stack, due to the use of the FreePDK.  What we found was that most of the architectures investigated exhibited a positive feedback loop between the leakage power and temperature (called "thermal runaway") and that this effect was visible only with this kind of an ESL-Thermal relaxation simulation, as shown in the figure.   This means that future chip stacks will depend heavily on thermal management to prevent them from burning themselves up.  Also shown in the figure is a plot of a simulation in which a thermal management technique is introduced, throttling the processor back to avoid thermal runaway.
