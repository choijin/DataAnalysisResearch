<AbstractNarration>Through this project, Carnegie Mellon is continuing to offer the Information Assurance Capacity Building Program (IACBP) that improves the capacity of Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) to offer high quality Information Assurance (IA) education. This project will build upon the previous four offerings of the IACBP which have resulted in the development of a number of new offerings at partner schools, from short modules integrated into pre-existing courses, to full courses, IA certificates, and even plans and initial frameworks for master's degree programs in IA. The program has also led to a number of research projects and publications involving faculty and students at partner schools, as well as multi-institution collaborative centers. San Jose State, a member of the California State University system, is collaborating on this project to design and offer 2-day symposia that follow each IACBP session. These symposia provide an opportunity for faculty participants to share and develop learning modules, disseminate research results, and explore policy implications for cyber-security education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the IACBP are to:&lt;br/&gt;-Help build new capacity or expand existing capacity of MSIs to offer IA courses and programs at institutions not currently designated as CAEs in Information Assurance&lt;br/&gt;-Expand the number of institutions that are CAEs in Information Assurance&lt;br/&gt;-Expand the number of Ph.D.-level researchers in IA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IACBP contains the following components:&lt;br/&gt;-Security Engineering Week: Lectures, facilitated discussions, seminars, and workshops based on the text Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems by Ross J. Anderson&lt;br/&gt;-Cisco Systems Network Security Bootcamp for Professors: An intensive, hands-on short course developed and offered by the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Group of Cisco Systems&lt;br/&gt;-Curriculum Development: Development of curriculum and materials for participants' home departments' IA courses/curriculum and a presentation of the resulting curriculum plan&lt;br/&gt;-Research Presentations &amp; Site Visits: Presentations on research initiatives currently underway in Carnegie Mellon CyLab and CERT and presentations by participants on their own research interests&lt;br/&gt;-Enrichment Afternoon: Presentations and discussions in important academic areas that intersect with Information Assurance&lt;br/&gt;-Follow Up Visit: A return visit to Carnegie Mellon after the program is over in order to sustain the dialogue and mentoring relationships begun with Cyber Trust faculty during the program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
