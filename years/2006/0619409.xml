<AbstractNarration>Proposal No.   CTS-0619409&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Stephen E. Mylon, Lafayette College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI: Acquisition of Instruments to Enhance Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Colloidal and Complex Fluid Science  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding provided by this Major Research Instrumentation grant will be used to purchase instruments that will enhance offerings of undergraduate research projects in the area of colloid science and complex fluids at Lafayette College. Three major instruments along with essential accessories will be acquired: 1) A single unit compact light scattering system capable of the detection and measurement of extremely small colloids and macromolecules. Unlike conventional light scattering systems, this system is capable of simultaneous time-resolved static (SLS) and dynamic (DLS) light scattering representing the needs of an increasingly advancing field of study in colloids and complex fluids. 2) A state-of-the-art zeta potentiometer capable of accurate measurements of dilutes samples of polymers, colloids, or bio-macromolecules. 3) A preparative scale chromatography system with a refrigeration unit for protein purification. The need for these instruments reflects the research activities of the interdisciplinary team of PIs and the development of an interdisciplinary colloidal and complex fluid research group composed of the PIs and undergraduates at Lafayette College. The PIs' interests span topics ranging from protein characterization and biotechnology to medical applications of colloids to aggregation phenomena of colloids in natural and engineered systems. The new instruments will enable faculty members in the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Departments to further their research while providing research opportunities for undergraduate students and visiting scientists. As pedagogical tools, the instruments will be used in classroom laboratory settings as a platform to discuss current trends and topics in colloids and complex fluids and to offer students hands-on experience and training with state-of-the-art instrumentation. Acquisition of the research instrumentation will have several broader impacts: (1) Lafayette College undergraduates are eager to participate in important research using modern instrumentation. Successful funding of this proposal will provide an ideal multidisciplinary opportunity for teaching and training this group. (2) The PIs have a history of active mentoring of women in the sciences and engineering, many of whom have won prestigious national awards including NSF-GRF, EPA-GRO, Goldwater and Udall Fellowships. With the acquisition of this instrumentation, more opportunities will be available for women and other underrepresented groups. (3) The proposed instrumentation are critical additions to the facilities at Lafayette College and will provide additional research training opportunities for undergraduate students while simultaneously enhancing courses and laboratory experiments relating to colloids and complex fluids.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
