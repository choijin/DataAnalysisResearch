<AbstractNarration>In order to maximize growth and development, photosynthetic organisms sense and respond to changes in their photoenvironment. Many cyanobacteria possess the ability to alter the protein composition of their light-harvesting complexes in response to changes in the prevalent colors of light in their environment. This process is termed complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA) and, in Fremyella diplosiphon, is most responsive to red and green illumination. CCA is controlled by a photosensory biliprotein, RcaE (regulator of chromatic adaptation). To increase knowledge about the molecular basis of CCA, the goals of this project are: (1) to investigate the biosynthesis of RcaE; (2) to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which RcaE perceives red and green light; and (3) to characterize the downstream effectors to which RcaE transmits the perceived light signal. Molecular genetic and biochemical approaches will be employed to accomplish these goals. As RcaE is one of only a few members of the prokaryotic class of phytochrome-related proteins closely linked to a discrete physiological phenomenon, elucidation of the RcaE regulatory gene network that controls growth and development in response to light is expected to provide insight into the mechanisms of operation of biliprotein-regulated photomorphogenesis in photosynthetic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, broader impacts of the research will include an influence on undergraduate science majors and students from underrepresented groups, including women and participants in the Charles Drew Science Enrichment Program at Michigan State University. A training component of the research will be designed, in part, to develop the ability of these students to think analytically and critically. This career development plan also includes the utilization of instructional methods that enhance students' critical thinking skills, scientific literacy, and technical proficiency. The educational focus incorporates the use and evaluation of active learning pedagogies in an undergraduate biochemistry survey course.</AbstractNarration>
