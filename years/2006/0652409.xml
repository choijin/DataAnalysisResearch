<AbstractNarration>The fields of particle physics and cosmology have become inextricably intertwined. Accelerator based experiments, detectors in mines, and telescopes are all needed and used to explore fundamental questions such as the nature of dark matter. The Stanford group led by Principle Investigator Patricia Burchat will complete its investment in the highly productive BaBar experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and build a new effort in cosmology through the proposed Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.   On the BaBar experiment the goal is to more than double the current data sample by the time the experiment completes its nine-year program at the end of FY2008. The Stanford group will contribute to the maintenance and operation of the SVT and the SVT radiation monitoring system. Members of the group will complete ongoing searches for new physics in rare or forbidden tau and charm decays, and a diverse set of analyses involving charmed baryons. The group is also initiating a new analysis effort involving D mixing and will conduct the final time-dependent Dalitz-plot analysis of B -&gt; rho pi on the complete data sample, to extract the CKM angle alpha.   The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is the first ground-based telescope being designed from scratch to address the severe demands on systematic uncertainties needed to fully exploit weak gravitational lensing as a cosmological probe. The LSST will also address cosmological questions through studies of the growth of large scale structure, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae.  The Stanford group is joining the LSST project collaboration and will contribute to areas that benefit from the experience of particle physicists and aid in the understanding and reduction of potential systematic uncertainties: the development of a detailed simulation, the study of algorithms with existing data sets, and the design and construction of calibration systems.  The broader impacts of the program have several foci.  The PI will continue her efforts to integrate experimental particle physicists into the LSST project through tutorials and workshops. Members of the Stanford group have been very involved in programs that involve high school teachers and students (including those traditionally under-represented in physics) in basic research. The PI has led efforts to develop new undergraduate majors that increase the cohort of students who receive an education in physics.</AbstractNarration>
