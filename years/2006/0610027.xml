    <AbstractNarration>0610027&lt;br/&gt;GE&lt;br/&gt;Current understanding of fault-zone permeability at regional scales is limited. Particularly,permeability measurements across faults are scarce. Yet, there are clear indications that faults&lt;br/&gt;have large hydrogeologic impacts on various geologic processes at this scale, as evidenced by&lt;br/&gt;variable hydraulic head gradients, geochemical and geothermal anomalies across faults. There&lt;br/&gt;remain questions that are scientifically fundamental and practically significant regarding largescale&lt;br/&gt;permeability of fault zones and their impact on aquifers. For example, how geologic and&lt;br/&gt;hydrologic information can be best integrated to effectively constrain regional-scale fault&lt;br/&gt;permeability? While existing knowledge on fault permeability at small scales is indispensable&lt;br/&gt;scientifically, ultimately, it is the regional-scale permeability that is needed in conceptual and&lt;br/&gt;numerical models for solving problems related to water resource management and transport of&lt;br/&gt;fluid, solute, and energy in the Earth's crust.&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objective of this research is to characterize fault-zone permeability at the wellfield&lt;br/&gt;to regional scale with constraints from field-based structural observations, hydrogeologic&lt;br/&gt;testing, and interpretation from conceptual and numerical modeling. The basis hypotheses are&lt;br/&gt;that distinctive hydrogeologic responses around a fault could be observed from cross-fault&lt;br/&gt;aquifer tests and that fault-zone permeability features could be established from a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the outcrop structural characteristics, borehole data of host rocks, and&lt;br/&gt;hydrogeologic tests conducted at multiple scales. Using the Elkhorn thrust fault in Colorado as a&lt;br/&gt;field site, the research plan consists of the following: (1) to characterize the geology and internal&lt;br/&gt;structure of the fault zone to better understand the influence of juxtaposition of different&lt;br/&gt;lithologies on fault-zone hydrogeologic properties, (2) to drill and core new boreholes through&lt;br/&gt;the fault zone to obtain direct field observations for fault-zone permeability, (3) to conduct crossfault&lt;br/&gt;pumping tests in the new and preexisting holes to provide the much need direct&lt;br/&gt;measurements on fault-zone permeability, and (4) to develop a fault-zone permeability model,&lt;br/&gt;through numerical modeling that integrates geologic, hydrogeologic, and geophysical field data.&lt;br/&gt;Three aspects of the intellectual merit are recognized. First, the study takes a new direction&lt;br/&gt;in characterizing fault-zone permeability by closely linking geologic observations and&lt;br/&gt;hydrogeologic testing data. Second, this proposed research offers the opportunity to gain&lt;br/&gt;hydrogeologic insight into a particular type of fault that is common but highly understudied - a thrust fault with a crystalline hanging wall and sedimentary footwall at regional basin scales. Finally, the cross-fault permeability tests coupled with geologic characterization planned in this research will be a significant advance in characterizing fault-related permeability by providing much-needed field measurement data.&lt;br/&gt;The major aspect of the broader impact of this proposed research is on enhancing&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students experience in hydrogeology, in addition to training graduate students and contributing to better groundwater resource management in the western US. This research will benefit a large group of undergraduate students. Undergraduate students will be involved in all stages of this project. Specific approaches to implement this commitment include: (1) Recruit top undergraduates to conduct honor theses, (2) Field exercise related to an upper-division hydrogeology class. Groundwater level mapping and aquifer tests can be incorporated into class related activities, and (3) Drilling new boreholes will be coordinated so that students can observe&lt;br/&gt;the operation. Finally, the PIs plan to co-teach a two-credit two-week summer undergraduate field hydrogeology class. The research will provide an excellent venue for many different projects for this field class and help to realization of this plan.</AbstractNarration>
