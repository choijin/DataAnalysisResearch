<AbstractNarration>Information-based complexity (IBC) studies optimal algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;computational complexity for the continuous problems which arise in&lt;br/&gt;physical science, economics, engineering, and mathematical finance.&lt;br/&gt;IBC has studied such continuous problems as path integration, partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, systems of ordinary differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear equations, integral equations, fixed points, and integration.&lt;br/&gt;Usually these problems have to be solved numerically and therefore&lt;br/&gt;approximately to within error e.  Often these problems involve a very&lt;br/&gt;large number of variables numbering in the hundreds or thousands.  If a&lt;br/&gt;worst case assurance of an e-approximation is demanded, then the&lt;br/&gt;computational complexity depends exponentially on the number of variables;&lt;br/&gt;the problem suffers the "curse of dimensionality".  The investigators and&lt;br/&gt;their colleagues attempt to vanquish the curse by settling for a&lt;br/&gt;stochastic assurance (average, probabilistic, randomized) or by using&lt;br/&gt;domain knowledge about the application.  The investigators are also&lt;br/&gt;studying the power of quantum computation for continuous problems.  To&lt;br/&gt;understand the power of quantum computation for continuous problems one&lt;br/&gt;must know the computational complexity of these problems on a classical&lt;br/&gt;computer in various settings.  This is exactly what has been studied in&lt;br/&gt;IBC.  Recently the investigators introduced a new quantum setting in which&lt;br/&gt;randomized queries are permitted.  They have shown that for path&lt;br/&gt;integration there is an exponential improvement for the qubit complexity&lt;br/&gt;compared to the standard quantum setting.  This is important since the&lt;br/&gt;number of qubits is a critical resource for the foreseeable future. Among&lt;br/&gt;the questions the investigators and their colleagues stydying are:&lt;br/&gt;What are the query and qubit complexities for other continuous problems?&lt;br/&gt;Are there trade-offs between query and qubit complexities?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some forty years, computing has been driven by Moore's Law which is&lt;br/&gt;the empirical observation that computing power doubles about every 18&lt;br/&gt;months.  Powerful computers have been crucial for our economic strength&lt;br/&gt;and our national security.  They have made the internet possible.  For a&lt;br/&gt;number of reasons the consensus among experts is that Moore's Law using&lt;br/&gt;current silicon technology will end in some 10 to 15 years.  These reasons&lt;br/&gt;include the shrinkage of logic gates and wires to atomic size, the tre-&lt;br/&gt;mendous heat generated as chips get smaller and faster, and the cost of&lt;br/&gt;fabrication facilities.  Since it is so important to maintain the&lt;br/&gt;Moore's Law trajectory, new ways to compute are being considered.  One&lt;br/&gt;of the most promising ideas is to use the principles of quantum mechanics&lt;br/&gt;to do quantum computing.  The investigators and their colleagues are&lt;br/&gt;studying the following question:  If physicists and chemists succeed in&lt;br/&gt;building quantum computers, which continuous problems arising in science&lt;br/&gt;and engineering can be solved much faster on a quantum computer than on a&lt;br/&gt;classical computer?&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
