<AbstractNarration>Wolfe 0652299 &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this planning visit is to initiate long-term collaborative interactions, both scholarly and educational, with academic colleagues in South Africa.  The focus of the research collaborations will be on biological invasions.  Invasions, which occur when plant or animal species are moved between continents, can have devastating impacts on native species, ecosystems and economies (e.g., the impacts of invasives cost ~ $100 billion annually in the U.S.).  One of the fundamental challenges facing biologists worldwide is to determine the factors that enable introduced species to become invasive.  The proposed research seeks to understand how extrinsic factors such as interactions with antagonists (natural enemies) and mutualists (pollinators), and intrinsic factors (breeding system) influence invasion success in plants.  This approach is novel in that it integrates the role of multiple factors into the study of invasions.  During this planning visit, Wolfe will work with Dr. Steven Johnson (University of KwaZulu-Natal [UKZN] and the Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology) to initiate a study examining how antagonistic and mutualistic relationships are altered between the native and introduced ranges of several plant species, and how this influences the outcome of species introductions.  Because of its unique flora and fauna, one that has been heavily impacted by invasive species, South Africa offers a spectacular natural laboratory in which to investigate the ecological and evolutionary basis to invasions.  The educational objective of this planning visit is to learn from South African faculty how they integrate students with different backgrounds into science.  The PI will work with Dr. Robert Slotow, UKZN School of Biological and Conservation Sciences' Education Coordinator, who has worked to increase the recruitment of students of disadvantaged backgrounds into the biological sciences and research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit will have significant broader impacts.  The problem of invasions is global and thus requires a broad international perspective encompassing the disciplines of ecology, genetics, and evolution.  This proposal will foster an international collaboration between scientists who would not normally interact and who bring diverse experience and knowledge on the topic of invasions.  The visit will also produce educational benefits because it will enable collaboration on how South Africa and the PI's home state of Georgia can best address their common challenges in recruiting a racially diverse set of students into university science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
