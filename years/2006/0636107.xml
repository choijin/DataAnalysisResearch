<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Carl J. Wendt and Scott Hewitt will conduct an investigation of bitumen processing and exchange in ancient Mesoamerica.  Often called asphalt, pitch, or tar, bitumen is a naturally occurring petroleum product that was collected, processed, and used by the ancient Olmec (1200-500 B.C.) peoples of southern Mexico.  The first aspect of the study will involve the analysis of bitumen from archaeological excavations to provide clues on how the Olmec processed 'raw' bitumen into its usable form.  Building upon prior investigations, the second aspect of the study will involve the location and sampling of bitumen from seepages in the Olmec region to compare their chemical signatures to the chemical signatures of bitumen excavated from Olmec period sites within and outside the Olmec region.  Results of the study will 1) provide clues on the nature of bitumen processing techniques, 2) allow for the identification of natural bitumen sources used by the Olmec, 3) allow for inferences on the organization of Olmec commodity exchange, and 4) allow for the reconstruction of the movement of bitumen between the Olmec region and other regions of Mesoamerica.  &lt;br/&gt;This project is significant and pioneering since it examines the organization of Olmec processing activities, and uses bitumen, an exchange item that has received little consideration in Mesoamerica, to study patterns of Olmec commodity exchange and intra- and inter-regional interactions.  Data on bitumen exchange can be used to evaluate and test various hypotheses on the nature of Early and Middle Formative (1500-500 B.C.) exchange networks and interactions.  This research will lay the foundation for larger and more extensive studies on Olmec bitumen exchange, while at the same time laying the groundwork for other Mesoamerican bitumen sourcing studies, which can investigate bitumen trade during various periods, namely the Classic and Postclassic when evidence suggests that bitumen was used extensively by Classic Veracruz groups, the Toltec, and Aztec.  Insights form this research will lead to a greater and more complete understanding of the processes and factors involved in the rise and organization of complex societies in the New World.  &lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of the research is that it will contribute undergraduate and graduate student learning, help build and strengthen international partnerships (US and Mexico), lead to the development of new analytical/archaeological methods, and contribute to society by helping to draw attention to a readily available, yet regionally underused material.  Although bitumen seepages are common in Mexico's Gulf Coast region, residents rarely use this valuable resource for their local needs.  In fact, most residents in need of bitumen purchase it commercially, even though it is very often naturally available at no cost.  We hope that our research will shed light onto the important role bitumen played in the economy of the Olmec with the hope that more local residents will take advantage of the seepages today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
