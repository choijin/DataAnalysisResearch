<AbstractNarration>     Dominance hierarchies organize the social behavior of all social animals, and the behaviors that contribute to them are immediately recognizable.  Despite the ubiquity and importance of social dominance, little is understood about its neural substrates in any species.  Serotonin has been identified as a neurotransmitter that helps mediate social dominance in vertebrates and invertebrates.  Although serotonin has many effects and sites of action in the central nervous system, the effects and sites that are relevant to social dominance are largely unknown.  One approach to this problem is to examine how serotonin affects neural circuits that help govern specific aspects of behavior, and to determine how these effects change with social dominance status.  &lt;br/&gt;     The well-understood neural circuitry for escape behavior in crayfish provides an opportunity to determine how changes in an animal's social status lead to changes in the effect of serotonin on the excitability of neural circuits for escape.  Earlier work has shown that serotonin's effect on the excitability of the lateral giant (LG) command neuron for escape varies from facilitation in socially dominant crayfish to inhibition in subordinate crayfish.  Two molecular receptors for serotonin have been identified in crayfish, and their distributions in the crayfish nervous system have been described.    &lt;br/&gt;     This project will test the hypothesis that the differences in serotonin's effects in dominant and subordinate crayfish result from differences in the distribution or the efficacy of serotonin receptors that affect the LG neuron's excitability. Differences in receptor distribution in the LG escape circuit will be determined using fluorescently labeled antibodies to the receptors.  Serotonin agonists and antagonists specific to each receptor will be used to determine how its activation contributes to the effect of 5-HT in each social type of animal.   &lt;br/&gt;    This research will show how differences in the distribution and action of serotonin receptors produce differences in nervous system function in dominant and subordinate crayfish.  Because the action of serotonin affects social status in many animals, these mechanisms are likely to be widespread in the animal kingdom.     &lt;br/&gt;    This work will provide research training opportunities for a Post-doctoral student and a few undergraduates drawn from GSU and from other members of the Center for Behavioral Neuroscience (CBN).  The research will be presented and discussed at the CBN's Aggression and Affiliation Collaboratories, and so contribute to the CBN mission.      &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two research themes have governed our work.  The first concerns the role of social status and serotonin in modulation of neural circuits and behavior, and the second concerns the development of a software tool for neuromechanical simulation, AnimatLab.  In addition, work on neurogenesis and neuroimaging was also supported by this grant.   Serotonin, social status and effects on neural function.        The excitability of the lateral giant (LG) command neuron for escape in crayfish is affected by exposure to serotonin, and those effects differ in socially dominant, subordinate, or isolated individuals.  We found that serotonin had a variety of effects on the LG neuron in socially isolated crayfish that were produced at different locations in the cell.  Serotonin increased the effects of synaptic inputs to the cell from sensory afferents by increasing the electrical conductances of the synapses on the cellÆs dendrites.  In addition, serotonin increased the input resistances of the dendrites and the spike initiation zone, making it easier for the synaptic currents to excite the cell. These effects occurred at different times following exposure to serotonin, suggesting that different serotonin receptors produced the effects at the different sites in the cell.   Dominant animals, including crayfish, tend to hold themselves in elevated postures while their subordinate neighbors adopt lower postures.  Injections of serotonin in crayfish can cause them to adopt an elevated posture, whereas octopamine evokes a more supine response.  We found that serotonin modulates the neural networks that control the animalÆs legs and posture, and that this modulation differs in animals of different social status.  We found that leg reflexes and the responsiveness of motor neurons to sensory inputs are larger in dominant than in subordinate animals, and that serotonin increases these differences.   We also found that an unexpected touch to the side of the abdomen caused dominant crayfish to turn towards the stimulus and raise its claws, whereas subordinate animals first dropped in place and then crawled straight backward.  Leg depressor motor neurons (Dep MNs) of dominant crayfish were excited by the touch as the leg on the same side was planted to make the turn, whereas the motor neurons on the other side were either inhibited as that leg was lifted. In subordinates, the same Dep MNs were bilaterally inhibited as the animal dropped in place before moving backward.  These status-dependent differences in motor neuron responses persisted after the nervous system was removed from the implanted animals to a saline-filled dish, where a sensory nerve stimulus substituted for the unilateral touch.  This result demonstrates that the reflex circuitry is functionally organized according to the animalÆs social status, and that this organization is robust and does not depend on immediate input from the brain.  AnimatLab: A 3-D Graphics Environment for Neuromechanical Simulations    AnimatLab is a freely available (www.animatlab.com) software tool for simulating the neuromechanical processes of animals with computational models of the body and nervous system.  AnimatLab enables a model of an animalÆs body to be constructed from simple building blocks, situated in a virtual 3-D world subject to the laws of physics, and controlled by the activity of a multicellular, multicompartment neural circuit.  Sensor receptors on the body surface and inside the body respond to external and internal signals and excite central neurons, while motor neurons activate Hill muscle models that span the joints and generate movement. AnimatLab provides a common simulation environment in which to construct and test models of any skeletal animal, vertebrate or invertebrate.   We used AnimatLab to understand the role of neural circuitry and biomechanics in the control of kicking and jumping in locusts.  It has been hypothesized that the same neural circuit and biomechanics governed both ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
