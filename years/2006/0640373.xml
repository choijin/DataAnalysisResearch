    <AbstractNarration>Amphibian skin is attacked by a lethal fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This disease has caused widespread population declines and apparent extinctions in many areas of the world, such as Australia and the Americas. Numerous species of bacteria produce antifungal compounds, and over 20 species of bacteria that live on the skin of amphibians produce antifungal compounds. Investigations will be made into the role of beneficial bacteria on the skin in protecting amphibians from this lethal fungal disease. The role of stress in changing the community of skin bacteria and altering susceptibility to disease will also be studied. Methods will include field sampling, experiments in large indoor amphibian habitats, culturing of bacteria and fungi, and identification of microorganisms with DNA sequencing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amphibians are a critical part of many ecosystems, yet many amphibian populations have declined or gone extinct and others are at risk. The proposed research will provide important information that will help in ongoing and crucial conservation efforts of frog and salamander populations. For example, one recommendation may be to inoculate populations at risk from pathogenic fungi with beneficial antifungal bacteria. In addition, this research effort will teach undergraduates how to conduct scientific projects, thus preparing them for graduate and professional schools. Underrepresented groups in science will be encouraged to participate and will be actively recruited.</AbstractNarration>
