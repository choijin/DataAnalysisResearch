<AbstractNarration>NSF Workshop for Frontiers in Transport Phenomena Research and Education:  Energy Systems, Biological Systems, Security, Information Technology and Nanotechnology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;School of Engineering&lt;br/&gt;University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop entitled Frontiers in Transport Phenomena Research and Education: Energy Systems, Biological Systems, Security, Information Technology, and Nanotechnology is proposed. The workshop will provide a venue for researchers and educators in transport phenomena to identify frontier challenges and associated opportunities. Approximately 400 participants are expected to attend, with 200 invited participants and an additional 200 participating in response to general solicitations. The main outcome will be a roadmap for frontiers in transport phenomena research and education, to be broadly disseminated in the open literature. The two-day workshop will be held in Storrs, CT in the Spring of 2007 or Fall of 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Intellectual Merit. The workshop will address emerging issues in research in transport phenomena. Panelists and attendees will address topics in: energy systems, security, information technology, biological systems and biotechnology, and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Broader Impacts. An integral part of each panel on each of the technical topics (see Intellectual Merit) will be integration of the emerging research opportunities into education through curriculum evolution and development. This workshop will directly address issues in teaching and learning as applied to transport phenomena. The workshop organizers will strive to have a diverse representation of attendees including members of underrepresented groups and females. The research and education infrastructure will be enhanced through broad dissemination of the results including printed copies of the workshop proceedings, access to the conference proceedings and resulting roadmap through the web, access of filmed panel discussion through the web, and publication of both research and education challenges in the open literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
