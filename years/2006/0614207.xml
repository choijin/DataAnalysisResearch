<AbstractNarration>       Lake and stream ecosystems integrate conditions within their catchments and regional climatic changes. Results of prior studies in high elevation aquatic ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada have indicated changes in the importance of phosphorus to biological activity. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that the changing snow regime and atmospheric inputs of phosphorus are driving ecological changes in high elevation lakes. Continued measurements of chemical and biological conditions in lakes and streams in the southern Sierra Nevada, application of advanced techniques to determine atmospheric inputs, and analyses of phosphorus biogeochemistry in soils and sediments will be conducted to test the hypothesis. &lt;br/&gt;       High elevation lakes are excellent indicators of regional environmental changes and are increasingly being used by regulatory agencies to establish critical loads for atmospheric pollutants. Further, the importance of montane snowpacks to freshwater supplies of the western states mandates that particular attention be paid to these systems.  Continuation of more than two decades of meteorological, hydrological, chemical and biological measurements in sites at high elevation will increase their value as detectors of conditions as regional variations occur. The proposed studies will continue to be used by the National Park Service in interpretative programs to demonstrate the role of scientific research in the National Parks. Engagement of local high school students in the studies fosters an interest in natural environments and encourages these students to attend college and pursue professional careers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Within the soils of the watershed microbes retain phosphorus under snow which highlights a process important to ecosystem fertility sensitive to climate changes.  One likely consequence of climate change for high-elevation lakes is more precipitation as rain, and we observed considerable ecological change as a consequence of an especially large rain storm that occurred during an "Atmospheric River" event.  Large quantities of material washed into the lake, reducing the transparency of the lake water, increasing nitrate concentrations by over 100 times, and shifting the lake's metabolism to be consume more dissolved oxygen than it produced.  Paleolimnological investigations at Emerald, Pear and other Sierra Nevada lakes suggest that acid deposition impacted the alkalinity of some lakes early on in the 20th century.
