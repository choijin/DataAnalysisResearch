<AbstractNarration>Some of the most prominent efforts to improve math and science learning today focus&lt;br/&gt;simply on students' exposure to curriculum--getting more students to take college preparatory&lt;br/&gt;coursework, while also increasing the rigor of such coursework. Yet, it is not known if just&lt;br/&gt;changing and expanding the courses in which students are enrolled will have a substantial effect&lt;br/&gt;on learning in science and math, particularly as participation expands to students who have&lt;br/&gt;traditionally not been enrolled in such courses, and whether there are potential costs to this&lt;br/&gt;approach. The efficacy of such reforms will likely depend upon the ways in which they are&lt;br/&gt;implemented, the capacity of schools to enact more rigorous coursework without sacrificing&lt;br/&gt;quality, the degree to which students actually receive more challenging and engaging instruction,&lt;br/&gt;and the capacity of students to respond to increased rigor. Extant research does not tell us the&lt;br/&gt;degree to which such curricular reforms improve student outcomes, nor what kinds of students or&lt;br/&gt;schools are best served by such changes in course requirements and offerings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research rigorously evaluates the efficacy of large-scale curricular reform&lt;br/&gt;in a large, urban mostly-minority school district, Chicago. Since 1997, Chicago has enacted a&lt;br/&gt;number of curricular reforms aimed at increasing students' exposure to rigorous coursework,&lt;br/&gt;including raising graduation requirements for all students, expanding AP courses in&lt;br/&gt;neighborhood high schools, and requiring double algebra courses for students with low skills.&lt;br/&gt;The researchers already have access to administrative records, elementary and high school&lt;br/&gt;standardized test scores, high school course transcripts, and college records on the population of&lt;br/&gt;students attending Chicago Public Schools since 1991. This allows for a rigorous, longitudinal&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the effects of large-scale curricular reforms on student outcomes, including ACT &lt;br/&gt;scores, course grades, high school graduation, and college outcomes. The data allow for&lt;br/&gt;examination of growth over time of individual students, and comparisons of this growth across&lt;br/&gt;pre- and post-reform cohorts of students. The four investigators on the research team all have&lt;br/&gt;substantial expertise conducting research on high schools and working with schools to make use&lt;br/&gt;of their research. All have very strong statistical skills and substantial experience using the&lt;br/&gt;longitudinal data required for this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will help guide urban schools as they make decisions about investing&lt;br/&gt;resources into particular courses to enhance student achievement and educational attainment.&lt;br/&gt;increased opportunities for advanced coursework may improve outcomes across the board, but it&lt;br/&gt;is likely that the findings will be more nuanced and complex. This study will also show the&lt;br/&gt;obstacles and costs to implementing rigorous curriculum in schools that have not traditionally&lt;br/&gt;offered such courses. The results will be published in multiple outlets to reach different types&lt;br/&gt;audiences. Reports will be aimed at practitioners, showing the effects of the different types of&lt;br/&gt;curricular reform on student outcomes for different types of students in schools with different&lt;br/&gt;levels of structural capacity, as well as the barriers to implementation. Scholarly articles will be&lt;br/&gt;written to explain the methodology for studying large-scale curricular reforms, and to discuss the&lt;br/&gt;implications for theories on learning and on the effects of school organizational structure.&lt;br/&gt;Members of the research team have a long history of working with the Chicago Public Schools to&lt;br/&gt;incorporate research results into policy and practice. They actively try to present their work in&lt;br/&gt;ways that are accessible to practitioners as well as scholars. The members of this research team&lt;br/&gt;will also share this work with the many organizations and individuals who are working on issues&lt;br/&gt;of high school reform around the country.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
