<AbstractNarration>Recent and projected growth in photonics and photonic-enabled industries requires education of an increasing number of technicians who understand aspects of photonics as related to six industry sectors: communications, lighting and illumination, medicine, manufacturing, optoelectronics, and imaging and remote sensing.  The National Center for Optics and Photonics Education (OP-TEC) is a consortium of twelve community colleges with photonics programs and fifteen industry partners led by the Center for Occupational Research and Development (CORD).  The Center supports the design and implementation of photonic career pathways from secondary schools through community colleges to four-year institutions by updating industry-validated photonics skill standards and developing, testing, and disseminating model photonics curricula.  Existing photonics materials are evaluated and new materials, where needed, are developed and marketed.  Faculty, as well as administrators and career counselors, receive professional development including industry externships.  The Center disseminates information about the need for photonics-competent technicians through professional societies and a website and establishes a network of photonics educators.  Ongoing and sustainable technical assistance in technician education is provided for the more than 200 colleges expected to introduce photonics technician programs.</AbstractNarration>
