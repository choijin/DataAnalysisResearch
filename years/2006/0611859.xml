<AbstractNarration>2006 EAPSI Public Abstract &lt;br/&gt;This award will support a U.S. graduate student to conduct research in East Asia and/or the Pacific Rim.  The research project will provide the student with a first hand research experience, an introduction to science and science policy infrastructure, and an orientation to the culture and language of the location.  The primary goals of the East Asia Summer Institute program are to expose students to science and engineering in the context of a research laboratory, and to initiate early-career professional relationships that will foster research collaborations with foreign counterparts in the future.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
