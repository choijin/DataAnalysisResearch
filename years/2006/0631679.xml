<AbstractNarration>Great Science for Girls: Extension Services for Gender Equity in Science through After-School Programs (GSG Extension Services) will use 21st century technologies in combination with in-person professional development, customized consulting services, and evidence-based, gender-equitable curricula to create a unified program of change around girls and STEM. The project will bring together the Educational Equity Center at the Academy for Educational Development (EEC/AED) and two AED Centers that have worked extensively in the after-school field: the Center for Youth Development and Policy Research (CYD) and the National Training Institute for Community Youth Work (NTI) as partners. In addition, the project will work in partnership with regional intermediary organizations that provide training and technical assistance to after-school centers; and after-school centers directly serving girls and other underserved youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit-- GSG Extension Services will build the capacity of after-school centers to deliver evidence-based programming that provides a learning environment for girls that includes opportunities for leadership; active, intelligent engagement with concerned adults and other students; inquiry-based, hands-on experimentation; risk-taking; challenges and problem-solving; cooperative learning; and fun.  Integral to this project will be EEC/AED's Science, Gender and After-school On-Line Community of Practice (COP).  The COP will serve as an online virtual support system for program implementation, and an important follow-up tool for program participants. In addition, the COP will provide ongoing, cutting-edge information and services to a national client base, and act as a continuous link between researchers and practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: During the five-year project period, GSG Extension Services will make significant impact by building the capacity of 16 national intermediary organizations to implement the unified program of change with 10,880 youth workers in the 2,720 centers they serve, ultimately reaching 162,800 girls.  Through this comprehensive approach, GSG Extension Service will advance STEM opportunities for the large number of low and moderate-income girls and other underrepresented students who attend after-school programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last decade, research has documented the important role of afterschool in fostering improved attitudes and enthusiasm among girls and other underserved groups about STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). These include greater confidence in science ability, improved performance in scientific subjects, persistence in the scientific pipeline, increased knowledge of and interest in STEM careers, and changes in course-taking behavior.  Based on the research, the Educational Equity Center at FHI 360* wrote a successful proposal to the National Science Foundation for Great Science for Girls: Extension Services for Gender Equity (GSG).  GSG developed and extended an approach to science education in the field of informal education by working to deliver evidenced-based programming through Intermediary organizations that, in turn, work with thousands of afterschool programs. Over a five-year period, GSG has been able to bring gender equity in STEM to a large, influential, and expanding audience.  Through a partnership with thirteen Intermediary organizations across the country that provide training and technical assistance to afterschool centers within their regions, GSG reached 400 afterschool centers and an estimated 17,000  underserved students, the majority of whom are girls.  During the course of the project, GSG provided professional development and on-site consulting; created a virtual support system of technical assistance, training, resources and research; and developed new tools to inform the field of afterschool education about gender-equitable STEM.  An evaluation of the project revealed the following positive results:  Intermediaries reported that GSG influenced      the organizationÆs awareness of gender equity.  Intermediaries rated highly the      influence of GSG on their organizationsÆ capacity to provide technical      assistance to afterschool centers and their knowledge of inquiry-based      science. Staff and youth reported enjoying      being part of GSG and felt they gained new skills through the initiative.  A majority (70%) of staff reported      that the professional development provided by GSG was very useful.  Surveys indicate that staff and      youth learned about the importance of science, became more aware of      science careers and less stereotypical in their beliefs about who could do      science. Girls reported greater change than boys in all areas. Staff who felt curriculum trainings      were useful were more satisfied with GSG and also reported greater changes      in themselves (in opinions about women in science and the realization of      scienceÆs importance) as well as among youth (in interest in science and      fewer stereotypes about who could be a scientist).  Over 70% of surveyed youth agreed that      through the GSG programs they learned new things about science, gained new      skills and had fun. Over 90% of surveyed      youth reported their interest in science increased as a result of their      participation.    Over the course of five years, GSG created several gender-equitable tools to support sustainability for participating Intermediaries. The tools are downloadable from the GSG website free of cost for informal STEM educators in afterschool centers, Extended Learning Programs, and other out-of-school time venues. They are:  Starter Kits for Intermediaries and Afterschool Centers provide practical information for implementing GSG including: a program flyer, talking points, press release, descriptions of evidence-based curricula, program management tools, and local outreach and funding.  Gender Equitable STEM Strategies: Stories from the Field brings to life the many successful strategies employed by Intermediaries and afterschool centers to increase their capacity to deliver programming that broadens and sustains girlsÆ interest in STEM. Through written survey and telephone interviews, GSG participants from Intermediary organizations and afterschool programs...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
