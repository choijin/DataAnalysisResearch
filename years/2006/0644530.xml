<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Lara K. Mahal of the University of Texas- Austin will develop lectin-based microarrays for rapid identification of microbial lectins. Traditional methods such as HPLC, and capillary electrophoresis are tedious, laborious, and not particularly efficient in analyzing the carbohydrate constituents, and thus an array-based system would be a welcomed and important contribution to the field. Professor Mahal's work has three main objectives: 1) to create new analytical tools for the study of microbial glycosylation using interdisciplinary research methodology, 2) to increase science interest and the retention of scientists by creating a dynamic, web-based role model network and 3) to improve training at the chemistry/biology interface at the University of Texas at Austin. The first objective will involve the expansion of her lectin microarray technology for the study of microbial glycosylation. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that have been used in glycan analysis for decades. The analytical capacity of the array will be enhanced through the cloning and directed evolution, using synthetic carbohydrate antigens, of a panel of microbial-derived lectins to create novel carbohydrate-binding proteins. For the second objective Professor Mahal will create a unique mentoring website, Projectscientists.com. This website will consist of profiles of working scientists, associated monthly weblogs by the scientists, and a commentary section for users to post questions and comments. This will help young people to gain insight into the lives of working scientists and provide an interactive network of role models. For the third objective, a chemical biology upper division undergraduate/graduate course at the University of Texas- Austin will be created. And, integration of biochemical course material in undergraduate organic chemistry and undergraduate and graduate interdisciplinary research projects will be integrated into her laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Mahal's work will extend the analytical capacity of the lectin microarray via the cloning and evolution of discrete carbohydrate-binding domains, providing a unique and much needed tool for the rapid analysis of cell surface glycans in both microbial and non-microbial systems. In addition to providing new analytical tools for study of microbial glycans, the research and teaching described presents an ideal opportunity for the cross-disciplinary training of students in both chemical and biological methodology, an integrated skill set of increasing value within the scientific community. In addition, the website Projectscientists.blogspot.com will aid in the retention of students in science by providing contemporary and accessible role models and insight into life as a scientist to those at the beginnings of their careers. Integration of the website into the Women in Natural Sciences Freshman Interest Group curricula will provide outreach and career guidance to early stage female scientists.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
