<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Transforming Resources for Individual Preferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WGBH National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM) proposes to embed the capacity to&lt;br/&gt;transform and customize presentation of content based on individual user profiles within&lt;br/&gt;WGBH's TEACHERS' DOMAIN, a K-12 library of rich-media science resources that support&lt;br/&gt;standards-based teaching and learning. The project will enable teachers or students with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities to locate accessible resources within all current and future collections offered by&lt;br/&gt;TEACHERS' DOMAIN; identify what kind of content is being presented; determine if the content&lt;br/&gt;will transform to fit their presentation preferences; and identify equivalent or alternative forms of&lt;br/&gt;the content that better meets their stated preferences. The Center for Children and Technology at&lt;br/&gt;the Educational Development Center (EDC) will evaluate the usability and effectiveness of these&lt;br/&gt;resources with students with disabilities and their teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of Project&lt;br/&gt;IMS Global Learning Consortium (IMS) accessibility specifications have been developed by an&lt;br/&gt;international working group comprised of leading learning companies, educational institutions&lt;br/&gt;and standards groups. Specifications define a universally designed infrastructure for adaptable&lt;br/&gt;learning systems and content that will respond to individual needs and preferences. TEACHERS'&lt;br/&gt;DOMAIN will be the first-ever full implementation of IMS accessibility specifications embedded&lt;br/&gt;in a complete set of classroom resources. It will provide a real-world model that promotes&lt;br/&gt;accessibility as an essential design element that enables teachers and students to easily identify&lt;br/&gt;accessible learning content. Evaluation research will identify potential impacts on teacher&lt;br/&gt;practice and student learning and suggest areas to be explored in the future within large-scale&lt;br/&gt;assessments using these permanent resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact of Project&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a significant amount of accessible, high quality science resources that&lt;br/&gt;serve science educators and teachers working with students with disabilities. The project will be&lt;br/&gt;prominently profiled within major communities dedicated to technology and learning the&lt;br/&gt;National Science Digital Library, the IMS Global Learning Consortium, the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Teachers' Association  and will utilize partner dissemination networks that regularly reach&lt;br/&gt;organizations and educators that serve students with disabilities; science educators and&lt;br/&gt;curriculum developers; state education systems and school boards; education-focused&lt;br/&gt;professional organizations and trade groups; developers and purchasers of distributed learning&lt;br/&gt;platform and resources; developers; and distributors and producers of educational multimedia.&lt;br/&gt;The project will also serve as an international model of how digital libraries that utilize IMS&lt;br/&gt;specifications can automatically respond to individual needs and preferences, paving the way for&lt;br/&gt;improved learning experiences for all users. This will set a standard of accessibility that teachers,&lt;br/&gt;students and administrators should demand from learning platforms and content providers.&lt;br/&gt;Ideally, this will help catalyze demand for accessible learning platforms and appropriately tagged&lt;br/&gt;resources. This outcome will greatly impact the ability of teachers to more effectively and&lt;br/&gt;efficiently meet their students' needs for accessible and meaningful content. It will also greatly&lt;br/&gt;impact the ability of students with disabilities to access and benefit from distributed learning&lt;br/&gt;resources.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
