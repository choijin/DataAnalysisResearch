<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting a bilateral Japan/US Workshop on "Sustainable Chemical Synthesis," organized by Dr. Dennis Curran of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. The Workshop will focus on the science drivers of green chemistry in countries as complex as the US and Japan. Opinions on green chemistry in these two countries differ widely in both industry and academia. The Workshop will attempt to identify the fundamental areas of inquiry and research needs that are essential to bring the promise of Green Chemistry to fruition. What are the big problems? Among the many nascent solutions to these problems, which ones are being pursued by the participants and why? The outcome of the workshop will be a final report that will summarize the discussions and issues identified and will point out the science drivers that the participants feel should be the future engines of progress in the field. Dr. Junzo Otera (Okayama University of Science) will serve as the Japanese organizer.  The Workshop is scheduled to extend from December 12, 2005 through December 14, 2005 in Honolulu. The location was selected as an intermediate place between Japan and the mainland US, and the dates were selected to immediately precede the large Pacfichem meeting, which takes place in Honolulu on December 15-20, 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop program will feature scientific, social, and cultural exchange, with the aim of building long-term bridges for productive international collaboration and knowledge exchange. The workshop is expected to provide a forum for the exchange of research ideas, accomplishments and common problems among the group of chemists.  The setting and the proposed schedule are designed to encourage formal and informal discussion that will allow participants to become well acquainted with one another. Assessment of the workshop will be conducted by a survey of all participants and by continued email exchange. Outcomes of the Workshop will include a proceedings (3-4 pages per participant), email lists exchange, follow up collaborations, and a workshop report.</AbstractNarration>
