<AbstractNarration>Children's deceptive behavior has recently emerged as a topic of considerable importance not only because of its relevance to parents and teachers, but also because research on this topic may provide clues to understanding children's eyewitness testimony. This project will integrate theories of children's development with theories of self-presentational that have proven useful in understanding adult deception. Self-presentation involves behaviors geared toward conveying a specific impression to others and, at times, attempts to manipulate social situations (e.g., presenting the self as studious, aggressive, scholarly, masculine or feminine, etc.).  When deceiving others, adults enact behaviors they believe will convince others of their honesty.  At the same time, adults inadvertently reveal cues that they are engaged in deception (e.g., shifting, nervous movements). This project will document the approximate ages at which children's cues that they are lying match the cues that have been documented in adults. The project will also explore the social cognitive skills that may be required for children to self-present deception and display adult-like deception  cues.  Effective self-presentation may depend on the development of advanced "theory of mind" abilities ("I know what my friend thinks her mother thinks  about me").  Liars may need such skills to anticipate whether a particular audience will detect their deception. Effective management of deception is also likely to depend on whether children understand the nature of self-presentation: For their lies to be effective, children may need to know which behaviors to display, how to display those behaviors, and the conditions under which they "should" be displayed. To explore the developmental trajectory of children's deception cues and the social-cognitive correlates of this development, 4- to 9-year-old children be observed in a resistance-temptation situation, wherein they will be told not to look to a desirable toy.  Children who cannot resist this temptation may decide to lie about their transgression. Children will next complete tasks designed to assessed advanced theory of mind and self-presentation understanding abilities. Statistical analyses will test the interactions among lying, age, indexes of social-cognitive development, and deception cues.  The PI anticipates that older children,  particularly those who understand the nature of self-presentation, will be more likely than other children to self-present deception like adults.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide new insights into the development of children's deception and self-presentation abilities.  For children's deception research, the objectives shift focus away from descriptions of the behaviors of liars and truth tellers toward identification of factors that may contribute to individual and developmental differences in lying, skilled deception (e.g., the appearance of honesty), and honesty.  This project will advance self-presentation because so little is currently known of children's understanding of self-presentation and whether this understanding is link to their actual self-presenting behavior, particular behaviors intended to deceive.  Because the PI will identify which types of deception cues are used by children of different ages, the results will also have the potential to inform the development of techniques for determining the veracity of children's testimony.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
