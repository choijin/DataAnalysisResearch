<AbstractNarration>This award is for partial support for the preparation of a monograph entitled Air-Ice-Ocean Interaction: Turbulent Ocean Boundary Layer Exchange Processes, to be published by Springer in 2007-2008.  The monograph will draw on extensive observational and theoretical background gained from numerous scientific expeditions in both polar regions. Particular emphasis will be placed on the contrast between sea ice and upper ocean dynamics in the Southern Ocean versus the Arctic, and the ramifications of upper ocean dynamics for understanding the impact of&lt;br/&gt;polar regions on global climate.  The preparation of the monograph presents an opportunity to pull together a number of concepts and techniques developed over more than three decades of research, and it is anticipated that the volume will be of interest to investigators interested in sea ice, polar oceans, and numerical modeling of air-ice-ocean interaction over a broad spectrum of scales.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
