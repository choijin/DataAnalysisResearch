<AbstractNarration>Integrated DC-DC Converter with Substrate-Molded Filter &lt;br/&gt;(Proposal No. ECS-0601294)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Huikai Xie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: This project investigates a CMOS-compatible micromachining process for building low-loss, high-power density inductors in the substrate of a semiconductor IC chip. By utilizing the substrate as a disposable mold, conductor and core laminates could be made as thick (~200-500mm) as the substrate. The substrate-molded inductors thus formed are combined with the CMOS power electronics on the chip surface to realize an integrated dc-dc converter. A multi-phase buck converter with coupled inductors is employed to alleviate the inductance requirement and to improve transient response. Symmetric core geometries can be realized, eliminating the problems associated with flux imbalance. The magnetic field can be shaped to parallel to, rather than cutting into, the silicon circuitry. Thermal plugs (the inductor windings being some of them) can be embedded to enhance heat removal. Intellectual Merit: Two sets of intellectual merits can be identified with the aforementioned goals. The first set comprises the advances needed to add the third dimension to the popular planar inductor fabrication processes. The second set comprises the opportunities to realize near-ideal magnetic and circuit performance that are not realizable with discrete components. Broader Impact: The success of this project will directly benefit portable electronics markets such as cell phones and laptops because of the small size, low power loss and low cost of the proposed fully integrated power converter. The silicon molding process opens the door for monolithic wireless sensors too. This research topic will be included in a graduate course, Advanced Microsystem Technology, newly developed by the PI. The co-PIs will also participate in the STEP-UP program designed to promote academic and personal success among minority freshman engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
