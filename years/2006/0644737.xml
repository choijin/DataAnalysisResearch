<AbstractNarration>0644737&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The objective of this CAREER proposal is to synthesize and study the optical properties of self-assembled nanowire heterostructure materials ranging from molecular to microscopic length scales. Fundamental understanding and exploitation of quantum effects in optical devices holds great promise to revolutionize nanophotonic systems. The research will focus on the synthesis and characterization of nanowire heterostructures and devices in different geometries with accurate control over composition and dimension for investigating fundamental optical properties of systems in confined geometries. The following approach will be undertaken: 1) Develop the atomic-layer deposition technique to synthesize nanowire heterostructures. 2) Characterization of nanowire heterostructures using electron microscopy, optical, electrical, and optoelectronic measurements. 3) Fabrication of quantum-confined nanowire photonic devices such as diodes, lasers, and single-photon sources. The proposed research extends across several frontiers of science and engineering, with the main focus on studying optical properties of chemically grown nanowire heterostructures where finite size, surface and quantum effects become predominant. It will lead to the development of new sub-lithographic nanophotonic devices, which are difficult to assemble using conventional techniques including integration of photonic components with Si-based electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research will greatly impact the field of nanophotonics, which represents a major driver ushering the era of nanotechnology. Bottom up approach to self assemble nanostructures will create highly efficient nanosystems with functionalities not possible with any conventional technology. Integrated nanophotonics/electronics will allow development of new, cheaper and efficient devices that will impact areas such as telecommunications, computing, diagnostics, and sensors. The main focus of the educational plan of this proposal is to develop innovative teaching tools to enable students at all levels to acquire high-quality scientific education. The PI will integrate research activities and educational goals by: 1) Developing a new curriculum in nanosciences in the Materials Science department at Penn. 2) Involvement of undergraduates, underrepresented groups and minorities in the research program. 3) Develop Science Van project to take scientific equipment and experiments to under-equipped high schools in West Philadelphia.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
