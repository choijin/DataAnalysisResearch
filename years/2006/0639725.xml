<AbstractNarration>The NSFAYS Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering is a program designed to engage 120 6th grade students in 216 hours of mathematics and engineering activities on Saturdays and in the summer.  Students will participate in three courses as they are promoted from 6th through 8th grade.  Students from an urban and suburban school district participate in the NSFAYS DAPCEP program.  The student population for the NSFAYS DAPCEP program is 95% African-American, 5% Latino and 30% female.  Students participate in the following courses:  Mathematics of Music, Mathematics of Motion and Mathematics of Machines.  School-based concepts are reinforced via these out of school time activities (i.e. fraction to decimal conversion, and the mathematics and scientific derivations of sound creation).  Approximately 20 teachers teach students on Saturdays.  Teachers also receive 360 hours of professional development over 3 years.  The NSFAYS DAPCEP project is a collaboration between the Detroit Public School system, Southfield Public Schools, Diamler Chrysler, Ford Motor Company and The University of Detroit Mercy.</AbstractNarration>
