<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Kerr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program set forth in the proposal involves a nexus of &lt;br/&gt;problems aimed at deepening and broadening both recently discovered&lt;br/&gt;and well established connections between dynamics, metric&lt;br/&gt;geometry, and functional analysis. The theory of C*-algebras will provide &lt;br/&gt;the basic reference point and meeting ground for the various components.&lt;br/&gt;One of the main objectives is to push forward the&lt;br/&gt;development of an abstract theory of C*-dynamics which, in the spirit of &lt;br/&gt;topological dynamics, sees as its primary object of study the long-term &lt;br/&gt;behavior of systems as captured by properties like entropy and mixing. &lt;br/&gt;This project will be pursued by building on links to the&lt;br/&gt;local theory of Banach spaces and making novel use of the perturbation &lt;br/&gt;techniques of C*-algebra classification theory, with a view towards &lt;br/&gt;applications in noncommutative metric and differential geometry, &lt;br/&gt;C*-algebra structure and representation theory, and operator space&lt;br/&gt;geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One way in which the notion of chaos manifests itself is through the &lt;br/&gt;unpredictability exhibited by many complex systems as they &lt;br/&gt;evolve with time. This unpredictability can be made mathematically precise &lt;br/&gt;in several distinct ways depending on the exact kind of behavior one wants&lt;br/&gt;to emphasize, such as mixing or sensitivity to initial conditions. Determining&lt;br/&gt;the relationships between the various phenomena encompassed &lt;br/&gt;by and related to the term chaos, including most notably entropy, &lt;br/&gt;is a major ongoing project in the theory of dynamical systems, and has &lt;br/&gt;practical interest for example in the effort to gauge the accuracy of &lt;br/&gt;computer simulations. &lt;br/&gt;While there exists a vast array of results for the type of&lt;br/&gt;systems which are used to model classical physics, the theory is much less &lt;br/&gt;developed for quantum systems as described mathematically by operator algebras.&lt;br/&gt;The broad aim of the proposal is to open up new perspectives on long-term&lt;br/&gt;behavior in quantum dynamics and at the same time to shed new light &lt;br/&gt;on classical dynamical phenomena by means of functional-analytic tools.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
