<AbstractNarration>A big theme in number theory in the last 50 years has been the relationship &lt;br/&gt;between automorphic forms, Galois representations and objects from algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry. There is an extensive web of extraordinary conjectures (for instance &lt;br/&gt;the Artin conjecture, the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Langlands' conjectures, &lt;br/&gt;Serre's conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture) linking these three &lt;br/&gt;seemingly very different subjects (which relate to analysis, algebra and &lt;br/&gt;geometry respectively). Progress on these conjectures is currently very &lt;br/&gt;exciting (particularly recent work of Kisin and Khare-Wintenberger). The PI proposes &lt;br/&gt;(with K. Buzzard and T. Gee) to prove the Artin conjecture for odd, two dimensional &lt;br/&gt;representations of the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers. He &lt;br/&gt;also proposes to investigate generalisations of Ihara's lemma to higher rank &lt;br/&gt;unitary groups. As the PI (with L. Clozel, M. Harris and N. Shepherd-Barron) has &lt;br/&gt;recently shown, this would imply the Sato-Tate conjecture for rational elliptic &lt;br/&gt;curves with multiplicative reduction somewhere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This circle of ideas is the one that led to Andrew Wiles' celebrated proof of &lt;br/&gt;Fermat's last theorem after over 300 years. They fall into the general area of &lt;br/&gt;arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved &lt;br/&gt;extraordinarily fruitful. Among its many consequences are new error correcting &lt;br/&gt;codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and &lt;br/&gt;compact disks.</AbstractNarration>
