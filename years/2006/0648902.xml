    <AbstractNarration>This Small Grant for Exploratory Research to Oglala Lakota College will support preliminary work on a "cohort model" to provide a common experience for pre-engineering students at the tribally controlled college in South Dakota on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The students will move through a series of courses together, including introductory mathematics, chemistry and physics. Most importantly, the students will also work together on application based engineering research projects that will introduce the students to the field of engineering and demonstrate the application and relevancy of engineering to the needs of their community. As the students progress they also will be exposed to the mainstream university and plan their transition to the four year engineering program there. Native American students who have already successfully transferred to the four year engineering school will advise and guide them. Faculty from the four year institution will also serve as mentors to the students so they learn more about the students and their background well before the students enroll in the four year institution.</AbstractNarration>
