<AbstractNarration>An inverted repeat (IR) consists of two copies of homologous DNA separated by a spacer region, with one copy inverted and complemented relative to the other. IRs occur frequently in genomic DNA and can have profound effects on chromosomal function and gene expression.  IRs are a common component of RNA secondary structure, and are known to contribute to RNA interference and micro-RNA formation. A lack of sensitive, comprehensive, and efficient detection programs and databases has hampered the identification, annotation, and the study of IR functions. This project will explore and test new, efficient algorithmic methods for detecting approximate and exact IRs in genomic length sequences and create new data sets on the occurrence and characteristics of IRs in many genomes.  It has three major goals:  1) To develop an Inverted Repeats Finder (IRF) program to detect approximate and exact IRs in long genomic sequences. 2) To develop a web-accessible, user-friendly, Inverted Repeats Database (IRDB) which will contain comprehensive information on IRs occurring in publicly available genomes.  3) To conduct collaborative research studies using IRF.  The first study will examine the occurrence of cruciform structures in the human and other genomes in order to identify IR characteristics that make cruciform extrusion likely.  The second study will examine the relationships, in mitochondrial DNA, among short imperfect repeats, age related deletions, and species life span.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IRF/IRDB software and data sets they produce will directly enhance the broader infrastructure for research in genome biology, genome evolution, chromosome architecture, and comparative genomics.  This project will provide opportunities in research to graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the PI's lab, including participation by members of underrepresented groups, and it will include outreach to high school mathematics and biology teachers through curriculum development in interdisciplinary topics in computational biology and bioinformatics.  As with other resources previously developed by the PI, all computer tools resulting from this project will be freely available to the research community through a high capacity website maintained in the PI's lab.</AbstractNarration>
