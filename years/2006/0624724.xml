<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit - The objective of this project is to characterize the change, stability and growth of STEM interests, goals and behaviors among girls and minority youth, during the ages of 10-17. The central hypothesis is that perceptions, student engagement, sense of belonging, and peer, teacher, and parent supports play a crucial role in girls' and minorities' STEM interests and choices at critical points in their educational and career trajectories. This will be a longitudinal study that will characterize the role of school and person factors in the development of STEM-related interests and choices of girls and minority youth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study has three aims which will determine: 1) how these crucial factors associated with STEM interests and goals develop, change, or remain stable over time for girls (ages 10-17) compared to boys, and for students of varying race/ethnicity and socioeconomic levels, 2) if the hypothesized model predicting STEM interests is supported, and 3) how gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic level moderate associations among model variables. A diverse sample of 900 students, grades 5, 7 and 9, will be followed for three years. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies will be used to test the central hypothesis. Survey instruments, focus groups and interviews will be used each year of the project. The fundamental new knowledge obtained about the development of STEM interests is expected to advance the fields of developmental, vocational, and multicultural psychology, teacher education, education science, and gender and racial equity in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - The project integrates teaching, learning and research by directly involving students in the proposed project. Educational infrastructure will be enhanced by providing research opportunities and training to students in education research. Over time, a broader network of educators, counselors, and education scientists who are prepared to address gender and minority equity issues in STEM may develop. Results and interventions that result from the project will be disseminated widely, through academic, public school and general public venues, as well as through a web site designed for young people and those who work with them.</AbstractNarration>
