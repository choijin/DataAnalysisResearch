<AbstractNarration>Many basic Markov processes evolve on a state space carrying&lt;br/&gt;a related geometric structure. Brownian motion on a Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;manifold,  random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated&lt;br/&gt;groups and  finite Markov chains on &lt;br/&gt;complex combinatorial structures such as trees or matchings&lt;br/&gt;are all primary examples.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the relationships between  &lt;br/&gt;the behavior of such  processes and the properties of&lt;br/&gt;the underlying geometric structure. &lt;br/&gt;It involves problems at the interface between&lt;br/&gt;analysis, geometry and probability with a major role played by&lt;br/&gt;groups and their actions. Potential theory, i.e., the study of &lt;br/&gt;harmonic functions and, more generally, of solutions of the heat equation,&lt;br/&gt;is at the center of many of these considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random processes  play an important role in many aspects of science and&lt;br/&gt;human activity. The study of card shuffling  procedures is an entertaining &lt;br/&gt;yet complex and mathematically interesting example.&lt;br/&gt;Various random processes are used to model complex phenomena,&lt;br/&gt;from polymer molecules, to DNA analysis, to image restoration, &lt;br/&gt;to financial markets. &lt;br/&gt;They are also used as crucial tools for efficient computations. &lt;br/&gt;In such cases, there are strong structural constraints underlying the behavior&lt;br/&gt;of these stochastic processes. These constraints are expressed in terms &lt;br/&gt;of the environment of the process &lt;br/&gt;which often has a complex combinatorial or geometric  nature.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the study of  the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental properties of such stochastic processes&lt;br/&gt;and on how they relate to the global structure of the environment.</AbstractNarration>
