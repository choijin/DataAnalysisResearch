<AbstractNarration>0601723&lt;br/&gt;Kim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to advance the fundamental science and technology for a contactless switch with a power isolation ratio of greater than 100:1 for microwave signals of 5 Watt power level. This switch is capable of hot switching and also is very reliable in hot switching, due to its non-contact mode, which eliminates all material challenges associated with metal-to-metal and metal-to-dielectric contacts. This contactless approach is brand new for microwave switches, and requires significant advancement in the fundamental science and technology for piezoelectric actuation of two-edges clamped bridges. The approach is to use a novel combination of variable capacitors and fixed on-chip inductors, so that a power isolation ratio of 100:1 can be obtained with a capacitance variation of mere 10:1. The high power handling capability is achieved by a clever design of placing one deformable bridge in the middle of two stationary electrodes with air gaps between them, in order to balance the electrostatic forces stemming from the high microwave power passing through the switch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This research will improve the reliability and power-handling capability of microwave switches for channel selection in a wireless transceiver and beam forming/steering through phased antenna array. The potential applications to commercial wireless communication and military tracking/guidance systems are numerous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: As wireless communication becomes ubiquitous, the impact of the proposed switch on society will be immense. The proposed research will also advance the fundamental science and technology that has broad applicability to microwave microsystems, structural engineering and piezoelectric actuation of microstructures, etc.  The PI plans to create a web page that presents valuable knowledge and hands-on insight on RF MEMS switches, piezoelectrically actuated bridges, residual stress control, etc. The educational impacts of the web disseminations will great due to (1) the PIs commitment to make it fruitful for the readers and (2) the unusual opportunities for the readers to obtain valuable, hands-on-knowledge on RF MEMS, and increasingly important field in the ever growing wireless communications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
