<AbstractNarration>The Arctic constitutes a unique and important environment, central to the dynamics and evolution of the Earth system. The region is currently experiencing rapid environmental change. The sources and ultimate consequences of such change are, however, still poorly understood. Research conducted as part of the NSF-ARCSS Arctic Freshwater Integration Study (FWI) program has documented not only the ongoing changes in the arctic hydrological cycle, but also the important role these changes play in global climate dynamics. Recently developed documents on research needs have emphasized the critical function of arctic freshwater processes in ecosystem, social and global systems. The recently released SEARCH Implementation Plan (SEARCH, 2005) describes changes in the freshwater system as one of the most consequential links between the arctic and the earth systems. Two of eleven working groups in the November 2005 International Conference on Arctic Research Planning II (ICARP II) focused almost exclusively on freshwater dynamics as the highest priority for the next decade of arctic research. The work in this proposal will support the goals of SEARCH and contribute to IPY through enhancing our understanding of the changing arctic system on circumpolar scales. The primary function of the efforts described in this proposal is to maintain the Arctic- CHAMP Science Management Office (SMO), expand the SMO portfolio of support activities to include those recently identified by the FWI rank-and-file to realize the FWI Synthesis, and to assist ARCSS in coordinating emerging Arctic-CHAMP science and outreach efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The Arctic-CHAMP synthesis and integration issues are complex and multi-faceted and a dedicated, well-managed, Science Management Office is necessary to provide an efficient mechanism for facilitating maximum collaboration and coordination among project participants and other related research activities. The research and integration activities of the FWI participants is now well established and progressing towards ultimately achieving a valuable synthesis of broad-scale understanding of atmospheric/terrestrial/oceanic connections through the freshwater cycle of the pan- Arctic; however, and as we have found, coordination of synthesis activities is essential to achieve maximum productivity and full-system scale integration. The SMO will specifically:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support the ongoing activities of the Arctic-CHAMP Scientific Steering Committee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalyze synthesis across FWI projects and make FWI synthesis relevant to ARCSS community wide synthesis&lt;br/&gt;Organize Arctic-CHAMP and FWI scientific meetings and symposia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support the timely delivery of CHAMP-related science data products and develop a coordinated&lt;br/&gt;pre-ADCC archive of FWI synthesis data products&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organize and conduct two major FWI synthesis Workshops in 2007 (for FWI investigators) and 2008 (as an IPY-affiliated meeting), including the exercise of the FWI synthesis compendium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conduct liaison activities with other US and international agency partners, with a special focus on IPY and ICARP-II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disseminate findings of Arctic-CHAMP effort, to scientists and broader user communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
