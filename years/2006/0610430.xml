<AbstractNarration>Development of modern technology requires robust, efficient and highly&lt;br/&gt;accurate numerical methods for solving time-dependent partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, including multidimensional systems of hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;conservation laws, balance laws, convection-reaction-diffusion equations&lt;br/&gt;and related problems. A family of simple, universal and high-resolution&lt;br/&gt;finite-volume central schemes has been recently offered as an appealing&lt;br/&gt;alternative to more complicated and problem oriented upwind methods.&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the project is applying the central schemes to various&lt;br/&gt;multi-phase and multi-fluid flow models, the Saint-Venant system of&lt;br/&gt;shallow water equations (which describes flows in rivers and coastal&lt;br/&gt;areas), multi-layer shallow water equations (arising in oceanology),&lt;br/&gt;models of transport of pollutant in shallow water, several chemotaxis&lt;br/&gt;models, reactive flows (in particular, the models describing stiff&lt;br/&gt;detonation waves), shallow water equations on a rotating sphere,&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous elasticity, granular material flows, dusty gas models&lt;br/&gt;(which describe volcanic eruptions), and others. Naturally, these&lt;br/&gt;applications, especially in the cases of high space dimensions, complex&lt;br/&gt;geometries and moving boundaries/interfaces, require development and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of additional numerical techniques such as different&lt;br/&gt;adaption strategies, hybridization with Lagrangian-type methods,&lt;br/&gt;accurate and efficient operator splitting, numerical balancing between&lt;br/&gt;the terms that are balanced in the original system of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations (development of well-balanced schemes), and&lt;br/&gt;others that will be in the focus of the proposed research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central schemes have proved to be a reliable and robust tool for solving&lt;br/&gt;multidimensional systems of partial differential equations that describe&lt;br/&gt;a variety of fundamental conservation laws in fluid mechanics, gas&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, geophysics, meteorology, magnetohydrodynamics, astrophysics,&lt;br/&gt;multi-component flows, granular flows, reactive flows, semiconductors,&lt;br/&gt;non-Newtonian flows, geometric optics, traffic flow, image processing,&lt;br/&gt;financial and biological modeling, differential games, optimal control,&lt;br/&gt;and many other areas. However, the models used in most practical&lt;br/&gt;applications are more complicated than just hyperbolic systems of&lt;br/&gt;conservation laws, and therefore central schemes may only serve as a&lt;br/&gt;basis in designing robust, efficient and highly accurate numerical&lt;br/&gt;methods. This project is aimed at developing a series of supplementary&lt;br/&gt;techniques that are essential for the extension of applicability of&lt;br/&gt;central schemes to many practically important problems, some of them&lt;br/&gt;are currently out of reach because the existing numerical methods are&lt;br/&gt;either too inefficient/inaccurate or not applicable at all.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
