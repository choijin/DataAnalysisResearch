<AbstractNarration>This project continues and expands the current related scholarship program (limited to computer science, enginering and mathematics majors)to provide more science educational opportunities for academically talented but financially disadvantaged students, especially students from groups currently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. The project awards up to 30 scholarships per year to deserving students who want to transfer to a four year college or pursue an Associate of Arts degree in STEM fields. The expansion of majors in this project affords students the flexibility to develop different interests within the sciences and technology. The support system is being strengthened and expanded to allow many talented students from financially disadvantaged families who might not otherwise gain access to education the opportunity to successfully pursue career choices in the preceding fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: S-STEM funds are being used to: 1. better prepare the selected students through careful mentoring and tutoring; 2. better assist the selected students in their transfer process by carefully planning and monitoring their educational plans; 3. familiarize the selected students with four year university programs, industries and research through academic trips, open houses, career days, professional meetings and visits to national laboratories; and 4. support all efforts that would aid program students in gaining scholarships, summer internships and employment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: S-STEM funds are increasing the number of students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields at Contra Costa Community College, reducing the financial burden of our STEM students, and giving selected deserving students more time to concentrate on their studies.  The project is providing a long-term benefit to society and the local community by filling jobs in high demand, high wage areas and increasing the successful entry of women and minorities into these fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Answering the national call for increasing the number of underrepresented students in the science, technology, engineering, or mathematics, this grant provided 132 scholarships to financially disadvantaged students at Contra Costa College studying in these critical areas of our economy.  These scholarships have averaged about $6000 when spread over the two to three years of attendance at our community college before transferring to universities in challenging yet rewarding disciplines.  Over the funding period of six years, 72 students transferred to four-year universities with the remainder planning to transfer in the next couple of years.  The ethnic and gender diversity of these students reflect the community around the college and almost all of the students are first-generation college students.   By combining these scholarships with institutional support and other grants, we have created a comprehensive support program for students intending to major in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics .Specifically, we have provided additional academic support, additional transfer support and augmented academic breadth to ensure that the students thrive in their major. Academic support is provided through weekly mentoring, faculty-led science and math workshops and one-on-one tutoring. The transfer process to universities is accomplished through educational planning, faculty and peer advising and traditional counseling. Academic breadth is broadened by communicating to the students how science and technology impacts social and cultural change. We enrich and modify the curriculum to enhance the studentsÆ experience of science and technology through scientifically relevant seminars and discussions twice a month, academic trips to places with science, technology and engineering emphasis, and encouraging participation of science faculty in all activities that will increase their knowledge and abilities in how students can learn how to do science. We have developed linkages with national laboratories, academic and industrial research laboratories and local science businesses that allow the students to do real science and engineering in paid internships early in their college experience.
