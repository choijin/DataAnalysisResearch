<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Hanna Reisler and her students will study the photodissociation of weakly bound and open shell systems, including molecules and radicals with low ionization potentials and hydrogen-bonded, acid-base dimers.  Interactions among electronic states are prevalent in these species, resulting in potential surfaces with changing electronic configurations and reactions with multiple pathways.  Photofragment ion imaging will be exploited to determine the pair-correlated distributions of dissociation products and to better understand the dynamics and mechanisms of photodissociation. Photoelectron imaging of parent excited states and of fragments will characterize the excited electronic states and couplings between states. Reisler will collaborate with Albert Stolow of the National Research Council, Canada to employ time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond coincidence imaging to determine the time evolution of coupled dissociative states. Electronic structure calculations will aid in attaining a comprehensive understanding of reactivity in these systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies promise to improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry as well as the chemistry of hydrogen-bonded species relevant to biology.  The research will be conducted with undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral research associates, in conjunction with a comprehensive mentoring program for women in science and engineering at the University of Southern California. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
