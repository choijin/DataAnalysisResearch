    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to conduct further research on the erosion properties of electrode materials under high-current pulsed operation, and demonstrate extended lifetime for a new pulsed lamp, making it economically practical. With increased lifetime, the new lamp can become the industry standard for UV water treatment and enable a new photolytic paint stripping process. Materials used for pulsed power electrodes were originally formulated for continuous or alternating current at low peak current. In Phase I a tungsten composite fabricated with a specific process eroded at one-sixteenth of the erosion of the standard electrode material. Phase II continues the research on this tungsten composite and its fabrication processes to demonstrate low erosion, with the objective of demonstrating increased lamp life that meets requirements for commercialization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the proposed research will enhance scientific understanding of the erosion of electrode materials under repeated high-current pulsed cycling. New electrode materials will expand the use of pulsed power and provide better alternatives to thoriated tungsten, which is banned in Europe because of its radioactivity. The primary goal is to enable a new commercial pulsed lamp. The lamp will replace mercury lamps, reducing mercury use and exposure of the public. The lamp also will enable commercial photolytic paint removal, replacing chemical and abrasive techniques that are labor intensive, create dust and debris, and generate toxic byproducts. The photolytic process will provide a lower cost and cleaner method of removing lead paint. This will allow abatement to replace "interim measures" currently in vogue, and support national goals to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. The commercial market for the new lamp encompasses all of UV water treatment and a wide range of paint removal applications.</AbstractNarration>
