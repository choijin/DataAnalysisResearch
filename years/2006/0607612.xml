    <AbstractNarration>The dynamical determination of the masses of young stars and brown dwarfs will be&lt;br/&gt;continued through an extensive observational program using a variety of tools and&lt;br/&gt;techniques. The work is motivated by substantial uncertainties in theoretical mass&lt;br/&gt;relations for substellar masses, the lack of empirical calibrations (temperature,&lt;br/&gt;luminosity, etc.) for very low mass/young stars, and uncertainties the distribution of mass&lt;br/&gt;ratios in clusters. The goal is to obtain dynamical masses to within 10% for stars of mass&lt;br/&gt;1 to 0.5 that of the Sun, and to within 20% for those of even less mass. Four specific&lt;br/&gt;projects will be undertaken: 1) The orbits of young visual binaries, including low mass&lt;br/&gt;pre-main sequence stars, will be improved using Keck and Gemini Observatory laserguide&lt;br/&gt;star Adaptive Optics systems and Hubble Space telescope Fine Guidance Sensor&lt;br/&gt;observations. 2) The mass ratio distribution in the Hyades will be explored using the&lt;br/&gt;Infrared Telescope Facility and the Cryogenic Echelle Spectrograph to observe&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopic binaries. 3) Masses of two pre-main sequence stars will be improved by&lt;br/&gt;observing the rotation of circumstellar disks in the 13CO line where the ambient cloud&lt;br/&gt;brightness should be lower (extended emission from the cloud was a source of&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty in previous 12CO measurements). 4) The dynamical masses of brown dwarfs&lt;br/&gt;will be determined from observations of brown dwarf binaries, which will be used to test&lt;br/&gt;theoretical mass-luminosity relations.&lt;br/&gt;This work will directly support the training of graduate students in contemporary&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation and collaborative investigations. Both students in the NSF supported&lt;br/&gt;Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at Stony Brook and Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates will also participate through independent research projects. Results of the&lt;br/&gt;work will be disseminated to the public through an ongoing monthly "Open Nights in&lt;br/&gt;Astronomy" program and talks to local amateur astronomy groups.</AbstractNarration>
