<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  Kokes Awards for the 20th North American Catalysis Society Meeting&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CTS-0638878&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:   Micahel Wong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   Willilam Marsh Rice University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis (rationale for decision):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20th North American Meeting of the Catalysis Society will be held June 17-22, 2007 in Houston, TX. These meetings of the Catalysis Society are held biannually and are recognized as premier events for catalysis researchers in North America and throughout the world for heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, surface science, and reaction engineering.  Symposium topics will include recent advances in:  high throughput catalysis, novel characterization techniques, new catalytic materials and supports, catalytic technology for protection of the environment, homogeneous catalysis, catalyst deactivation, syngas conversion, hydroprocessing, heavy feed conversion, catalysis for chemicals and specialty products, hydrogen and syngas generation from hydrocarbons, acid-base catalysis, fuel cells, and novel reactors.   Keynote speakers will provide overviews in these areas.  The objective of this proposal is to maximize meeting attendance by graduate students by defraying the costs of participation.  With co-funding from other sources, support for about 100-110 students will be provided.  The overall technical impact of the Catalysis Society meetings is high due to the wide interest in current topics in catalysis and reaction engineering that are related to energy sustainability, environmental protection, and alternative or renewable resources for chemicals production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the conference include the exchange of scientific information among the faculty, governmental laboratory scientists, postdoctoral students, and graduate students.  This grant will enable a diverse group of students to attend, including women and minorities from varied geographical locations in the United States.   Student attendance would significantly contribute to their scientific training and communication/presentation skills.  The poster presentations (nearly 400) and informal interactions permit students to gain a much broader perspective of catalysis research.    The career development of these young investigators will be significantly enhanced by participation in the meeting.  This component of the young investigators' educational experience will foster future scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations that benefit the entire US economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
