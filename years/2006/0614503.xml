<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to investigate genes expressed in sperm storage organs (SSOs) in female Drosophila melanogaster. SSOs potentially play an important role in a range of evolutionary phenomena including co-evolution and speciation. Given the prominent role of D. melanogaster as a model for evolutionary and genetic studies, it is surprising that so little is known about the evolution of genes characteristically expressed in SSOs and that little is known about the function of these genes. The investigators will examine the function of a set of these genes defined by molecular evolution data, molecular population genetic data and information suggesting that certain genes play a direct role in sperm storage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequences generated from this project will be deposited in the public database, NCBI/GenBank, in timely manner. A project website will be developed to provide information about the progress of the research and to provide the research community access to all sequence data.  The grant will contribute to educational outcomes in various ways. First, both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research.  Second, the co-PI (Moriyama) will incorporate statistical methods used in the project and the results into her course. Third, the PI (Harshman) will expand the population genetic component of his honors human genetics course and its graduate student counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Molecular population genetic investigation of female sperm storage expressed genes in Drosophila melanogaster. Journal of Evolutionary Biology     The RNAi crosses to suppress specific gene expression, and importantly new control crosses (see major activities above) were repeated for 14 spermatheca genes.  This experimental was replicated for egg production, progeny production and remating incidence.  This research indicates that the effect of suppression of egg expression is to reduce the number of eggs laid and reduce the number of progeny produced.  This result is straight-forward to interpret in terms of diminution of gene expression and consequent reduction of the effect of wild-type gene expression.      Importantly, all of the specific objectives of the grant have been accomplished.  Two evolutionary EST projects (one for each sperm storage organ), one transcriptome project (comparing the spermathecal and seminal receptacle), one molecular population genetic project (comparing an African and North American populations for candidate genes for both sperm storage organs) and tests of gene function using RNAi.
