<AbstractNarration>Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, the 14th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (and associated events, including a workshop on network protocol security) will be held from November 12 to November 15, 2006, in Santa Barbara, California, USA. Support from the National Science Foundation is provided on behalf of graduate students attending institutions in the United States as well as junior faculty members from under-represented groups and those serving minority (EPSCOR) institutions. The award will support approximately twenty awards to graduate students and ten awards for faculty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: ICNP has served as an important forum for exchange of knowledge about network protocols since 1993. ICNP's importance to the field has increased dramatically since its inception. According to CiteSeer, ICNP is now second only to SIGCOMMamong networking conferences, and ranks in the top 11% of all computer science publication venues in terms of impact (http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/impact.html). This impact is a consequence of the consistently high-quality research presented at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The goal of this funding is to widen the audience attending the premiere network protocol conference, and as a result, raise the level of interaction and the potential for new collaboration, new investigations, and higher quality research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
