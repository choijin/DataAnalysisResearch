    <AbstractNarration>The FASEB conference on Transcriptional Regulation During Cell Growth, Differention and Development will be held at Saxtons River, Vermont in August 2006. The intellectual merit of this meeting is that understanding the networks and mechanisms that regulate transcription is necessary to understand the most fundamental processes that govern biological growth, development and diversity. The purpose of this conference is to bring together biochemists and molecular biologists studying fundamental mechanisms of transcription, cell and developmental biologists studying biological processes dependent on transcriptional regulation, and scientists using global approaches to understand networks of interacting genes involved in transcriptional regulation of cell growth and differentiation. In each session junior investigators will be chosen to speak, based on their abstracts. The broader impact of this meeting will be the opportunity for junior investigators to present their research and confer with the leaders in the field. In addition, the exchange of ideas between scientists with different experimental approaches will facilitate interactions and future collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
