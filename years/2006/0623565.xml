<AbstractNarration>0623565&lt;br/&gt;Berger  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an IRES award that supports research experiences in India for graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The opportunity for MIT students to undertake research at Indian centers-of-excellence is a relatively new component of MIT's international program in India.  Formerly, support had been limited to internships in industry and teaching.  Funding from NSF's Office of International Science &amp; Engineering for a three year period will enable sixteen MIT graduate students to undertake research internships at eight of India's premier centers of research and higher education.  The program is designed to integrate them into groundbreaking research at some of India's top institutions, allow them to explore careers in research, as well as provide the opportunity to gain international research experience early on in their careers.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MIT-India Program Director has an extensive network of contacts with academics at many of the best research institutions in India.  These include the Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, the Indian Institute of Science, the Indian Institute of Information Technology, the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, and the National Centre for Biological Sciences.  Contacts with Indian colleagues have lead to the development of internships in leading edge areas of telecommunications, information technology, genomics, and neurobiology.  In addition to providing a unique research experience for MIT graduate students, this award contributes to internationalizing the U.S. workforce, making U.S. students globally competitive, and creating scientific networks of lasting value.  This award is cofunded by EHR's Division of Graduate Education.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
