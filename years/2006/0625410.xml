<AbstractNarration>Philander Smith College, through the HBCU-UP program, plan to improve student recruitment and retention, redesign curriculum in science and mathematics, and strengthen the instructional, training and research infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through partnership with area high school students, the university will implement academic year and summer bridge programs to increase the interest in and awareness of STEM programs at Philander Smithe College, as well as strengthen the science and mathematics preparation of incoming students.  The program will utilize collaborative learning, supplemental instruction, lecture series, and student-to-student mentoring to ensure success of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty will re-design traditional gate-keeper courses in order to increase retention of students.  These courses, College Algebra, College Chemistry and Applied Computer Science, will incorporate changes in instructional strategies, be infused with technology, and will benefit from an enhanced view of the relationship of the course materials with those of other discipline.  Additionally, courses in applied computer science and cross-disciplinary research will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will supplement in-class instruction with increased undergraduate student research and enhancement of the college's technology infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
