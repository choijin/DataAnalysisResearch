<AbstractNarration>Zhou&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0604912&lt;br/&gt;Forest&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0604891&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This collaborative project targets mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;computation for a technologically important class of materials&lt;br/&gt;called polymer nano-composites (PNCs).  The investigators study&lt;br/&gt;two topics: the hydrodynamics of processing, and effective&lt;br/&gt;property characterization (e.g., conductive and mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties).   PNCs consist of ensembles of thin rods or&lt;br/&gt;platelets (millions in a cubic micron, generating football fields&lt;br/&gt;of surface contact with the solvent), whose orientational&lt;br/&gt;distribution and superior properties relative to the matrix have&lt;br/&gt;exhibited huge enhancements of materials properties in test&lt;br/&gt;systems.  However, success in Nature and industry with fibers,&lt;br/&gt;which uniformly align the load bearing or conducting&lt;br/&gt;nano-elements, has not been duplicated for films and molds,&lt;br/&gt;thereby dramatically limiting the range of applications.  The&lt;br/&gt;difficulties are widely documented in benchmark experiments: &lt;br/&gt;shear dominated, confined steady processing yields complex&lt;br/&gt;dynamics and heterogeneity in the rod or platelet ensemble. &lt;br/&gt;Resultant film properties are highly anisotropic, non-uniform,&lt;br/&gt;and sensitive to nano-particle geometry, volume fraction, and&lt;br/&gt;processing conditions.  Theory, models, analysis, and numerical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms are undertaken to explain these phenomena, to explore&lt;br/&gt;the most perplexing observations, to map out parameter domains of&lt;br/&gt;robust film flows, and to characterize the conductivity and&lt;br/&gt;mechanical effective property tensors.   The key object across&lt;br/&gt;all projects is the orientational probability distribution&lt;br/&gt;function (PDF) of the nano-particle ensemble.  The PDF is&lt;br/&gt;described by the Doi kinetic theory and its extension to&lt;br/&gt;viscoelastic solvents, which the investigators and their&lt;br/&gt;collaborators merge into homogenized averaging and&lt;br/&gt;percolation-dominated effective property characterization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The promises of nano-composite materials are profound. &lt;br/&gt;Nano-scale "designer" molecules are added at very low percentages&lt;br/&gt;to traditional materials, with the result of huge gains in&lt;br/&gt;performance properties of the composite relative to the original&lt;br/&gt;material.  The nano-elements are much stronger, conduct&lt;br/&gt;electricity or heat significantly better, or are impermeable to&lt;br/&gt;gases and liquids that contaminate traditional materials.  There&lt;br/&gt;is an engineering price, however, in that the smart engineering&lt;br/&gt;models and numerical codes that perform effectively for&lt;br/&gt;traditional composites simply do not apply to nano-composites. &lt;br/&gt;There are millions of nano-particles per cubic micron, with&lt;br/&gt;football fields of new surface area per raindrop of volume. &lt;br/&gt;Thus, nano-composite flows cannot be simulated with existing&lt;br/&gt;simulation tools.  The principal investigators are designing new&lt;br/&gt;numerical simulation tools, based on new theoretical models,&lt;br/&gt;which extend the traditional flow processing models and codes by&lt;br/&gt;addition of new physics specific to nano-composites.  The&lt;br/&gt;predictions are tested in conjunction with nano-engineering&lt;br/&gt;experimentalists.  The goal of this effort is a platform for&lt;br/&gt;design and control of nano-composite materials, with the ability&lt;br/&gt;to steer the processing phase to achieve targeted property&lt;br/&gt;specifications.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
