<AbstractNarration>This award will enable researchers to pursue a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach to improving the understanding of the interactions between climate variability and climatic mean state over the past 50,000 years. Specifically, the researchers will compile a global array of existing data, acquire high-resolution records that focus on climate variability across the western Americas and eastern Pacific Ocean, place these data on a common timescale to quantify age uncertainties, use traditional and newly developed time series analysis tools to quantify the nature of climate change and variability in the region, and integrate numerical models and data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research team will pursue the following science questions: 1) How does the mean state of the climate system influence climate variability? 2) What is the feedback of climate variability on the long-term mean climate state? 3) Does variability change as a threshold in the climate system is approached? and 4) What is the sensitivity and response of terrestrial and marine systems to changes in mean climate and climate variability?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research strategy allows for assessing the ability of climate models to simulate changes in climatic variability and providing guidance for future experimental designs in terms of direct implications on predictions of future climate variability. Process modeling will help address a myriad of questions relevant to climate science, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and water resources management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will directly support the next generation of paleoclimate scientists by supporting several graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, emphasizing cross-training in data acquisition, data analysis, and modeling, and ensuring that science results are disseminated to the broader public through an interactive website and active public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study includes a strong element of interagency cooperation between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) thorough the active involvement of USGS researchers with academic colleagues. The USGS commitment of personnel and computing resources will be leveraged with the NSF commitment to the academic researchers and their institutions in a cost-effective partnership to help the project achieve its science goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report for"Collaborative Research: Project PALEOVAR -- Past Climate Variability:  Understanding Mechanisms and Interactions with the Mean State" (with an emphasis on the contributions from the University of Minnesota)       PALEOVAR is a project that was carried out by scientists from three institutions:  Oregon State University, the University of Oregon, and the University of Minnesota.  The part of the project carried out by the University of Minnesota scientists is now (as of May 31, 2011) complete and is emphasized in this report.  The part of the project carried out by scientists from the other institutions will be complete a year from now, and will be reported at that time.       The main goal of PALEOVAR was to study changes in the earth's climate over the past 50,000 years.  Broadly speaking, for the first 40,000 years of this period, the earth was in the grips of the last ice age (the last glacial period), a time when glaciers covered a good portion of northern North America and northern Eurasia. The ice age ended about 10,000 years ago, marking the beginning of the current interglacial period.  We chose this 50,000-year period because we could study climate change during the last glacial period, during the transition from the last glacial period to the current interglacial period, and during the present interglacial period.          Our strategy for studying these 50,000 years of climate change included a number of steps. First, instrumental records cover only the latest century or so. Therefore, we obtained climate records by analyzing ocean sediments, ice cores (from Antarctica), and cave deposits.  We then analyzed the data and designed climate models.  Finally, we compared the results from the climate models with the records of climate change to help us to understand the causes of the climate changes.        Within the larger project, the University of Minnesota scientists focused on obtaining climate records from cave deposits and analyzing these records. Whenever one obtains climate records from natural deposits, one of the great challenges is the dating of the deposits.  Such records are of limited use if ages of each layer are not known.  One of the great advantages of cave deposits is the fact that they can be dated very well by analyzing extremely low levels of uranium and thorium naturally present in the deposits. The modern version of the so-called uranium-thorium dating method was developed by Larry Edwards, who was the principal investigator on the University of Minnesota portion of PALEOVAR. Using this method, the Minnesota scientists (along with their scientific collaborators at the Oregon institutions) were able to obtain precisely dated climate records from a number of caves along the west coast of North America.            Among our findings, two stand out as being of general interest.  For more than half a century, there has been an ongoing debate about the causes of the succession of ice ages that have taken place over the last 2 million or so years of earth history. In recent decades, significant evidence has come down in favor of an idea, the modern version of which was proposed by Milutin Milankovitch.  Milankovitch suggested that changes in the intensity of the earth's seasons, caused by changes in the earth's orbital geometry, cause the ice age cycles.  However, standing in opposition to this idea is a remarkable record of climate change from Devils Hole Nevada, which exhibits changes in climate that cannot easily be explained by Milankovitch's idea.  As part of this project, we tried to reproduce a small but important portion of the Devils Hole record by analyzing samples from a nearby cave.  Our record did not agree with the corresponding portion of the Devils Hole record, suggesting an artifact in one of the records or an invalid interpretation in one of the records.  While not completely definitive, this finding demonstrates that further detailed study in this region is ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
