<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  This research seeks to obtain high-spatial resolution, high-precision isotopic data to address fundamental questions on the generation of mid-ocean ridge basalts.  Two competing hypotheses for the generation of ocean crust will be tested on the basis that the two models predict different distributions of low-degree melts along the ridge.  Because basalt chemistry is strongly dependent on the degree of melting this project looks at trace elements and key indicator isotopes such as Hafnium, Neodymium, Lead, and Strontium to determine which model is correct.  The case study from which samples have already been obtained is the East Pacific Rise between 6oN and 19oN. Results will be compared to data from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  Chemical analyses will be made using the new ICPMS that was recently installed at Florida State University.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project will support a graduate student and undergraduates.  It also provides core support for a multi-user laser ICPMS facility which has a focus on training students.  High school teachers will also be exposed to this research through an ongoing summer program to expose them and their students to scientific discovery. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
