<AbstractNarration>0644646&lt;br/&gt;Han  &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to develop a biomechanical model for artery buckling, and to determine the roles of mechanical factors in artery buckling, kinking and twisting. Artery buckling creates significant vascular problems. The educational objective is to integrate the proposed research into the education of undergraduate and graduate students, with a special emphasis on recruiting Hispanic students.  The project is a combination of experimental and theoretical work. In the long term, the project can have a significant impact on the study, treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases, with possible applications to other biological tubular systems (e.g. veins, ureters).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
