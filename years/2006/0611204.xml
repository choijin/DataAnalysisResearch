<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aimes to design and build a digitally-controlled vapor generator that will enable field calibration of vapor trace detectors for explosives.  The technology risk-elements concern precisely delivering, under digital control, a dilute explosive mixture to a heated surface, converting it to a vapor and then delivering the vapor plume to a trace explosive detector to be tested or calibrated. Other technology issues relate to vapor generator precision, repeatability, and instrument reliability.  Engineering issues concern the design and fabrication of a handheld prototype based upon a disposable cartridge approach. The handheld vaporjet calibration instrument will include standard test protocols with a user-friendly computer interface. It is anticipated that, during Phase I, the handheld unit will be tested and characterized with existing trace detector systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are tens of thousands of vapor trace detector systems deployed in the field today. They are operated by military personnel in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere; they are operated by government agents in airports, sub-way system, ports, embassies, consulates and public facilities across the globe; they are operated by private industry to protect their customers, employees and facilities. All these systems must be calibrated and verified on a regular basis. This need requires standard testing protocols for trace and stand-off detection methods and vapor sampling calibration methods.  Sales will come from the calibration of detectors in the field, on manufacturing lines, and sales to R&amp;D institutions for sensor development. Ultimately, real-time vaporjet calibration units could be designed into next generation sensor systems to insure consistent accuracy. Societal benefits include improved trace detection of explosives and other chemical threats.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
