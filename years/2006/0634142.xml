<AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergradute Education (NUE) program entitled, "NUE: Understanding Optical Nanomaterials-Research-Based Experiments in Upper Division Undergraduate Physics Courses," at the College of Charleston, under the direction of Dr. Narayanan Kuthirummal will develop advanced research based experiments on nanomaterials and optical as well as electron microscopic characterization techniques, develop a manual describing the procedures, and prepare students for careers in nanomaterials/photonics industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The impact of nanotechnology in modern science and technology is overwhelming.  The proposed research-based advanced experiments will be designed to prepare College of Charleston students for graduate studies or for successful careers in the nation's scientific and technological infrastructure in nanomaterials by incorporating nanotechnology education and training in the undergraduate curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed project will directly benefit courses such as Experimental physics, Research, Senior Research, Physical Optics, Photonics, Solid State Physics, and Bachelor's essay.  The proposed program will also contribute to increasing the talent pool of students in general and women students specfically and will pave the way for collaboration within the College and with other research/educational institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) Program Solicitation (NSF 06-538), and is being funded by the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE).</AbstractNarration>
