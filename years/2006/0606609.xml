<AbstractNarration>    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer Research Conference in Statistics, 2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) together with the American Statistical Association is organizing a Summer Research Conference (SRC) in Statistics be held June 4-7, 2006, in Kerrville, Texas. The conference objective is to bring together statistics researchers of all academic levels in a relaxed and stimulating atmosphere.  The program chairs for the 2006 Summer Research Conference (SRC) on Statistics are Dr. Jack Tubbs, Department of Statistical Science, Baylor University, and Dr. Jiayang Sun, Department of Statistics, Case Western Reserve University. The session topics include; Bayesian Methods in Pharmaceuticals, Adaptive Clinical Designs, Multiple Tests of Hypotheses, Bioinformatics, Data Confidentiality and Security, and Text and Data Mining. The principal Senior speakers include; Stacy Lindborg, Eli Lilly, Andre Rogatko, Emory University, Don Berry, M D Anderson, Jeff Hart, Texas A&amp;M, Rudy Guerra, Rice University,  Simon Sheather, Texas A&amp;M, Alan Karr, NISS/SAMSI, and Ed Wegman, George Mason University.  A poster session is open for graduate students and other attendees to present their research. The sessions of the conference are not concurrent. &lt;br/&gt;The research topic areas are broad, with applications of the methodologies in a spectrum of fields (such as medicine, homeland security, business, etc.) The individual 90-minutes sessions, featuring a senior speaker and two junior speakers, are structured to provide in-depth coverage of the topic, from an overview by the senior speaker to specific, current research problems of the junior researchers. Advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior researchers are encouraged to attend and present in the judged poster session. Support to offset travel expenses for students and junior researchers by NSF is gratefully acknowledged.
