<AbstractNarration>Recent years have seen  breakthroughs on many long-standing problems in the  theory of minimal surfaces, with important contributions from many mathematicians.  A minimal surface is a natural generalization of geodesics.  It is a surface that locally minimize area.  The lamination theorem, the one-sided curvature estimate, the resolution of the Calabi-Yau conjectures for embedded surfaces, and the structure results for fixed genus surfaces (all joint work of the PI and Bill Minicozzi) have played a key role in recent breakthroughs and have been used by many people.The PI proposes, jointly with Bill Minicozzi,  to continue our investigations on minimal surfaces and related areas of geometric analysis, including geometric evolution equations such as the mean curvature and Ricci flow, and on function theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also propose a joint project with Bruce Kleiner about mean curvature flow of mean convex sets and a joint project with Nancy Hingston about Morse index bounds of geodesics.  Finally, we propose a project with Camillo De Lellis about Min-Max constructions and applications and a joint project with Camillo De Lellis and Bill Minicozzi on generic metrics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major themes of this proposal was about minimial surfaces and another was about geometric flows and in particular about mean curvature flows.  Minimal surfaces are the mathematical models for soap films whereas the mean curvature flow is the negative gradient flow of volume, so any hypersurface flows through hypersurfaces in the direction of steepest descent for volume and eventually becomes extinct in finite time.  Before it becomes extinct, topological changes can occur as it goes through singularities.  Thus, in some sense, the topology is encoded in the singularities.   One of the things that was proven in this proposal was that if one begin at a generic hypersurface then under the mean curvature flow one only see the nicest possible singularities - shrinker spheres and shrinking cylinders.  We proved that in Euclidean three space the space of all singularities not necesarily generic ones form a smooth space and we took some of the initial steps towards understanding the dynamical nature of the flow.  Mean curvature flow has its origin in material science and has found a wide variety of applications in many different areas of science and the key is always understanding the sigularities.  We also did work on Ricci flow and on Einstein metrics in this proposal.   For Einstein metrics which are the basic object of study in general relativity we showed that the regular set is convex.  Meaning that any minimizing geodesic joing regular points lies entirely within the regular set.            Last Modified: 09/26/2011       Submitted by: Tobias Colding]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
