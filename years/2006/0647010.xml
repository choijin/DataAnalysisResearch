<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0101050&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Fengbo Hang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the impact of topology on some&lt;br/&gt;variational problems for maps between manifolds and investigate&lt;br/&gt;some conformal invariant differential equations. Sobolev spaces&lt;br/&gt;of weakly differentiable maps appear naturally in the solution of&lt;br/&gt;variational or differential equations problems, but the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental theorems on Sobolev spaces of maps between regions in&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean spaces are not necessarily reproduced for maps between&lt;br/&gt;manifolds.  Topology in the domain and range of a mapping space&lt;br/&gt;can prevent approximation of an arbitrary Sobolev map by smooth&lt;br/&gt;maps and can force singularities to appear in solutions to&lt;br/&gt;variational problems.  The principal investigator's work aims to&lt;br/&gt;understand the analytical description of some of these&lt;br/&gt;topologically forced singularities.  Some particular topics&lt;br/&gt;include the rectifiability of defect measure of a general Sobolev&lt;br/&gt;map, Ginzburg-Landau type approximation for maps which are not&lt;br/&gt;weak limits of smooth maps, gap phenomena, extension of maps with&lt;br/&gt;energy control, travelling waves in planar antiferromagnets, and&lt;br/&gt;singularities of minimizing p-harmonic maps.  Tools include&lt;br/&gt;geometric measure theory, analytical techniques for simplified&lt;br/&gt;Ginzburg-Landau models, differential topology, and homotopy&lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physical problems often admit formulations that seek to minimize&lt;br/&gt;energy or some energy-like quantity over a large family of&lt;br/&gt;allowable configurations.  For example, the path of a beam of&lt;br/&gt;light follows the shortest route between two points, minimizing&lt;br/&gt;time and distance.  An important mathematical device for solving&lt;br/&gt;such "variational problems" is sometimes called the direct&lt;br/&gt;method: a sequence of realizable configurations that drive energy&lt;br/&gt;down toward a lowest possible value is used to construct a&lt;br/&gt;genuine minimizer, usually by picking out a subsequence that&lt;br/&gt;converges.  To make this process work mathematicians tend to work&lt;br/&gt;in enriched environments such as the Sobolev spaces cited above.&lt;br/&gt;These make convergence easier to establish, and then one has to&lt;br/&gt;show that the candidate minimizer is actually present in the&lt;br/&gt;original setting.  It is a relatively recent discovery that this&lt;br/&gt;procedure sometimes fails if the domain and range of the maps&lt;br/&gt;being studied has a bit of topological complexity, and the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator's projects seek to analyze the nature of&lt;br/&gt;these occasional failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
