    <AbstractNarration>The 8th International Conference on Southern Hemisphere (SH) Meteorology and Oceanography will be held 24-28 April 2006 in Foz do Iguacu, Brazil. The meeting is organized around the broad theme "Understanding and Predicting Climate and Water Resources, their Variability and Change in the Southern Hemisphere. These meetings have been successful in promoting understanding of atmospheric and oceanic processes particular to SH and their linkages to the Tropics and the Northern Hemisphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention will be given to:&lt;br/&gt;a) Monsoon systems and continental rainfall; fundamental processes; climatological, ecological biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of the Monsoon regions;&lt;br/&gt;b) Role of the SH oceans in climate. Climate- ecosystem- biogeochemistry interactions in the oceans of the SH;&lt;br/&gt;c) Addressing gaps in SH observing systems;&lt;br/&gt;d) Climate and weather forecasts: The challenge of seasonal, interannual, and interdecadal predictions in the SH;&lt;br/&gt;e) Understanding long-term climate variations in the SH;&lt;br/&gt;f) Hydrological variability and modeling;&lt;br/&gt;g) Climatic and ecological impacts of land cover and land use changes;&lt;br/&gt;h) Climate and cryosphere of the Antarctic region;&lt;br/&gt;i) Climate change in the SH;&lt;br/&gt;j) Inter-ocean exchanges in the SH;&lt;br/&gt;k) Human influences on climate;&lt;br/&gt;l) Atmospheric chemistry in the SH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: With the advances in communication, the economic and social impacts of weather and climate information are global and the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the scientific community are concerned with the social impacts and applications of weather and climate information. It is recognized that a global perspective is required for understanding regional variability, but each region has its unique geographical perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: An international conference facilitates a fluid dialogue between scientists and users of weather and climate information. That is a crucial ingredient to advance global research in the atmospheric sciences and to promote the beneficial application of this research to the needs of society. The funds will support 7-10 students to attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>
