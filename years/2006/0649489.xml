<AbstractNarration>This project will examine how energetic particle precipitation affects the electrical conductivity and fields in the upper and middle atmosphere.  It will examine how solar energetic protons access the middle atmosphere and will utilize the gamma rays emitted by the incoming protons to determine the energy spectrum of the incoming particles.  It will also investigate the mechanisms which accelerate, transport, and precipitate relativistic electrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will analyze data from two balloon data sets that contain multiple episodes of energetic particle precipitation.  Models will be constructed to describe the effects these energetic particles produce in the upper and middle atmosphere.  Model results will be compared with measured middle atmosphere radiation, conductivity, and electric fields.  To determine the mechanisms which accelerate, transport and precipitate relativistic electrons the balloon observations will be combined with ground and spacecraft observations to test wave-particle interaction theories for precipitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from the project will improve our ability to predict energetic precipitation events that can affect a variety of satellites and can alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere.  The project is a collaborative one involving faculty and students at Dartmouth College, the University of Washington and the University of Houston.</AbstractNarration>
