<AbstractNarration>This Partnerhships for Innovation (PFI) project seeks to create entrepreneurial activities around a well established research program in Brain Machine Interfaces at the University of Florida.  Neural interfaces have the potential to revolutionize the present interface with computers and man-made appliances, as well as play a crucial role in rehabilitation medicine.  Due to the novelty of this field, it is timely to invest now in entrepreneurial and innovative activities, because they provide the opportunity to leverage the innovations and intellectual property, mobilize investors, and develop lines of products that will guarantee self-sufficiency for the Center of Innovative Brain Machine Interfaces.  Project collaborators within the university are the College of Engineering, McKnight Brain Institute (UFMBI), and Shands and VA Medical Centers.  The College of Engineering has extensive experience in entrepreneurial and technology transfer programs and has created a successful undergraduate student training program designed around the concept of "virtual start-up" companies.  Capitalizing on these two experiences, the Partnerships project proposes to restructure the ongoing research in Brain Machine Interfaces around technology test beds.  The goal of this restructuring is translation of the research mission into core technologies and competencies with a wrapper of immersive, experimental entrepreneurship education for the graduate students that are engaged in the research.  Specifically, six high-technology test beds (multi electrode arrays, ultra low power bio amplifiers, wireless delivery of data/power, portable DSP systems and algorithms, brain computer interfaces) will be created.  Technology advances in neural interfaces will be accelerated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact will be felt at several levels: 1) this is a new educational experience since graduate students will be engaged in entrepreneurial activities while at the university; 2) a more transparent way of implementing technology transfer between universities and industry that can be widely applied is being prototyped; 3) the creation of a high tech industry in the state of Florida is being seeded; and 4) an underrepresented institution and minority students are being involved in hands-on courses that teach the technology components of an emerging industry.  A plan has been outlined to make the center financially self-sufficient after the end of NSF support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners: Partners include University of Florida (Lead Institution); Florida International University in Miami, FL, a designated minority institution, where one of the test beds will reside; four Companies, which have joined the Industrial Board (Advanced Neuromodulation Systems (ANS), Convergent Engineering, Tucker-Davis Technologies, and Motorola Labs); Sid Martin Development Incubator; City of Gainesville Department of Economic Development; Gainesville Chamber of Commerce; Technology Enterprise Center of Gainesville, Alachua County; Inflexion Partners(Venture Capitalists); and Saliwanchik, Lloyd &amp; Saliwanchik (law firm). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
