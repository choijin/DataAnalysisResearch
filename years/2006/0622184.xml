<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to address the fundamental problems preventing commercialization of the silicon carbide high-power and high-frequency bipolar junction transistor. The approach utilizes a novel low-temperature selective epitaxial growth process (LTSEG). LTSEG offers an opportunity to eliminate the problematic ion implantation and plasma etching processes in device fabrication sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The low-temperature growth technique discovered at Mississippi State University enables selective epitaxy and self-aligned device fabrication that had been previously impossible for silicon carbide. The new device technology is capable of eliminating the most detrimental problem of SiC transistor - recombination-enhanced stacking fault generation causing gain degradation. Record-high p-type doping efficiency and elimination of the implantation damage will drastically improve the peripheral base resistance and emitter injection efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silicon carbide bipolar transistor is eagerly anticipated as a power switch for military and space applications. In addition, the proposed research can facilitate the attempted replacement of Si electronics with silicon carbide in hybrid electric vehicles, which is pushed by the US automotive industry as a strategy for reducing dependence on the foreign oil supply. Aggressive R&amp;D conducted abroad threatens the leadership of the US in silicon carbide field. The proposed development brings strong competitive advantage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The research is uniquely positioned to contribute to the industrial growth in Mississippi by offering new opportunities for collaboration between the university and a local small business spin-off dedicated to commercialization of SiC technologies. It will be an excellent tool for attracting new students into the graduate programs and creating local employment opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Silicon carbide (SiC) power-switching and radio-frequency semiconductor devices reached the stage of aggressive commercialization. Of all SiC devices, bipolar junction transistor (BJT) has the most far-reaching expectations with respect to many advantages of its material and device technology. Simultaneously, SiC BJT is far ahead of other SiC devices in terms of unfulfilled promises and frustrations experienced by device and process engineers. The problems involve challenging fundamental issues of SiC materials science.  The goal of the project was to explore novel ways of addressing one of the fundamental problems preventing commercialization of silicon carbide bipolar junction transistor &ndash; recombination-induced stacking fault generation in the BJT base leading to degradation of minority carrier lifetime and transistor gain. The investigated approach was based on a novel fabrication process that utilizes low-temperature selective epitaxial growth (LTSEG) replacing ion implantation when fabricating critical regions of the SiC transistor.  There were six significant outcomes from this project:  1)      The possibility of growing SiC at temperature significantly lower than the regular growth temperatures was explored and the viability of the technique has been demonstrated;  2)      Prototypes of SiC devices fabricated using the low-temperature epitaxial growth technique were demonstrated;  3)      The development of the selective growth technique was advanced to the level enabling fabrication of a number of useful device regions;  4)      Advantages and disadvantages of different masking materials as commercially-feasible mask-candidates for LTSEG were evaluated;  5)      Promising ways of conducting self-aligned fabrication compatible with LTSEG were identified;  6)      BJT design issues benefiting from the fabrication of the critical device regions by the BJT technique were investigated by computer modeling and device fabrication.
