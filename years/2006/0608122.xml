<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Robert A. Walker of the University of Maryland, College Park,  and his undergraduate and graduate research students will continue their work studying solvent structure at liquid interfaces.  They will do this through the interrogation of probe species and solvent molecules situated at the interface,; this will be done  with second harmonic generation and vibrational sum frequency spectroscopies.  Many questions remain about the structure of liquids at interfaces, and Prof. Walker and his research team are striving to develop molecular-level pictures of how liquids behave at liquid/liquid, liquid/solid, and liquid/vapor interfaces.  Given the ubiquity of these kinds of interfaces in nature, the results of this research are expected to have broad applicability across a number of disciplines and technology applications.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Besides the broader scientific and technological impacts of the research being supported, Prof. Walker continues mentoring young scientists, and works on a number of projects to bring aspects of modern chemistry to a broader audience, through programs, like the Rollinson Fellowship Programfor undergraduate research, and the "Seeing is Believing" program in undergraduate curriculum development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
