    <AbstractNarration>This project's goal is to reach the underserved Hispanic audience with science radio programs using both broadcast and the internet. The deliverables include 200 ninety-second Earth and Sky programs in Spanish for broadcast on both commercial and public radio stations. The goal is to get distribution on 200 stations by 2008. In addition to the 90-second broadcast programs, the project will produce longer programs (8-15 min.) with interviews with Hispanic scientists, teachers and writers who will serve as role models for Hispanic young people. These short and longer form programs will be on the cieloytierra.org web site along with Spanish language science blogs, daily sky charts in Spanish and links to other relevant Spanish and scientific web sites. The project will use "eblasts" to inform users about the site and help in the creation of an online community of Hispanics interested in science. Project partners include The Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists and the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science.</AbstractNarration>
