<AbstractNarration>Non-technical: &lt;br/&gt;The project is aimed to investigate the role of electrostatic forces in the assembly of biological materials such as proteins, DNA condensation inside sperm heads, and formation of arterial plaque. The proposed research is strongly motivated by the richness of materials found in nature often displaying superior mechanical properties and functionalities. Under this project, biological molecules (peptides and proteins) will be combined with synthetic macromolecules (specific electrolytes and copolymers) to create novel functional hybrid materials with superior properties and performance. The results of this work impact the basic understanding of biological self-assembly processes and contribute to applications in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Our project is highly interdisciplinary and will train students and postdoctoral researchers in the increasingly complex interdisciplinary work in science, engineering and medicine. Our team members will acquire skills in state-of-the art microscopy, synchrotron X-ray scattering at national laboratories, and biochemical methods to prepare them for careers in academia, government and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate electrostatically self-assembled materials. In particular, we will focus on complexes of charged objects (membranes, cylinders and spheres) with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PE) or tri-block copolymers (PE-neutral-PE). With this strategy, we expect to create functional hybrid materials from building blocks that are taken from biology (peptides and proteins) and synthetic polymer chemistry. By systematically varying the interaction strength and range between building blocks we will identify conditions for long-range order. The results of this work will not only impact the basic understanding of biological self-assembly processes, but also through extension to material science contribute to applications of self-assembled nanostructured materials in drug delivery, tissue engineering, bioseparation processes, biosensor materials, novel filter materials, as well as fuel cells. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will produce students and postdoctoral researchers that have a rigorous science background, are independent thinkers, and have an understanding of intellectual property and real world applications; all those aspects being highly valued by industry as well as academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
