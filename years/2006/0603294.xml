    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0603294&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Frederic Mynard and Francis Jordan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2006 Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications will&lt;br/&gt;be held July 6-9, 2006, at Georgia Southern University in&lt;br/&gt;Statesboro, GA. This conference is the twenty-first in a series&lt;br/&gt;that began at City College of New York in 1984 and has been held&lt;br/&gt;every year, except 1986, at locations in the United States and&lt;br/&gt;abroad. There will be seven invited plenary speakers, all of&lt;br/&gt;which are international leaders in their fields. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;two workshops will be conducted on "Physics and Domain Theory"&lt;br/&gt;and "Selection principles in topology", each of which will meet&lt;br/&gt;three times. These workshops will provide opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;researchers and students to obtain an up-to-date overview of&lt;br/&gt;specific and particularly active areas of research. Finally, six&lt;br/&gt;special sessions are planned, each of which will be organized by&lt;br/&gt;a group of three leading researchers in the corresponding field&lt;br/&gt;and feature one semi-plenary speaker and more than twenty other&lt;br/&gt;speakers. The special sessions are: Set-theory and Topology,&lt;br/&gt;Topological Groups and Semi-groups, Asymmetric Topology, Topology&lt;br/&gt;in Dynamical Systems, Fractals and Tilings, and Categorical&lt;br/&gt;Topology. The areas of expertise of the plenary speakers reflect&lt;br/&gt;the diversity of themes of the special sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more than twenty years, this series of conferences has been&lt;br/&gt;one of the main forums for researchers in topology and related&lt;br/&gt;fields. Topology is an area of pure mathematics that interacts&lt;br/&gt;with virtually every other branch of mathematics in addition to&lt;br/&gt;many other scientific fields. Applications of topology in other&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics, physics, and computer science have long&lt;br/&gt;been a focus of this series of conferences. The 2006 conference&lt;br/&gt;will continue this tradition, as reflected by the variety of&lt;br/&gt;workshops and special sessions proposed. This conference usually&lt;br/&gt;brings together over 125 researchers and graduate students from&lt;br/&gt;across the United States and more than 25 other countries. The&lt;br/&gt;goals of this conference are to present participants with the&lt;br/&gt;leading experts and latest research in topology and related&lt;br/&gt;fields; foster collaborations and interactions between&lt;br/&gt;researchers in topology and related fields; provide the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for graduate students and underrepresented groups to&lt;br/&gt;be exposed to the latest research in topology-related fields and&lt;br/&gt;to interact with leading researchers in these areas. The wide&lt;br/&gt;range of special sessions and the types of workshops proposed&lt;br/&gt;will provide the ideal environment for new interactions and&lt;br/&gt;collaborations between researchers and students in different&lt;br/&gt;fields related to topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see the conference Web site,&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.georgiasouthern.edu/faculty/mynard_f/STC06.htm.</AbstractNarration>
