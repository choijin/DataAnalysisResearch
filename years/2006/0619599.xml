<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will acquire a state-of-the-art Reinshaw structural and chemical analyzer (SCA) coupled with a Hitachi S4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The combined instruments will enable new advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The major advantage of combining the SCA analyzer with the FESEM includes the unique ability to obtain critical information on morphological, physical, chemical and electronic structure, all from the same region of the sample at a high-spatial resolution.  The SCA combines advantages of light microscopy-based Raman, photoluminescence (PL), and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy with their high sensitivity to light elements with the high resolution imaging (to 1.0nm) of the FESEM and elemental analysis capabilities of EDS. The instrument will be utilized in advancing the following research activities: (1) Growth of Carbon Nanotubes for Flat-Panel Displays and for Microwave Applications; (2) Studies of Quantum Dot Formation in a Transparent Conductive Matrix; (3) Identification of Uranium-Containing Minerals in Soils from the Navajo Reservation; (4) Characterization of New Photonic and Molecular Electronic Materials; and (5) Characterization of Minerals Analyzed for U-Th-Pb Geochronology. The system will serve interdisciplinary research and education through the existing Electron Microscopy Center, and will increase collaboration between University researchers and industry. We have major involvements in minority programs and have contributed significantly to interactions with students of all ages through the REU, RET, GK-12, IGERT, MPS Public Science Education program, and with the University Science Center and the AZ State Museum, located on campus. We will use campus visits and the Internet to bring the excitement of materials research to instructors and students of minority-serving institutions, to Native Americans, and to science museums. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lay Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is a basic tool in materials characterization laboratories, allowing researchers and engineers to study a material's microstructure and composition to relate it to the material's properties and processing techniques. Recent innovations in optical spectrometers have made it possible to combine the resolution and versatility of the SEM with conventional light spectroscopy techniques. The resulting combination of SEM and optical spectrometer (Renishaw) is capable of analyzing nanoscale structures for morphological, physical, chemical and electronic properties at a scale and thoroughness not possible before. This ability is critical to the advancement of a diverse range of research projects at the University of Arizona. Specific projects include the study and fabrication of carbon nanotubes for use in the electronics industry, a major initiative on the Navajo reservation to mitigate groundwater contamination, fabrication of materials used in nanoscale electronic and photonic devices, a novel use for luminescent quantum-dots, and improved radioisotope dating techniques. Several of these projects will greatly enhance the University's ties to local industry. The instrument will be part of the existing Electron Microscopy Center, which serves the entire University with a full training, education, and outreach program. The facility has an outstanding track record of working with students of all ages and levels of education, minorities including Native Americans, and local K12 science teachers, as well as a close association with the University Science Center and the Arizona State Museum. The instrument will be linked via the internet to schools and science museums, as well as being available for our many on-campus functions and activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
