<AbstractNarration>One of the major advances in evolutionary biology in recent years is the recognition that the origins of the incredible diversity of life on earth lie largely in the interactions organisms have with each other.  Yet, we know remarkably little about what might be described as "the ecology of diversification". This project seeks to understand the process of adaptive diversification in a complex ecological system consisting of a fly, its host-plant, a symbiotic fungus, and its parasitic enemies. We will use DNA data along with behavioral assays and ecological experiments to determine the processes that are involved in this incipient adaptive radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work bridges a crucial divide between evolutionary studies of adaptive diversification and ecological interactions, in particular by providing insight into the determinants of insect specialization, the influence of enemies on insect populations, and role of symbiotic interactions in diversification. Importantly, the focal species are related to important agricultural pests and our research into their interactions and diversification will benefit both applied and basic scientific fields. This study will foster collaboration between laboratories at Wright State and Vanderbilt Universities. It will train four graduate students, at least four undergraduates, and provide additional students with training in scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
