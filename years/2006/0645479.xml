<AbstractNarration>Title:  Using the SRS Human Resource Data to Study the Science and Engineering Workforce&lt;br/&gt;Proposal for Two Workshops by Paula E. Stephan, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia&lt;br/&gt;State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal would organize two one-day workshops for users and potential users of SRS restricted data in the spring of 2007 and 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop are threefold: (1) Exchange information among users&lt;br/&gt;concerning creative uses of the data and research outcomes; (2) Broaden the base of users by familiarizing&lt;br/&gt;potential users with the data that is available and ways in which the data is currently being used as well as&lt;br/&gt;the potential for other kinds of use; (3) Provide feedback to SRS regarding the data and ways to enhance&lt;br/&gt;use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genesis for the proposed workshops is the workshop that Stephan has organized for October 20, 2006.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop, which had funds for 22 participants, attracted 53 applicants. The result is that a large&lt;br/&gt;number of current users and potential users will not be able to participate in the workshop. Moreover,&lt;br/&gt;increasing the number of users is of special policy concern given new initiatives and opportunities created&lt;br/&gt;both in response to John Marburger's article concerning the "Science of Science Policy" in Science and the&lt;br/&gt;development, by SRS, of a formal policy for linking the SRS micro data to other databases.</AbstractNarration>
