<AbstractNarration>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on the quantum and statistical mechanics of diverse important quantum phases of matter. These include: quantum magnets and spin glasses, quantum coherence in mesoscopic electrical systems, micro-mechanical systems, novel correlated states of atoms in condensates and optical lattices, and two-dimensional electron gases. Applications and extensions of quantum optics ideas for superconducting circuits and opto-mechanical systems will continue to be developed. Analytical as well as quantum and classical Monte Carlo and other numerical techniques will be applied to the study of these phenomena. New numerical techniques with wide applicability will be sought, developed and investigated. &lt;br/&gt;This work has a strong interdisciplinary component which brings together ideas and methods used in the condensed matter, atomic physics and quantum optics communities and will help foster communication among these groups. The research also contributes to the intellectual foundations of future cyberinfrastructure. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will receive significant training through close interactions with the PI and regular attendance at the experimental and theoretical group meetings. Undergraduates will have an opportunity to do summer research at an appropriate level which will lead to broadening their base of experience and provide opportunities for starting projects for later senior thesis work. Results will be widely disseminated in publications, seminars, colloquia and conference presentations. Where appropriate, the PI will also disseminate results of this work at the Boulder Summer School for Condensed Matter and Materials Physics and conferences which he helps organize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
