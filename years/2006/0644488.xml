<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: ECS-0644488&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: CAREER: Single Carbon Nanotube Based Nano-Optical Imaging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name:  Xu, Yong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a novel nano-optical imaging technique that can perform non-perturbing, multi-functional near-field imaging with 1 nm resolution. The approach is based on an active nanoprobe composed of a single carbon nanotube and a single active nanocrystal. By monitoring nanocrystal fluorescence, one can obtain optical near field images and vacuum field images with nanoscale resolution. The proposed nanoprobe can also lead to integrated chip scale single photon operations.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Using the proposed nanoprobe, it is possible to perform, for the first time, non-perturbing imaging of optical near field and vacuum field with 1 nm resolution. Furthermore, the proposed research can lead to a new paradigm for the fabrication of single photon sources, which can ultimately lead to chip-scale quantum information processing.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The 1 nm resolution and new functionalities provided by the nanoprobe can have a revolutionary impact on the development of nanophotonics and significantly boost the pace of discovery in nanophotonics research and engineering. The development of integrated single photon optics represents a new development in quantum information technology, and has important commercial and national security applications. Through a tight integration between interdisciplinary research and course development, a nanophotonics education program will be developed at Virginia Tech. A significant portion of such effort is devoted to mentoring female and African American students at Virginia Tech and local Montgomery County high schools, with the aim of encouraging their participation in nanophotonics research and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
