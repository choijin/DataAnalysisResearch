<AbstractNarration>The AIM Research Conference Center (ARCC) will continue to foster progress in the mathematical sciences through the sponsorship of focused workshops. ARCC workshops are distinguished by their emphasis on a specific mathematical goal, such as a significant unsolved problem, an important new result, or the explanation of the convergence between two distinct areas of mathematics. Central to each workshop is a public website which will outline the scope of the workshop and provide resources for the participants. Following the workshop, the website will be expanded to serve as both a record of the workshop and as a comprehensive resource for the current status of important problems and results. ARCC will also host a sequence of Structured Quartet Research Ensembles during this award. These ensembles are vertically integrated teams of 4 to 8 researchers who work at AIM for one to four weeks on a focused research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics has become an increasingly collaborative endeavor, and many of today's unsolved problems will require techniques from several areas of the mathematical sciences. The ARCC workshops are an ideal forum for teams of researchers to construct a framework for progress on important problems. To ensure that these collaborations will be successful, the leaders in each field will be involved in the planning of the workshops. Equally important is the active involvement of junior scientists and graduate students in the workshops. Special attention is paid to facilitating those collaborations which include women, minorities, and researchers at primarily undergraduate institutions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
