<AbstractNarration>There is a pressing requirement for compact, reliable, ultra-sensitive and cost-effective chemical sensors for emergency response and threat detection.  A major problem in persistent sensors has been the size and power consumption requirements.  The technology proposed answers this problem with a proposed network of nano-wires that will be used as selective point sensors, utilizing a combination of electronic and optical responses.  Detection of an adsorbed chemical on individual wires will use both current voltage curves and surface-enhancde Raman scattering spectra.  Nano-wires are grown and assembled into networks using surface tension and magnetic forces.  Making the junctions of the networks reproducible and coupling with electronic sensors will enable design of a multi-modal sensor.  This will enable low cost sensors for detection of biological and chemical agents to be built.  The group has engaged with local high schools in an active mentoring and internship program, as well as outreach to teachers.  An additional university-level laboratory course will be enhanced to deal with the new nano-fabrication requirements of nano-wire networks.   The development of the sensors  will have a broad impact in  medicine and environmental monitoring, as well as national security.</AbstractNarration>
