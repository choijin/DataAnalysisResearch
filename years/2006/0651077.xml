    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is for the support of work to study a broad class of stochastic processes,&lt;br/&gt;both classical and quantum, involving noise-induced escape from the basin of attraction&lt;br/&gt;of a locally stable state. The proposed research involves the development of new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical techniques for analyzing these processes, and their application to a&lt;br/&gt;variety of open problems in condensed matter and nuclear physics associated with&lt;br/&gt;nucleation processes in systems both at and away from equilibrium.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of proposed activity. The choice of research projects described herein&lt;br/&gt;is guided by three objectives. They are: development of techniques that broaden the&lt;br/&gt;variety of systems and situations accessible to theoretical analysis; application of these&lt;br/&gt;techniques to the solution of open problems in physical systems; and testing, both&lt;br/&gt;experimentally and numerically, of the resulting predictions. The overall research&lt;br/&gt;program aims towards a significant advance in our understanding of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems perturbed by weak noise, a class of systems that cuts across many&lt;br/&gt;scientific disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact of proposed activity. Mathematical methods developed by the PI and&lt;br/&gt;collaborators will be applied to a broad range of systems that, put together, are of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental scientific importance in a variety of scientific fields, and at the same time&lt;br/&gt;have promising future technological applications. These include magnetization reversal&lt;br/&gt;in nanomagnets, stability and lifetimes of monovalent metallic nanowires, decay of&lt;br/&gt;high-angular momentum superdeformed nuclear states, the thermal activation$quantum&lt;br/&gt;tunneling transition, and electroconvective pattern formation in liquid crystals. These&lt;br/&gt;problems are accessible through a unified mathematical approach resulting from the&lt;br/&gt;work of PI and collaborators. Training will be provided to postdoctoral researchers,&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, and, if possible, undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;For example, the proposal includes an experimental/numerical/theoretical collaboration&lt;br/&gt;in the study of thermally induced magnetization reversal in submicron-scale&lt;br/&gt;ferromagnetic annuli. The experiment, already in its initial stages, is designed to test&lt;br/&gt;theoretical predictions of the PI and others, and is largely being carried out by a&lt;br/&gt;graduate student towards a Ph.D. thesis. There should also be several resulting&lt;br/&gt;outreach activities, including presentations to classes at local K-12 schools, science&lt;br/&gt;projects for NYC high school students participating in science competitions for&lt;br/&gt;scholarships, and lectures to graduate students in other fields at multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;summer schools. Finally, the applicability of the PI?s work to areas of potential&lt;br/&gt;technological importance has already led to one patent application, and is likely to lead&lt;br/&gt;to more.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Diary Note&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0651077 PI Name:Stein, Daniel&lt;br/&gt;Printed</AbstractNarration>
