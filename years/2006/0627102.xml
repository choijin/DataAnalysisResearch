<AbstractNarration>In order to meet expected requirements for reliability and performance in Future Internet, a large majority of the management functions will be automated and rely on embedded capabilities in the network.  The objective of the proposed research is to explore design alternatives in the development of technology that will facilitate critical network management tasks in Future Internet. The research program to achieve these capabilities is focused on exploring design alternatives for network management building blocks that will provide essential low-level functionality and can then be composed in different configurations to enable an Internet Management Plane. Specific management building blocks that are targeted for this work include: 1) ubiquitous instrumentation, 2) protocols for data sharing, 3) protocols for end host signaling, 4) event detection mechanisms, and 5) systems for data organization, summarization and presentation. This research program will be facilitated by the use of large-scale test-bed facilities that enable both in situ measurements and controlled laboratory experiments.  The broader impacts of this project are that it provides a foundation for flexible, measurement-based investigation of new network architectures and network management practices.  The expected results of this work include documentation of designs and in some cases initial prototypes for each of the building blocks.  The project also includes education and outreach activities that will develop course materials on network measurement, configuration and management.  These web-based materials, which will be openly available to the community, will emphasize a hands-on approach intended to provide students with practical, relevant experiences.</AbstractNarration>
