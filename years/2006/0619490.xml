<AbstractNarration>AST-0619490&lt;br/&gt;Robert Simcoe, Adam Burgasser, and Paul Schechter&lt;br/&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Robert Simcoe, Adam Burgasser and Paul Schechter of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will construct, calibrate and commission the Folded-Port Infrared Echellette (FIRE)- a moderate resolution near infrared spectrograph for use with the twin 6.5-meter Magellan telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: FIRE is a science-driven instrument, optimized for spectral line studies of faint astronomical sources at near infrared wavelengths. FIRE's unique combination of spectral resolution, complete wavelength coverage and high sensitivity will enable significant advances in many areas of astrophysics, including: studies of the early universe, gamma ray bursts, the intergalactic medium, galaxy formation, supermassive black holes, star formation, low mass stars, brown dwarfs, planet formation, and Kuiper belt objects. FIRE's simple design makes it a versatile, user-friendly instrument. FIRE will be the first facility infrared spectrograph for Magellan, and has been identified as a top-priority instrument by Magellan's Science Advisory Council (SAC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its innovative design provides complete spectral coverage over the entire 0.9-2.5 micron band in a single exposure, offering both moderate resolution cross-dispersed (R= 6000) and low resolution prism-dispersed (R=1200) broadband spectroscopy. Its primary mode provides sufficient resolution to mitigate the strong atmospheric OH emission foreground, while still maintaining sensitivity to detect faint, near-infrared sources. Both modes achieve high throughput through the use of prisms as dispersing (or cross-dispersing) elements. A low noise, large format HgCdTe detector accommodates a spectral format that is simultaneously broadband and high resolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIRE's compact design will expedite construction and installation, while keeping its cost low relative to cutting-edge infrared spectrometers on comparable telescopes. Much of the design work has already been completed. FIRE will be assembled and calibrated at MIT throughout CY 2007-2008, and shipped to Magellan for commissioning and regular science operations in late 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: As the first facility, infrared spectrograph for Magellan, FIRE will dramatically enhance the capabilities of these world-class telescopes, and by extension, the research of astronomers at consortium institutions (Carnegie Observatories, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona and the University of Michigan). It will also be available to US national astronomers through open competition. FIRE's use at Magellan will enable young researchers to develop their future potential by learning the tools of infrared spectroscopy and its application to experimental astrophysics.  All consortium members encourage students to formulate, apply for and carry out research programs with Magellan facilities, and strong support is given to members of under-represented groups through programs such as the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
