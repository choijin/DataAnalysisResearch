<AbstractNarration>Kuchment&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0604778&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleague develop mathematical&lt;br/&gt;techniques, both analytic and numerical, for obtaining images of&lt;br/&gt;biological tissues.  They concentrate on mathematical issues that&lt;br/&gt;arise in recently introduced imaging methods for which there is&lt;br/&gt;little mathematical theory: Thermoacoustic Tomography (TAT),&lt;br/&gt;Ultrasound-Modulated Optical Tomography (UOT), and&lt;br/&gt;Acousto-Electric Tomography (AET). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Computerized tomography has become a major method of medical&lt;br/&gt;diagnostic imaging and industrial non-destructive testing.  Over&lt;br/&gt;time, many modalities have been developed, such as X-ray&lt;br/&gt;tomography (usual CAT scan), MRI, Emission Tomography, Optical&lt;br/&gt;Tomography (OT) and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), to&lt;br/&gt;name only a few.  All of them have their advantages and&lt;br/&gt;disadvantages in terms of contrast between different biological&lt;br/&gt;tissues, resolution, cost of devices and procedures, and safety&lt;br/&gt;of the patient.  For instance, cheap and safe procedures like EIT&lt;br/&gt;and OT are plagued by low resolution.  Recent years have brought&lt;br/&gt;novel methods of imaging that intend to overcome these problems&lt;br/&gt;and have a high potential for becoming cheap, safe and effective&lt;br/&gt;diagnostic tools.  These are Thermoacoustic Tomography (TAT),&lt;br/&gt;Ultrasound-Modulated Optical Tomography (UOT), and&lt;br/&gt;Acousto-Electric Tomography (AET).  They all combine different&lt;br/&gt;types of radiation to overcome the known difficulties of methods&lt;br/&gt;involving only one of these modalities (e.g., optical tomography,&lt;br/&gt;ultrasound imaging, or electrical impedance tomography), such as,&lt;br/&gt;for example, low contrast of ultrasound imaging and high&lt;br/&gt;instability and low resolution of optical and electrical&lt;br/&gt;impedance imaging.  Mathematical issues are among the most&lt;br/&gt;crucial in development of these methods, because images have to&lt;br/&gt;be obtained by sophisticated mathematical procedures rather than&lt;br/&gt;by direct acquisition as in the standard (non-tomographic) X-ray&lt;br/&gt;imaging.  However, in all these modalities necessary analytic and&lt;br/&gt;numerical tools are essentially absent or at very early stages of&lt;br/&gt;development.  Thus, the investigators develop mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analytic and numerical techniques for obtaining images of&lt;br/&gt;biological tissues, with the primary targets being TAT, UOT, and&lt;br/&gt;AET.  The project aids development and implementation of several&lt;br/&gt;new, cheap, and safe methods of medical diagnostic imaging to be&lt;br/&gt;used in clinics.  Some applications for non-destructive&lt;br/&gt;industrial testing are also possible.  Graduate students play a&lt;br/&gt;significant role in the project, and some of the project's&lt;br/&gt;techniques and results are incorporated into graduate-level&lt;br/&gt;classes.  This prepares students for work in exciting&lt;br/&gt;contemporary areas at the junction of exact sciences and medicine&lt;br/&gt;and biology. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
