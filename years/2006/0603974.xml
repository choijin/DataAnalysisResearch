<AbstractNarration>A program of theoretical research on the interaction of light with cold, optically&lt;br/&gt;thick, atomic ensembles is proposed. Quantum control of the interface between light&lt;br/&gt;fields and atomic matter is essential for future scalable quantum network systems which&lt;br/&gt;have application to the secure sharing of information between remote parties. The success&lt;br/&gt;of the implementation of atomic ensembles in that context depends on achieving high&lt;br/&gt;efficiency and long-lived coherence in their interaction with the light input and output&lt;br/&gt;channels. The properties and characteristics of the interactions in such a multi-mode and&lt;br/&gt;multi-atom system will be thoroughly addressed by means of the analytical and numerical&lt;br/&gt;methods of atomic physics and quantum optics. The collective enhancement of the&lt;br/&gt;interactions between the light field and multi-atom states of the ensemble provides an&lt;br/&gt;organizing principle for their understanding, as well as a mechanism for strong,&lt;br/&gt;directional coupling between light and matter. Another characteristic of light propagation&lt;br/&gt;in optically thick media, the mixed light/multi-atom excitation known as the dark state&lt;br/&gt;polariton, will be investigated as a means to perform controlled storage, and subsequent&lt;br/&gt;retrieval, of light pulses down to the single photon level. The research will focus on&lt;br/&gt;realistic experimental scenarios including the study of relevant states of preparation of the&lt;br/&gt;atomic ensemble, and the incident light fields. In this context, the coupling of ambient&lt;br/&gt;magnetic fields to the spins of the atomic nucleus and electrons provides the primary&lt;br/&gt;decoherence mechanism. This process and its impact on the overall storage and retrieval&lt;br/&gt;efficiency of the light field will be investigated in detail.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
