<AbstractNarration>B. PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;In this research program, the PI proposes a novel combined geometric active contour/particle&lt;br/&gt;filtering approach for tracking the boundaries of objects (i.e., planar shapes), when the observation&lt;br/&gt;is an image which may be a complicated nonlinear function of the closed curve. The advantage&lt;br/&gt;of using geometric active contours is that they allow topological changes (automatic merging and&lt;br/&gt;breaking), and hence can be used to track multiple objects.&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the particle filtering framework will be applied to the space of continuous&lt;br/&gt;closed curves which is an infinite dimensional space. This is a particularly difficult problem since&lt;br/&gt;generating Monte Carlo samples from a very large dimensional (theoretically infinite) system noise&lt;br/&gt;distribution is computationally complex. Moreover, the number of samples required for accurate&lt;br/&gt;filtering increases with the dimension of the system noise. The PI will show that as long as the&lt;br/&gt;number of dimensions of the system noise is small, even if the total state space dimension is&lt;br/&gt;very large (or infinite), a particle filtering algorithm can be implemented which will allow him&lt;br/&gt;to develop practical robust tracking algorithms. In particular, the PI proposes to approximate&lt;br/&gt;curve deformation using a time- varying finite dimensional representation. He will formulate the&lt;br/&gt;problem as particle filtering with unknown static parameters and use a modification of a particle&lt;br/&gt;filter that has been shown to be asymptotically stable for tracking static parameters.&lt;br/&gt;The main assumption is that even though the curve may be regarded as a point of an infinite&lt;br/&gt;dimensional space, "most of its deformation" for a given period of time can be approximated using&lt;br/&gt;a small finite number of dimensions. But over time, this approximation may no longer suffice&lt;br/&gt;and hence one must allow the number of dimensions and the finite dimensional basis to change&lt;br/&gt;whenever the current approximation is unable to track with suffcient accuracy. For a number&lt;br/&gt;of key scenarios, this assumption seems reasonable, and allows the use of infinite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;observer techniques for visual tracking.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The key objective of this project is the development of new methodologies for employing visual&lt;br/&gt;information in a feedback loop, the underlying problem of controlled active vision. This is a&lt;br/&gt;challenging problem both from the intellectual and practical points of view. Indeed, controlled&lt;br/&gt;active vision, and in particular visual tracking requires the integration of techniques from control&lt;br/&gt;theory, signal processing, and computer vision. This research program points the way to finding a&lt;br/&gt;new class of robust and hopefully real-time visual tracking schemes making use of all of the above&lt;br/&gt;building blocks.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of Research Activity:&lt;br/&gt;The PI believes that the proposed synergy of vision, filtering, and control described in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal may have a strong impact on tracking and active vision. Indeed, visual tracking provides&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental example of the need for controlled active vision. While tracking in the presence of a&lt;br/&gt;disturbance is a classical control problem, visual tracking raises new issues. Firstly, since cameras&lt;br/&gt;are part of the system, one must consider the nature of the disturbance from imaging sensors.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, the feedback signal may require some interpretation of the image, e.g., segmentation&lt;br/&gt;of a target from its background, or an inference about an occluder. Finally, as visual processing&lt;br/&gt;becomes more complex, the issue of processing time arises. Each of these problems must be&lt;br/&gt;answered before target detection, and visually-mediated control can be provided for medical,&lt;br/&gt;commercial, or advanced weapon systems.</AbstractNarration>
