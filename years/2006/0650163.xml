<AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project will apply an innovative approach for translating research on IXF and nano-particles of metal oxide into environmental industrial applications, thus serving to revitalize the textile industry.  The project will combine high value-added manufacturing and relatively short times-to-market production, leading to novel combinations of knowledge base and applications to important environmental problems.  The design is to combine textile production with the ability to generate nano- and micro-fibers having highly selective ion exchanges and ion generating properties.  The textile production expertise, a legacy of the northeastern U.S., will be combined with new processes in order to develop a fiber-based technology with applications in industrial products and processes.  The new fibers can ultimately be used to produce textiles and products for water treatment, filtration processes, phosphorus removal, and clean-up of contaminated water sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project are the creation of new jobs and business opportunities through private partnerships and students' innovations and enhanced academic-private sector interaction leading to sustainable technologies for mitigating environmental hazards with tangible economic benefits.  The detailed management plan will develop and transfer IFX technology to a broad range of commercial partners representing different water purification needs in the economy.  Clear objectives have been established in each area and should ensure that the new IFX technologies have impact on the important water purification problems at the household, community, and industrial level. The project will also create opportunities for underrepresented groups of students to receive education and training and develop skills required to join the high technology workforce.  Because of the potential impact of the concept for advancing discovery and understanding, it is likely that results from this project will effectively promote teaching, learning, and the integration of research and education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners include the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth (lead institution), Lehigh University, Chevron Energy Technology Company, Donaldson Company, Inc., The Purolite Company, Royal Consulting Services, Inc., Solmetex, Inc., and Southern Company Generation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
