<AbstractNarration>This project is increasing the number of students pursuing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines at the associate degree level. Participants are being supported via financial assistance, mentoring, advice for successful transfer to a four year university, and participation in a learning community of scholars.  The college is reaching out to groups of talented students who would otherwise not be able to, or not choose to, enter into a STEM career. The college already has considerable experience doing the type of outreach required for the program. For the past ten years Glendale Community College (GCC) has run, in collaboration with California State University, Northridge, a successful Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) program. The college has an extensive support system to help students succeed, especially those who do not have a strong support system of their own, such as first generation college students and students from lower economic strata. The college's counseling staff is one of the largest in the state, as is the supplemental instruction program which provides collaborative learning workshops in many science and math classes. GCC has a Math/Science Center for computer work and drop-in tutoring, a regular tutoring program, and, because of the AMP experience, a mentoring program and a summer bridge program focusing on mathematics training and general college preparation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project's activities address a major challenge in recruiting students to STEM careers.  It is supported by a capable faculty and by adequate institutional facilities, resources, and commitment.  In addition there is a focus on documenting measurable improvements in student learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  A replicable support system for STEM students, a model useful to other institutions, is being disseminated.  Faculty are taking specific steps to ensure that pedagogical strategies related to enhancing the success of underrepresented students are integrated into instructional approaches benefiting the college's diverse student population and broadening the successful participation of underrepresented groups in STEM-related learning.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
