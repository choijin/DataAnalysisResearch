<AbstractNarration>The investigator proposes several problems in arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;geometry and transcendental number theory that explore the arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;nature of special values of analytic functions.  In one project, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator plans to study transcendence and algebraic independence of&lt;br/&gt;numbers in positive characteristic arising from Anderson-Drinfeld motives. &lt;br/&gt;These transcendence questions are closely connected to Galois groups &lt;br/&gt;of Frobenius difference equations, and in particular the investigator&lt;br/&gt;proposes to pursue the interaction between transcendence theory and Galois&lt;br/&gt;theory to study function field multiple zeta values, periods and logarithms &lt;br/&gt;of Drinfeld modules, and higher dimensional versions.  The investigator &lt;br/&gt;proposes to study Fourier coefficients of modular forms and their relationships &lt;br/&gt;with finite field hypergeometric functions and Calabi-Yau manifolds.  He &lt;br/&gt;plans also to discover arithmetic properties of the extension groups of elliptic &lt;br/&gt;curves and their connections with Galois representations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the fundamental branches of modern mathematics, number theory&lt;br/&gt;serves as the basis for many applications, including cryptography and&lt;br/&gt;coding theory.  The proposed research considers questions involving the&lt;br/&gt;interplay between arithmetic and analytic aspects of number theory, which &lt;br/&gt;have their beginnings in classical work of Euler and Gauss and which continue &lt;br/&gt;to have important implications today to the essential understanding of problems &lt;br/&gt;both in number theory and in many other branches of mathematics.  Several parts &lt;br/&gt;of the project lead naturally to problems for graduate and undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
