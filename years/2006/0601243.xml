<AbstractNarration>This project will fund an upgrade to the existing NSF-funded University of Michigan (UM)- University of Notre Dame (UND) low-energy nuclear research apparatus "TwinSol" located at the UND nuclear particle accelerator.  Specifically, the project will include the construction of a new scattering chamber and an associated large-area nuclear-particle detector array, together with improved particle time-of-flight capability, better vacuum, etc. This upgrade will permit a new generation of nuclear physics experiments involving the study of nuclear reactions with short-lived (i.e. radioactive ) nuclear beams at low energies. Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of very neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability. Such nuclei  generally are very short-lived (e.g. 1 sec or less)  and the new, upgraded apparatus will permit detailed studies of many of these nuclei with better accuracy than previously possible. Such short-lived nuclei (for example the short-lived isotope of helium, 6He which has 4 neutrons and 2 protons in contrast to the normal, stable isotope of helium, 4He which has 2 neutrons and 2 protons) nonetheless are important for the synthesis of atomic elements in normal stars, as well as in supernova (exploding stars) and other extreme astrophysical environments. This includes synthesis of many atomic elements important for the formation of planets and for life itself (oxygen, silicon, calcium, iron..).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a broad impact on graduate, undergraduate, and high school education, as well as the development of a technologically-literate work force as it will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Michigan and the University of Notre Dame, together with faculty members and students from several other (primarily undergraduate) colleges and universities  located in the Midwest, in close proximity to UM and UND. The ``hands on" training of these students in the use of advanced, state-of-the-art nuclear accelerators and nuclear-particle detectors together with the associated superconducting accelerator magnets thus will provide important training with applications in many possible career paths (e.g. those involving nuclear technology including nuclear medicine, or in  teaching) . It also will keep faculty at these schools involved in fore-front physics research which can then be incorporated in their course work , public outreach functions , etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
