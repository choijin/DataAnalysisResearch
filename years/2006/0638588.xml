<AbstractNarration>The Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have established a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Precision Forming.    The mission of the I/UCRC is to serve as a center of excellence for the creation and dissemination of a systematic body of knowledge in precision forming and fabrication of lightweight-high strength materials of interest in this century, and ultimately to impact the next-generation products and production systems with precision, responsiveness and near-zero waste.  The objectives of this I/UCRC are to explore, conduct research and to bring about innovation and practical solutions by focusing on industrially relevant research needs; foster collaborative and interdisciplinary research projects between industrial and academic engineers and scientists; and promote intra-university research activities and prepare the next generation of engineering graduates for the metal forming industry.</AbstractNarration>

It shared state-of-the art information and knowledge with all of its stakeholders (faculty, students, member companies).  It disseminated knowledge to undergraduate and graduate student through manufacturing, metal forming and design courses at OSU (ISE 350, ISE 694, ME 694, ME 890) and VCU (EGRM 426, EGRM 627, ENGR 591), as well as at K-12 institutes, professional organizations/chapters, through its outreach and information activities.     CPF contributions within the field of manufacturing can be summarized as follows:  -       Understanding forming characteristics of lightweight &amp; high strength sheet materials (Al, Mg and AHSS),  -       Characterization of friction &amp; wear behavior in sheet metal forming at room temperature and at elevated temperature conditions,  -       Forming characteristics and micro-mechanical behavior in micro-manufacturing of micro-channels for fuel cell applications,  -       Project results are being introduced into educational modules for students, researchers as well as industry.     CPF contributions to education and human resources  -       Non-proprietary aspects of the project results are included in manufacturing seminar courses taught by faculty leaders and presented in various conferences and meetings.     CPF contributions to resources for science and technology  -       The results of this project are already being used at the CPF in a) conducting other research projects and b) updating of metal forming and machining courses for undergraduate and graduate students as well as in the dissemination of the research results to industry.  -       Technical reports and data on research results are provided to member companies for their internal use.  -      ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
