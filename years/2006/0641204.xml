<AbstractNarration>RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism involved with the control of gene expression that operates via double stranded RNA. Homologous messenger RNAs to the double stranded trigger are enzymatically destroyed. This mechanism provides an endogenous protection against viruses and transposable element mobilization. Apoptosis involves cell death and is involved with normal developmental processes. In preliminary experiments, it was found that cell death would cause inhibition of RNAi in adjacent cells. It is hypothesized that signals from the dying cells cause this inhibition. In order to gain insight into the mechanism of inhibition of RNAi by cell death signaling, this project will involve a mutagenesis in Drosophila to identify mutations that modify the inhibition of silencing via RNAi of the white eye color gene. The mutations identified will be used in an attempt to understand the molecular mechanism of inhibition of RNAi by cell death signaling. By mapping the genes and determining the predicted genes from the genomic sequence, the collection of modifier genes will provide information about the molecular processes involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell death is a natural process involved with development and its inhibition can lead to cancer. RNA interference is also a natural process of gene silencing that can serve as a  protection against viruses. Cell death was found to inhibit the process of RNA interference in adjacent sectors.  This interaction might be the case if a viral infection overcomes the first line of defense of RNAi and kills a cell. The dying cell might send signals to its neighbors to induce more potent antiviral mechanisms that compete with the RNA interference process. This project will investigate the mechanism of this interaction. The research project will also contribute to the mentoring of a postdoctoral fellow and introduce the undergraduates involved to scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
