<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research, Prof. Keith A. Nelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  and his postdoctoral and graduate student colleagues will work to further develop methods for exciting and controlling the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom in condensed phase materials.  Prof. Nelson and his group will use optical excitation and control of lattice vibrations (optic phonons) and coupled lattice vibrational/electromagnetic waves (phonon-polaritrons) motions to learn details about condensed phase order, dynamics  and structure, as well as to generate tailored terahertz (THz) frequency fields to be used in THz spectroscopy and coherent control.  The methods that Prof. Nelson and his group develop should become useful tools for other scientists interested in developing a firmer understanding of the properties of liquids and solids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the broader scientific and technological impacts of the research being supported, Prof. Nelson continues to introduce high school students to the excitement of cutting edge research in a dedicated laboratory, through his "Lambda Project." &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
