<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have lead to a variety of microsensors&lt;br/&gt;and actuators that have great potential for guidance and control of aircraft and spacecraft. Such devices&lt;br/&gt;can deliver high-bandwidth performance with low power consumption, and their small size and weight&lt;br/&gt;permit the use of numerous sensors and/or actuators in applications where conventional sensor/actuator&lt;br/&gt;technology limits the number of measurement channels and actuator degrees of freedom.&lt;br/&gt;For these emerging technologies to realize competitive performance levels, innovative methods are required&lt;br/&gt;for device calibration and closed-loop control. The necessity of such methods arise from the fact&lt;br/&gt;that fabrication irregularities can produce a wide range of dynamic responses among any batch of supposedly&lt;br/&gt;identical devices due to the microscopic scale of key electro-mechanical components. The sensitivity&lt;br/&gt;and variability of sensor and actuator dynamics can be compensated by precise calibration of individual&lt;br/&gt;devices based on detailed modeling and parameter identification from input/output data, and by control&lt;br/&gt;loops built into the micro device.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:This research focuses on the development of multivariable system identification and control strategies&lt;br/&gt;for improving the performance of MEMS vibratory angular rate sensors. The intellectual merit of this&lt;br/&gt;research derives from the study of problems stimulated by the following needs: 1) The first major research&lt;br/&gt;topic develops algorithms for achieving optimum device sensitivity. The highest signal-to-noise ratio&lt;br/&gt;is achieved when two dynamic modes of the sensor are rendered degenerate. Robust test methods and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms have been developed that vastly improve the SNR associated with the angular rate estimate via&lt;br/&gt;real-time tuning of the sensor dynamics. Furthermore, on-line algorithms continuously probe the sensor&lt;br/&gt;dynamics during operation in order to maintain the tuned condition; 2) The second major research topic&lt;br/&gt;develops a process for minimizing the rate uncertainty at designated integration times via the shaping of&lt;br/&gt;closed-loop noise spectra. In this case, additional freedom in the control filters is exploited for shaping the&lt;br/&gt;Allan variance of the rate estimate in a desired manner.&lt;br/&gt;This research program is conducted in the PIs Microsensor Laboratory on sensor prototypes loaned&lt;br/&gt;to the PI from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The research contributions have significant broader&lt;br/&gt;impacts well beyond graduate education. The algorithms and methods devised under this program have&lt;br/&gt;changed the way the PIs collaborators at JPL and elsewhere model, test and control their sensor prototypes.&lt;br/&gt;In the undergraduate engineering curriculum at UCLA, a series of design courses expose students to this&lt;br/&gt;rapidly evolving sensor technology with projects that include the design and construction of a stabilized&lt;br/&gt;sensor platform for the UCLA DARPA Grand Challenge Team using commercial GyroChip vibratory&lt;br/&gt;gyros donated by BEI Technologies.</AbstractNarration>
