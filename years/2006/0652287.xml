<AbstractNarration>National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;NETS- Research in Network Technologies and Systems  &lt;br/&gt;CISE/CNS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0435105&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jue, Jason P.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Texas at Dallas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0435095&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jianping Wang&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Georgia Southern University Research and Service Foundation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: NeTS-NR Collaborative Research: Multi-Layer Dual-Homing Survivability for the Next-Generation Internet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates multi-layer survivability schemes for the next-generation networks, which are expected to be deployed over a wide range of underlying physical network infrastructures, from wireless networks in the ac-cess to optical networks in the core. An important issue in designing such net-works is to develop effective survivability schemes that can continue to carry critical traffic in the event of network failures. Traditionally, different survivabil-ity mechanisms have been implemented at various layers, independently. This project investigates the survivability schemes in which survivability mecha-nisms may be implemented simultaneously at multiple layers within the net-work in either a coordinated or independent manner. The work focuses primar-ily on multi-layer dual-homing techniques in the wireless and IP layers, protec-tion schemes in the optical layer, and the effective integration of these schemes. By establishing appropriate models and developing new algorithms, the project will provide insights into the trade-offs between coordinated and independent survivability schemes with respect to cost, complexity, and service levels pro-vided in the wireless and IP layers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Admela Jukan&lt;br/&gt;Program Director, CISE/CNS&lt;br/&gt;Aug 4, 2004.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
