<AbstractNarration>CAREER: A New Look at the Fundamental Limits of Lossy Network Compression&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lossy compression plays a key role in our information economy. By far, most of the information that we&lt;br/&gt;generate as a society represents pictures, sounds, and  videos, and for this kind of data, lossy compression &lt;br/&gt;yields a tremendous reduction in transmission and storage requirements. The aim of this project is to &lt;br/&gt;understand the fundamental limits of lossy compression,especially in the context of networks, which dominate today's communication infrastructure. Previous work on this problem has not led to a fundamental understanding  of lossy network compression nor has it had a significant  impact on the design of practical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research overcomes the limitations of prior work  using two novel approaches. First, the highly general models  of the past are eschewed in favor of canonical, concrete  problems that are simultaneously more tractable and more  relevant to applications. Building on recent results of  the PI, the work develops a comprehensive and conclusive  understanding of the fundamental limits of lossy network  compression for Gaussian sources under quadratic distortion  constraints and discrete sources under erasure distortion &lt;br/&gt;constraints. Second, these fundamental limits are studied  under more realistic scenarios in which the source, the network,  and the allowable distortion all change in unpredictable ways.  To help students learn how to create probabilistic and  information-theoretic models that are tractable yet also  applicable to real systems, existing courses at both the  graduate and undergraduate level are being remade to include  greater emphasis on modeling. The project also includes significant outreach, involving an interactive tutorial  on compression delivered to women and underrepresented-minority  engineering undergraduates and rural high-school students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
