<AbstractNarration>Summary:  "A Comparative Invetigation of Technological Transformation and Musical Expression." The phonograph was never intended to be a musical instrument. Yet this technology is now at the center of a thriving, global performance art known as turntablism. This proposal requests funding to support  research examining the cultural and technological transformation of the phonograph into a vehicle for musical expression within hip-hop culture. This transformation, which began in NewYork City's African American community in the late 1970s, is unique since a marginalized community reappropriated and redefined an existing and popular technology according to its own distinctive cultural aesthetics. This project will document how turntables as technological artifacts of hip-hop have produced musical genres with loyal devotees, mediated multiple cultural relationships, and contributed to the global dissemination of black cultural aesthetics.  Given the transformation of the turntable, this project will examine: how national, cultural, ethnic, and racial politics of identity influence technological design, choice, and use.  The PIs  will seek to understand how ideas of race, ethnicity, and culture have influenced the technological design of turntables and associated turntablist equipment, and to understand the influence of developing turntablist technology on musical originality.   It will entail comparative work examining how  turntablist communities in the United States and Japan  contribute to the production of a hybrid global technological movement by defining, appropriating, and reconstituting the racial, cultural, and technological aesthetics of turntablism.  It will produce a study that will move beyond turntables and provide insights into technological transitions from analog to digital affect a variety of cultural communities.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This project will contribute to work on music in STS and on technology within musicology, and produce new ways to think about the race in relation to technology.  This comparative study will augment the understanding of race and technology.  The study will also consider the effects that the larger transition from analog to digital technologies will have on our society. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research will show the connections between music, race, and technology. It will show that music can be an important avenue for marginalized peoples to engage technology in a proactive way. This project will facilitate the coalescing of faculty members and students interested in investigating how music, race, and technology interact. The project will enhance research and teaching at the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins and the Center for Cultural Design, and undergraduate program in Product Design, and Innovation at RPI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
