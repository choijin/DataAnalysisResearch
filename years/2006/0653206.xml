<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to increase the number of Estrella Mountain Community College students who complete an Associate's degree and who transfer to four-year institutions in STEM fields. A two-tiered cohort program is in place with students enrolled in either a pre-STEM cohort or a STEM cohort based on their prior level of math preparation. The students in the cohorts are being supported through expanded student recruitment, learning communities, faculty and peer mentoring, field experiences, career explorations, financial scholarship incentives, and a systemic change in mathematics instruction. The mathematics instruction is being improved campus-wide through the development of the Math Emporium as a mathematics laboratory where students work with mathematics faculty and student tutors to enrich their educational experiences in developmental and other math courses. The Math Emporium serves the needs of the student cohorts by providing access to online interactive support as well as enhanced faculty/student interactions.</AbstractNarration>

Evidence of higher achievement for the entire student population, in addition to the STEM cohorts, has been recorded.

Development of a student æSTEM clubÆ, designed to engage both STEP scholars and STEM students, exposed students to professional opportunities available in STEM fields.

An æInternship Information BoardÆ was developed to aid students in searching for academic or professional experiences. Centrally located and maintained by STEM faculty, the board lists current internship opportunities organized by STEM curriculum fields.  A æHall of FameÆ showcasing past STEM graduates was created to celebrate students who have pursued degrees in STEM areas, completed study at our community college, and earned a university degree.
