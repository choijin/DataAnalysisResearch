<AbstractNarration>Building a National Model for Excellence in Native American Higher Education Programs&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP Pacific Alliance&lt;br/&gt;University of Alaska Anchorage&lt;br/&gt;The Pacific Alliance Universities&lt;br/&gt;University of Alaska Anchorage&lt;br/&gt;University of Alaska Fairbanks&lt;br/&gt;University of Hawai'i Manoa&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;Alaska Native Civil Engineering graduates Andy White and Michael Nabers&lt;br/&gt;helped architects and engineers to design a new 12,000 square foot building on&lt;br/&gt;the UAA campus to house the Pacific Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;Pacific Alliance&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment, Retention and Placement Strategies&lt;br/&gt;Pre-College program: empowerment &amp; excitement&lt;br/&gt;about careers in engineering and science&lt;br/&gt;computer building with trig, physics &amp; chemistry&lt;br/&gt;High School to University Bridge: Summer&lt;br/&gt;experiences for entering freshman&lt;br/&gt;Internships with Calculus Prep&lt;br/&gt;Graduate School&lt;br/&gt;Peer mentoring &amp; co-enrollment&lt;br/&gt;Presentations and technical papers&lt;br/&gt;Organized study groups&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative experiences&lt;br/&gt;Faculty cross-cultural training&lt;br/&gt;Faculty mentoring&lt;br/&gt;Internships&lt;br/&gt;National &amp; international conferences&lt;br/&gt;Grant writing experience&lt;br/&gt;Graduate research and undergraduate research&lt;br/&gt;Workshop for Teaching Assistant (TA)&lt;br/&gt;instruction&lt;br/&gt;Faculty Mentoring&lt;br/&gt;Peer Mentoring&lt;br/&gt;Supporting community&lt;br/&gt;Professional mentoring&lt;br/&gt;Graduate student&lt;br/&gt;mentoring&lt;br/&gt;Research&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate Retention&lt;br/&gt;Learning Community Co-enrollment&lt;br/&gt;Team building&lt;br/&gt;Group study&lt;br/&gt;Advising&lt;br/&gt;Scholarships&lt;br/&gt;Internships&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;Our objective is to effect a systemic&lt;br/&gt;change in the hiring patterns of&lt;br/&gt;Indigenous Americans in the fields of&lt;br/&gt;science, technology, engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics (STEM) by increasing&lt;br/&gt;the number of individuals on a career&lt;br/&gt;path to leadership within STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;We will double the 2005 Indigenous&lt;br/&gt;STEM graduation rate over the next 5&lt;br/&gt;years.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Beginning with&lt;br/&gt;high school juniors, structured&lt;br/&gt;programs lead students each step of&lt;br/&gt;the way through high school, into the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate years, on to graduate&lt;br/&gt;school, and into professional life. At&lt;br/&gt;each level the goal is to create&lt;br/&gt;empowerment and excitement around&lt;br/&gt;engineering and science. We have doubled the Alliance&lt;br/&gt;wide Indigenous STEM graduation rate from 46 students in&lt;br/&gt;2000 to 95 during the last academic year. Enrollments of&lt;br/&gt;Indigenous students in STEM disciplines have climbed from&lt;br/&gt;344 students during the 2001- 2002 academic year to 795&lt;br/&gt;during 2004-2005. We have leveraged $3.2 million in NSF&lt;br/&gt;funding with contributions of approximately $11 million&lt;br/&gt;dollars from our many partners.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Our students are among the poorest people&lt;br/&gt;in the nation. The parents of some of our Alaska Native&lt;br/&gt;students were raised on the tundra as nomads and are the&lt;br/&gt;first generation of people in their families to ever use money.&lt;br/&gt;Indigenous students have historically come to our&lt;br/&gt;Universities under-prepared in math and science. We&lt;br/&gt;would do years of remedial work at the University before&lt;br/&gt;these students were able to successfully complete a&lt;br/&gt;University level course. In many of the high schools with&lt;br/&gt;high populations of Native students, coursework was not&lt;br/&gt;available that would foster success in STEM degree&lt;br/&gt;programs. We are now bringing Indigenous people who are&lt;br/&gt;prepared in math and science to Alliance Universities in&lt;br/&gt;numbers that are unprecedented at our institutions. They are&lt;br/&gt;graduating and moving on to graduate schools. At UAA, the&lt;br/&gt;University is in construction phase for a 12,000 square foot&lt;br/&gt;building to house the Pacific Alliance and the Indigenous&lt;br/&gt;Peoples Institute for Engineering and Science Education.&lt;br/&gt;The new Institute will be a focal point as our programs are&lt;br/&gt;replicated across the nation. We are having a profound and&lt;br/&gt;positive impact on the students, their families, and their&lt;br/&gt;communities that will endure for generations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual merit:  The LSAMP Alaska Alliance is the BS STEM undergraduate portion of a comprehensive longitudinal model that starts with middle school students, extends through high school, into the undergraduate years, on to graduate school and into the professions.  We started 18 years ago.  We have graduated 431 minority STEM students since 2002 and increased the average annual underrepresented STEM BS graduate number from a pre LSAMP number of 16.67 to 43.10 since our first award in 2001.    The focus of our longitudinal effort is to effect systemic change by:  eradicating forever the belief that minority students are not science and engineering material, inspiring students to complete advanced science and math coursework in middle and high school, bringing students who are academically prepared for BS STEM degrees into a welcoming environment on our Alliance campuses and supporting them through degree completion inspiring undergraduate STEM students to enroll in graduate school providing opportunities and guidance for all students at each step creating empowerment and excitement around engineering and science at each step,   providing career visioning opportunities through experiential activities led by practicing STEM professionals at each step, focusing on the academic, personal, and professional development of every student at each step  infusing values of family and community in all we do   Broader Impact: Our students are among the poorest people in the nation.  The parents and grandparents of some of our Alaska Native students were raised on the tundra as nomads and are the first generation of people in their families to ever use money.  Some Alaska Native LSAMP students are the first in their family to ever graduate from high school.  Native students have historically come to our Universities under-prepared in math and science.  We would do years of remedial work at the University before these students were able to successfully complete a University level course.  In many of the schools with high populations of Native students, coursework was not available that would foster success in STEM degree programs. LSAMP has catalyzed a change in this paradigm and spawned affiliated components that extend from sixth grade to graduate school.  We are now bringing native students who are prepared in math and science to our Universities in numbers that are unprecedented.  Some students arrive ready for calculus 3 during their first semester freshman year. One student from bush Alaska has completed partial differential equations as a high school senior. Students are graduating and moving on to the professions and graduate schools. We are replicating our model in 12 states and have developed partnerships with 130 industrial firms, philanthropic organizations, federal agencies, state agencies, schools, colleges, and universities who provide cash, advocacy, research opportunities, and internships for our students at every level.  We have successfully institutionalized with State of Alaska General Fund money all faculty and staff positions as well as programmatic components initially funded through LSAMP. We have a new 13,000 square foot building to house our programs on the campus at UAA and a dedicated endowed chair so that minority students will forever have a STEM faculty advocate.   We have been successful with leveraging $1.8 million in LSAMP funding with approximately an additional $15 million in funding from other sources over this grant term.
