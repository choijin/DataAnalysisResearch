<AbstractNarration>The Pascagoula School District in southern Mississippi is partnering with the National Audubon Society (Audubon Mississippi), Chevron-Texaco, Mississippi Naturalists, NASA and the University of Southern Mississippi to extend its existing science curriculum by involving 135 students and 9 teachers from three middle schools in grades 6-8 in out-of-school time scientific investigations of local coastal wetlands.  Approximately 50 percent of the students in the district are students of color and/or economically disadvantaged.  Project goals are to (1) increase students' understanding, appreciation, attraction and interest in STEM fields and prepare them for high school course work and post-secondary study in science, math and engineering; (2) improve teachers' "content knowledge and pedagogical skills through collaborative experimentation and rich industrial and academic experiences with researchers in STEM fields;" and (3) "establish a sustainable and replicable model for development and implementation of an integrated in- and out-of-school curricular program."  The project is conducting research on the impact of the program on student and teacher learning and attitudes, parental involvement and partnership development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project WetKids (www.projectwetkids.net) was funded by the National Science Foundation from 2006-2012.  The National Science Foundation recognized Project WetKids as a highlight research program and it is used in communicating NSFÆs successes to national stakeholders.  This out-of-school science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) program provides teachers, students, and families on the Gulf Coast wetland, estuary, watershed, and career exposure experiences with regional scientists, engineers, and naturalists.   The extensive partnership includes: the Pascagoula River Audubon Center, NOAA Fisheries Laboratory, Chevron Pascagoula Refinery, Northern Gulf Institute, Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, John C. Stennis Space Center, Huntington Ingalls Industries, and the Live Oak Alliance.  The integration of industry, non-profit research organizations, informal science centers, and academia has provided diverse resources and opportunities in Alabama and MississippiÆs coastal counties.   The middle grades provide a critical window to inspire students and  spark interest in STEM career paths. Project WetKids has repeatedly  documented STEM educational success and is a replicable model that  teachers embrace and students and their families enjoy.  Intellectual Merit    A university based research team of STEM  educators and educational and social psychologists documented and  analyzed Project WetKidsÆ impact on studentsÆ science content knowledge,  scientific aspirations, and views of science learning in experimental  and quasi-experimental studies.   Cwikla, J. &amp; Barry, C. (2011).  Project WetKids:  An out-of-school program fostering citizen scientists in the middle years.  In R. Oxford &amp; J.  Lin (Eds.)

Project WetKids Community Partners Champion Interdisciplinary Out-of-School Learning.  AERA &ndash; American Education Research Association.  San Diego, CA.   Broader Impacts    Our student participants are from the coastal counties in Alabama and Mississippi serving communities with poplutions ranging from 50-95% African-American with 60-100% students eligible for free and reduced lunch.   Based on quantitative and qualitative data, Project WetKids has significantly impacted these under privileged studentsÆ understanding, appreciation, attraction, and interest in the science, engineering, and mathematics fields.  Further, and perhaps most important, it is expected that the long-term effects of this program will raise the proportion of students (minority included) entering advanced secondary science course work and consequently impact plans for pursuit of postsecondary study in the areas of chemistry, engineering, environmental sciences, mathematics, physics...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
