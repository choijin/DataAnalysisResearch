<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Sociology at Texas A&amp;M University-College Station, TX will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site offering an eight-week summer institute focusing on research experiences and training in research methods.  The organizing theme of the summer institute is the application of sociological research methods in the study of social stratification, racial and ethnic inequality, and the demography of racial and ethnic groups.  Topics range from using statistical analysis of secondary data (e.g., surveys and census data) to investigate ethnic differences in stratification outcomes, to using field methods and in-depth interviews to explore different aspects of racial and ethnic relations, and combining field trips to urban and rural communities with examination of census materials to investigate ethnic segregation and neighborhood stratification.  A dozen students will be selected from across the country, especially undergraduates at ethnic-minority serving institutions and non-PhD. granting institutions. The centerpiece of the program is an intensive research experience in which each student undertakes a project under the supervision and mentorship of a faculty member.  In addition, students participate in a course on  different research methodologies can be applied in studying social stratification and racial and ethnic relations and students also attend professional development seminars focusing on graduate education and careers in sociology.  Students present their research both at an on-site research symposium at the end of the summer institute and at a professional conference (i.e., the Southwestern Social Science Association meetings) in the spring.  The primary goal of the program is to encourage student interest in careers in sociology and impart skills and experiences that will enhance their prospects for pursuing doctoral training and careers in sociology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
