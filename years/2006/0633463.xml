<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: Phase transformations, and the microstructural evolutions they produce, play a critical role in the mechanical and functional properties of engineering materials. The core of materials science lies in understanding and predicting how processing or service conditions influence materials structures and microstructures, which in turn modify the properties of use. While engineering materials have largely been designed empirically in the past, recent development in modeling techniques, computing power, and nanoscale experimental techniques have contributed to a dramatic increase in our understanding of these phenomena, as well as in our predicting power. There is an urgent need to expand and to apply this knowledge since materials play a key role in many challenges faced our by technological societies. This is, in particular, the case for power generation, delivery and use, for ground and air transportation, for information technology, and for biomedical applications. The Materials Research Society plays a leading role in the organization of materials symposia that focus on specific materials according to their functions. Most concepts, modeling tools, and techniques, however, cut across the specifics of particular applications. There is thus a need to maintain a forum for the exchange of fundamental knowledge on phase transformations and microstructural evolutions in inorganic materials. No MRS symposium has been organized on this topic or a related topic since 2000. We, the organizers of this coming symposium, believe that it is time to bring together the active community of researchers working in this field. The 2006 Symposium-HH: Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Phase Transformations in Inorganic Materials will cover recent advances in the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transformations. It will include eight [8] interrelated topics of fundamental importance, and their links to practical applications. The central theme rests on inorganic materials, and topics range from nucleation &amp; growth, to atomistic and continuum modeling, thin film transformations, to heterophase interfaces and their role in phase transformations. NON-TECHNICAL: The conference will feature at least 21 invited talks by experts from around the world. The conference will enable a close-quarter discussion between leading scientists and new faculty/students/postgraduates who are engaged in cutting edge research on thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transformation, with due consideration to broadening participation by women and minorities. Minority and underrepresented groups will be attracted through targeted e-mails sent by the conference organizers, and will be made aware of NSF support to attend this conference.</AbstractNarration>
