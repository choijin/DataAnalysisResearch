<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt; An abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues will organize the New Researchers&lt;br/&gt;Conference, a scientific conference for roughly ninety new researchers&lt;br/&gt;in statistics and probability. This consists of organizing an application&lt;br/&gt;process, selecting participants from a pool of applicants, coordinating&lt;br/&gt;talks and poster sessions, arranging for senior speakers, and a variety of&lt;br/&gt;other administrative tasks (arranging for travel, housing, food, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Researchers Conference (NRC) is a conference for recent&lt;br/&gt;recipients of doctoral degrees in Statistics and Probability. The primary &lt;br/&gt;purpose of this conference is to provide a much needed venue&lt;br/&gt;for interaction among new researchers. At present, researchers develop&lt;br/&gt;contacts with others in their field either through their own&lt;br/&gt;institutions or at meetings of professional societies. It is often the&lt;br/&gt;case that junior researchers have limited&lt;br/&gt;contact with senior colleagues, even at their own institutions.&lt;br/&gt;Meetings of professional societies are rather large and junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers often find them overwhelming. The proposed meeting of new&lt;br/&gt;researchers will provide a unique opportunity for these junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers to exchange ideas and initiate contacts among themselves&lt;br/&gt;as well as provide them an opportunity to interact with the invited senior &lt;br/&gt;participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
