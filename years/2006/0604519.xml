    <AbstractNarration>Buhler&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0604519&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator undertakes a theoretical and numerical&lt;br/&gt;study of strong stochastic effects in mathematical fluid&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, specifically in the area of wave-mean interaction&lt;br/&gt;theory. Here "strong" refers to effects that substantially change&lt;br/&gt;the overall dynamics of the fluid system when compared to the&lt;br/&gt;standard deterministic setting. In general, wave-mean&lt;br/&gt;interaction theory describes the nonlinear interactions between&lt;br/&gt;small-scale waves and the large-scale mean flows on which the&lt;br/&gt;waves are propagating. There exists a substantial body of&lt;br/&gt;classical wave-mean interaction that is based on deterministic&lt;br/&gt;waves, but very little has been done on the stochastic version of&lt;br/&gt;the problem. The present work combines a number of projects&lt;br/&gt;aimed at extending the classical theory in this direction. &lt;br/&gt;Examples include the use of stochastic theory for wave dynamics&lt;br/&gt;and nonlinear wave breaking, for two-dimensional wave-vortex&lt;br/&gt;turbulence, and for the derivation of effective mean-flow&lt;br/&gt;equations for stratified flows subject to high-frequency&lt;br/&gt;oscillatory forcing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Interactions between waves and mean currents include the&lt;br/&gt;driving of long-shore currents and vortical motions such as rip&lt;br/&gt;currents by breaking waves on a beach (important for civil&lt;br/&gt;engineering and naval operations), the creation of clear-air&lt;br/&gt;turbulence by breaking waves in the stratosphere (important for&lt;br/&gt;aviation and the environment), and the driving of the global air&lt;br/&gt;circulation by breaking waves in the mesosphere, above 60km&lt;br/&gt;altitude or so (important for climate evolution). These&lt;br/&gt;processes are far too small in spatial scale to be resolvable in&lt;br/&gt;numerical models for atmosphere-ocean dynamics, which means that&lt;br/&gt;in these models their impact must be put in by hand based on&lt;br/&gt;theory and observations. This is called the "parametrization"&lt;br/&gt;problem for unresolvable processes, and even on the biggest&lt;br/&gt;supercomputers it will remain a bottleneck problem for decades to&lt;br/&gt;come. Now, in the classical "deterministic" theory in this area,&lt;br/&gt;the prevailing conditions are assumed to be simple and perfectly&lt;br/&gt;known. However, in reality, the prevailing conditions are often&lt;br/&gt;complex and poorly known. Stochastic theory addresses this by&lt;br/&gt;allowing for uncertain, or random, components of the situation. &lt;br/&gt;This project brings modern stochastic theory to bear on the kind&lt;br/&gt;of wave-mean interaction problems that are relevant to&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere-ocean science. There are two principal project aims:&lt;br/&gt;first, finding new effects that are missed by the deterministic&lt;br/&gt;theory; and second, laying the foundation for a more realistic&lt;br/&gt;representation of wave-mean interactions in numerical models for&lt;br/&gt;use in climate prediction, aviation, and near-shore civil&lt;br/&gt;engineering.</AbstractNarration>
