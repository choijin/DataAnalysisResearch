<AbstractNarration>The program "Mathematics of Materials" provides a wide range of interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in the mathematical sciences.  The research activities are organized around five topics that play a fundamental role in emerging technologies: multifunctional materials, polymers and composites including carbon nanotubes, orthopaedic biomaterials, dynamics of thin material layers, and material behavior of laser welding.  Within each topic, investigations focus on fundamental model development, mathematical solution, numerical simulation, and control design.  Each project involves substantial collaboration with experimental colleagues that provides interdisciplinary training opportunities to mathematics students and postdocs.  The training component is designed to prepare students and postdocs for the varied roles of interdisciplinary research mathematicians.  This includes training modules that introduce participants to research and career topics not typically covered in coursework, targeted courses on topics pertaining to research areas and national research agendas, and participation in summer internships and national conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Mathematics of Materials" is an interdisciplinary research training group program designed for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs in the mathematical sciences.  The research activities are organized around five topics that play a fundamental role in emerging&lt;br/&gt;technologies: multifunctional materials, polymers and composites including carbon nanotubes, orthopaedic biomaterials, dynamics of thin material layers, and material behavior of laser welding.  The training component involves a coordinated set of activities designed to prepare students and postdocs for the varied roles of interdisciplinary research mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;This includes training modules that introduce participants to research and career topics not covered in traditional coursework, new courses pertaining to the five research topics and areas of national need, and participation in summer internships and national conferences spanning multiple disciplines.  The objective of the program is to attract and train highly qualified students and postdocs for academic and nonacademic careers at the interface between applied mathematics, materials science, engineering, physics, and advanced technology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The RTG program ``Mathematics of Materials" provided a wide range of interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in the mathematical sciences.  The research activities were organized around nine topics that play a fundamental role in emerging technologies: multifunctional materials, polymers and composites including carbon nanotubes, orthopaedic biomaterials, dynamics of thin material layers, multiphase materials, noninvasive damage detection techniques, analysis of magma flow and magnetic solitary waves, contact problems in elasticity, and fault detection and identification.  Within each topic, investigations focused on fundamental model development, mathematical solution, numerical simulation, and control design.  Each project involved substantial collaboration with experimental colleagues that provided interdisciplinary training opportunities to mathematics students and postdocs.   During the RTG, we initiated 5 new courses on topics relating to program research areas: (i) Applied Modeling and Analysis Techniques, (ii) Mathematical Fluid Mechanics, (iii) Validation, Verification and Uncertainty Quantification, (iv) Numerical Methods for Model Calibration, and (v) Introduction to Continuum Mechanics of Elastic and Viscoelastic Solids.  The training component was designed to prepare students and postdocs for the varied roles of interdisciplinary research mathematicians.  This included the development of Research Training Modules (RTM) that introduce participants to research and career topics not typically covered in coursework, the development of the 5 targeted courses on topics pertaining to research areas and national research agendas, and participation in summer internships and national conferences.  During the RTG, 2 postdocs, 28 graduate students, and 16 undergraduates were supported by the program.  Additionally, there was one high school participant in the program.  A total of 13 PhD dissertations were written on topics pertaining to the mathematics of materials by students supported in the program.
