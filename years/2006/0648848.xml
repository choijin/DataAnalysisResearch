<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;The research project proposed will analyze the epistemic strategy of an organism-oriented approach to the use of model organisms in experimental biology by examining the history of protozoan genetics in the United States. It will focus on the careers of American biologists and geneticists, Herbert Spencer Jennings and his student, Tracy Sonneborn, and their research organisms, the ciliated unicellular protozoa, Paramecium and P. aurelia, respectively. The project will consider the use of protozoa as model organisms in relation to the epistemic strategy with which they generally were employed by Jennings and Sonneborn -- that of gaining intimate knowledge of the organisms. It will compare this strategy with the problem-oriented approach to the use of model organisms largely practiced by T. H. Morgan's Drosophila school and its many successor programs. The objectives of this research are: (1) to elucidate the underlying philosophical beliefs and sociopolitical priorities that supported Jennings' and Sonneborn's approach to biological research; (2) to compare the beliefs and priorities that facilitated an organism-oriented approach with those associated with the competing, problem-oriented strategy in twentieth century genetics research; and (3) to examine the function of an organism-centered epistemic strategy in the dynamics of experimental systems in the life sciences. The historical method employed likewise will prioritize actors to analytical categories such as disciplines, and thus will follow the careers of Jennings, Sonneborn, and Paramecium into the related domains of animal behavior, developmental biology, and evolutionary biology, as well as that of genetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This study will enrich recent discussions in science studies on the function of model organisms in the life sciences by illuminating the diversity of epistemic strategies for the use of model organisms available to researchers. Furthermore, it will contribute to recent thinking on the dynamics of experimental systems in the life sciences by illustrating the diverse means by which these epistemic strategies facilitate the evolution of experimental systems. Most broadly, by offering a longitudinal study spanning the joint scientific careers of Jennings and Sonneborn, from 1890 to 1981 -- a uniquely long span of time for most studies of recent science -- it will highlight the long-term consequences of scientists' values and commitments for the development of later scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This study will illuminate that the nature of genetic knowledge emanating from biological laboratories and journals is not inevitable, but that methodological choices informed by social and political priorities and philosophical beliefs have and will affect many aspects of biological experimentation, including the use of particular research organisms. This message will be communicated to a broader audience through publication of articles in biological journals committed to disseminating research on biology and society. Full funding of this NSF Scholar's Award proposal will provide support for two calendar years full-time research and writing, including travel to five US archives containing materials vital to the success of this project. Support also provides for access to the University of Chicago Library for use of primary and secondary research materials, and travel to one conference to present research results. The primary products of the proposed research will be a book and two journal articles that will disseminate the PI's research to a broader audience, consisting primarily of life scientists and biology educators. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
