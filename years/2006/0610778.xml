    <AbstractNarration>Models based on partial differential equations are widely used in&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering, and numerical methods for their solutions are&lt;br/&gt;of central interest. In the last several years, there has been steadily&lt;br/&gt;growing interest in two such methods: Generalized Finite Element&lt;br/&gt;Methods and the closely related Meshless Methods. They have become a&lt;br/&gt;focus of development and application -- especially in the engineering&lt;br/&gt;community. These methods generalize the Finite Element Method, and are&lt;br/&gt;of interest mainly for two reasons: (i) they are not based on a mesh,&lt;br/&gt;or use a mesh only minimally, and hence avoid some of the problems in&lt;br/&gt;meshing complicated domains; (ii) they permit the use of non-polynomial&lt;br/&gt;approximating functions, and hence are applicable to problems with&lt;br/&gt;special features, whose solutions are not accurately approximated by&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. This flexibility has, in the past few years, been effectively&lt;br/&gt;used in handling certain important problems. But a deep and precise&lt;br/&gt;theoretical understanding of these methods is needed to broaden their &lt;br/&gt;applicability, in particular their efficiency and robustness, to complex &lt;br/&gt;problems in engineering that otherwise cannot be solved with existing &lt;br/&gt;methods, for example, the Finite Element Method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves careful and precise mathematical study of various&lt;br/&gt;aspects of Generalized Finite Element and Meshless Methods. The broader&lt;br/&gt;impact of this study will be reflected in the applicability of these&lt;br/&gt;methods to a wide range of complex problems of technical and societal&lt;br/&gt;importance; for example, problems with multiple scales. Multiscale&lt;br/&gt;problems are increasingly important; they include the problems of&lt;br/&gt;composite materials and flow through porous media. Finding robust,&lt;br/&gt;efficient, and reliable approaches to solve these problems is one of&lt;br/&gt;the challenges of modern technology. Another impact of the proposal is&lt;br/&gt;the training of graduate students in a vital, cutting edge area. Their&lt;br/&gt;involvement in this project will not only help them become experts in&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical underpinning of these important methods, but will also&lt;br/&gt;give them the rare first-hand experience in working with practical&lt;br/&gt;engineering problems.</AbstractNarration>
