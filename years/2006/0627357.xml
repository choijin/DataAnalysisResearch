<AbstractNarration>An Integrated PHY-MAC approach to secure Open-Access Wireless Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project proposes an integrated research and educational&lt;br/&gt;plan for addressing many important serious security challenges, especially&lt;br/&gt;at the lower layers of Open-Access Wireless Networks (OAWNs).&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to addres wireless security vulnerabilities in OAWNs&lt;br/&gt;by defining an ubiquitous infrastructure for security and control that maintains&lt;br/&gt;its open access nature for regular clients while appropriately detecting,&lt;br/&gt;localizing, and isolating malicious behavior and mitigating their impact.&lt;br/&gt;A unique aspect and key contribution of this project will be its focus on &lt;br/&gt;protecting the lower (PHY and MAC) layers through an integrated approach that &lt;br/&gt;has received scant prior attention in the context of OAWNs.&lt;br/&gt;This is particularly important since the lower layers are the weakest &lt;br/&gt;links of any open wireless system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, the PIs will design protocol mechanisms that, first, prevent or at&lt;br/&gt;least render MAC-layer attacks difficult. If an attacker would instead try to&lt;br/&gt;attack the PHY layer, it would have to expend significantly higher amounts of&lt;br/&gt;energy, which in turn simplifies attack detection.  In addition, to combat such&lt;br/&gt;PHY layer attacks, the PIs propose to use sophisticated signaling and coding &lt;br/&gt;techniques as well as PHY-MAC cryptographic and spatio-temporal scheduling strategies.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, to facilitate some of these security mechanisms, the PIs will also design&lt;br/&gt;distributed PHY-MAC strategies that perform continuous monitoring of the wireless&lt;br/&gt;environment and help isolate anomalous behavior.&lt;br/&gt;An important part of this project will be evaluating the tradeoffs between degree&lt;br/&gt;of interoperability of proposed mechanisms with the corresponding level of security &lt;br/&gt;guarantees achievable. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
