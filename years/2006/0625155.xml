<AbstractNarration>J.F. Drake State Technical College in Huntsville, Alabama is a two-year Historically Black Institution.  Their HBCU-UP project SPEED-UP (Strategic Plan for Enhancement, Expansion and Development of Undergraduate Programs) will provide the infrastructure to i) expand professional development opportunities for STEM faculty; ii) enhance and expand Drake's current STEM curriculum and articulation agreements and iii) expand outreach to underrepresented groups to increase STEM participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the SPEED-UP project, Drake plans to offer professional development for faculty in the areas of peer learning, interactive learning, Just-in-Time Teaching and Supplemental Instruction.  In the area of curriculum development, Drake will re-design the mathematics, physics, biology and computer information systems curriculum through the use of some of the techniques emphasized in the professional development activities.  In addition, Drake will implement summer bridge programs for high school students and for adults, which should increase interest in STEM programs, especially with the students that they serve.</AbstractNarration>
