<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston under the direction of Dr. Markus Horning for partial support of the development the Satellite-linked Data Acquisition and Photogrammetry (SLiDAP) system. The SLiDAP remote imaging network uses digital still pictures transmitted through a satellite data link, to reconstruct virtual 3D models of individual animals and their colonies. The development of the SLiDAP system was initiated to address significant gaps in the knowledge about many declining species of seals and sea lions in remote, polar regions. Specifically, information on year round trends in body condition and health of the Steller sea lion is vital to test the suggestion that a reduction in food abundance or quality, possibly related to extensive commercial fishing, may be contributing to the decline of this endangered species. Under this new funding, infrared cameras will be integrated into the SLiDAP system. Infrared cameras will allow users to remotely collect accurate temperature measurements on individual sea lions. The infrared images will be used to extend animal census operations into low light conditions, and to diagnose the health status of individual sea lions. The integration of infrared imaging into the existing SLiDAP system will be a substantial enhancement of the efforts to test the possible effects intense fishing on a declining marine mammal species. &lt;br/&gt;To integrate infrared cameras into the SLiDAP system, several software and hardware elements of the system will be extensively modified. The software that controls the imaging system and allows for remote operations will be adapted to accommodate the new camera type. The glass viewport that allows pictures to be collected by cameras protected from a fairly extreme environment, will be modified to permit accurate temperature measurements, since the current design is not transparent to heat radiation essential to infrared imaging.  The current ice removal system was developed by undergraduate students with Texas A&amp;M University's Marine Engineering Technology department, and the revision of the system will also be carried out by undergraduate engineering students. Simultaneously, Dr. Jo-Ann Mellish and her student will calibrate the relationship between infrared signatures of individual sea lions held at the Alaska Sea Life Center, and the extent of body fat stored by the sea lions under their skin. This calibration will permit an accurate estimation of changes in the sea lions' body condition throughout the year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SLIDAP remote data collection network will open many inaccessible regions for long-term scientific observations that currently cannot be performed by other means, in addition to facilitating the collection of vital data on the biology of many animals species in a rapidly changing Alaskan ecosystem. The integration of remote temperature measurements will be a significant enhancement of the ability of the SLiDAP network to collect accurate measurements from animals and their environment. The development of a web-based multi-user shared access control interface for the SLiDAP network is being planned. Through this interface, the SLiDAP resource can be shared by many different institutions in different locations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
