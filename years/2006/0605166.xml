<AbstractNarration>This proposal describes problems in several areas of probability,&lt;br/&gt;involving stochastic geometry, Markov chains, and stochastic games.&lt;br/&gt;Determinantal point processes arise naturally in several settings,&lt;br/&gt;including eigenvalues of random matrices.  One goal of the proposal is&lt;br/&gt;to develop robust methods to recognize determinantal processes that do&lt;br/&gt;not require calculating correlation functions of all orders.  Two&lt;br/&gt;methods of allocating equal volumes to the points of a point process,&lt;br/&gt;one based on the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm, the other on&lt;br/&gt;gravitational potentials, will be compared. In the area of Markov&lt;br/&gt;chain mixing, the ``cutoff phenomenon'' where distance to stationarity&lt;br/&gt;decreases rapidly from near 1 to near zero is believed to hold in most&lt;br/&gt;natural chains but is established for very few.  A robust and easily&lt;br/&gt;checkable possible criterion for cutoff will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;Recently, the classical connection between random walks and harmonic&lt;br/&gt;functions has been extended to nonlinear potential theory using ideas&lt;br/&gt;from game theory and optimal control. A major aim of the proposal is to&lt;br/&gt;develop and study stochastic games whose value functions, in the&lt;br/&gt;scaling limit, solve other important PDE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random scatters (Point processes) that exhibit clumping have effective&lt;br/&gt;models in statistics, but random scatters that exhibit repulsion are&lt;br/&gt;less well understood.  The proposed project aims to develop a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of such processes which should enable wider use for them&lt;br/&gt;in statistical modeling. Given a random scatter, different algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for allocating equal areas to the points of the scatter will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated.  Markov chains are a widely used tool in simulation and&lt;br/&gt;randomized algorithms.  Basic features of convergence to equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;in these chains will be studied. These should have an impact on the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of algorithms. The project has a substantial educational&lt;br/&gt;component, in mentoring of graduate students and preparation of&lt;br/&gt;educational materials at the undergraduate level on Markov chains and&lt;br/&gt;game theory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
