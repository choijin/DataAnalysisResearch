    <AbstractNarration>Sherrice Vallette Allen&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 0641823&lt;br/&gt;Demolition of Ceramide Synthesis Gene in Magnaporthe grisea with Putative Roles in Pathogenicity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, poses a serious threat to the world's most important food crop with losses between 10-30% of annual harvest. The pathogen can infect all parts of the plant, with the most devastating situation being colonization of the neck just below the panicle. Fungal penetration via an infection structure, the appressorium, requires a variety of factors such as physical and biochemical signals. The appressorium is a highly melanized cell that builds up sufficient turgor pressure to force a penetration peg through the plant cuticle to gain access to the underlying tissues. Ceramide monohexosides (CMHs) are compounds hypothesized to have a role in this morphological transition. This project will aid in understanding how CMHs influence the biology of M. grisea, as well as establishing their role in appressorium formation and infection. In addition, it is thought that the enzyme arylsulfatase assists in maintaining the cellular pool of ceramide monohexosides. Specific Aim I will test this hypothesis by creating disruption mutants in genes that encode this enzyme . Specific Aim II will concentrate on determining the role of each gene in appressorium formation and fungal virulence. The generation of mutants lacking key enzymatic activities involved in CMHs biosynthesis is a fundamental application to study fungal development and differentiation. The specific aims of this project will be carried out utilizing molecular and genetic techniques that can be performed by undergraduate and graduate student researchers. The broader impacts of this project will be to provide research experiences for underrepresented minority graduate and undergraduate students in microbial-plant pathogenesis, an area not traditionally pursued by underrepresented minorities. Also, the proposed research will add to a growing research community at Fayetteville State University, a historically black university, allowing for the development of partnerships with the North Carolina State University Fungal Genomics laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
