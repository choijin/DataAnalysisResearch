    <AbstractNarration>REU SITE: The Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0647325&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will head the Research Experience for Undergraduates site conducted by the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium (KNAC). The site has three main components: (1) A 10-week summer research opportunity for 12 students per year to work at a KNAC institution, (2) A fall Student Symposium attended by KNAC faculty and about 80 students, where each KNAC supported student gives a 10-minute research talk, as well as other students from their institutions, and guests. There is also a poster paper session for students who cannot give talks due to time constraints, (3) Publication of the Proceedings of the Undergraduate Research Symposium, for which each presenting student will contribute a four-page research paper. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, approximately half of KNAC students go on to graduate school and most are pursuing science-oriented careers. KNAC serves as a model for other small college astronomy departments of how a regional consortium can successfully address issues of size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
