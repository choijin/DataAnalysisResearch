<AbstractNarration>The Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) recognizes outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George C. Lee is Samuel Capen Professor of Engineering, and former dean of the school of engineering and applied sciences at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York (SUNY). He has internationally recognized scholarship and leadership in multidisciplinary earthquake engineering, and is a leader in providing and sustaining educational opportunities in engineering. For nearly 40 years his mentoring efforts have led to thousands of underrepresented high school students in the greater Buffalo area being exposed to engineering and science. Once underrepresented students are enrolled in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Lee continues mentoring to encourage student success during the undergraduate engineering experience. Lee has also served as the principal advisor for a large number of underrepresented graduate students. He was the principal founding member of BEAM, Buffalo Area Engineering Awareness for Minorities, an organization whose membership draws on Omega Psi Phi, a black professional men's' national fraternity, and the Buffalo City Schools in addition to the SUNY Buffalo population. Lee has designed, developed and obtained funding for a wide variety of highly effective mentoring programs, including research internships for students in grades 5-12 and their teachers; community programs; and leadership training programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
