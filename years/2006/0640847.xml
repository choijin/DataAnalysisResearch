<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will dramatically increase our knowledge of the ecology, biodiversity, and phylogeny of the phylum tardigrada through new undergraduate research programs at Baker University, Fresno City College, and Brigham Young University. The teams will conduct a biotic survey of North America by collecting tardigrades at the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. Student researchers will be trained to collect, identify, sequence, and report on tardigrades. Their results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and available over the internet on the Tardigrade Reference Center (TRC) at the Academy of Natural Sciences with keys, descriptions, images, DNA sequences, and distribution maps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will discover new species, expand the continental diversity, and link DNA sequences to voucher specimens in order to ascertain species associations, distributional patterns, and genetic variation of the tardigrades.  The TRC will target scientists, educators and hobbyists who use the Internet to find data, facts, and teaching activities. The project models the collaboration between the undergraduate, research, and museum communities. It also fosters communication among specialists, and demonstrates the blending of morphological and molecular approaches to species identification.  The project will expose many students to scientific inquiry such that they will be prepared for careers in science, education, and government.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

At our workshops, Adams taught the extraction and sequencing of DNA, Miller taught tardigrade taxonomy, and Johansson taught field ecology.  Student research has compared urban and rural tardigrades and looked into the impact of pH on distribution.  Students investigated an altitudinal transect in the California, tardigrades in the canopy of a Kansas tree, and found a new species of marine tardigrade in Florida. At the North Temperate LTER students found rare species and in Utah, a plesomorphic tardigrade genus was recovered.  In Alaska, ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
