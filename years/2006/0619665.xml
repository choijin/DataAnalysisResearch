<AbstractNarration>The acquisition supported by this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)&lt;br/&gt;grant consists of a modular wave tank and related wave making and data collecting&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation to be housed in the new Fluids Lab at the University of&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina.  The proposed modular wave tank has been designed with&lt;br/&gt;maximum flexibility in mind.  Much of fluid mechanics takes place across multiple scales, and their&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear coupling is arguably one of the most challenging features of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and experimental science. With this instrument the team of PIs and&lt;br/&gt;participants will be able to probe into phenomena, some of them newly discovered&lt;br/&gt;in the existing Mathematics Fluid Lab or in field experiments by Marine Science faculty, as never&lt;br/&gt;before. From mixing in stratified jets and their generation and&lt;br/&gt;interaction  with internal waves, to sedimentation of particles in stratified fluids and their&lt;br/&gt;entrainment phenomena, to large internal solitary wave propagation from deep to&lt;br/&gt;shallow topography with forcing and breaking, to boundary layer sediment&lt;br/&gt;transport  by surface wave motion, the host of experiments that the new instrumentation&lt;br/&gt;makes possible is such as to guarantee intensive usage for many years to come.&lt;br/&gt;The modularity of the new wave tank is designed so that each module can serve a different&lt;br/&gt;purpose, as well as allowing simultaneous experiments to take place in the&lt;br/&gt;different modules. This will optimize time sharing as well as usage of resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The destructive powers of water, set in motion by large natural forces, have been painfully&lt;br/&gt;illustrated by the tragic events that marked the recent past. Tsunamis and&lt;br/&gt;hurricane surges have taken untold lives, and cost hundreds of billions of&lt;br/&gt;dollars in damage. The primary means to mitigate the effects of these uncontrollable&lt;br/&gt;natural forces is accurate prediction and forecast, which in turn relies on fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the physical phenomena at play. Close integration of experimental&lt;br/&gt;and mathematical modelling is becoming more and more recognized as the most&lt;br/&gt;successful approach to study this range of fluids problems. The proposed instrumentation&lt;br/&gt;is dedicated to the study of the relevant physical processes that govern the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;water emulating these natural events, with the ultimate goal of improving predictive capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;The visual  appeal of fluid motion and the challenge of its mathematical modeling&lt;br/&gt;will further extend the proposed instrumentation into a primary educational tool able&lt;br/&gt;to attract bright undergraduate students to careers in the sciences, thereby increasing&lt;br/&gt;the competency of our workforce in these fields of national interest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
