<AbstractNarration>Bard College will host 6 REU students each summer in a 7 week field program in Tropical Limnology and Evolutionary Biology.  This program operates in concert with a sister REU, the Nyanza Project, on Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania.  Jointly, these programs are designed to provide students with an interdisciplinary perspective on tropical lakes and the opportunity for hands-on independent research.  Recruitment will be based on academic achievement, interest in ecology and evolutionary biology, and career goals.  We also aim to recruit from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences.  Students will travel to Kigoma, Tanzania, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, where they will:  1) participate in a two-week interdisciplinary workshop (lecture, lab, and field activities) involving geology, paleoclimatology, limnology, and evolutionary biology, 2) learn the essentials of experimental design and statistical analysis, 3) design and implement independent research projects in conjunction with their peers, 4) present their work at the end of the summer in a formal seminar, 5) write a report on their work.  As a 10-million-year-old Rift Valley lake with high levels of endemism among many faunal groups, Lake Tanganyika offers unique opportunities for research in limnology and evolutionary biology.  The region is also experiencing high levels of population growth and land use change which can subsequently affect the water chemistry and biodiversity.  Research projects can focus on topics such as pelagic nutrient dynamics, fisheries biology, the effect of deforestation on tropical streams, the effect of sedimentation on gastropods, predator-prey co-evolution, and population distributions.  Past research reports, more information about the program, and application materials can be found at http://www.geo.arizona.edu/nyanza/.

This award was cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
