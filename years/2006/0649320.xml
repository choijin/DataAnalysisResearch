<AbstractNarration>This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Southern California for the summers of 2007-2009.  Anna Krylov is the site's Program Director.  Nineteen faculty will serve as mentors and provide research projects centered on the theme of visualizing chemical processes at the molecular level. Projects include optical imaging of reaction products, femtochemistry experiments, X-ray crystallography, spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations. Ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. Minority students will be recruited through contacts with institutions in the Los Angeles area with significant populations of underrepresented groups and by coordinating recruitment with the USC McNair Scholars Program. In addition, several international students supported by USC will participate in the program. Students will participate in informal evening tutorials and seminars. Visits are planned to several large research and development labs in the Los Angeles area.  Students will prepare a final written paper and a poster presentation on their research. Evaluation forms will be completed by students and their future career choices monitored.</AbstractNarration>
