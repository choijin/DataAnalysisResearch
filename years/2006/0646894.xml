<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  An NSF Workshop on Complex Interacting Systems for a Sustainable Future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CTS - 0646894&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:   Timothy J. Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   University of Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis (rationale for decision):&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal would fund the organization and participation in the NSF workshop on "Complex Interacting Systems for a Sustainable Future". The field of sustainability encompasses a wide range of disciplines, and a sustainable industry must consider the full life cycle of products, the broadest impact of an industrial processes on the environment, energy consumption, materials utilization, and the human social context.  An innovative research opportunity exists at the systems level to address these interacting infrastructures, which would be the core theme of this workshop.  The enabling capabilities include recent advances in solving complex problems, the increased deployment of sensors with advanced data collection, and advances in modeling that more accurately describe components (such as ground water flow, global energy demands, integration of policy decisions, etc.).  A three-day workshop would be conducted at the University of Florida to address critical research needs in sustainability and to provide a road map for research on sustainability for emerging frontiers within the Directorate of Engineering.  The goals of the workshop include identification of the fundamental science and engineering that underlines the systems-level requirements for sustainability.  A core of topics addressing sustainability will guide this discussion:  sustainable energy resources, clean water supplies, environmental preservation, feedstock assurances, and human resources and social factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research will be achieved through discussion of national and global technological sustainability decisions that include government, industry, and academic leaders.  The workshop will seek to develop interagency Federal links in the area of sustainability.  International participation in the meeting is likely to be significant.  Educational issues, public policy issues, and outreach to communities facing critical issues regarding sustainability in the face of environmental disasters will be addressed in a concerted manner.  Dissemination of the workshop's ongoing activities will include the NSF emerging frontiers working groups, professional society meetings, and industry-university partnership organizations.  A website will be created, and preliminary documents as well as workshop report will be avaiable in early 2007. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
