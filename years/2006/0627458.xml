    <AbstractNarration>In the ever expanding cyber community public-key cryptography is&lt;br/&gt;deployed at various platforms and gateways to ensure authenticity,&lt;br/&gt;confidentiality, and integrity in all kinds of communication and&lt;br/&gt;transaction. Therefore the security of public-key cryptography is&lt;br/&gt;foundational to the security of the cyberspace. Elliptic curve&lt;br/&gt;cryptography has risen in recent years to meet the challenge of&lt;br/&gt;constraints in bandwidth, power, and size in wireless and mobile&lt;br/&gt;communication, and is likely to become the mainstay for public-key&lt;br/&gt;cryptography in the wireless arena. This research focuses on&lt;br/&gt;critical issues concerning the foundational security of elliptic&lt;br/&gt;curve cryptography. A unified approach using the theory of global&lt;br/&gt;duality is developed to study the discrete logarithm problem upon&lt;br/&gt;which elliptic curve cryptosystems are based. This research seeks to&lt;br/&gt;identify and classify weak cases of elliptic curve groups beyond&lt;br/&gt;what is currently known. The findings of this research will deepen&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the security of the elliptic curve cryptosystems in&lt;br/&gt;general, and relative cryptographic strength of specific classes of&lt;br/&gt;elliptic curves in particular. The techniques and methodology&lt;br/&gt;developed in the proposed research will provide the basis for future&lt;br/&gt;research on similar issues in curve-based cryptography. A&lt;br/&gt;long-term goal of this research is to explore the prospect of using&lt;br/&gt;algebraic groups for building future generations of public-key&lt;br/&gt;cryptosystems. Elliptic Curve Cryptography is also an excellent&lt;br/&gt;subject to integrate research and education in mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. Part of this project is to introduce students at all&lt;br/&gt;levels and across disciplinary boundaries to research in this area&lt;br/&gt;through well-designed courses, seminars and workshops.</AbstractNarration>
