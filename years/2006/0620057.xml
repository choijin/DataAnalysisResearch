<AbstractNarration>With the goal of advancing the participation of women in the academic sciences and engineering, Grand Valley State University (GVSU) and the University of Michigan (UM) propose a partnership to (1) adapt and implement interventions at GVSU from the UM NSF ADVANCE project and (2) develop a synergistic component that creates a collaborative pipeline for future faculty to benefit both institutions. The UM interventions include faculty mobilization for peer education on recruitment and development of a recruitment handbook; interactive theater to raise issues about climate in the sciences and engineering; a professional development fund to attract and retain women in the sciences and engineering at GVSU; and networking for women science and engineering faculty (within and outside the institution).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At GVSU, the interventions will address institutional factors impeding women's entry and retention in full-time, tenure-track positions in science and engineering and will offer opportunities for networking and support for professional development. At UM, the&lt;br/&gt;collaborative pipeline will benefit future faculty, whether ABD or PhD, as they gain vital&lt;br/&gt;classroom experience and are exposed to an alternative career path at an institution with a&lt;br/&gt;predominantly undergraduate focus. Given this focus, partnering with us will also help UM build in appropriate mechanisms to assess the impact of such programs on students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this project has implications beyond GVSU and UM: it will provide a model for collaboration between colleges and universities whose primary focus is undergraduate teaching and doctoral training institutions, with greater research emphasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
