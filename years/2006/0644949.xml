<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;McMahon, Katherine D.   &lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0644949&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Microbes and phosphorus: integrating engineering principles, ecology, and student learning to study eutrophication of freshwater lakes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. &lt;br/&gt;It is generally accepted that microbes (primarily algae and bacteria) control P-cycling in lakes, through their actions in both the water column and sediments. However, very little is known about the biochemical mechanisms involved in microbial P-cycling, or about the contribution of different taxonomic groups to specific P transformations. Recent studies of freshwater bacterial community dynamics in eutrophic lakes suggest that community composition varies significantly over time, and that this variation is correlated with changes in nutrient availability. A better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved, and how these may vary with community composition, will ultimately lead to an improved ability to predict the effects of lake management practices on water quality.  The PI  will be building strong connections to scientists at the UW Center for Limnology and at Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In turn, I will leverage ongoing efforts to build wireless sensor networks for lakes, and to foster international collaborations, both of which will provide tremendous opportunities for student training.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. &lt;br/&gt;Lake water quality is a problem that appeals to a vast majority of Wisconsin residents.  UW-Madison and its outstanding existing outreach infrastructure will help me to develop and assess outreach materials designed to promote an awareness of lake water quality and the Environmental Engineering and Science discipline, targeting multiple age groups. Staff in the NSF-Funded Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning will work with me and my graduate students to engage middle school students through a one-week inquiry-based instructional unit designed to introduce them to Environmental Engineering and Science. The PI will also have a unique opportunity to reach minority and disadvantaged high school students, through the Pre-College Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence. The PI has already demonstrated a strong commitment to teaching as research," in introductory Environmental Engineering course for undergraduates, and will continue to engage in this process in order to promote effective teaching and learning while striving to inspire the next generation of Environmental Engineers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
