<AbstractNarration>The TECHS-NJ program is recruiting, preparing, certifying and helping retain a new cohort of 26 science and mathematics teachers, who, upon graduation, hold baccalaureate degrees in Biology, Botany, Chemistry, Environmental Geology, Environmental Science, Geology, Mathematics, Physics or Zoology with New Jersey teacher certification and a job in the Newark Public Schools, a high-need school district.  New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Rutgers-Newark (RN), Newark Museum (NM, and Newark Public Schools (NPS) are bringing together existing STEM undergraduate programs, an urban education teacher certification program, high quality professional development and service activities that leverage other NSF supported programs, community building activities and support services while students are undergraduates and while they are in the early years of teaching.  The project's main components are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Recruitment of high achieving freshmen and sophomores at NJIT and RN and seniors in NPS high schools representing diverse student populations.&lt;br/&gt;2) Academic Preparation leading to a full academic degree in a scientific discipline or mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;3) Teacher Preparation provided through RN's Department of Urban Education which is designed to prepare students to teach in high need school districts.  Noyce Scholarship recipients participate in year-long, grant supported, inquiry-driven professional development programs,  mentor students who follow them in TECHS-NJ and hone their skills in a summer program for HS students at NJIT.   &lt;br/&gt;4) TECHS-NJ students have the resources of RN's and NJIT's many support services and participate in monthly community building meetings/activities. Students have both academic and teacher education advisors.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
