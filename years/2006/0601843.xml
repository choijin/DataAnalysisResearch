<AbstractNarration>The Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP), Phase IV, builds on the successes of the alliances over the past 15 years in increasing the number of qualified, underrepresented minorities participating in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce.   Phase I and II focused on the revision of the STEM curriculum to emphasize depth of understanding, promote active learning, incorporate technology, and develop broad-based mathematics skills.  Mentoring and research activities are standard support activities for undergraduate students matriculating in the alliance programs.  In Phase III, the alliance built on these academic enhancements by developing interactive web-based learning for mastery of difficult concepts, developing electronic modules to expand interdisciplinary capabilities of undergraduates, scaling up of the successful teaching/learning strategies, developing Information Technology skills in STEM students, and expanding the research and mentoring program to include a large number of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Phase IV, PR-LSAMP, through its systemic, integrative and collaborative approach that builds on institutional initiatives to improve STEM education will: (1) continue to increase the baccalaureate production of students in STEM disciplines; (2) continue to increase the number of students who complete a Ph.D program in a STEM field; (3) sustain the annual number of BS STEM graduates from PR-LSAMP institutions to provide a significant pool of STEM graduate degrees; (4) sustain and enhance the direct student support strategies that have proven successful to retain and motivate undergraduate STEM students to pursue graduate studies, such as undergraduate research experiences and mentoring, and (5) sustain the collaborative network among STEM faculty from the different PR-LSAMP institutions for exchange of and mentoring in the implementation of successful strategies to enhance the teaching and learning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An elaborate tracking system is in place to track the progress of Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) fellows.  PR-LSAMP tracks the academic progress of fellows while participating in BD programs and entrance into a Ph.D program as well as through completion of the Ph.D and entrance into the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alliance consists of the University of Puerto Rico System which includes two graduate centers (UPR-Rio Piedras and UPR Mayaguez); 6 four-year campuses (Humacao, Cayey, Arecibo, Aguadilla, and Bayamon; and the Inter-American University System, which includes two 4-year institutions (Bayamon and Metro).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation PR-LSAMP) is an alliance of three major higher education institutions in Puerto Rico with a total STEM undergraduate enrollment in the Fall of 2010 of 27,258, jointly working to strengthen STEM undergraduate education.  Created in 1991, the PR-LSAMP alliance aims at increasing the number of STEM BS graduates, and the number of BS graduates that enroll in graduate school and eventually complete a PhD degree in a STEM field.  As of June 2011, PR-LSAMP institutions have awarded 55,480 BS degrees in STEM fields (1991-2011).  To achieve this goal, PR-LSAMP works at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of undergraduate STEM education by transforming the teaching and learning culture of the participating institutions.  During Phase IV (2006-11) the following institutions are members of the PR-LSAMP alliance: University of Puerto Rico System, Inter American University System, and Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico.  The Polytechnic University of P.R. left the alliance at the end of Phase III, and no other institution was added in Phase IV.  Since the emphasis of Phase IV is to increase the number of BS graduates that continue on and complete a graduate degree, the current three institutions in the alliance are the main P.R. institutions with this track record.     During Phase IV, PR-LSAMP developed and implemented four main strategies:     1. Enhancing Students Knowledge and Skills for Graduate Studies     2. A Mentored Undergraduate Research Experience, including an annual local scientific forum for students to present their research projects, The Puerto Rico Interdisciplinary Scientific Meeting (PRISM), and travel stipends to present research results at national scientific conferences     3. A Role Model Series to expose students to successful professionals in science and engineering fields to motivate them to continue graduate studies.     4. The Annual Best Practices Conference on Teaching and Learning to continue to expose STEM faculty to successful strategies to improve the teaching and learning process, so as to increase the number of STEM students that obtains a BS degree and continue graduate studies.     The Bridge-to-the-Doctorate HRD/NSF Initiative, implemented in 2003, provides 2-year fellowships to former PR-LSAMP graduates to pursue graduate studies in STEM fields. As of July 2010, 94 fellowships have been awarded.     During Phase IV, PR-LSAMP major accomplishments are:  In the fall of 2010 27,258 students were enrolled in STEM fields at PR-LSAMP institutions.  This represents an increase of 14,686 students (5%) since 1991. In academic year 2010-11, 2,764 baccalaureate degrees were awarded in STEM disciplines.    The PR-LSAMP program has made a significant contribution to the NSF goal of a diversified STEM workforce.  It has increased the number of STEM PhD granted to Hispanics from PR-LSAMP Institutions in Natural Sciences from 302 for cohort 2000-05 to 413 for cohort 2004-09, a 37% increase; and the number of STEM PhD granted to Hispanic in Engineering from PR-LSAMP Institutions from 71 for cohort 2000-05 to 119 for cohort 2004-09, a 68% increase. At the local level, the University  of Puerto Rico's three graduate institutions, UPR-Rio Piedras, UPR-Mayaguez, and UPR-Medical Sciences awarded 44 PhD degrees in science and engineering in 2011. Of the seventy four (74) students that have participated in Activity #1, Enhancing Students Knowledge And Skills For Graduate Studies, since their freshman year, seventy-one (71) students, 96%, completed graduation and are in graduate school or working in the industry, eleven more than originally projected.    In academic year 2011-12, PR-LSAMP awarded 147 stipends ($117,600) to undergraduate STEM students to participate in research experiences and $29,400 were awarded by PR-LSAMP to researchers to cover laboratory materials for PR-LSAMP participants. Five hundred and thirteen (513) STEM students (...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
