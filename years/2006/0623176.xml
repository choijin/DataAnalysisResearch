<AbstractNarration>For the HSD initiative, Embryo research provides a case study of rapidly changing science within radically contested contexts. As with any science, embryo research is embedded in webs of unsettled ethical, legal, political, religious, cultural, and social negotiations that shape the conduct of science, its diverse meanings, and the spectrum of decisions built upon such understandings. Embryo research starts with a scientific drive to understand development of the individual organism and is shaped by three clusters of factors: (1) technical, including experimental techniques, equipment, and the way results are presented (in publications and presentations) and represented (in images and models); (2) actors, laboratory settings, institutions, and local contexts of scientific and technical work; and (3) social/cultural/ intellectual/economic environments in which the work is done. These clusters of Technical, Actors/Places, and Social/Cultural all impact and are impacted by the science. Understanding each requires different disciplinary research approaches, and understanding interactions requires multi-disciplinary research strategies and methods. The factors combine to serve as "Agents of Change" shaping science in society. This project explores those agents of scientific change in a dynamic, interactive, integrative, interdisciplinary, international research environment. With regards to Intellectual Merit, we will accomplish two major intellectual goals. First is a rich understanding of the history and current state of embryo research, the factors involved, and the multiple contexts in which research is done. Because of the importance of embryo research, this is of powerful intellectual value itself. Furthermore, in bringing together multiple otherwise disparate areas of study related to this particular case, we will achieve a much richer understanding of the Agents of Change influencing each case of scientific change. Our hypotheses focus on selected episodes in which different factors had different relative importance, and we seek to analyze and understand the Agents of Change over time. All results will be part of the digital working environment of the Virtual Laboratory (VL) in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. We will archive research materials to be shared among different working teams, and will add scholarly interpretive essays and articles that will make up an on-line Resource Collection accessible to multiple users, in addition to traditional scholarly publications. With regards to Broader Impacts,  this project has a several: (1) Working with a network of nearly 2 dozen collaborators in 6 countries and multiple disciplines, we will develop a true "collaboratory." By sharing materials and research questions, we will ask new questions within each discipline and learn of research materials, questions, and interpretations across disciplines. (2) The VL tested digital working environment makes that research possible by making all research materials and scholarly interpretations available to all users at all times. (3) The research will allow us to demonstrating how Agents of Change affect this case of Embryo Research in its societal contexts, including interpretations of the emerging patterns shaping science and societal decisions. This should also inform future decisions processes and policy-making. (4) In the final stages, we will develop Educational Materials for multiple user groups. A Postdoctoral Fellow, Graduate Student, and Undergraduates will all be members of the research team, and each will be trained individually while helping to add to the accumulating community results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding Agents of Change began as part of the Human Dimensions of Science and Technology Program, with the goal to document changes in embryo research and to discover patterns over time in the science and its relations to society.   We have developed an online database and peer reviewed publication through the Open Access Embryo Project Encyclopedia (embryo.asu.edu).   This includes digital items:  &bull; Over 300 entries in the form of short descriptive articles, with more in process  &bull; A half dozen experimental longer interpretive articles with more planned  &bull; 2000+ photographs  &bull; Videos, timelines, microscope slides, and other kinds of historical objects  This has required developing a process, captured in style guides and manuals, which will also be made available for all to use.  This involved:  &bull; Writing articles.  For the descriptive articles, this involved a seminar every semester with undergraduates and graduate students learning to identify, do research for, write, and revise a cluster or related articles.   &bull; Editing articles.  The graduate students developed an editing seminar and an editorial work flow. They also developed style manuals for all kinds of articles.  &bull; Marking up articles with relationships, triples, and other codes of use now or in the foreseeable future.  &bull; Coding metadata and identifying relationships and ontologies.  This has been done in collaboration with library and IT staff at ASU and the MBL. The supplements helped make this possible.  &bull; Establishing a repository for all the objects, in a form that will interconnect easily with others.  We selected d-Space, with Drupal web interfaces, though we also have experimented with and are compatible with Fedora and with Omeka and other interface systems.  The database serves as a repository for existing objects as well as for the articles being published.  It also makes it possible to ask new research questions, these are continuing to develop, and we are learning new ways of extracting, creating, and presenting knowledge in collaboration with others who are carrying out similar projects.  These include timelines and other ways of presenting data, for example, and also have put us in the position to move forward with further projects that develop new computational approaches.  For training, we have involved over three dozen undergraduates in all aspects of the work, a dozen grad students, and three postdocs.  The Postdocs and PI each semester offer a structured Embryo Project research seminar.  Undergrads and grad students participate, learn the system, write articles, and help us evolve our ways of working.  This process is in place, and it will continue. In addition, we have been working closely with 2 of our institutional collaborators, who have helped the informatics base for the project, and with individual collaborators who have helped develop research projects and ways of working across national borders.   Furthermore, beyond the individual project we have added to our own project to work with a dozen other History and Philosophy of Science digital projects to develop Digital HPS (digitalhps.org).  This is collaboration across projects with a commitment to sharing our software, develop methods for interlinking knowledge across projects, and sharing information technology expertise.  This has enormous potential for helping expand digital contributions to the field generally.  Further collaborations with computer scientist, including 2 in process now, already offer great promise for developing leadership in new computational HPS research.   The Digital HPS Consortium (http://www.digitalhps.org/index.php/Main_Page) provides a sustainable group of leaders of related projects, sharing resources, tools, and ways of working to help all projects become more efficient, more effective, and to expand their impact through linking and sharing.
