    <AbstractNarration>This project comprises studies that seek to answer basic questions arising &lt;br/&gt;in two areas of Probability Theory, Interacting Particle Systems and&lt;br/&gt;Percolation. They include the construction and application&lt;br/&gt;of nucleation processes&lt;br/&gt;taking place at the touching points of forward and backward&lt;br/&gt;paths in the (double) Brownian web and the conceptually related&lt;br/&gt;marking process on the ``double points'' of the (critical) continuum&lt;br/&gt;nonsimple loop process. This loop process, constructed by the PI&lt;br/&gt;and Federico Camia based on the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE)&lt;br/&gt;and the work of Schramm and Smirnov, is the full scaling limit&lt;br/&gt;for two-dimensional critical percolation. The double points,&lt;br/&gt;where the loops touch themselves and each other, represent the&lt;br/&gt;scaling limits of lattice sites where a change in microscopic state&lt;br/&gt;has a macroscopic effect on connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many situations, such as the functioning of the Internet&lt;br/&gt;and the behavior of engineered materials and of the economy,&lt;br/&gt;where many small individuals (web sites, molecules, investors)&lt;br/&gt;interact with each other in seemingly random ways leading to&lt;br/&gt;novel behavior of the entire system. A classic goal of Probability&lt;br/&gt;Theory and Statistics is to understand these situations. A particularly&lt;br/&gt;intriguing set of problems concerns so called ``critical'' systems&lt;br/&gt;where even one individual can provide a tipping point for the whole&lt;br/&gt;system. The goal of this research project is to lay a firm foundation&lt;br/&gt;for the mathematics needed to understand such critical systems, at least&lt;br/&gt;in some special situations where there have been theoretical breakthroughs&lt;br/&gt;in the past several years. It is hoped that progress in these&lt;br/&gt;special cases will lead to more general progress.</AbstractNarration>
