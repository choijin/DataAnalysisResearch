<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the development of advanced statistical methods'called constrained ranking and selection (R&amp;S) procedures'for selecting the best of a large number of alternative system designs. These competing designs are typically evaluated via computer simulation with respect to the expected value of a primary performance measure, subject to constraints on acceptable expected values of several secondary performance measures. All the relevant expected values of the selected primary and secondary performance measures must be estimated by sufficiently long runs of the corresponding simulation models. Further, this research investigates how to extend the resulting constrained R&amp;S procedures for use within each search step of a simulation optimization algorithm; and how to combine the extended constrained R&amp;S procedures with optimization search algorithms to handle a large search space. Finally, findings from this research will be applied to a real-world problem, namely, groundwater resource allocation in water resource planning and management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will develop generally applicable, statistically valid R&amp;S procedures for discrete optimization under uncertainty both on objectives and constraints; help industry to reduce costs and improve overall decision-making processes; and provide a solid foundation for applying the new procedures to areas in which these techniques are not yet popular'in particular, the filed of environmental and water resources management, whose problems have an enormous impact on public policy/health. More specifically, the groundwater resource allocation problem for the Savannah Georgia region will be investigated from the perspective of environmental water resources planning. Therefore, the completion of the proposed work will have a significant impact not only on the theory and methodology of industrial engineering and operations research but also on environmental and water resources management. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
