    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST-0649261&lt;br/&gt;Donald T. Gavel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at University of California Lick Observatory will construct an adaptive optics instrument and install it on a 1-meter telescope at the Mount Hamilton observatory site to demonstrate new component technologies and control techniques for the next generation of adaptive optics systems. The experiments are designed to prove the maturity of these technologies for use in instruments on large (10-30 meter diameter) telescopes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of this effort. Previously use of adaptive optics in night-time astronomical instruments has been restricted to infrared science wavelengths because of the complexity and expense of the system and the lack of suitably bright guide stars. The use of micro devices for wavefront control makes it feasible to implement high order adaptive optics on large aperture telescopes, and in particular enables the degree of correction and sky coverage necessary to correct wavefronts at visible wavelengths. In this experiment the PI will test a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) deformable mirror for real-time wavefront correction. The experiment will also include testing of a novel open-loop sensing and control architecture which will open up additional possibilities for adaptive optics corrections over a wide-field for multiple-object spectrographs. If successful, this experiment will not only provide a 1 meter telescope with adaptive optical performance in visible wavelengths, it will also demonstrate a technology that could substantially reduce the cost and complexity of adaptive optics systems for very large telescopes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The Lick Laboratory for Adaptive Optics employs a number of graduate students and post doctoral researchers in astronomy and engineering. Hands on experience in the laboratory, followed by hands on experience at the telescope, inspires student involvement in instrument design and provides valuable observing experience. It also educates the next generation of adaptive optics instrumentalists. Demographics of the research team include traditionally underrepresented groups: women, Native American, and Hispanic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
