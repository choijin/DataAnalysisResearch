<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for a continuing program of collaborative research in conformal quantum mechanics and its role in black hole thermodynamics. The aim is to obtain a definitive characterization of the thermodynamics and Hawking radiation for a large class of black holes using the near-horizon confromal symmetry in two dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal include the training of students in theoretical physics and broadening the participation of under-represented groups, especially students from the Hispanic community and female students in physics.</AbstractNarration>
