<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division Prof. Richard N. Zare of Stanford University and his postdoctoral and graduate student colleagues will examine chemical reactions with the most exquisite detail.  Prof. Zare and his group will continue their studies of state-to-state reaction dynamics in fundamental chemical systems, seeking to identify how chemical reactions depend upon the precise distribution of molecular excitation within the reacting partners, and to probe the deposition of the energy into the chemical products.  The ultimate goal of these studies is to understand, at the most fundamental level, the driving forces for chemical reactions.  The centerpiece of this work will be the study of the reaction and inelastic scattering of a hydrogen atom with molecular hydrogen.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Zare will continue to serve as a mentor to a diverse group of young scientists, and will continue in his wide ranging efforts at educating the public about the importance of science.  In this regard, Prof. Zare's service as a host of WONDERFEST is emblematic; WONDERFEST is a Bay Area celebration of science and attracts over one thousand people a year to learn about and debate upon current topics in science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report   During the grant period, the Principal Investigator has engaged in many different ways to address the public about science, and in particular, the objectives of this grant.  Specifically, the PI is the host of WONDERFEST, the celebration of science for the San Francisco Bay Area, which holds annually a two-day meeting, one day at UC Berkeley, the other day at Stanford University.  Many activities take place during this festival &ndash; several dialogues between experts on topics of current scientific interest, a contest among high school science students who compete for the WONDERCUP, a Klein bottle, and a contest between leading experts and the winning WONDERCUP high school team on science questions.  For more information, see www.wonderfest.org  In addition, two students from my laboratory participate annually in a science week that takes them to local elementary schools to introduce children to the wonders of science.  Moreover, the PI gives many talks inside and outside the US on the topic, "The Challenge of Sustainability."  This has included visits to Kyoto, Japan in which the PI spoke to approximately 500 high school students on this topic.  Most recently, the PI has authored an invited editorial in Angewandte Chemie (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201105242) titled "Why Help a Growing Scientific Giant?" which concerns fostering better relations between the US and China in the scientific arena.  Regarding specifically this grant, the PI presented a plenary lecture at COMET (conference on molecular energy transfer), which was held at Oxford University this past September. He also gave the opening plenary lecture at the 3rd Asian Spectroscopy Conference, Xiamen, China on November of this year, which again included work from this granting period.
