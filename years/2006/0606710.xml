<AbstractNarration>AWARD NO: AST-0606710&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ira Wasserman&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Long Term Variations in the Rotation of Neutron&lt;br/&gt;Stars&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;The research to be carried out here is a renewal of a project of the same title. Building&lt;br/&gt;upon this previous work in which the precession and nonlinear saturation of the r-mode&lt;br/&gt;instability of neutron stars was examined, Dr. Wasserman and collaborators/students will&lt;br/&gt;undertake two major computational projects. The first is a numerical study of vortex lines&lt;br/&gt;and magnetic flux tubes in neutron star interiors. The work is motivated by the need to&lt;br/&gt;understand the precession of pulsar PSR B1828-11 and whether its slow period&lt;br/&gt;contradicts a conventional neutron superfluid/proton Type II superconductor core model.&lt;br/&gt;Critical to this is the strength of drag forces between superfluid vortices and&lt;br/&gt;superconducting flux tubes, which will be addressed here (if the mutual drag force&lt;br/&gt;between superfluid vortices and superconducting flux tubes is too strong, long period&lt;br/&gt;precession would not be possible). Second will be a study of how the nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;development and saturation of the r-mode instability affects the spin evolution of new&lt;br/&gt;and old accreting neutron stars. Recent work by Dr. Wasserman's group (supported by&lt;br/&gt;the NSF previous award) has shown that the r-mode instability tends to saturate at lower&lt;br/&gt;amplitudes than originally thought but the implications of this result on the subsequent&lt;br/&gt;spin evolution of neutron stars remains unexplored.&lt;br/&gt;Through this work, graduate students at Cornell will be trained in advanced and&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary (astrophysics, gravitational physics, condensed matter) theoretical&lt;br/&gt;research. Dr. Wasserman participates in the Harlow Shapley Lectureship program and&lt;br/&gt;will continue to lecture regularly on forefront topics in astrophysics (including this&lt;br/&gt;project) to diverse audiences, which include members of the public and high school&lt;br/&gt;students in addition to faculty and students at the host colleges.</AbstractNarration>
