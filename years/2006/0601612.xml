<AbstractNarration>Jean-Claude Diels&lt;br/&gt;University of New Mexico&lt;br/&gt;0601612&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The aim of this project is to use the laser cavity as a sensor.  Although lasers had been used widely as sources, their unique environment for precision measurement had not been recognized.  Phase to frequency conversion inside laser cavities enable measurements of phase changes smaller than 1 part in 10 million.  These measurements can be applied to inertial sensing, magnetic field measurements, and nonlinear index (with an accuracy of 10-21cm2/W).  Another basic scientific contribution of this project is a novel spectroscopy with mode-locked lasers, with emphasis on repetition rate dependence, leading to improved stability and accuracy of sensors.  Materials to be investigated include atoms, biological membranes (exciting their resonances) and molecules.  The projected sensors will have two pulses circulating in an optical parametric oscillator cavity, pumped by an external cavity semiconductor laser sharing the parametric crystal with the signal cavity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Most laser systems of this research group are being designed and constructed in house, guaranteeing that each graduate is an expert in femtosecond lasers.  The experience in femtosecond phenomena accumulated over the last 30 years has been documented in a graduate textbook, and is culminating in a new type of sensor that will provide a tool for environmental detection and material studies.  Results of this project will be incorporated in two graduate courses (Modern topics and Optics Labs) of the Optical Science and Engineering Ph.D. program of UNM.  The NSF resources of the Research Education for Teachers will be used to enroll the participation of teachers from Albuquerque Academy and Sandia Prep (two selective High Schools) in the summer months of the program. This group will continue to welcome minorities (4 out of 7 graduate students were women during the previous NSF grant period) and newcomers to the mainstream of American society.  UNM is a Hispanic serving institution.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
