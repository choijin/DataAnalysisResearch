<AbstractNarration>Goriely&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0605029&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The general theme of the project is the study of growth,&lt;br/&gt;structure, and function in physical and biological systems&lt;br/&gt;through the use, and development of, nonlinear elasticity theory&lt;br/&gt;and the associated methods of applied mathematics.  The project&lt;br/&gt;is divided into three main lines of interconnected research: (i)&lt;br/&gt;the analysis and modeling of elastic growth in soft materials,&lt;br/&gt;such as biological tissue; (ii) the biomechanics of microbial&lt;br/&gt;systems including the study of force-driven penetration&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms, such as those arising in fungi that destroy crops;&lt;br/&gt;and (iii) the dynamics and stability of various elastic rods,&lt;br/&gt;cables, and pipes having important engineering applications.  For&lt;br/&gt;the first theme, the investigators and their students study the&lt;br/&gt;mechanical consequences of growth and its potential to either&lt;br/&gt;generate instabilities through changes in geometry and stresses,&lt;br/&gt;or to act as a mechanism to stabilize and regulate physical&lt;br/&gt;properties.  The goal of these studies is to gain insight into&lt;br/&gt;the fundamental coupling between growth and stress in many&lt;br/&gt;biological systems.  The second theme of microbial biomechanics&lt;br/&gt;involves the mathematical modeling of both bacterial and fungal&lt;br/&gt;systems.  The investigators formulate and analyze mechanical&lt;br/&gt;models of growing micro-organisms in order to understand their&lt;br/&gt;overall structure (e.g. the formation of appressoria in the&lt;br/&gt;rice-blast fungus) and their ability to invade host tissues by&lt;br/&gt;penetration (as found in many fungi), as well as the growth and&lt;br/&gt;structural changes exhibited by filamentary bacteria, such as&lt;br/&gt;those that are a natural source of antibiotics.  The description&lt;br/&gt;of these organisms combines a general formulation of membrane&lt;br/&gt;growth (based on the first research theme), the elastic modeling&lt;br/&gt;of cell walls undergoing large deformations, and the use of&lt;br/&gt;plasticity and fracture theory to describe penetration processes. &lt;br/&gt;The third theme of elastic rod dynamics involves the study of&lt;br/&gt;elastic tubes conveying fluids, and the dynamics of rods with&lt;br/&gt;constitutive coupling between twist and tension (hemitropic rods)&lt;br/&gt;-- a functionality that is relevant to the design of crane cable&lt;br/&gt;and other braided structures.  The analysis of filament&lt;br/&gt;instabilities is carried out through the use and extension of the&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear analysis techniques developed by the investigators in&lt;br/&gt;their previous work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project concerns the dynamics of filamentary structures&lt;br/&gt;such as pipes and rods and the physical analysis of growth&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms and invasion appearing in biological systems.  It is&lt;br/&gt;highly interdisciplinary in nature, cutting across the fields of&lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics, mechanical engineering, microbiology, and&lt;br/&gt;biomechanics, and addresses questions of both practical&lt;br/&gt;importance and mathematical interest.  The themes have a broad&lt;br/&gt;range of applicability in biology (morphogenesis), in biomedical&lt;br/&gt;engineering (analysis of soft tissues, their mechanical&lt;br/&gt;regulation and function), in understanding fundamental processes&lt;br/&gt;in biological invasion such as fungal penetration of tissues, and&lt;br/&gt;in classical engineering problems (pipes conveying fluids,&lt;br/&gt;instabilities in drilling).  The project also provides many&lt;br/&gt;attractive training experiences at different levels suitable for&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. &lt;br/&gt;These include opportunities to synthesize mathematical modeling&lt;br/&gt;with hands-on experimentation through the use of the Applied&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics Program's unique experimental facilities.</AbstractNarration>
