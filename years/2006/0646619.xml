<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;We propose a two-day conference at the Smithsonian Institution to examine the impetus for (and the impact upon) science, society and culture by the International Polar Years of 1882, 1932, and 1957. We intend to invite roughly two dozen scholars, mainly historians and scientists, from experienced researchers to advanced graduate students, to explore the origins of these campaigns and their role in the growth of global science (both the physical sciences and the human sciences), of professionalism, and of institutions in associated disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The overarching theme of the proposed conference is to explore the role of the three successive IPYs (International Polar Years) in the emergence of transnational scientific entities in the geosciences, identifying and assessing the importance of nation building and international competition and cooperation. Hunter Dupree (1967) may have been the first to recognize and articulate the inherent interest that governments of all forms have had in campaigns of exploration, and his observations have been extended and refined by William Goetzmann (1967) who has shown that whether or not governments paid the bills, still they benefited from the activity and facilitated them through the infrastructure of transportation and access (Thibodeau, 1985, 82). Of great need therefore is an assessment of how the IPYs stimulated the professionalization of the various disciplines within the geosciences, how they elucidated national styles, how they fostered the development of scientific instrumentation, and how they focused patronage for science. These are themes that to date remain largely unexplored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;We have planned this conference to coincide with an annual meeting of the History of Science Society. We will start on Wednesday morning 31 October 2007 just before the HSS meets (1 - 4 November). In this way we expect to reach as broad and varied a community of historians of science as possible. We also feel that the Washington DC site will promote attention among a far broader community of scholars and workers in fields that are impacted by the phenomenon of the IPYs, and who may be aware and curious about the legacy that had led to the fourth IPY, which will start in 2007. We also hope to reach out to scientists and policy makers alike in a special evening panel discussion. The panel will consider how historical perspectives can be communicated to contemporary scientists about to undertake the extended investigations organized as the fourth IPY, as well as how interested students and the public can engage the campaign. These aspects of the conference appeal directly to criteria specified in Program Solicitation NSF 05-588, page 13, item 7, paragraph 2. We will advertise this conference locally to take advantage of the fact that Washington is home for many scholars interested in global issues. We will also take advantage of the Smithsonian Institution's visibility to attract an audience beyond the professional scientific organizations in the Washington DC area. We intend to edit and publish the peer-reviewed proceedings of the conference, and once NSF support is secured, will seek a publishing subvention to do so, most likely a soon-to-be re-vitalized SI-internal "Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Publishing Program", which will be available in 2007. We are seeking support from the NSF mainly for travel stipends for a mixture of domestic and foreign scholars, including students, hoping to attract some from regions that have been traditionally underrepresented. Support is also sought for an administrative intern and associated costs of preparing and disseminating information about the meeting. We are approaching NSF as the primary supporter of this activity. Once NSF funding is approved, we will be seeking supplemental funding.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
