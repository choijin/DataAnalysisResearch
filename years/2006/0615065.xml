<AbstractNarration>Animals initiate movements either in response to specific stimuli (such as touch, sound &lt;br/&gt;or light signals), or as a result of an internal change in state (such as hunger). One &lt;br/&gt;important aspect of such voluntary animal movements that has received relatively little &lt;br/&gt;attention is their episodic nature, with distinct beginnings and endings. Much is already &lt;br/&gt;known about the networks of nerve cells that control rhythmic movements like flying and &lt;br/&gt;swimming, but the nervous system components that control the initiation and &lt;br/&gt;termination of rhythmic behavior are largely unknown. The experiments funded by this &lt;br/&gt;grant are designed to significantly advance the understanding of how nervous systems &lt;br/&gt;process information generated by brief sensory stimuli and how they thereby produce &lt;br/&gt;episodic locomotion. &lt;br/&gt;Experiments will be conducted on isolated central nervous systems of the medicinal &lt;br/&gt;leech using two different approaches. One approach is electrophysiological, with &lt;br/&gt;experiments to investigate connections among nerve cells that control the initiation and &lt;br/&gt;maintenance of swimming movements. The second approach is pharmacological, with &lt;br/&gt;studies on the neurohormone serotonin and on other messenger molecules to learn &lt;br/&gt;how these substances are involved in converting the quiescent motor system into one &lt;br/&gt;that is functionally active. Because there is significant functional similarity between &lt;br/&gt;swimming and related locomotory movements in all animals and because the &lt;br/&gt;transformation of a system from quiescence to activity and back to quiescence is a &lt;br/&gt;feature of all episodic animal movements, insights gained from this research will have a &lt;br/&gt;major impact on our understanding of how the nervous system controls animal &lt;br/&gt;movements generally. &lt;br/&gt;The activities funded by this grant have a broader impact on science by increasing the &lt;br/&gt;opportunities for undergraduates, primarily women, to conduct scientific research at &lt;br/&gt;Bryn Mawr and at the University of Virginia. Also, experiments conducted in the &lt;br/&gt;research laboratory are subsequently incorporated into laboratory exercises for &lt;br/&gt;advanced neurobiology courses at both institutions. Finally, training is provided to &lt;br/&gt;graduate students in modern electrophysiological recording techniques, data &lt;br/&gt;acquisition, and analysis. Results from these experiments are widely disseminated &lt;br/&gt;through posters at scientific meetings, including student presentations at local science &lt;br/&gt;fairs and scientific meetings; publication in scientific journals; lectures open to the &lt;br/&gt;public; and demonstrations on animal behavior at K-12 schools.</AbstractNarration>
