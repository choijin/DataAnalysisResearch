<AbstractNarration>CAMP Summary&lt;br/&gt;The Louis Stokes California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) a ?Phase III?&lt;br/&gt;Alliance funded by the National Science Foundation, is a prime University of California&lt;br/&gt;initiative to diversity the student population and the future faculty. Phase IV will&lt;br/&gt;continue the grant, HRD No. 0115115. UC Irvine serves as the lead campus and fiscal&lt;br/&gt;agent, under the established cooperative agreement. The primary goal of the eight UC&lt;br/&gt;campus partners (Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, San&lt;br/&gt;Diego and Riverside) is to significantly increase the number of B.S. degrees granted to&lt;br/&gt;undererepresented minority students in STEM (science, technology, engineering,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics) majors at the University of California and to prepare these students&lt;br/&gt;competitively for the nations top graduate schools. This is accomplished through shared&lt;br/&gt;best practices, networking, and a cultural change in the campus climate. CAMP represents&lt;br/&gt;a systemwide community of UC faculty, program staff, and students working toward a set of&lt;br/&gt;shared goals, including not only B.S. degree completion but continuation on to graduate&lt;br/&gt;school, completion of the Ph.D., and entry into the scientific and engineering workplace.&lt;br/&gt;This collective effort has contributed to a 78% increase in B.S. degrees granted by UC&lt;br/&gt;from the baseline year (1990-91), for a total of 12,396 bachelors degrees awarded to date&lt;br/&gt;to underrepresented minorities by UC. In addition to faculty mentored research experiences&lt;br/&gt;and peer mentoring and tutoring, principal activities include collaborative learning,&lt;br/&gt;presenting at scientific conferences, science writing and co-authorship, technology&lt;br/&gt;proficiency, and preparation for advanced degrees. Graduate education is currently&lt;br/&gt;supported by the supplemental activity, Bridge to the Doctorate, which currently has three&lt;br/&gt;cohorts, hosted respectively at UCLA, UCI, and UC San Diego. The Bridge Fellows represent&lt;br/&gt;a robust effort to encourage and support minority graduate education and completion of the&lt;br/&gt;doctorate. The Bridge to the Doctorate also represents the foundation for continuing the&lt;br/&gt;AMP program into Phase IV.</AbstractNarration>
