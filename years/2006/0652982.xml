<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to establish a sustainable high school/community college/University of Utah transition process that will nurture students and increase the number of engineering and computer science graduates by at least 180 per year. The project is in keeping with a statewide initiative in Utah and represents a grass-roots effort by enthusiastic partners. The project is student-centered and includes activities designed to improve partnership relationships between the University of Utah and feeder institutions. The project also establishes a Community Impact service learning community that includes interdisciplinary projects in the planning, preparation, and presentation of hands-on engineering modules aimed at high school students. The modules are based on real-world engineering applications. As part of this project a market survey is being conducted using state-of-the-art tools to determine why Utah students do or don't choose engineering or computer science as a major.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to increase the number of engineering graduates at the University of Utah.  This is part of a national effort to increase the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) graduates.  From 2006-2014, the enrollment in the College of Engineering grew students (66.7%) from 2000 to 3331.  This is considerably greater than the national increase in enrollment for the same time period of 45% (ASEE Profiles of Engineering and Engineering Technology Colleges 2013).  The number of engineering graduates went from 360 to 484 and is expected to continue to increase as the larger student body progresses through their programs.  This project contributed to that growth through high school recruitment efforts where undergraduate Engineering Ambassadors regularly visited local high schools, libraries, and other community events with hands on engineering projects, supported Engineering Days, Meet an Inventor Night, Girl Scout Night, and other on campus events and tours, and a summer Engineering Camp.  Although most of our programming over the grant period did not specifically target women, we made certain that our activities would appeal to a broad audience.  To our delight, this has apparently been effective, as the number of women in the college has increased by 121% during this grant.  In 2007, women were 11% of the undergraduate enrollment. Now (2013-14), they are 15% of the undergraduate student enrollment.       Last Modified: 08/06/2015       Submitted by: Cynthia Furse]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
