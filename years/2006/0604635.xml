<AbstractNarration>Milewski&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0604635&lt;br/&gt;Tabak&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0604520&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The atmosphere and ocean are stratified fluids and as such&lt;br/&gt;support the propagation of disturbances through internal waves. &lt;br/&gt;These internal waves may deform nonlinearly and break by&lt;br/&gt;overturning, leading to the mixing of the ambient fluid.  Both&lt;br/&gt;the atmosphere and ocean also display strong shear flows that may&lt;br/&gt;become unstable, producing rolls that can also lead to mixing and&lt;br/&gt;local homogenization of the density.  The investigators study the&lt;br/&gt;issue of which of these two processes prevails in a given flow&lt;br/&gt;configuration.  Based on preliminary work, the investigators&lt;br/&gt;conjecture that in the shallow water regime there is a sharp&lt;br/&gt;boundary below which the dynamics disallow shear instabilities,&lt;br/&gt;leaving only wave breaking as the possible mixing mechanism.  In&lt;br/&gt;mathematical terms, they consider systems of partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations of mixed type, where the hyperbolic domain corresponds&lt;br/&gt;to the internal waves and the elliptic domain to shear&lt;br/&gt;instability.  The question of nonlinear stability of the flow can&lt;br/&gt;then be formulated in terms of whether the solutions themselves&lt;br/&gt;can make the system become elliptic.  The investigators have&lt;br/&gt;proved that this cannot happen for a simple system and here&lt;br/&gt;extend the result to much more general scenarios.  In addition to&lt;br/&gt;this stability result, they propose a closure that quantifies the&lt;br/&gt;mixing taking place when waves break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Understanding and quantifying fluid mixing is a key&lt;br/&gt;ingredient in global weather and climate studies.  The atmosphere&lt;br/&gt;and ocean are stratified fluids: fluids whose density varies&lt;br/&gt;(primarily) with height due to temperature, salinity and other&lt;br/&gt;effects.  Stratified fluids allow for the propagation of internal&lt;br/&gt;waves, and these waves may eventually break and mix the fluid. &lt;br/&gt;Another possible source of mixing is due to shear instabilities:&lt;br/&gt;the formation of eddies at the interface between flows of&lt;br/&gt;different speeds.  In this project the investigators study which&lt;br/&gt;of these two effects is more likely to prevail given the ambient&lt;br/&gt;conditions.  Such a study has far-reaching implications: the&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric and ocean mixing layers control the coupling between&lt;br/&gt;the two, and hence exert a critical control on the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;the climate.  The work advances the predictive capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;coupled atmosphere-ocean models, by improving their&lt;br/&gt;parameterization of fluid entrainment and mixing.  It also trains&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students in the use of applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools for the advancement of the natural sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
