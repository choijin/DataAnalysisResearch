<AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to NSF 05-1788, category Unsolicited. This research project aims to advance the fundamental knowledge and process technology for manufacturing of novel stable carbon nanotube (CNT) aerogels. By combining the extraordinary properties of CNTs with those of aerogels, a new class of materials will become accessible with far reaching possibilities. Stable CNT aerogels will not only avoid the limitations of traditional carbon aerogels and CNTs, but also have unmatched multifunctional material properties in a single material system, which will potentially lead to highly diversified applications in multifunctional composites, fuel cells, super capacitors, 3-D batteries, solar cells, advanced catalyst supports, energy absorption materials, chemical and biological sensors, power-generating and energy-storing structural composites, hydrogen storage, etc. The major innovation is to create synergistic marriage of two outstanding materials (i.e. aerogels and CNTs) via judicious nanoengineering. The nanoengineering approach includes two key aspects: 1) Rational engineering of CNT surfaces; 2) 3-D assembly of CNTs through chemical cross-linking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a robust nanoengineering process for the fabrication of stable CNT aerogels and the advances in fundamental understanding of this new class of materials will lead to a variety of energy- and materials-related applications. This project provides unique educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. This proposed research, if successful, will enable the PI to initiate broad collaborations with researchers at universities, NASA, DOE, DOD as well as various companies in order to reduce discoveries into real applications and products. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
