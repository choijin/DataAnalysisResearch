<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL ID: 0437169&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Richard Berk  and Robert D Mare&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTIONS: UCLA&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Ensemble Methods for Data Analysis in the Behavioral, Social and Economic &lt;br/&gt;Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analysis of observational data in the behavioral, social, and economic sciences is &lt;br/&gt;commonly undertaken with statistical modeling. Over the past decade, another approach &lt;br/&gt;to data analysis has been evolving in applied mathematics, computer science, and &lt;br/&gt;statistics that some have called ``algorithmic.''  There is usually no effort to construct a &lt;br/&gt;model of how the data were generated. The goal is to link a set of inputs to one or more &lt;br/&gt;outputs so that some clear objective function is optimized by a computer algorithm. This &lt;br/&gt;proposal focuses on ``ensemble methods,'' which are an especially promising special case &lt;br/&gt;of algorithmic methods. The goal this is to help foster more effective interactions &lt;br/&gt;between the developers of ensemble methods and empirical researchers in the behavioral, &lt;br/&gt;social, and economic sciences. The approach is to apply, using real data sets, ensemble &lt;br/&gt;methods to important social science data analysis problems. These include 1) evaluation &lt;br/&gt;procedures for complex computer simulations, 2) diagnostic procedures for conventional &lt;br/&gt;statistical models, 3) adjustments for confounding in observational studies, and 4) &lt;br/&gt;classification and prediction exercises when the response variable is highly skewed. In &lt;br/&gt;each case, the performance of the ensemble methods will be compared to the &lt;br/&gt;performance of conventional modeling using ten assessment criteria detailed in the &lt;br/&gt;proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed application of ensemble methods to real data sets should have several &lt;br/&gt;broad benefits for the behavioral, social and economic sciences, as well as for the &lt;br/&gt;mathematical and statistical sciences. Powerful and rapidly developing data analysis &lt;br/&gt;tools, under the broad rubric of "data mining," will be applied to difficult data analysis &lt;br/&gt;problems. These exercises will illustrate strengths and weakness of ensemble methods for &lt;br/&gt;certain kinds of demanding empirical research. This experience will help inform the &lt;br/&gt;behavioral, social, and economic sciences about when ensemble methods can be useful &lt;br/&gt;and what their limitations can be. Equally important, the applications will provide a  ``test &lt;br/&gt;bed'' for a variety of ensemble methods from which will likely emerge potential &lt;br/&gt;refinements in existing ensemble procedures and new technical questions insufficiently &lt;br/&gt;addressed in the current literature.  Thus, the mathematical and statistical sciences can &lt;br/&gt;benefit as well. Finally, each of the data sets to be used is potentially rich in substantive &lt;br/&gt;implications.  Although the emphasis in this proposal is methodological, it is entirely &lt;br/&gt;possible that the data analyses to be undertaken will also be instructive from subject-&lt;br/&gt;matter perspective.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
