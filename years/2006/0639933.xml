<AbstractNarration>The meeting brings together economists, psychologists, and other experts to develop national accounts of well-being. The national accounts of well-being will represent the status of the nation in terms of its well-being, including factors such as life satisfaction, feelings of engagement at work, health and relationship satisfaction, and trust in one's neighbors.  The purpose of national accounts of well-being is to complement economic indicators by assessing a broader set of outcomes from governmental policies, the impact of science, and an assessment of the degree to which a nation's competitiveness and innovative success lead to the enhancement of quality of life.  The Declaration of Independence of the United States famously advances the idea that there are three fundamental human rights -- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The national accounts of well-being will help assess how successful the nation is in terms of the "pursuit of happiness."  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The national accounts of well-being can be used by policy makers and other citizens to judge the impact of science on society. By making a society more prosperous, more challenging and engaging, less burdensome, healthier, and so forth, science can greatly enhance the well-being of societies, and the national accounts of well-being can give a window into this process. The national accounts of well-being are proposed at this time because the measurement of well-being has proceeded to the point where its strengths and limitations are known.  In addition, there are now compelling examples of where well-being measures can shed light on policy issues. The meeting will bring together international experts on well-being and its measurement, as well as individuals who are knowledgeable about policy assessment, in order to explore the most desirable form of the national accounts, to analyze the areas where the well-being accounts are most likely to yield information beyond economic measures, and where research is still needed. The national accounts of well-being can help create a better society that is happier, more competitive, more tightly integrated, and more prosperous by giving feedback about where we are succeeding of failing in terms of national well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
