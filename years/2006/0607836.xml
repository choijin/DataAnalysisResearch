<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The research to be carried out here centers on the transportation of mass and angular&lt;br/&gt;momentum in protoplanetary disks surrounding young stars. "Turbulence" or "eddy&lt;br/&gt;viscosities" have been invoked to solve a variety of problems, including the transport of&lt;br/&gt;angular momentum outward from a disk to allow mass to accrete onto a central protostar,&lt;br/&gt;the accumulation of dust to produce planetesimals, and their ability to act as an enhanced&lt;br/&gt;viscosity which allows planetesimals or planets to migrate radially in the disk away from&lt;br/&gt;the regions in which they formed. However, computing the transport of angular&lt;br/&gt;momentum, dust, planetesimals, and planets within a disk using transport rates from&lt;br/&gt;"eddy viscosities" may well be incorrect. Here, the sustainability of another process,&lt;br/&gt;magnetohydrodynamic turbulence (which is highly dissipative) and its ability to transport&lt;br/&gt;angular momentum, will be studied as a function of the disk's ionization. In addition, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator's previous work has shown that vortices are efficient at transporting angular&lt;br/&gt;momentum. His 3D modeling further indicates that grains can be trapped in these vortices&lt;br/&gt;and concentrated. Using two new codes, one a hybrid particle/gas code and the other a&lt;br/&gt;two-phase flow code in which one phase is the gas and the other is the dust, the&lt;br/&gt;accumulation of dust in the disk's mid-plane, in the vortices that form within a disk, and&lt;br/&gt;in the inter-eddy regions of the turbulence will be examined. All of these locations have&lt;br/&gt;been suggested to be regions where dust concentrates and then undergoes agglomeration&lt;br/&gt;or instability to produce planetesimals. A proposed scenario by which protoplanetary&lt;br/&gt;disks fills with vortices will also be investigated. In this model a small, initial&lt;br/&gt;perturbation produces weak internal gravity waves. Those waves, in a rotating, shearing&lt;br/&gt;stratified flow, create vortices. The vortices are not steady, but oscillate, creating new&lt;br/&gt;gravity waves, and the disk fills with waves and vortices.&lt;br/&gt;The tools employed here are applicable to other problems as well, including the&lt;br/&gt;circulation of Jupiter's atmosphere, modeling wake-vortices produced by wide body&lt;br/&gt;aircraft, and the role of particulates in climate pollution. The results of this work will be&lt;br/&gt;disseminated to the public through public lectures and popular articles. A graduate&lt;br/&gt;student will be supported and trained in numerical modeling of fluid flows.</AbstractNarration>
