<AbstractNarration>AWARD NO: AST-0606764&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gordon McIntosh&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Minnesota Morris&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: RUI: SiO Maser Studies&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the SiO maser emissions from long period/Mira variable stars.&lt;br/&gt;The maser radiation originates within several stellar radii of the surface and can be used&lt;br/&gt;as a probe of the physical characteristics of these outer regions and of the dynamics of the&lt;br/&gt;star. The maser pumping mechanism itself is still the subject of debate with both&lt;br/&gt;collisions and radiation being suggested. Moreover, the variability seen among maser&lt;br/&gt;emissions from Miras may be the result of shocks passing through the extended&lt;br/&gt;atmospheres of these stars.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to allow the continuation of an ongoing observational program&lt;br/&gt;using the remote observing capabilities of the Haystack Radio Astronomical Observatory&lt;br/&gt;in Massachusetts to follow the maser emissions of Miras. The result will be an SiO maser&lt;br/&gt;data set of approximately six years duration with high phase coverage and velocity&lt;br/&gt;resolution for the stars Mira and R Cas. The data will provide the basis for an improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the SiO maser pumping mechanism and the dynamics of the&lt;br/&gt;circumstellar region in which the masers originate. The extended duration of the&lt;br/&gt;observations is important to reduce the effects of random variations that occur during&lt;br/&gt;individual phase cycles in maser locations and velocities. A second goal is to complete a&lt;br/&gt;re-survey of stars previously observed in 1983. Comparisons between these and new&lt;br/&gt;measurements will be made to statistically describe the variations in the velocity centroid&lt;br/&gt;over time. Large shifts in the velocity centroid may indicate the presence of a binary&lt;br/&gt;partner. Stars discovered to have large shifts will be monitored in a search for the orbital&lt;br/&gt;parameters of the system. Finally, the orbital parameters of at least two SiO maser&lt;br/&gt;sources, R Aql and Mira, will be determined using published and archive data along with&lt;br/&gt;new observations of the maser emission as a velocity probe.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will be trained through direct involvement in the data acquisition,&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and interpretation. Students will further be expected to co-author and present&lt;br/&gt;their results in publications and conferences. The work will also be included in a variety&lt;br/&gt;of undergraduate courses as an example of astronomical concepts, data analysis, the&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics of maser emission, the physical parameters of the circumstellar&lt;br/&gt;environments that generate SiO masers, and binary stars. Moreover, the research&lt;br/&gt;proposed here is expected to considerably enhance the research climate at the University&lt;br/&gt;of Minnesota Morris and in a physics department recognized for a traditionally high&lt;br/&gt;fraction of women graduates.</AbstractNarration>
