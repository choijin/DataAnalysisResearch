<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 0604759&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jon Wolfson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the question of the existence minimal lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds in Kaehler-Einstein manifolds and special lagrangian submanifolds&lt;br/&gt;in Calabi-Yau manifolds using variational and deformation techniques and using&lt;br/&gt;mean curvature flow. The ``Lagrangian Hodge Conjecture'' states that given an&lt;br/&gt;integral lagrangian homology class in a Calabi-Yau manifold there is a special&lt;br/&gt;lagrangian cycle that represents this class. This conjecture is now known to&lt;br/&gt;be false in a Calabi-Yau surface (a K3 surface). The failure of the conjecture&lt;br/&gt;is closely related to the existence of singularities (other than branch&lt;br/&gt;points) on minimizing lagrangians.  This project aims to answer a related&lt;br/&gt;conjecture, the ``Deformation Lagrangian Hodge Conjecture'': Given a&lt;br/&gt;one-parameter family of Calabi-Yau metrics whose associated Kaehler forms have&lt;br/&gt;fixed cohomology class and given a lagrangian homology class, suppose that the&lt;br/&gt;initial metric in the family admits a special lagrangian cycle that represents&lt;br/&gt;the lagrangian homology class. Then, we conjecture, that the metrics in the&lt;br/&gt;one-parameter family sufficient close to the initial metric also admit special&lt;br/&gt;lagrangian cycles that represents this class. This conjecture has been&lt;br/&gt;established in the two dimension case (the case of special lagrangian surfaces&lt;br/&gt;in K3 surfaces) and in the case that the initial special lagrangian is an&lt;br/&gt;immersion. It is known that the mean curvature flow of a smooth lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;submanifold preserves the lagrangian condition if the ambient manifold is&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler-Einstein. The project intends to investigate various questions about&lt;br/&gt;the behavior of lagrangians under this flow, in particular, to study examples&lt;br/&gt;that can be used either to give counter-examples to the Thomas-Yau conjecture&lt;br/&gt;or show that any such counter-example must be global.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variational problems with geometric constraints, deformation problems and mean&lt;br/&gt;curvature flow in codimension greater than one are on the frontier of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis. These problems are natural in geometry but they are&lt;br/&gt;also important in many different applied problems. For example, in material&lt;br/&gt;science a model problem asks to find a minimizer of ``kinetic energy'' among&lt;br/&gt;area preserving maps between disks and to find the optimal smoothness of the&lt;br/&gt;minimizer.  Parts of this project are closely related to this kind of&lt;br/&gt;existence and regularity question and therefore to developing techniques at&lt;br/&gt;the foundations of the theory of non-linear elasticity. In string theory, a&lt;br/&gt;branch of theoretical physics, well known work conjectures the existence of a&lt;br/&gt;certain class of volume minimizing three dimensional surfaces called special&lt;br/&gt;lagrangian submanifolds. This project is a direct attempt to resolve this&lt;br/&gt;conjecture.  Mean curvature flow in various codimensions models many different&lt;br/&gt;physical phenomena, including, for example, flame propagation. This project&lt;br/&gt;attempts to exploit the ``lagrangian'' constraint to get an understanding of&lt;br/&gt;mean curvature flow in higher codimensions. The techniques investigated in&lt;br/&gt;this project hold the promise of enhancing the interaction between geometry&lt;br/&gt;and various fields of applied mathematics and engineering and in bringing new&lt;br/&gt;results and techniques into these fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
