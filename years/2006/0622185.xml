<AbstractNarration>Realization of High-Throughput Real-Time Nano-Imager&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0622185&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Seng-Tiong Ho, Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Imaging materials or objects at smaller than the optical diffraction limit is of great interest to nano technologies. Current approach based on Near-field Scanning Optical Microscope (NSOM) has found wide usages. NSOM, however, has various limitations such as the very low light power throughput (10-3 to 10-6) of its metal-coated fiber tip and its reliance on very slow mechanical scanning. The proposed works aimed to develop new technology that will enable the realization of novel nano-imaging devices by engineering a high-speed nano-pixel photodetector array that can be used by itself or with an integrated super-focusing lens made up of negative dielectric constant material. The nano-imager will be capable of real-time imaging and high light throughput without mechanical scanning. These works will help to form the technological foundation for future nano-photodetectors and imagers, and will have broad applications to nano-technologies, meso-scopic physics, molecular chemistry, engineering, materials science, biotechnologies, and many other areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The works will also generate new knowledge in nano-device design, materials science, nano-materials simulation, and new physical understanding of the novel materials or devices, and will have potentially broad impacts on science and technology much beyond the project proposed here. Thus, the realization of the high-throughput real-time nano-imager will benefit U.S.'s competitiveness in the nanotechnology areas with potentially significant economic impacts. The PI is a member in the NSF NCLT-National Center for Learning and Teaching in Nanoscale Science and Engineering at Northwestern University. The nano-imager will also be used as an interesting teaching tool that can be incorporated to teach the students the new physics associated with nano-imaging. The students can also learn to use the nano-imager to observe moving nano-objects. Through the NCLT Web based teaching, the knowledge learned in the research will be disseminated widely to benefit the next-generation of scientists and engineers nationally.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
