<AbstractNarration>Modern Nuclear Physics rises to the challenge to understand how the complex&lt;br/&gt;structure of hadrons and nuclei at low energies emerges from Quantum Chromo&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics QCD, the fundamental theory of strong interactions. Effective Field&lt;br/&gt;Theory, the model-independent, systematic description at low energies, has&lt;br/&gt;lead to a vibrant interplay between experiment and theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is a better understanding how the internal structure&lt;br/&gt;of nucleons and few-nucleon systems emerges from QCD: The heart of its&lt;br/&gt;approach are model-independent estimates of its theoretical uncertainties&lt;br/&gt;which in turn lead to reliable determinations of nuclear binding effects and&lt;br/&gt;few-nucleon forces. Both encode essential information about QCD. I merge this novel&lt;br/&gt;description with well-developed but sophisticated numerical techniques to&lt;br/&gt;extend it into the realm of light nuclei. Besides the intrinsic interest, I&lt;br/&gt;will investigate few-nucleon reactions which are hard, if not impossible, to measure&lt;br/&gt;but essential for Astro-Physics (e.g. in big-bang nucleo-synthesis or&lt;br/&gt;supernovae) and for tests of extensions of the Standard Model of Particle&lt;br/&gt;Physics. Such an approach is in addition vital to compare and understand&lt;br/&gt;proton and neutron properties with a minimum of theoretical prejudice. I therefore&lt;br/&gt;provide model-independent parameterisations and predictions in close contact with a&lt;br/&gt;variety of current and upcoming experiments. One focus is to extract the&lt;br/&gt;nucleon polarisabilities, and in particular the so-far poorly explored&lt;br/&gt;spin-polarisabilities, which contain essential information on the constituents&lt;br/&gt;and spin-structure of the nucleon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With research and teaching inseparable in higher education, I will train&lt;br/&gt;both undergraduate and graduate students in communication and teaching skills&lt;br/&gt;in a non-traditional format, enabling them to raise the general standard of&lt;br/&gt;scientific literacy. Students will apply the acquired skills in GW courses for&lt;br/&gt;school teachers and high-school pupils in the DC area, where the&lt;br/&gt;socio-economic and educational indicators are particularly low.</AbstractNarration>
