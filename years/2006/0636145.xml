    <AbstractNarration>Funds are being provided via an interagency transfer to provide cost sharing for ongoing and new projects being conducted under the auspices of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP).FY05 funds are requested for cost sharing seven ongoing projects: 1) incremental support for a NOPP project entitled "PARADIGM (Partnership for Advancing Interdisciplinary Global Modeling)" led by Lewis Rothstein (University of Rhode Island); 2) annual funding of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl; 3) support for the MOSEAN project awarded to Tommy Dickey of UCSB as part of the FY02 NOPP BAA; 4) support for the Ocean.US office; 5) the first of three year's support for a study entitled "Community Sediment Transport Model" led by Rocky Geyer (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) funded as part of the FY06 BAA; 6) support for a joint NSF-ONR effort entitled "SWIMS3" that examines ocean microstructure led my Mike Gregg (University of Washington); and 7) ONR support of an interagency Ocean Education event entitled "CoOL - Conference on Ocean Literacy". The Office of Naval Research continues to be the lead agency to implement and fund many NOPP research and education programs. This arrangement helps to centralize and better control fiscal management, using cost sharing funds provided by other partnering agencies.</AbstractNarration>
