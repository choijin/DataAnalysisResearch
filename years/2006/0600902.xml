<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to understand how to process large quantities of data being generated by high density, high speed sensor-intense inspection systems. The approach to accomplish this objective is to formulate a new fundamental understanding of computational metrology, as it relates to the computational geometry techniques used in accelerated computer graphics. This formulation will ultimately be realized on graphical processor units that are incorporated into most computer video cards. Graphically intensive computer applications such as games have driven a significant increase in the capabilities of these cards, and made them readily available on most computer systems. The newly reformulated metrology algorithms will operate orders of magnitude faster on these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include improved inspection and quality control capabilities for a wide variety of manufacturers.  Manufacturers that will benefit the most are those whose product is high precision and high volume. In particular, firms targeting the micro and nano manufacturing sectors will be able to efficiently and cost effectively monitor and improve their processes and products. Such an increase in quality control will ultimately yield a stronger and more competitive position for manufacturers in the United States, in a variety of sectors including the emerging areas of MEMS, micro and nano-systems.</AbstractNarration>
