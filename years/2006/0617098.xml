<AbstractNarration>Some citizens cleave to strong partisanship, prejudging potentially new information, filtering and interpreting it in accordance with strongly held beliefs.  Others are much more open-minded and deliberative by their nature.  Most of us, of course, fall somewhere in between.  Whether a political event, speech or news story stimulates in us a thoughtful mulling over of alternatives or triggers an impulse to rally around a particular partisan flag depends on how issues are framed and linked with familiar linguistic and pictorial symbols, particularly those that signal threat or stimulate enthusiasm, anxiety or aversion.  This is the focus of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study undertakes an analysis of three possible responses to new political circumstances: 1) seeking additional information, 2) seeking a balance of information from multiple perspectives, and 3) exhibiting openness to compromise.  In initial research, strong evidence of the importance of the distinction between an anxious and an aversive response to new information was uncovered.  This leads to a rethinking of the overused and potentially misused characterization of 'negativity' in political rhetoric and advertising.  This research was based on the study of a single issue, at one point in time and with a student population.  In this study, our initial results are tested - over time, over a diverse population and over a range of political issues including 1) economic well being, 2) physical health, 3) physical safety and security, 4) threats to core values, 5) threats to ethnic and religious identity, and 6) threats to national identity.  This work is designed to establish a fresh line of scientific inquiry on human attention and inattention to complex political stimuli utilizing novel measurement strategies and research design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involved a systematic content analysis of 120 real-world news stories from which 30 sets of evocative 'stimulus stories' were developed in the form of manipulated online news narratives.  These materials were presented to student and non-student adult subjects including video, text and graphic images as a test of a new, personalized, computer-based 'News Machine.'  This analysis included validity testing and focus group research to better understand the dimensionality of this domain and the character of short-term individual responses to risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second year, we selected ten now relatively well-understood stimulus sets for a 10-week, four-wave panel study of a nationally representative sample of 900 adults in coordination with Knowledge Networks Inc. The use of the relatively rare panel design and a field rather than laboratory setting permits the analysis of more realistic behaviors resulting from exposure to political news under different conditions.  Real-time online information seeking behavior is assessed through an innovative methodology pioneered by Knowledge Networks.  Individual versus collective responses to news stimuli are also a subject of measurement development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to publication of these analyses we anticipate a broader impact beyond social science scholarship in five domains of active politics and policy including -- 1) civic engagement, 2) campaign reform, 3) media policy, 4) new media institutions and, 5) international civil society.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
