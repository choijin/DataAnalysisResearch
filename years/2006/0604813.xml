<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This is part of the AIMS Conference Series on Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations, a biennial event working with a different hosting university each time, to benefit all international researchers in the broad field.  For each meeting, some world-renowned experts of the highest caliber are invited to deliver plenary addresses.  A key feature has been the active participation by and interaction among established researchers, young scientists and graduate students.  Junior researchers are especially benefited by a round-table panel discussion, in each meeting, led by leaders in the field.  Furthermore, a refereed high quality proceedings is published for each meeting. The AIMS Conference Series has clearly developed into the international platform in the field for exchange of ideas, reporting of new achievements, discussions on new and emerging applications, and interaction and collaboration. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This platform is being highly recognized by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from academia and industry working in the proximity of analysis, different equations, dynamical systems, and applications.  For this meeting, the invited plenary speakers include Alberto Bressan (USA),  Odo Diekmann (Netherlands), Pierre-Louis Lions (France),  Alexander Mielke (Germany), Masayasu Mimura (Japan), Peter Polacik (USA), Patrizia Pucci (Italy), Bjorn Sandstede (UK), and Lan Wen (China).  This list represents the authorities in multi-disciplines ranging from theoretical aspects of differential equations and dynamical systems, to numerical methods, to computations, to control and optimization,  and to mathematical models arising in physics, biology, medicine, and engineering.  The backbone of the meeting is the organization of the many special sessions of top quality representing all major areas of current research.
