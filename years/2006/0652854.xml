<AbstractNarration>This research is devoted to various aspects of many-body theory in quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics, as well as some&lt;br/&gt;problems in quantum information theory and pure mathematics. These various topics&lt;br/&gt;have grown out of a body of research over several decades and the underlying unity is&lt;br/&gt;that solutions in the various problem areas shed light on each other. A broader impact&lt;br/&gt;of this activity is that students and postdocs will be involved in these projects, which will&lt;br/&gt;combine mentoring with research and help produce the next generation of&lt;br/&gt;mathematically knowledgeable physicists. It will also further the interdisciplinary bonds&lt;br/&gt;between the communities of mathematicians and physicists and promote the relevance&lt;br/&gt;of modern concepts of mathematical analysis to problems of condensed matter physics.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is contained in the following partial list of specific&lt;br/&gt;research goals.&lt;br/&gt;1. Low density Bose gases are now in the forefront of research {experimentally and&lt;br/&gt;theoretically) and it is intended to continue the previous successful work on the ground&lt;br/&gt;state energy, as well as the question of Bose-Einstein condensation and its relation to&lt;br/&gt;superfluidity. One question concerns the simultaneous occurrence of solidity and&lt;br/&gt;superfluidity. Another is to validate&lt;br/&gt;Bogolubov's second term in the expansion of the ground state energy. A third is to see if&lt;br/&gt;the excitation spectrum of the Lieb-Liniger one-dimensional model can be established&lt;br/&gt;for realistic three-dimensional gases used in experiments.&lt;br/&gt;2. Various topics and conjectures concerning magnetization and long-range order in the&lt;br/&gt;Hubbard model of correlated electrons will be investigated. In parallel, an attempt will be&lt;br/&gt;made to prove long-range order in the ground states of two-dimensional Heisenberg&lt;br/&gt;models. Both models are presently important in condensed matter physics.&lt;br/&gt;3. A fundamental statistical-mechanical property of matter is the existence of the&lt;br/&gt;`thermodynamical limit of the free energy. A proof of this has been only partially&lt;br/&gt;accomplished so far when the electromagnetic radiation #eld is taken into account. It is&lt;br/&gt;intended to complete the demonstration.&lt;br/&gt;4. To study the renormalization problem in quantum electrodynamics (QED), especially&lt;br/&gt;with regard to the many-body and bound state aspects. This continues a successful&lt;br/&gt;non-perturbative study begun under the previous grant in which we developed a model&lt;br/&gt;of relativistic QED that makes sense for bound states. A complete theory has not yet&lt;br/&gt;been invented, and it is important to try to do so because QED is one of our&lt;br/&gt;fundamental physical theories.&lt;br/&gt;5. An attempt will be made to verify the long-standing conjecture that the maximum&lt;br/&gt;negative ionization of a large atom is only about one electron. It is very di#cult, even&lt;br/&gt;with computers, to be sure about ionization of atoms, but nature seems to be telling us a&lt;br/&gt;universal fact about fermions that it would be desirable to understand from first&lt;br/&gt;principles.&lt;br/&gt;6. Several topics in quantum information theory and closely related #elds. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;a proof (or disproof) will be sought for Holevo's additivity of entropy conjecture. Success&lt;br/&gt;here will imply that entangled states cannot improve the capacity of quantum channels.</AbstractNarration>
