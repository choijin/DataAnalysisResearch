<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II research project addresses safety, user -interface, and performance challenges uncovered in Phase I while adapting a haptic robot to the manufacturing environment for medium-production-run paint spraying. Haptics is an exciting field, but industry adoption has been slow. Yet without haptics in applications like medium-run paint spraying, the two alternatives (fully automated or fully manual) are unappealing. Robots are prohibitively expensive to program for short runs, and fully manual operations endanger worker health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technologically revolutionary haptics field has not yet revolutionized manufacturing. Some manufacturing tasks lack good alternatives, especially in medium run production, where one must choose between high-cost, time-consuming robot programming versus poor worker health. Physical robot-craftsperson interaction will benefit these middle applications, if safe and intuitive. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
