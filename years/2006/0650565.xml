<AbstractNarration>During the past 40 years great progress have been made in understanding the functional&lt;br/&gt;basis of anatomical diversity of organisms. More recently, researchers have begun to&lt;br/&gt;unravel the genetic and developmental basis of anatomical structures. To understand&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary transformations, one needs to analyze changes at genetic, developmental, and&lt;br/&gt;phenotypic levels, as well as the integration between these levels. This requires the&lt;br/&gt;construction of genetic, developmental and functional/selectional scenarios. Current&lt;br/&gt;interest focuses on genetic and functional/selectional scenarios. Developmental scenarios&lt;br/&gt;that convincingly link genetic and functional/selectional scenarios are scarce, but see&lt;br/&gt;Beldade et al. 2002 for an example). It is essential to include knowledge of developmental&lt;br/&gt;processes for a continued integration of developmental genetics and morphology. Most&lt;br/&gt;morphological structures develop under the influence of many genes. Therefore, to&lt;br/&gt;comprehend the evolution of the development of these structures, an understanding is&lt;br/&gt;needed of how the involved genes interact, directly or epigenetically, in steering&lt;br/&gt;morphogenetic patterning. The symposium and accompanying contributed paper and poster&lt;br/&gt;sessions will provide a strong stimulus for integrative studies that link developmental&lt;br/&gt;biology, genetics and functional morphology.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: There is a wide gap between what is known about the activity of genes&lt;br/&gt;and their role in morphogenesis. Therefore, we perceive an urgent need to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;communication among geneticists, developmental biologists and morphologists. The symposium&lt;br/&gt;and associated activities (contributed paper and poster sessions) will provide important&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for scientists with these two approaches to learn how their different&lt;br/&gt;perspectives and methodologies can be used to broaden interpretations and generate more&lt;br/&gt;robust and testable hypotheses that will shed light on the evolution of vertebrate&lt;br/&gt;structure.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The symposium and associated activities (contributed paper and poster&lt;br/&gt;sessions) will be held at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and&lt;br/&gt;Comparative Biology, a well-established international meeting that attracts a broad&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of biologists who are interested in interdisciplinary approaches. Symposium&lt;br/&gt;papers will be published in Integrative and Comparative Biology.</AbstractNarration>
