<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Biology Directorate, Prof. Judy E. Kim of the University of California, San Diego, and her graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will work to develop a better understanding of the mechanics of the folding, insertion and aggregation of membrane-bound proteins in biological systems.  Prof. Kim and her group propose to do this with a powerful suite of spectroscopic tools, including steady state and time-resolved resonance emission spectroscopy (fluorescence, phosphorescence, and UV resonance Raman) along with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membrane proteins are believed to comprise roughly 30% of all cellular proteins, and these serve important biological functions as gates, pumps, receptors, energy transducers, etc.  Prof. Kim will also develop new biophysically-oriented courses (undergraduate and graduate,) and she will work to bring biophysical topics (e.g. protein misfolding and how it relates to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease) to a wider audience, through community outreach efforts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Membrane protein folding is a critical area of research because this fundamental process is relevant to a wide range of topics, including protein misfolding diseases, drug development, and pathogenesis.  Experimental and computational efforts over the past decade have focused on the energetics, rates, and overall mechanisms associated with membrane protein folding.  Some general thermodynamic principles have shaped our understanding of folding in membranes, but molecule-specific interactions within the bilayer remain largely unknown.  A key goal of our research program was to elucidate the structural evolution of key amino acids, such as the aromatic residues, that serve as protein anchors in bilayers.  A molecular understanding of protein-lipid interactions is crucial to develop a comprehensive and unifying picture of membrane protein folding.  In this project, we combined thermodynamic studies and vibrational spectroscopy to study integral membrane proteins and membrane-associated peptides.   We selected an array of biomolecules that allowed us to probe systems with different binding/insertion motifs and functions.  For example, we studied biomolecules in which the folding reaction in a bilayer causes membrane disruption; these so-called anti-microbial peptides are an innate component of our natural immune systems.  We also focused on engineered peptides that can be studied both experimentally and in simulations with collaborators.  Finally, we probed integral membrane proteins, such as Outer Membrane Protein A (OmpA), to elucidate folding mechanisms.  This array of proteins allowed us to probe the different structures and functions associated with membrane-associated biomolecules.  Results from the experiments on membrane proteins and peptides helped reveal the diversity of molecular interactions that guide biomolecules to fold in vesicles, and shed light on the mechanisms of insertion.  An important theme and insight from this project is that membrane proteins are specifically stabilized by the lipid environment that surrounds them, and fold with the assistance of lipids.  This aspect of protein-lipid interactions must be included in models of membrane protein folding.  These studies of molecular interactions were complemented by experiments that probed the mechanisms of protein insertion into bilayers.  Our results revealed that secondary and tertiary structures evolve on similar timescales, supporting the hypothesis that OmpA folds in a concerted process.  A slower process was also identified, and may reflect protein and/or bilayer equilibration.  An important goal of the current project was to promote teaching, training and learning; graduate and undergraduate education was enhanced through the development and optimization of courses, and mentoring of diverse groups of students.  Additionally, the researchers on this project participated in community outreach events that engaged non-scientists and young girls in science.  The motivation for these educational activities is to train and inspire a new generation of scientists who will have the technical and academic capabilities to become scientific leaders, and also to share the deep relevance of science to everyday life.
