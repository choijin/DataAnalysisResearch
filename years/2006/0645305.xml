<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Strongly correlated oxides exhibit exciting and technologically useful properties: examples include high temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance. Recently, ruthenates became a new focus within this field since they exhibit diverse and fascinating physical properties, such as unconventional forms of superconductivity and magnetic ordering.  One of the most remarkable characteristics of ruthenates is that their properties can be tuned with external stimuli such as magnetic field, chemical composition, or pressure, which offers a unique opportunity to study the physics of novel quantum phases. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at Tulane University is to search for novel quantum phenomena in ruthenate materials and investigate their underlying physics. Understanding of novel physical phenomena in ruthenates is not only important for the development of the basic science of materials, but also has potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials. This project will be integrated with educational activities. A new course in materials science will be developed for Tulane Interdisciplinary Experiences program, which provides incoming freshmen students with an environment for interdisciplinary learning. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research of this project. In addition, this project will also provide research opportunities to minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Strongly correlated oxides exhibit exciting and technologically useful properties: examples include high temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance. Recently, ruthenates became a new focus within this field since they exhibit fascinating ordered ground states. Spin-triplet superconductivity, metamagnetic quantum criticality, itinerant ferromagnetism, and antiferromagnetic Mott insulating behavior have all been found in close proximity to one another. These diverse and tunable ground states offer a unique opportunity to study the physics of novel quantum phases. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at Tulane University is to search for novel quantum phenomena in ruthenate materials and investigate their underlying physics. The specific research plan includes studies of novel quantum phase transitions, metamagnetism, bulk spin valve behavior, and orbital-related physics. Understanding of these phenomena in ruthenates is not only important for the development of the basic science of materials, but also has potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials.  This project will be integrated with educational activities. A new course in materials science will be developed for Tulane Interdisciplinary Experiences program, which provides incoming freshmen students with an environment for interdisciplinary learning. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research of this project. In addition, this project will also provide research opportunities to minority students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
