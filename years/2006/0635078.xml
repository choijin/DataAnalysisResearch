<AbstractNarration>Abstract of project: Efficient algorithms and data structures via geometric realizations&lt;br/&gt;Assaf Naor&lt;br/&gt;When one needs to perform an algorithmic task on a large data set it is often the case that the best&lt;br/&gt;way to fathom the massive amount of information contained in the data is to visualize it geometrically. By&lt;br/&gt;representing the input as a geometric object one can observe certain helpful features, such as clusters or&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional structures within the data, and harness this structural information to solve the algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;problem at hand. In recent years the geometric approach to the design of algorithms has been greatly enhanced&lt;br/&gt;by the use of powerful methods from modern mathematics. This research project is at the frontier&lt;br/&gt;both for mathematics and computer science. Using ideas from analysis and geometry, combined with modern&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic methods and intuitions, the investigator's study will lead to advances on central algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;primitives for a wide variety of tasks ranging from combinatorial optimization and machine learning to&lt;br/&gt;information retrieval and bioinformatics.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to embed data into a well understood geometric object (such as Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;space), so that certain essential features of it are preserved. This makes it possible to harness intuitions and&lt;br/&gt;methods that were not available before the embedding was performed. The investigator will develop new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools for the study of algorithms for partitioning and clustering large networks, techniques for&lt;br/&gt;dimensionality reduction, constructions of compact representations of data, and methods for fast similarity&lt;br/&gt;search and classification. The proposed research will be of interest to computational scientists in a broad&lt;br/&gt;range of areas. The connection between mathematics and computer science will be deepened in order to&lt;br/&gt;disseminate powerful new ideas for algorithm design.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
