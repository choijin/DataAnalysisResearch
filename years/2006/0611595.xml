<AbstractNarration>Howard University, the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Prince Georges Community&lt;br/&gt;College (PGCC) are joining together in this Partnership for Research and Education in&lt;br/&gt;Materials (PREM). The shared goal is to systematically identify and support students from&lt;br/&gt;under-represented minority communities. The PREM project will enable them to a)&lt;br/&gt;envision, b) train for, and c) begin materials science and engineering careers. Each step is&lt;br/&gt;as important as the next. The PREM team combines sophisticated approaches for&lt;br/&gt;advanced materials science and engineering research with demonstrated success in&lt;br/&gt;recruiting, supporting and training African-Americans for materials related careers.&lt;br/&gt;Scientific training occurs in the context of research. The PREM team will study nanowire&lt;br/&gt;growth and phenomenology in three areas which join together established research efforts&lt;br/&gt;in the JHU Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) and at Howard.&lt;br/&gt;They are 1) transport properties in Bi nanowires; 2) transport properties in InN nanowires;&lt;br/&gt;and 3) fabrication of dipolar nitride nanowires for nonlinear optical elements. The PREM&lt;br/&gt;will assist Howard's efforts to better integrate its primarily African American student body&lt;br/&gt;into the international research community and improve its materials education&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure. The PREM will provide Howard undergraduates summer research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities at Hopkins and graduate students will be able to do a significant part of their&lt;br/&gt;research in the Hopkins MRSEC. There will be co-advising of Howard PREM students by&lt;br/&gt;Hopkins MRSEC PIs, and pairing of senior JHU MRSEC students as preceptors with&lt;br/&gt;Howard PREM students. Hopkins will benefit when well-prepared Howard graduates&lt;br/&gt;enroll. PGCC students involved in PREM activities will have opportunities for summer&lt;br/&gt;research at Howard. PGCC and Howard have an existing articulation agreement, which&lt;br/&gt;the students can use to continue their studies. PREM support for materials education at&lt;br/&gt;Howard and PGCC will improve interdisciplinary materials education. Few freshmen know&lt;br/&gt;what materials science or engineering is. This is even more the case for community&lt;br/&gt;college students who tend to come from minority communities or are first in their family to&lt;br/&gt;attend college. PGCC has designed web based guided inquiry courses which are not only&lt;br/&gt;effective ways of teaching science but also a good introduction to research. PGCC will&lt;br/&gt;take the lead in producing materials centered, guided-inquiry software suited to college and&lt;br/&gt;high school classes. Broad dissemination of the modules will inform students about the&lt;br/&gt;impact materials have on their lives and attract them to materials related studies. The webbased&lt;br/&gt;modules can be used for undergraduate courses and by high school students taking&lt;br/&gt;AP courses. This PREM will build a pipeline for materials research careers among African&lt;br/&gt;Americans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader Impacts:  In 2006, Howard, Johns Hopkins and PGCC won an NSF PREM award, a program that brought together a research university, Hopkins, an historically black university, Howard, and a community college, PGCC.  In 2010, Gallaudet, the National Deaf University joined with us.  NSFÆs purpose was to knock down research and research training silos opening them to minority serving institutions.  The PREM partners broadened this remit to develop an innovative and successful program that brings nontraditional populations into the materials science pipeline and nurtures them. Scientific training occurs, of course, in the context of research.  By providing initial training at Howard, both Howard and PGCC students were prepared to make strong positive impressions at Hopkins.  An Email from one of our Hopkins partners puts this in perspective:  In terms of the "transfer student" issue, I am also sure that the experience of one of our students, who came from a community college, was the difference-maker in giving him the confidence to apply to top research universities to complete his BachelorÆs degree.  He had offers of admission from at least two such schools, and selected one after being offered a full scholarship.  To have reached this level of achievement, including likely co-authorship on two manuscripts now in preparation, from a community college level of preparation is simply astounding.   But the PREM program also was a difference maker for some at Hopkins. The letter goes on:  One other benefit to my own group that I should mention:  one of the postdoc mentors is now applying for academic positions, and has obtained an instructor position at a local college as a steppingstone.  I am confident that his experience in mentoring diverse students is serving him well in this new role, and is a highly positive.  The PREM has created imaginative educational material.  Scott Sinex at PGCC has authored a large collection of materials science Excelets on topics ranging from bonding in crystals to conductor and semiconductor IV curves.  Excelets are small Excel spreadsheets that can be used for discovery based education.  They are being used worldwide, and can be downloaded from http://academic.pgcc.edu/~ssinex/ excelets/matsci_excelets.htm.   Intellectual Merit:  While training occurs only in the context of research, research must be the bedrock of any NSF program.  The PREM has made contributions in several areas. Tito HuberÆs group has a longstanding interest in using nanowires as thermoelectric materials.  They have recently shown that the mobility of electrons on 50 nm Bi nanowires is 2/3 of the value for unsuspended graphene and twice that for Bi2Te3.  At 50 nm, there is an interesting quantum effect excluding charge carriers, either electrons or holes, from the center core of the nanowire while the surface charge density remains high.  Because the electron spins on the surface are all pointing in the same direction, the Bi nanowires may be useful for spintronic applications, where information is transmitted faster and using lower energy than in normal electronics.   Gary Harris and Josh Halpern have developed novel, catalyst free methods for growing a variety of nanowires, including GaN, InN, and SiC.  These high speed materials with a range of bandgaps, can be electrical, optical, electro-optical and perhaps mechanical elements with potential for operation at high temperatures in some cases.  Silvina GaticaÆs group numerically models the absorption of gases, on a variety of nanomaterials that have been proposed for gas storage, or for use in separating gases such as carbon dioxide and methane from natural gas streams.  Computations such as hers can be used for designing better materials as well as understanding how those materials behave.  Jason Matthews group collaborates closely with Howard Katz group at Hopkins and Paul Sabila at Gallaudet.  Their research program seeks to synthesive single molecules for chemical vapor ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
