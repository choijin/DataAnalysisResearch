<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;CHE-0616800&lt;br/&gt;Scherson/Case Western Reserve&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Daniel Scherson and his group in the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University explore aspects of interfacial structure that control the dynamics of heterogeneous oxidation and reduction of nitrogen and sulfur oxides and oxyanions in aqueous electrolytes.  They develop and implement in situ spectroscopic techniques that enable direct probing of chemical processes at metal-solution interfaces.  Methods include resonance and surface enhanced Raman, ultraviolet-visible normalized differential reflectance, and second harmonic generation.  Attention is focused on the binding and reactivity of small nitrogen- and sulfur-containing molecules to metal surfaces of well defined microtopography, either bare or modified by transition metal macrocycles.  An important thrust of the project involves the development of strategies for monitoring interfacial dynamics with high spatial resolution and temporal resolution down to the sub-microsecond scale.  Implementation of dual beam coincidence tactics provides specificity for detection of two or more species adsorbed on single surface.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information obtained from this project improves our fundamental understanding of chemical reactions, including formation and dissociation of chemical bonds involving molecular and ionic forms of nitrogen and sulfur oxides.  Interest in this class of compounds spans a wide variety of disciplines, ranging from atmospheric sciences and toxicology to catalysis and neurobiology.  As a result, students involved in this research are exposed to a broad range of both fundamental and applied disciplines, and become well suited to face the challenges posed by a multitude of yet unresolved highly interdisciplinary problem areas, particularly those related to nanoscience, medicine and biotechnology.  Close links with Hathaway Brown, a private women's K-12 institution in the Cleveland area, allows extension of these research opportunities to high school students.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
