<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL #: 0638723&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Mitchell Wayne&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: GK-12: The Notre Dame extended Research Community (NDeRC)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Notre Dame extended Research Community (NDeRC), a new GK-12 project between the University of Notre Dame and eleven K-12 school districts in Indiana and Michigan, focuses on research activities for graduate students, K-12 teachers and students.  These activities that center on such areas as astronomy, physics, chemistry, computer science and engineering, are developed by graduate students and experienced teachers and are then implemented in the K-12 classroom.  The research activities are connected to nationally recognized education programs such as QuarkNet (a previously funded NSF project, award # 0207072), TLRBSE and Supercomputing Education Programs.  The goals of NCeRC are: 1) to incorporate graduate students into the life and work of the Notre Dame QuarkNet Center so as to instill a sense of responsibility to and provide a model for education and public outreach, 2) to provide a research experience to a wider range of K-12 teachers and students in surrounding areas, 3) to strengthen and expand avenues of collaboration between University and surrounding K-12 institutions.  This project provides research experience in the sciences for those who traditionally would not have had the opportunity.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
