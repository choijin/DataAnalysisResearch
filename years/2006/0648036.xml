<AbstractNarration>This workshop will provide a forum for members of the U.S. astronomy community to share ideas about priorities for the many scientific opportunities that are being opened for exploration at meter and centimeter radio wavelengths, and to discuss how best to exploit those opportunities.  Planning for the future of U.S. astronomy at meter and centimeter wavelengths is at a crossroads.    Where the US radio community should focus its efforts toward  a next generation instrument is uncertain.   A major new facility in this wavelength range, the Square Kilometer Array, is being actively planned internationally, and the US role in this project, among other possible initiatives, will be discussed at this workshop.</AbstractNarration>
