    <AbstractNarration>The 6th biannual meeting of the U.S.-Japan Natural Resources Panel on Earthquake Research will be held in Tokushima, Shikoku, Japan on November 8-11, 2006. The PIs of this proposal have requested funds to support the travel costs for 8 early-career scientists to attend. The technical sessions will focus on great interplate earthquakes and tsunamis, transient deformation and seismic phenomena including slow slip and nonvolcanic tremor, predictability of the earthquake system, and results from in situ studies in deep mines and deep bore holes. The panel will focus on important geologic sites on Shikoku that are affected by great earthquakes and tsunamis off the coast of this area. A post-meeting field trip will provide the opportunity to see signs of past catastrophic tsunamis, unique facilities for earthquake disaster prevention, as well as a major active fault, the Median Tectonic Line. The U.S. members of the panel include USGS (lead), NSF, NASA, SCEC, IRIS and UNAVCO. The total U.S. delegation is expected to number about 20-25.</AbstractNarration>
