<AbstractNarration>0316453&lt;br/&gt;Abbaschian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports a joint research project between Dr. Reza Abbaschian, Department of Materials Sciences and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida and Dr. Sayed F. Moustafa, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute (CMRDI), Helwan, Egypt.  They plan to investigate producing nano-sized copper-alumina composites by using two novel methods of powders preparations, namely, Cu-coated alumina powders, and Cu-alumina composites powders produced by mechano-chemical method. The powders will be cold pressed and then sintered using conventional powder metallurgy techniques. The copper-alumina composites produced by the above mentioned methods will be compared to those produced by conventional powder metallurgy techniques.  It is expected that the novel coating techniques will lead to better thermal and electrical conductivities, better particle/matrix interface adhesion, higher stiffness, and high temperature strength than the composites produced by the conventional technique. The physical and mechanical properties of the composites will be correlated with the processing parameters in order to provide a science base for their manufacturing. The developed composites can be used for heat sink applications, welding electrodes, bearing and high temperature electrically conducting materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:  Materials with high thermal conductivity and high elevated-temperature strength have been required for certain applications such as spot welding electrodes, seam welding wheels, conductors, and electrical switches.  Copper based-alloys that are currently used for such applications, exhibit excessive creep and low high-temperature strength.  Copper-based ceramic composites in general, and copper - alumina composites in particular, are potential alternatives. The composites, if properly processed, can provide excellent high-temperature strength without sacrificing other attractive properties of the alloys.  This project involves multidisciplinary fundamental and applied research efforts where the two teams collectively contribute to developing a new technique for processing of nano-sized alumina particulate reinforced copper matrix composites with desired properties. The project will help introduce the science and technology of composites' fabrication to US and Egyptian industries as well as educating students and training scientists in both countries. The two organizations have had collaboration in the past in areas of training and education of students and scientists in microstructural characterization area, and this project will extend that collaboration to areas of powder and composite processing.</AbstractNarration>
