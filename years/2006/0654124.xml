<AbstractNarration>The goals of this Grant Opportunities for Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project are to experimentally and analytically characterize the stress based failure criterion for sheet materials; to incorporate the criterion into finite element models of the sheet metal forming process; and to exploit the material phenomenon through process innovations. Past research has shown that the stress based failure criterion is path independent or at least less sensitive to the deformation path than the commonly used strain based failure criterion. First, a biaxial test apparatus will be used to characterize the stress based failure criterion for advanced alloys. Using this experimental data, analytical and numerical models will be developed to assist designers determine the correct process variation in order to prevent tearing concerns. Finally, process innovations for both deep drawing and stretch forming will be implemented to exploit this material behavior. This research will add significantly to the scientific knowledge base for this emerging material characteristic.&lt;br/&gt;There are several broader impacts from this research.  First, improved failure prediction methods will benefit society at large through a reduction in the time to market of new products and more aggressive product designs, which will decrease the weight and cost of components. Graduate students will also benefit from the potential to work with industrial partners as summer interns. Furthermore, the results of this research will be directly integrated into course material thus impacting the education of students. Finally, to ensure that the results of this research are effectively disseminated to industries, a set of workshops will be conducted at Alcoa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
