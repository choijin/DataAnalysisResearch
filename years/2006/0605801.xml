<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on fundamental phenomena in condensed matter and materials. It contributes to the intellectual foundations of future cyberinfrastructure. The PI seeks a better understanding of coherent photo-magnetism in semiconductor nanostructures. The control of magnetization of a medium by ultra-fast laser pulses may be an efficient way to provide fast memories and information processing. In many magneto-optic devices, the control of the magnetization is realized through thermal effects produced by the absorption of light or by photo-doping. In this project, the PI will investigate the theory of much faster non-thermal and non-dissipative control methods in which the light is not absorbed by the medium. Given recent advances in nano-optics techniques, this coherent optical control can be realized at the nano-scale.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate coherent photo-magnetic effects in bulk, quantum dots, and micro-cavities. He plans to consider nano-systems based on Mn-doped semiconductors, which are currently being investigated for their ferromagnetic properties. Light can induce magnetic phase transitions in these materials and it can also control the critical temperature and the orientation of magnetization. The PI aims to identify materials, structures, and control parameters for an optimal implementation of this coherent control, and to address fundamental questions on the nature of ferromagnetism and phase transitions under strong and non-equilibrium light-matter coupling.&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve collaborations with theorists and experimentalists in the EU and in the US. With cofunding from the Europe and Eurasia Program in OISE, the PI aims to initiate collaboration with a theorist in Greece and provide international research experience for students. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project and will be trained in quantum optics, solid state physics and statistical mechanics. The research involves the development of a suite of computational tools for the calculation of the nonlinear optical properties of magnetic semiconductors that will be made public. The involvement of students in the development of those tools will enable them to expand their skills in designing numerical codes to solve complex problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on fundamental phenomena in condensed matter and materials. It contributes to the intellectual foundations of future cyberinfrastructure. The PI will investigate how quantum mechanical states in materials can be manipulated by lasers and the novel phenomena that arise as a consequence. Of particular interest is the mechanism through which light can manipulate magnetic states of impurities in semiconductors and nanostructures and new phenomena that can arise. The PI aims to address fundamental questions on the nature of ferromagnetism and phase transitions as a consequence of the strong interaction of light with materials.&lt;br/&gt;Optical control suggests an intriguing active approach to materials science: the goal of such studies lies beyond the investigation of the general optical properties of materials, and directly focuses on fundamental condensed matter and quantum phenomena that may lead to the design of optical devices with a functional role in, for example, memories, information processors, or network components. This project may impact information technology by laying the intellectual foundations of phenomena that may lead to new, non-dissipative and reversible methods of computation and data storage, based on light. These coherent control schemes will suggest new ideas for quantum computing implementations, as well as for present technology applications, such as magneto-optical recording or tunable magnetic switches and amplifiers.&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve collaborations with theorists and experimentalists in the EU and in the US.
