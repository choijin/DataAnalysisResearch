<AbstractNarration>Bacteria belonging to the phylum Acidobacteria are ubiquitous and abundant in&lt;br/&gt;soil. Despite this, we know very little about soil Acidobacteria; only a small&lt;br/&gt;portion of the genetic diversity within the phylum has been surveyed and the&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic relationships of acidobacterial taxa have not been adequately resolved. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the physiological characteristics of Acidobacteria and their ecological roles in&lt;br/&gt;soil remain largely unknown. One major reason for this is that Acidobacteria are poorly&lt;br/&gt;represented in soil culture collections as they are difficult to culture using traditional&lt;br/&gt;culturing strategies. This project has two objectives: 1) to survey and describe the&lt;br/&gt;genetic diversity of soil Acidobacteria, and 2) to improve methods for the cultivation of&lt;br/&gt;soil Acidobacteria in vitro so their physiological characteristics can be assessed. To&lt;br/&gt;meet these objectives, we will collect six distinct soils from across the United States and&lt;br/&gt;build acidobacterial-specific clone libraries from extracted DNA to describe the&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic diversity of soil Acidobacteria. We will then use a PCR-based screening&lt;br/&gt;approach to identify the specific conditions, or set of conditions, under which&lt;br/&gt;Acidobacteria are most efficiently cultivated from soil. Our goal is to isolate and culture&lt;br/&gt;those Acidobacteria which, from the results of the soil clone libraries, are found to be&lt;br/&gt;numerically abundant in the collected soil samples. Since our previous work suggests&lt;br/&gt;that soil Acidobacteria are strongly oligotrophic, we expect that Acidobacteria can be&lt;br/&gt;most effectively cultured with nutrient-poor media and prolonged incubation times. Once&lt;br/&gt;soil Acidobacteria can be successfully isolated and cultured in vitro, their physiological&lt;br/&gt;characteristics can be assessed in-depth. With this project, we will significantly expand&lt;br/&gt;what we currently know about soil Acidobacteria; we will describe the genetic diversity of&lt;br/&gt;this under-surveyed taxa and, by obtaining pure culture isolates, we can begin to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the ecological roles of soil Acidobacteria. This project will provide a graduate&lt;br/&gt;student with training in both conventional microbiology (strain isolation and cultivation)&lt;br/&gt;and molecular microbiology (rDNA sequence analysis).</AbstractNarration>
