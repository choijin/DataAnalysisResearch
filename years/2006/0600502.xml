<AbstractNarration>The primary theme  of this project is to study the interplay between &lt;br/&gt;topology, geometry and combinatorics.   Four areas  will receive &lt;br/&gt;special emphasis:  triangulations  of compact manifolds, Cohen-Macaulay &lt;br/&gt;complexes,  finite linear quotients of spheres, and matroids. It has &lt;br/&gt;been over 100 years since the introduction of the Euler-Poincare &lt;br/&gt;formula, yet the combinatorial properties of triangulations of compact &lt;br/&gt;manifolds remain largely unknown.  Indeed, a complete characterization &lt;br/&gt;of all possible f-vectors (which record the number of faces in each &lt;br/&gt;dimension) is not known for any manifold of dimension five or more.   &lt;br/&gt;The possible f-vectors of Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complexes have been &lt;br/&gt;known since the foundational work of Hochster, Reisner and Stanley in &lt;br/&gt;the 1970's.  However, the classification of face counts for important &lt;br/&gt;subclasses, such as spheres and doubly Cohen-Macaulay complexes, &lt;br/&gt;remains a fundamental open problem in algebraic and topological &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics.   Even though the representation theory of finite groups &lt;br/&gt;is an extremely well developed subject, tools for computing many &lt;br/&gt;topological invariants, such as Betti numbers, for the corresponding &lt;br/&gt;spherical quotients are practically nonexistent.  Matroids are a &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial abstraction of linear independence which can be modeled &lt;br/&gt;through a variety of topological spaces.  Their enumerative properties &lt;br/&gt;have    many applications including coloring and flows on graphs, &lt;br/&gt;network reliability, and the topology of hyperplane arrangements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two recurrent and complementary ideas in mathematics are the &lt;br/&gt;approximation of continuous phenomena using discrete data, and modeling &lt;br/&gt;the latter with smooth objects, such as spheres or polyhedra.  The &lt;br/&gt;guiding principle of this project is that the combination of these two &lt;br/&gt;techniques  is a powerful method of approaching both situations.&lt;br/&gt;For instance, compact manifolds, which are frequently presented as &lt;br/&gt;solutions to nonsingular polynomial equations in several variables, can &lt;br/&gt;also be examined by using simplicial complexes which are easier to &lt;br/&gt;encode into a computer.  In turn, this allows a deeper study of the &lt;br/&gt;shape and geometry of the original space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
