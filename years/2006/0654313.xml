<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) renewal award combines the resources and expertise of faculty at two major universities to train Ph.D. students to lead the way in the development, application, and responsible integration of nanotechnology.  Drexel faculty members excel in nanoscale engineering research related to materials synthesis and characterization, materials for biomedical, energy and environmental applications, and sensors.  University of Pennsylvania faculty members excel in nanoscale science research related to conductive polymers, structure of matter, nano-bio interfaces, electronic devices, molecular motors, and nanoscale instrumentation.  This program strives to instill in its trainees the idea of nanotechnology not as an individual discipline, but more of a new approach to science and engineering, which allows us to build new materials and devices starting from molecules or nanometer-size particles.  As such, nanotechnology is inherently interdisciplinary.  Through collaborative research programs involving multiple faculty advisors that transcend disciplines, departments and university boundaries, IGERT trainees address the most acute problems in the fields of energy, environment and health.  This program aims to enhance the diversity of graduate students in nanoscale engineering and science by partnering with the Philadelphia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, Society of Women Engineers, and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions Project Office.  The program prepares trainees to effectively teach and communicate with a broad audience while recognizing the ethical, legal, and social issues related to cutting-edge research.  Trainees receive valuable mentorship experience working with K-12 students and teachers from the School District of Philadelphia and other regional districts, as well as undergraduate researchers, through Drexel's and Penn's network of science and engineering education outreach activities.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania completed a collaborative NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program in 2012.  This IGERT built upon an established education, training, and research program that strengthened links and leveraged the resources of both institutions.  The motivation was to educate a new class of engineers and scientists capable in interdisciplinary, team-based research projects to be at the forefront of nanoscale science and engineering.  Research and education in this area is poised to address acute problems in the fields of energy, environment and health, with dramatic improvements to everyday life. The research outcomes of this IGERT have informed the area of alternative energy through work on supercapacitors and related energy storage mechanisms, design of new biological materials and nanoparticles for medical applications, insight into sequencing DNA, and novel applications related to smart and sustainable textiles.  The goal of this IGERT was to give trainees a strong background in basic science, to instill confidence in developing creative and innovative independent research practices, and an understanding both of the role that science and technology play in society and their individual roles within the scientific community.  We see nanotechnology not as an individual discipline, but more of a new approach to science and engineering, and are confident our IGERT trainees are well equipped to take part in its development, application, and integration.  A total of 47 graduate students from over 25 research groups participated in the IGERT.    It successfully increased the number of female scientists in the field with 35% of funded fellows being female. 11% of trainees came from groups underrepresented in the physical sciences.   The number of publications grew steadily thought the IGERT. Ultimately, 78 papers were published in peer-reviewed journals, including high profile journals such as Science, Nature Materials, ACS Nano, Nano Letters, and Energy &amp; Environmental Science.  Media coverage of IGERT research appeared in the Economist, Science Daily, Nanotechnology Now, and Information Week.  Additional publications included four book chapters and over 35 conference proceedings.  IGERT trainees presented more than 60 research talks at scientific meetings and conferences. As the Fellows and their advisors continue to analyze and publish results, there will be additional papers published and presentations delivered in 2012-2013, acknowledging support from the IGERT program.  IGERT fellows and their research advisors engaged in many interdisciplinary projects allowing collaboration in world-class research facilities at Drexel and Penn.  This included the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter on PennÆs campus and the Centralized Research Facility at Drexel.  Resources from two multidisciplinary research centers that included the A.J. Drexel Nanotechnology Institute and the Nano/Bio Interface Center (Penn) ensured opportunities for interdisciplinary research and crosscutting research initiatives.  Similarly, trainees were able to take courses at the adjoining university.  The IGERT capitalized on a variety of education and outreach programs to provide opportunities for IGERT fellows to teach, present, and mentor a diverse audience including teachers, school students, families, and undergraduate students.  On the Penn campus, the annual NanoDay@Penn saw the IGERT trainees engaging the general public with exhibits and demonstrations of their own design to help explain nanoscale science and engineering.  Since 2010, Philly Materials Day has been hosted by the Drexel Materials Science community and let trainees engage hundreds of families with high quality experiments, demonstrations, and presentations.  Both programs continue and represent highly successful collaborative outreach efforts in educating the public about the value and impact of nanosca...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
