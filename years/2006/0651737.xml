<AbstractNarration>This award supports the investigation of the fundamentals of evanescent radiation and photothermal phenomena during radiation interaction with single molecules in whispering-gallery mode integrated optical microcavities. The long-term goal is to develop a new generation of system-on-a-chip optical microsensors as an extremely sensitive tool for molecular probing using the induced signal changes including resonant frequency shift and radiation intensity reduction and decaying. To establish basic pillars supporting this goal, a comprehensive simulation study will be conducted to understand the micro/nanoscale radiation transport in the integrated devices and the thermal effects on the optical resonances and the induced signals due to photon absorption in the microcavities and/or the surrounding media. The devices will be fabricated in dielectric thin films using optical lithography and conventional integrated circuit processing in collaboration with an industrial partner  the NJ Nanotechnology Consortium. A proof of concept study for detecting target analytes in single molecular complexes will be carried out. The project integrates the research frontiers of micro/nanoscale thermal transport and thermal phenomena with optical resonance and emerging laser applications. If successful, it will advance the understanding of the optical and thermal mechanisms of evanescent radiation interaction with surrounding target molecules, minimize thermal noise, ensure good device design decision making, and establish measures by which new sensing principles and models can be validated and demonstrated. The integrated devices will lead to miniaturization, uniformity, precise control, and mass production; all of these are crucial for enabling practical microsensors in a wide variety of industrial, government, and biomedical applications. The project will impact the education of Rutgers graduate and undergraduate students through engineering curriculum improvement and participation of students in research. The multidisciplinary collaborations and outreach to industry and community will enhance the infrastructure for research and education at Rutgers University and benefit the community and society at large. The research and education results will be widely disseminated.</AbstractNarration>
