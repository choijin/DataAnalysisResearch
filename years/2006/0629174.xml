<AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Affairs jointly fund this award to the City Colleges of Chicago to establish an Undergraduate Research Collaborative. The PI for this project is Thomas Higgins, who will be assisted by Co-PIs Thomas Dowd, Gregory Ference, Yvonne Harris and Roger House. The collaborating partners in this project include: The seven campuses of the City Colleges of Chicago (Harold Washington College is the lead institution); William Rainey Harper College; Oakton Community College; and College of DuPage. Other partners are: Illinois State University, Youngstown State University, Chicago State University, and Hope College. Informal agreements to host summer students and/or build faculty collaborations have been made with DePaul University, Loyola University of Chicago, Northern Illinois University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Case Western Reserve University. The DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team at the Advance Photon Source and the Chemical Engineering Division, both located at Argonne National Laboratory, are also working with the Collaborative. The goals of this project are to: (1) Identify and recruit promising young scientists from two-year colleges (2YCs) into the STEM disciplines, especially, from traditionally under-represented groups; (2) Train 2YC students to become effective practitioners of science; (3) Instill in 2YC students the confidence to pursue science as a profession; (4) Encourage 2YC students to complete their undergraduate and graduate STEM education; and (5) Transform the cultures of participating 2YCs by embedding intensive research experiences during the academic year and summer into their curricula and their courses. These institutions are located in the Chicago-metro area and collectively serve approximately 106,000 undergraduates annually, 42% of whom come from underrepresented groups. In City Colleges of Chicago, 70% of the 50,000 undergraduates are either Black or Hispanic.</AbstractNarration>

To increase the quality of future STEM students, this country needs to increase the quality of undergraduate STEM education. To increase the quantity of these students, we must reach out to underrepresented and non-traditional student bodies. Undergraduate research with community college students, who are early in their academic careers, can do both. Undergraduate research is a powerful way to recruit and retain students into STEM and improving their practice of science. Community colleges educate almost half of all undergraduate students annually and this student body is diverse by almost any measure. This project, the STEM-ENGINES Undergraduate Research Collaborative, has taken what is successful in undergraduate research and adapted it to the needs of community college students. The core partners of this collaborative were ten Chicago-area community colleges (The seven City Colleges of Chicago, William Rainey Harper College, Oakton Community College, and the College of DuPage) and three Midwestern baccalaureate-granting institutions (Illinois State University, Youngstown State University, and Hope College).
