<AbstractNarration>Physics (13) The goals of the project are: (1) to improve learning for all students in the introductory algebra-based and calculus-based physics and in the astronomy classes at an urban university and neighboring community colleges, (2) to involve undergraduate science majors in the implementation, assessment, and creation of innovative teaching materials, and (3) to document the effectiveness of the implementation in promoting student learning through the use of multiple assessment instruments and to disseminate these results to the community of physics teachers and education researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is adapting materials currently being developed by Kanim, Loverude, and Ortiz as part of the Research-based Laboratories in Introductory Physics project funded by NSF. These materials carefully integrate conceptual understanding with laboratory experiments and observations. The project is looking critically at the materials being used in the semester I and semester II physics courses and revising them. Other physicists at different institutions are being invited to pilot test the materials. The project is also developing and pilot testing a number of activities in the semester III calculus-based physics course as well as in the general education astronomy course.  In addition, the project is collaborating with community colleges in the area that serve a similar population of students. Currently, there are few research-based instructional materials in this subject area, and these have not been widely used with urban students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The project is based on well-established, well-tested curricula. The PIs are building on their experience investigating student understanding of physics. The work is supported by a carefully designed assessment in order to pinpoint areas in which student difficulties still exist so that the curriculum can be further refined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;This project targets students in introductory physics and astronomy courses at the university and the local community colleges, mostly students from populations not well-represented in the sciences. The effectiveness of the implementation is being documented and disseminated. Upon completion of the project there will be a set of well-tested materials including laboratories, mini-labs, interactive PowerPoint Lectures, and pedagogical strategies that have been shown to promote understanding for this student population.</AbstractNarration>
