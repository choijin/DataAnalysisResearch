<AbstractNarration>In this project, scientists at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and the University of Connecticut will investigate the CO2 exchange between the ocean and atmosphere in the Southern Ocean as part of the multi-institutional GasEx-3 Experiment.  The overall goal of the GasEx-3 process studies will be to determine the dependence of gas exchange on easily measured atmospheric and oceanic variables and derive parameterizations applicable to all regions of the ocean. The focus of this particular contribution to GasEx-3 will be on moderate to high wind speeds where the CO2 flux may be significantly enhanced by wave breaking. For example, the earlier GasEx-98 study suggested a cubic relationship between wind speed and gas transfer velocities above 12 m/s. However, the dearth of data created significant error bars and uncertainty in this relationship. The Southern Ocean is an ideal site to explore this environmental condition where persistent high winds and storms are prevalent. The Southern Ocean and other mid- to high-latitude regions represent the primary oceanic sink of atmospheric CO2 over the global ocean. Consequently, an accurate CO2 flux parameterization in these regions is important for accurate estimates of the global carbon budget, climate model forecasts, and ultimately climate change predictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have a number of broader impacts including educational and outreach components. Presently at Columbia University and Barnard College (women's college), a number of course offerings expose students to principles of oceanography and applications of advanced environmental field methods. The investigators will develop focused teaching modules on global ocean carbon science problems to be incorporated into curricula.  The project will offer unique opportunities for University of Connecticut's undergraduates in a formal Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP) in which freshmen and juniors participate in activities in which they will receive valuable experience that helped them make decisions about careers in science and engineering.  The investigators also expect to continue working with the Institute for Science Instruction and Study (ISIS) where this work will be incorporated into the training of K-12 science teachers who will incorporate their research experience into stimulating lesson plans about the very interesting remote regional ecosystem of the Southern Ocean.  They will also be involved with K-12 student enrichment directly through the John's Hopkins Center for Talented Youth programs, which actively involves both minority and women participants.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
