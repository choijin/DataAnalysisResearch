<AbstractNarration>A new computational method for image registration is formulated.  &lt;br/&gt;Registration refers to the task of aligning a pair of images obtained  &lt;br/&gt;by CT (computed tomography), MR (magnetic resonance), ultra-sound,  &lt;br/&gt;and other techniques, so that they can be compared both qualitatively  &lt;br/&gt;and quantitatively. This is an important problem with applications  &lt;br/&gt;ranging from remote sensing to medicine. In medicine, imaging  &lt;br/&gt;techniques and analysis have become an important, non-invasive tool  &lt;br/&gt;for diagnosis and for surgical and radiation treatment planning.  &lt;br/&gt;Despite advances in this area of research, the challenges posed by  &lt;br/&gt;registration for three-dimensional images remains an open problem. A  &lt;br/&gt;new mathematical approach is developed that optimizes any chosen  &lt;br/&gt;similarity measure of the images, subject to the constraint of a set  &lt;br/&gt;of differential equations that can generate any differentiable and  &lt;br/&gt;invertible transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main intellectual merit of the project is that it significantly  &lt;br/&gt;enhances our understanding of imagery and shapes and also the  &lt;br/&gt;accuracy and efficiency of image registration techniques. The main  &lt;br/&gt;features of the new method are as follows.&lt;br/&gt;1. Similarity measures used to compare images are directly optimized.&lt;br/&gt;2. The method has a landmark matching capacity for large deformations  &lt;br/&gt;between images.&lt;br/&gt;3. The method is founded on solid mathematical theory; in particular,  &lt;br/&gt;the admissible space of transformations is the set of all  &lt;br/&gt;differentiable and invertible transformations.&lt;br/&gt;4. The project is carried out with the use of the software Insight  &lt;br/&gt;Tool Kit developed by the National Institutes of Health; that  &lt;br/&gt;software provides an excellent resource for the research activity.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed activity are as follows.&lt;br/&gt;1. Undergraduate and graduate students are educated and trained to  &lt;br/&gt;apply powerful mathematical techniques to medical and other image  &lt;br/&gt;processing problems.&lt;br/&gt;2. The new method will impact other areas of the computational  &lt;br/&gt;sciences. Results are to be presented at conferences and published in  &lt;br/&gt;scientific journals and through the mass media directed at scientists  &lt;br/&gt;and the general population as well.&lt;br/&gt;3. New partnerships between medical doctors, biomedical engineers,  &lt;br/&gt;and mathematicians are established, helping create a favorable  &lt;br/&gt;environment for further research aimed at improving the health of our  &lt;br/&gt;citizens.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
