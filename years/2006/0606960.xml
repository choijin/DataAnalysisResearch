    <AbstractNarration>AWARD NO: AST-0606960&lt;br/&gt;PI: Daniel Savin&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Further Measurements of Thermal Energy Charge&lt;br/&gt;Transfer in Support of Ground-Based Astronomy&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This research is a continuation of an ongoing laboratory study of thermal energy&lt;br/&gt;charge transfer among atoms and ions of astrophysical interest. It has long been known&lt;br/&gt;that thermal energy charge transfer plays an important role in determining the ionization&lt;br/&gt;structure, thermal structure, emission spectrum and absorption spectrum for a range of&lt;br/&gt;cosmic plasmas. These include photoionized gas found in planetary nebulae, H II regions,&lt;br/&gt;Wolf-Rayet nebulae, luminous blue variable nebulae, Lyman alpha clouds, and the&lt;br/&gt;intergalactic medium; shocks in supernova remnants and Herbig-Haro objects; and&lt;br/&gt;primordial gas clouds during the epoch of protogalaxy and first star formation.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, many theoretical calculations carried out during the past 25 years in&lt;br/&gt;response to the demand for reliable thermal energy charge transfer data are reliable to&lt;br/&gt;only a factor of 3-10. And while the latest state-of-the-art calculations are expected to be&lt;br/&gt;more reliable, such efforts are less common and can still be off by a factor of 3 when not&lt;br/&gt;benchmarked against experiments. However, few laboratory measurements exist despite&lt;br/&gt;the demand from the community.&lt;br/&gt;To address this need, an ongoing series of laboratory measurements of thermal energy&lt;br/&gt;charge transfer will be continued using the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ion-atom&lt;br/&gt;merged-beams apparatus. Here, measurements will be made of the thermal energy charge&lt;br/&gt;transfer of C2+, O+, O2+, Se3+, and Kr2+. Reliable charge transfer data for the&lt;br/&gt;cosmically abundant C2+, O+, and O2+ are needed for modeling planetary nebulae and H&lt;br/&gt;II regions as well as shocks in supernovae remnants and Herbig-Harrow objects. Data for&lt;br/&gt;Se3+ and Kr2+ are needed to analyze planetary nebula spectra in order to study both&lt;br/&gt;nucleosynthesis via the slow neutron capture process and convective dredge-up in the&lt;br/&gt;planetary nebula progenitor stars. These results will be used to produce rate coefficients&lt;br/&gt;with an estimated accuracy of * 20% and will provide fits for plasma modeling. Modern&lt;br/&gt;charge transfer theory will also be benchmarked against these results. Finally, the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory apparatus will be modified so that the metastable fraction in the ion beams can&lt;br/&gt;be measured and controlled. For beams with a significant metastable fraction, this will&lt;br/&gt;allow the extraction of absolute cross sections for both the ground state and metastable&lt;br/&gt;ions in the beam. This new capability will further increase the uniqueness of the Oak&lt;br/&gt;Ridge National Laboratory ion-atom merged-beams apparatus.&lt;br/&gt;The training and professional preparation of a graduate student will be supported. This&lt;br/&gt;student will carry out a large portion of the project in partial fulfillment of the&lt;br/&gt;requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The results of this research will be&lt;br/&gt;presented via seminars and colloquia to colleagues in academia, government, and&lt;br/&gt;industry. Reports at national and international conferences will be given and published in&lt;br/&gt;the appropriate journals. In addition, this work will further enhance the Columbia/Oak&lt;br/&gt;Ridge National Laboratory infrastructure for research and education. Prof. Gary Ferland&lt;br/&gt;at the University of Kentucky will input the new rate coefficients into CLOUDY which is&lt;br/&gt;one of the most commonly used codes for modeling photoionized gas.</AbstractNarration>
