<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No.:  0609087&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:    NIRT: Engineered Molecular Fluidics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:    Sheiko, Sergei S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 05-610, category NIRT.  This project will explore a new direction in micro-fabricated fluidics  molecular fluidics wherein one can monitor, probe, and manipulate flows one molecule at a time. Investigations will be performed on the behavior of fluid mono-layers residing on solid substrates that can be manipulated by both electric fields and intrinsic means such as the interaction with the substrate.  The proposed approach is based on synthetic design of flow- and electric field-responsive molecules, experimental and theoretical studies of surface-confined macromolecules under flow, and the engineering of flow actuation techniques. The flow will be monitored over a broad range of length scales from the motion of the film front all the way down to the movements of individual molecules within the film. Since molecular conformation responds to flow and may respond to external stimuli such as electric fields, one anticipates the development of molecular devices that can both probe the flow properties and actively affect the flow structure. If successfully implemented, electrically controlled surfaces will lead to creation of a new range of materials and devices that enable anisotropic wetting, directional liquid transport, and anisotropic tribology, and may even be self-cleaning or direct the growth of live cells for biomaterials and implants. Experimental findings will be continuously tested against theoretical predictions and computer simulation studies, and will guide the synthesis of additional functional macromolecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impacts, the proposed research will advance fundamental understanding of the conformation and dynamics of surface-confined polymer chains and lead to the development of new theories for interfacial flow and its interaction with electric fields. Furthermore, the highly interactive and efficient teamwork in the proposed multi-disciplinary research area will ensure maximum opportunity for integrating science and education based on the interdisciplinary training of student and postdocs, partnerships with 6-12 schools, and involvement of underrepresented groups. The collaborative education plan involves three areas of activity: (i) the development of a new graduate course and a new lab module, (ii) co-advising and an exchange of students that will experience a highly interdisciplinary education in polymer chemistry, advanced polymer theory, visualization and micro-fabrication techniques, (iii) and regular interactions with local high schools in form of introductory lectures and summer research programs at our universities. One of the most important goals is to bring molecular visualization from university to high-school classrooms where the ability to see molecules would be invaluable for the teaching of molecular structures and chemical reactions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
