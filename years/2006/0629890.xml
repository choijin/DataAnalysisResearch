<AbstractNarration>AToL for Gymnosperms: Resolving the Phylogeny of Seed Plants&lt;br/&gt;An award is made to Sarah Mathews (Lead PI), Jianhua Li (Co-PI), Harvard University; Reed S. Beaman (PI), Nico Cellinese (Co-PI), Yale University; Christopher S. Campbell (PI), University of Maine; Richard C. Cronn (Collaborator), USDA Forest Service; Sean W. Graham (Co-PI), University of British Columbia; Stefanie M. Ickert-Bond (PI), University of Alaska; Dean G. Kelch (PI), University of California-Berkeley and California State Herbarium; Aaron I. Liston (PI), Oregon State University; Linda A. Raubeson (PI), Central Washington University; Gar W. Rothwell (PI), Gene Mapes (Co-PI), Ohio University; Andrea E. Schwarzbach (PI), University of Texas-Brownsville; Dennis W. Stevenson (PI), New York Botanical Garden; Ruth A. Stockey (Co-PI), University of Alberta to construct sequence-based phylogenetic hypotheses for all living gymnosperms and for seed plants overall, and morphology-based hypotheses to include ALL living species of gymnosperms (conifers, cycads, Gingko, and Gnetales) including examples from the fossil record, along with exemplar angiosperms (flowering plants). Nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial sequences will be utilized in the analysis along with the morphological characters to allow the rich record of fossil gymnosperms to be included.  All of the data (molecular, morphological, voucher, etc.) will be submitted to standardized and accessible databases through an enhanced version of the web-based informatics tool TOLKIN (Tree Of Life Knowledge and Information Network, www.tolkin.org). The evolution of the seed marks one of the most important innovations in the history of land plants and led to greater mating control and to enhanced survival and dispersal capabilities.  Seed bearing plants dominate the landscape; today, forests and grasslands are among our most important resources.  Understanding the origin(s) of seeds is basic to understanding seed plant phylogeny.  Obtaining the needed phylogenetic framework is not a trivial undertaking and the multi-faceted approach is designed to address the inherent complexity of the problem, incorporating approaches not considered by all projects (e.g., including all gymnosperms, serious attention to the fossil data).  While phylogenetic inference will be the main focus of the project, data will bear significantly on the understanding of historic patterns of biotic change at the global level, and will provide insight into the origins of many important plant traits, including those that are the basis of breeding programs in horticulture and forestry. In addition to training students, workshops for K-12 teachers will be held at several botanic gardens.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT  Seeds, which contain a plant embryo and nutritional reserves needed for seedling establishment, are central to human health and to the maintenance and regeneration of earth's vegetation. Their reserves of protein, oil, and carbohydrates are the basis of agriculture. Their ability to remain viable for long periods of time is the basis of conservation of plant genetic diversity. Seed-bearing plants comprise the flowering plants, conifers, Ginkgo biloba, cycads, and gnetophytes. They are the predominate elements of all terrestrial ecosystems and serve as major reservoirs for carbon storage.  A poor understanding of relationships among and within lineages of seed-bearing plants hinders the sustainable use and management of this important resource because it prevents the identification of plant functional traits that are most important for the success or failure of ecologically and economically important species.

Extinct branches of the tree cannot be sampled for DNA data.

BROADER IMPACTS  Curated collections of live plants in arboreta and botanical gardens are ideal settings for workshops designed to show teachers how to use living plant materials in their biology curricula.
