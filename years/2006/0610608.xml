<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves developing a novel high temperature NOx abatement catalyst and catalytic process for the control of NOx, NH3, CO and non-methane-hydrocarbon emissions from natural gas fired power plants. The catalyst is designed to be operated up-stream of the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), thereby operating at temperatures between 550 C and 620 C. The catalytic process described herein involves tailoring a zeolite-based catalyst to operate within the specified temperature regime, and employing the catalyst in a layered bed configuration. The layered bed configuration is designed to operate with excess NH3, thereby increasing NOx abatement efficiency. The catalyst designed for the inlet region of the bed is responsible for achieving NOx reduction with minimal NH3 decomposition. The catalyst located in the outlet region of the bed is designed to reduce the remaining NOx, decompose the excess NH3, and oxidize CO and non-methane hydrocarbons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of said catalyst will provide the power generation industry with a simple, low cost means of meeting increasingly stringent emissions requirements.  A catalyst capable of exceeding emissions requirements while operating outside the HRSG is expected to rapidly gain market acceptance due to lower capital costs associated with retrofit and new installation, increased operating efficiency, and reduced disposal burdens associated with the spent catalyst. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
