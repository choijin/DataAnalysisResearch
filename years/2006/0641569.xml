<AbstractNarration>In engineering terms, the hydraulic system of a woody plant is a "negative pressure flow &lt;br/&gt;system" in which conducting cells in the wood (xylem) are linked from roots to leaves.  &lt;br/&gt;This type of hydraulic system is prone to failure due to the introduction of air bubbles, &lt;br/&gt;which create embolisms. Plants frequently develop embolisms in their hydraulic &lt;br/&gt;systems, especially under water limited conditions. &lt;br/&gt;Whether man-made or natural, a pressure flow system can be protected from &lt;br/&gt;failure in three ways: resistance, reparability, and redundancy.  Resistance to hydraulic &lt;br/&gt;failure in plants is fairly well understood and involves the thickness of cells walls in &lt;br/&gt;conducting cells and in the surrounding matrix of thick-walled cells (fibers).  Reparability &lt;br/&gt;after failure depends on living cells in and adjacent to xylem.  Redundancy reflects the &lt;br/&gt;number of root to leaf conducing pathways and the degree of their interconnectedness &lt;br/&gt;(hydraulic integration).  The unique arrangements of conducting cells, supporting fibers, &lt;br/&gt;and living cells in different species suggest that tradeoffs occur among these three &lt;br/&gt;types of protections.  To date, interactions among them are virtually unknown. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research questions whether the relative amounts of different types &lt;br/&gt;of protection change with increasing habitat aridity in dominant shrub species from &lt;br/&gt;multiple lineages along transcontinental aridity gradients in North America, South &lt;br/&gt;America, and Australia. Methods will involve standard techniques used to study the &lt;br/&gt;structure of plant xylem and the use of dye tracers to characterize three-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;pathways of water transport. Xylem function studies will quantify resistance to &lt;br/&gt;embolisms and reparability of experimentally induced embolisms.  This study will be the &lt;br/&gt;first to simultaneously examine the relative roles of redundancy, resistance and repair in &lt;br/&gt;protecting plants from hydraulic failure. &lt;br/&gt;Results from this study will aid researchers and land managers in understanding &lt;br/&gt;how hydraulic protection influences shrub survival during global climate change and &lt;br/&gt;desertification.  Students of different ages, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds will &lt;br/&gt;experience the scientific process as they participate in every aspect of the research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
