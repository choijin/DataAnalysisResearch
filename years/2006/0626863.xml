<AbstractNarration>NeTS-NBD Simulcast Enhanced Wireless Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award  0626863&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tan F. Wong and John M. Shea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information theory predicts that it is more efficient to simultaneously transmit (simulcast) signals carrying independent information to multiple users on a wireless channel than it is to time-, frequency- or code-share the channel among the users.  In current wireless networks, this simulcasting capability of the wireless medium is not utilized. This research aims to develop practical simulcasting transmission techniques that exploit such hidden resources in both infrastructure and ad hoc networks. The application of simulcasting at the physical layer has many impacts on the higher-layer protocols. Under a cross-layer framework, the use of simulcasting in wireless networks is investigated through analysis, simulation, and experimentation. The expected analytical results will be used to investigate the performance limits of simulcasting.  Simulation results will be used to test protocol designs and evaluate performance under more realistic models for channel, traffic, mobility, etc.  A heterogeneous ad hoc network (HANET) testbed will be developed to emulate simulcasting in real networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing demand for wireless services has resulted in significant pressure to develop new approaches to more efficiently utilize bandwidth resources.  The simulcasting techniques developed in this project have the potential to significantly improve efficiency in cellular and wireless local area networks. Through this project, engineering students learn to design communication systems by understanding the analytical limitations, evaluating performance through simulations, and deploying and testing new protocols on the HANET testbed.  The research results will be disseminated through the Internet and publications in conferences and technical journals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
