<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive collection of literature-based case studies (LBCS) is being created to enable inquiry-based learning in genetics. Case studies being created use the primary literature to focus student learning on the fundamental concepts of genetics in the context of scientific discovery.  As a result students are learning genetic concepts through deliberate engagement in the learning cycle and the process of scientific inquiry, i.e., "scientific learning." A pedagogical model based on constructivist learning is being employed to create the literature-based case studies and associated learning materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The case studies model the process of scientific discovery and analysis and practice questions and exercises help students test their understanding. Overall, the project aims to promote scientific thinking, conceptual understanding and scientific information competence. Students are being empowered to analyze and manage scientific information, ask questions and obtain answers about genetics. The projects is being evaluated using both direct (e.g., embedded exam questions) and indirect measures (e.g., in class student question analysis).  Student learning using the LBCS approach is being assessed using formative (e.g., performance on practice questions and exercises) and summative (e.g., embedded exam questions) measures. Online surveys are used to obtain student perceptions regarding the approach and their learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The primary broader impact of this project is the creation of a model for robust literature-based, experiential scientific learning that builds upon previous case study and problem-based learning teaching methods. The results are being developed into an interactive, inquiry-based electronic textbook whose primary goal is to facilitate a shift in textbook philosophy from one of knowledge transmission to one of knowledge discovery. This model is anticipated to be applicable to any science discipline or level of instruction. In addition, the project is pioneering the integration of scientific information competence exercises into case study-based undergraduate instruction. The project is also impacting the training of future science teachers by involving graduate and undergraduate student assistants with high school science teaching career goals. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
