    <AbstractNarration>AST-0602282&lt;br/&gt;Halfen, DeWayne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Halfen is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Arizona and Steward Observatory. Focusing on the chemistry of photon-dominated regions (PDRs), Dr. Halfen will investigate several molecular ions using a combined laboratory and observational approach. Using an ion-selective spectrometer, he will measure the rotational spectra of molecular ions, including CS+, CN+, NH+, and SiH2+. These species are predicted by theory to be present in PDRs but have not yet been studied because their spectra are unknown. Once this data has been measured, Dr. Halfen will conduct radio astronomical searches for these species towards PDRs. Identification of these molecules will help assess PDR models and complete the chemical inventory of these objects. Sources to be studied include the Orion Bar, NGC 2023 and M17-SW. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Halfen will also incorporate a laboratory astrophysics lab into a junior-level astronomy course and conduct an outreach component that will include a public lecture focusing on laboratory astrophysics in astronomy. Additionally, Dr. Halfen will work on a laboratory project with a high school student from the San Carlos Apache reservation as part of a program sponsored by the Mt. Graham International Observatory. His education program goals include fostering the participation of Native Americans in science and teaching laboratory skills.</AbstractNarration>
