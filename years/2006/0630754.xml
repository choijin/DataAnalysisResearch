<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  Boston University's Science and Engineering Program (SEP) is a two year full-time enrichment program for students to prepare for the rigors of upper division coursework leading to a baccalaureate degree in a science (astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth science, geography, mathematics, and physics) or engineering (aerospace, biomedical, computer systems, electrical, manufacturing, and mechanical) discipline. The Scholarships for Science and Engineering Program Students (SSEPS) program provides crucial scholarship aid to 20- 25 financially needy and academically talented students per year who intend to enter these fields.  Freshmen SSEPS recipients are selected by Boston University's Office of Financial Assistance and the SEP Chairman. SSEPS recipients who meet Boston University's guidelines for renewal of support are funded through University scholarships for three remaining years of full-time enrollment. SSEPS recipients explore careers opportunities as part of the Freshmen Advising Seminar and through the University's extensive career development and placement offerings. SSEPS recipients also participate in career internship programs to reinforce their educational experience with "real world" applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  SSEPS will open doors to science and engineering (STEM) careers for students who are academically capable of entering these fields if provided with academic support during their freshmen and sophomore years. SSEPS serves to broaden the participation of students from many groups that are traditionally under-represented in STEM. Historically, approximately 10 - 15% of SEP students have an identified disability, 30% are female, and 30% are minority students, so the SSEPS enables the University to respond to the urgent need for a more diverse pool of well qualified scientists and engineers. The SSEPS team is committed to rigorous program evaluation and dissemination of best practices to encourage community colleges and four year research intensive institutions to emulate this program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
