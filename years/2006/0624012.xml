<AbstractNarration>This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) activity links researchers and mentors at Duke University in North Carolina with counterparts at the University of Aarhus in Denmark.  Principal investigator, Thomas H. LaBean, and colleagues from Duke will work with Danish partners, led by Kurt V. Gothelf, to manage a balanced, team-based approach to research and education in nanotechnology. The integrated, collaborative program will provide international research experience for U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in self-assembling DNA nanostructures and nanochemistry.  The Duke-Aarhus IRES model also involves post-doctoral mentors and research-ready high school students.  Duke participants will travel to Aarhus to be trained in various techniques including conjugation chemistry and preparation of materials for use in future experiments.  Each of the junior participants will be assigned projects that are designed to contribute to program-wide research goals as well as their professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical focus of this IRES program of activity reflects U.S.-Danish complementary strengths. The planned cross-disciplinary work requires knowledge of techniques in synthetic chemistry, DNA structural engineering, protein biochemistry, materials science, and molecular biology.   Duke University's team contributes strengths in development of advanced DNA self-assemblies to the collaboration. The Aarhus team provides expertise in DNA-directed organic synthesis and conjugation chemistry for coupling diverse compounds to oligonucleotides.  Research results and training experiences will benefit greatly through interaction.  Overall, this cooperative exchange should yield results that improve our ability to organize a wider variety of nanomaterials using DNA self-assembly and program sophisticated nanochemistry using complex DNA nanostructures. The educational value of the IRES rests with the students' involvement in their mentors' cutting-edge research and exposure to the collective research life of two outstanding institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Danish IRES collaboration in molecular engineering fulfills the program objective of developing global scientists and engineers by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to combine complementary talents and share research and education resources in an area of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include the introduction of U.S. junior researchers and students to leaders in the international nanotechnology community through a program of study at an established Danish center of excellence.</AbstractNarration>
