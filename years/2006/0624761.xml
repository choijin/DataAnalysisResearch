<AbstractNarration>The Little Haiti Housing Association proposes a partnership with three Computer Clubhouses of Miami, Florida and the YWCA of Greater Miami.  The result of this partnership, Green Table Productions, offers 90 Haitian and African American 7-12 grade current clubhouse members, 30 at three neighborhood clubhouses, with an intensive three-track media development program in video, music and graphic arts production.  The program aims to improve young people's ability to express themselves with technology, collaborate and work in teams, solve complex problems, develop, plan and execute complex projects and develop self esteem and self-efficacy.  After having completing one of the three tracks, older teens will participate in local media internships and younger teens will support the clubhouse activities as youth mentors.  The program will evaluate the difference in outcomes for the teens in the general Clubhouse program and teens entering this higher end process.  Products from the core program will be housed in the Clubhouse's Village network where 20,000 youth around the world provide online materials and critique each other's work.  Family outreach includes quarterly parent meetings, college prep guidance and individual meetings with parents.  Career development includes the internships, Clubhouse mentors and a series of guest speakers.</AbstractNarration>
