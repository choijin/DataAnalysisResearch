    <AbstractNarration>Laser cooling and Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute atomic vapors have completely changed the landscape of Atomic, Molecular and Optical (AMO) physics. The PI has been engaged in quantum-optics style theories in these areas for quite a while. Main interest has been the Feshbach resonance in degenerate Fermi gases. Foreseeable activity in this area includes cleaning up some loose ends in his mean field theory (MFT), such as an investigation of atom-molecule conversion in a magnetic field oscillating in the neighborhood of a Feshbach resonance. New contributions are expected to come from studies of optical-lattice systems, taking into account atom-molecule conversion due to either Feshbach resonance or photoassociation. Finally, in a highly speculative item, we will make forays into the notion of superuniversality, according to which the physics in extremely strongly interacting systems could be the same for bosons and fermions.</AbstractNarration>
