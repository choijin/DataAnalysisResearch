<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular Approaches in Plant Biology (MAPB), an upper division undergraduate laboratory course, is designed to help students obtain the skills needed to participate in plant molecular biology research and develop an appreciation of the importance, relevance, and fascination of plant biology.  Because of their pliability and ease of access, plants are ideal organisms for inquiry-based investigations in undergraduate education. This course uses research-oriented approaches to develop student interest in plant biology and student skills in data analysis, experimental design and critical thinking. During the first eight weeks, in preparation for actually participating in a research project, students learn different techniques designed to study how genes function in plants. Throughout the course students have opportunities to practice their technical skills and improve their abilities in scientific investigations through exercises and discussions in on-line forums. In the latter part of the course students carry out independent studies based on their proposals. They report their progress weekly to the class and the instructor for criticism and suggestions. At the end of the semester, students present their results in a mini-symposium. Their presentations are judged by their peers, the instructor, and an invited symposium audience. Course effectiveness is being evaluated based on student reports and the quality of their presentations as a demonstration of the skills students have acquired.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: MAPB is a research-oriented laboratory course designed to develop student abilities to conduct scientific investigations. The course creates new materials which are important for undergraduate education in the life sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This course increases awareness of plant science by a diverse set of students and provides opportunities for them to participate in plant science research projects and enhances teacher preparation by providing equipment to outreach programs.  Findings from this course will be used to enrich lower division courses as well.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
