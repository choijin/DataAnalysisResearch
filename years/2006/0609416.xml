<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This NIRT project focuses on the development of nanometer-scale photonic structures to overcome critical obstacles limiting efficiency of optoelectronic devices. Novel concepts will be formulated and applied to the technologically important AlGaN and InGaN semiconductors leading to efficient light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) operating in the green and deep ultraviolet wavelength regions. The project encompasses growth of novel optoelectronic nanostructures, studies of their physical properties, and device design, fabrication, and testing. These activities span a broad range of technical and educational issues in science and engineering. The major proposal thrusts are: (1) substrate engineering and nanotemplating; (2) active region nanoengineering; (3) and nanophotonic surfaces for enhanced light extraction. Ordered nanostructures grown with vertical and lateral size control will allow tailoring of properties at the quantum level, leading to new device concepts. The use of nano-engineered photonic crystals to modify and control emission properties promises to improve LED performance and enable demonstration of LDs. Individually these three areas will improve internal and external efficiencies. Integrated, they will enhance design and fabrication of light emitters. The proposal will be carried out in partnership with Technology and Device International (TDI). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The devices described have numerous potential applications. Commercially, these sources are ideally suited for projection displays and lighting. Miniaturized wavelength-tuned sources are critical for portable biohazard detection. The research plan will be integrated with educational development. Students will be trained in advanced interdisciplinary research central to our nation's technical needs. As part of our GOALI agreement, they will collaborate closely with TDI scientists and engineers, greatly enriching their educational experience. New components of classroom and laboratory courses will incorporate fabrication of active nanostructures and nanosystems, drawing students from diverse disciplines. Finally, active recruitment of students, emphasizing under-represented groups, will address national workforce needs in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
