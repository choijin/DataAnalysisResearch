<AbstractNarration>A Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) grant has been awarded to the&lt;br/&gt;Hope College Nuclear Group (under the direction of Dr. Paul DeYoung and Dr.&lt;br/&gt;Graham Peaslee) by the National Science Foundation to support a variety of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research projects for the next three years.  The research&lt;br/&gt;activities will center on understanding the properties of unstable nuclei far&lt;br/&gt;from stability, which are essential for understanding the fundamental nuclear&lt;br/&gt;force, modeling the formation of heavy elements in supernovae, and testing a&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of nuclear theories and models.  In addition, we will be&lt;br/&gt;developing novel applications of nuclear physics techniques to questions in&lt;br/&gt;other scientific fields, which can lead to valuable new scientific information&lt;br/&gt;in these areas.  Involving undergraduate students in all of these efforts&lt;br/&gt;educates them, excites them, and gives them tremendous preparation for&lt;br/&gt;graduate work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically the Hope College Nuclear Group currently is planning to&lt;br/&gt;characterize the structure of several radioactive nuclei, including 16Be,&lt;br/&gt;13Li, 5H, and 9C.  These studies will be done at the National Superconducting&lt;br/&gt;Cyclotron with the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA)  and the University of Notre&lt;br/&gt;Dame with the ND neutron wall.  At the Hope College Ion Beam Analysis&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory, the nuclear group will use nuclear scattering and x-ray&lt;br/&gt;spectrometry along with accelerator and detector technology to determine&lt;br/&gt;metalloprotein stoichiometry, to characterize the trace-element constituents&lt;br/&gt;of glass, and to determine the geological provenance of sand grains.&lt;br/&gt;Rutherford backscattering will also be used to characterize electropolymers&lt;br/&gt;and conduct in-situ measurements of protein fragments in gels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the experiments:&lt;br/&gt;planning, detector development, experiment setup, data taking, analysis, and&lt;br/&gt;dissemination. This grant will also provide support for a postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;associate as part of a trial effort to train future researchers that can&lt;br/&gt;effectively involve undergraduate students in the setting of a primarily&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate institution.&lt;br/&gt;**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
