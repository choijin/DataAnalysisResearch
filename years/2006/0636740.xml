<AbstractNarration>Kreutz/0636740&lt;br/&gt;Dunbar/0636767&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to perform continuous microparticle concentration and size distribution measurements (using coulter counter and state-of-the-art laser detector methods), analysis of biologically relevant trace elements associated with microparticles (Fe, Zn, Co, Cd, Cu), and tephra measurements on the WAIS Divide ice core. This initial three-year project includes analysis of ice core spanning the instrumental (~1850-present) to mid- Holocene (~5000 years BP) period, with sample resolution ranging from subannual to decadal.   The intellectual merit of the project is that it will help in establishing the relationships among climate, atmospheric aerosols from terrestrial and volcanic sources, ocean biogeochemistry, and greenhouse gases on several timescales which remain a fundamental problem in paleoclimatology.  The atmospheric mineral dust plays an important but uncertain role in direct radiative forcing, and the microparticle datasets produced in this project will allow us to examine changes in South Pacific aerosol loading, atmospheric dynamics, and dust source area climate. The phasing of changes in aerosol properties within Antarctica, throughout the Southern Hemisphere, and globally is unclear, largely due to the limited number of annually dated records extending into the glacial period and the lack of a&lt;br/&gt;tephra framework to correlate records.  The broader impacts of the proposed research are an interdisciplinary approach to climate science problems, and will contribute to several WAIS Divide science themes as well as the broader paleoclimate and oceanographic communities. Because the research topics have a large and direct societal relevance, the project will form a centerpiece of various outreach efforts at UMaine and NMT including institution websites, public speaking, local K-12 school interaction, media interviews and news releases, and popular literature. At least one PhD student and one MS student will be directly supported by this project, including fieldwork, core processing, laboratory analysis, and data interpretation/publication. We expect that one graduate student per year will apply for a core handler/assistant driller position through the WAIS Divide Science Coordination Office, and that undergraduate student involvement will result in several Capstone experience projects (a UMaine graduation requirement). Data and ideas generated from the project will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate course curricula at both institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Insoluble mineral aerosols (hereafter termed ædustÆ or æmicroparticlesÆ) are an important but poorly understood component of EarthÆs climate system.  Aerosols act as a negative forcing on the radiative balance of the atmosphere, through direct (absorption and scattering of incoming solar radiation) and indirect (e.g., cloud albedo) effects; mineral aerosols also provide a critical source of iron (Fe) and other trace nutrients to remote regions of the worldÆs oceans. Aerosol Fe fertilization of marine primary producers in Fe-limited waters can impact global climate by increasing carbon export to the deep ocean and drawing down atmospheric CO2, a process which may act as an important climate feedback.

Our project reconstructed atmospheric dust deposition over the past 2400 years and addressed the following questions:   1. What is the provenance (i.e., geographic source) of microparticles deposited in West Antarctica? Based on dust geochemistry, our results suggest that both South America and Australia/New Zealand contribute dust to West Antarctica in nearly equal amounts;   2. What drives the seasonality of microparticle deposition in West Antarctica?  Our results show that dust is deposited primary during the austral spring in West Antarctica, suggesting that atmospheric transport strength plays a dominant role;   3. How have particle size distribution and concentration changed through time in the WAIS Divide ice core and what do these parameters indicate about climatic changes during the late Holocene?  Our results indicate that dust changes in West Antarctica are driven primarily by periodic atmospheric pressure differences such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).   However, there is a clear increase in dust deposition during and after the mid-1980Æs, which may be related to anthropogenic activity;   4. What drives changes in the relative proportions of soluble, labile, and particulate aerosol Fe deposited at WAIS Divide through time? We found that changes in aerosol Fe concentrations are related to particle size distribution.  Fe in smaller particles is more labile, suggesting that biologically available Fe deposition may be linked to atmospheric processes.     Intellectual merit and broader impacts.  The new high-resolution microparticle size distribution and composition record produced through this project provides an unprecedented opportunity for identifying the dominant controls on atmospheric dust and aer...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
