<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical studies in gravitational physics and elementary particle physics will be conducted. Studies will include further developing field theories associated with large symmetries for gravitational physics, exploring the relationships of string theories to nuclear matter and applying theories developed from string symmetries to the early universe and cosmology. These studies may provide information and ideas concerning some of the issues that are pressing in the research in gravity, cosmology and nuclear physics. To date there is no satisfactory explanation available for all the interactions of gravity with elementary particles or for gravity at large scales. Also further studies of the relationship of string theory to nuclear physics will help provide a mathematical framework for better predictions in nuclear physics. Understanding these fundamental interactions at a rigorous mathematical and computational level are important for further understanding of the nature of the fundamental forces of nature. The project has a wide variety of problems that can be solved which include advanced undergraduates and graduate students. This affords opportunities for younger students in physics to get early exposure to issues in nuclear physics, string theory and problems related to gravitation. &lt;br/&gt;The PI is also the faculty coordinator of the "Hawkeyes On Science" outreach program for the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Iowa, is the organizer and creator of the Iowa City chapter of "Cafe Scientifique", and a volunteer tutor for the Iowa City Community School District. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
