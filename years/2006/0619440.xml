<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: MRI:  Acquisition of a Transmission Electron Microscope for Nano/Biomaterials Research and Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CTS-0619440-MRI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:   Arijit Bose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:     University of Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will acquire a Scanning/Transmission Electron Microscope (S/TEM) for research and education spanning inorganic, organic and biological nanomaterials at the University of Rhode Island (URI).  The S/TEM system will be used to carry out a wide range of innovative research projects including the examination of surfactant microstructure evolution in highly constrained domains, which is useful for drug delivery as well as surfactant-mediated oil recovery operations.  It will be employed for the characterization of fracture in nanoparticle/polymer composite materials especially under extreme or impact loading conditions.  The instrument will be used to study marine phytoplankton biodiversity and evolutionary ecology and to understand the toxicological impact of nanoparticles. Colleagues from industry and about a half-dozen other URI faculty from various departments as well as other universities will also extensively use this new instrument in their research in topics ranging from light-induced changes in surfactant microstructures to measurement of surface relaxation in magnetic nanoparticles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The S/TEM instrument, along with improved cryo- sample preparation and imaging capability, will have a significant impact on research and education at the University of Rhode Island, regional universities and will improve collaborations with industry and provide significant new outreach capabilities to local high schools.  The proposed instrument will greatly improve the infrastructure for research and education at URI.  The ability to control the microscope remotely will allow high school students to operate the S/TEM through the internet, providing them with unique hands-on experience on a state-of-the-art instrument.  Local as well as national industries will also use the microscope, allowing collaborations to extend well beyond the university.  Beginning with the LSAMP program at URI, this acquisition will play an important role in encouraging the participation of underrepresented groups in the areas of science and engineering through exposure to state-of-the-art technology.  In addition, this acquisition will help to attract high-quality faculty and students to URI.  Its use by a wide range of investigators will promote a synergistic climate of cross-disciplinary and inter-institutional research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
