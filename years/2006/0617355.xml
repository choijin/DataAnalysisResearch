<AbstractNarration>Coupling Ecology and Taphonomy: An Integrated Model of Molluscan Death Assemblage Genesis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thomas D. Olszewski&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M University&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0617355&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; Assessing the effect of environmental change on ecosystems requires knowledge of their state in the past.  Historical surveys often are not available or are inadequate to assess the degree and nature of ecological change, but paleoecologists have discovered that the dead remains of molluscs in coastal marine settings can preserve a wealth of information on past environmental conditions.  However, dead shells are known to accumulate over decades to centuries (much longer than the generation times of most molluscs) and to be influenced by a variety of postmortem processes (for example, destruction by a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes and mixing of species from different habitats), resulting in alteration of death assemblages relative to their corresponding living communities.  To unlock the full potential of death assemblages as records of environmental and ecological change, the proposed research will develop a numerical model of their genesis that integrates ecological community dynamics with a broad array of postmortem alteration processes.  Model predictions will be tested using survey data and field experiments from Copano Bay in south Texas, which is ideal for this study because it was the site of several earlier surveys and remains accessible today.  The archived, baseline data from these previous studies are the key to recognizing changes in living communities and evaluating how they are recorded in the accumulations of dead shells from the same region.  Changes in the species composition, diversity, and geographic distribution of habitats will be evaluated by comparing the present-day state of living communities with the results of previous surveys.  The duration of time averaging in death assemblages will be assessed by measuring the postmortem ages of shells (i.e., time since death) using amino acid techniques calibrated to carbon-14 ages.  Species-specific rates of loss, which can alter the apparent community structure of death assemblages relative to living communities, will be directly measured using a series of controlled field experiments.  A modeling approach is necessary to incorporate these many interacting factors into a unified framework that can predict the nature of variation in death assemblage diversity and species composition and relate it to past and present environmental conditions.  For paleontologists studying ecological change in the distant past, this research will provide improved understanding of fossil assemblages.  For ecologists studying ecological change in the present day, this research will help unlock the potential of death assemblages as ecological baselines for recognizing ongoing environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
