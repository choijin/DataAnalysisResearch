<AbstractNarration>Through a cooperative agreement, the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) will provide organizational support to the Arctic Sciences Division to develop, promote, and implement arctic research and education through tasks that cannot be accomplished as effectively by individual researchers, institutions, agencies, or by currently existing advisory bodies. ARCUS has served as the project office for major research initiatives and organized education and outreach efforts and ad hoc meetings in the service of the Arctic research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, ARCUS will provide services in the following four areas: &lt;br/&gt;- Arctic science planning, coordinating science planning for the arctic research community at several levels, including continuing examination of logistical requirements with the goal of improved access for all researchers in the Arctic; &lt;br/&gt;- Organizational support for research programs included in the Office of Polar Programs Arctic Sciences Division: the Arctic System Science Program (ARCSS), the Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP), the Arctic Natural Sciences Program (ANS) and Arctic Research and Education; &lt;br/&gt;- Development and coordination of arctic science educational activities; and &lt;br/&gt;- Information and outreach about opportunities, needs and issues in the arctic to the arctic community of researchers, educators, and the public.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
