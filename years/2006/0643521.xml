<AbstractNarration>Federated sharing of dispersed pools of geographically distributed high-end computing resources under coordinated control is widely recognized as a promising paradigm for building and executing next generation distributed high performance applications. However, the autonomous, heterogeneous and decentralized nature of participating peers across multiple administrative domains introduces two challenges.&lt;br/&gt;One challenge is effective decentralized resource management, which includes introducing incentives for peers to provide good services, self-adaptive resource sharing in different situations and optimal resource allocation. The other challenge is efficient system management, which includes self-defensive system management and user friendly management interfaces. Efficient system management makes the system easy to maintain and use and reduces the system management cost, which is extremely important for large scale systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigator conjectures that the fundamental problem of resource sharing is a dependable mechanism for resource trading. Given this trading mechanism, it is easy to build several high level resource management services, such as service level agreements, optimal resource co-allocation, advance reservation, and dynamic adaptation and reconfiguration. This research consists of four components: (1) An adaptive, personalized trust model named aPET to be employed by individual peers for trustworthiness derivation; (2) A trust-based economic model M-CUBE to efficiently express resources thus to provide a powerful foundation for resource allocation and management; (3) Efficient resource allocation scheme across multiple sites and investigating the impact of trustworthiness provided by aPET on resource allocation schemes; and (4) Applying the proposed trust and economic models to provide efficient system management. The research is expected to serve as a fundamental component and has the extraordinary potential to be deployed and adopted by several high-end computing communities, which require collaboration of geographically distributed resources.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The M-CUBE model provides a general and flexible substrate to support most of high level resource management services, such as resource co-allocation, quality of service (QoS) control, advance reservation and scheduling algorithms. aPET is built on top of our previous work on PET, which derives the trustworthiness from the reputation evaluation and risk evaluation.

Two kinds of knowledge, interaction-derived experience (local knowledge), and the recommendation (knowledge of other peers), are used to derive the reputation.  Selecting the weights of these two parts are environment specific and are a decision on the trade-off between the reliability and efficiency. With the help of the trust management and the merits of the economic institution, M-CUBE provides a novel self-policing and quality-aware framework for the sharing of heterogeneous resources, and is a flexible universal infrastructure for building high-level resource management related services.  M-CUBE is built upon currency-based mechanism, where the uniqueness of M-CUBE is each peer has its own currency.

Finally, we introduced RESCUE, an energy aware scheduler for heterogeneous cloud environments. RESCUE ranks nodes within the cloud based on their Application Specific Energy Efficiency (ASEE), which captures the correlation between the various hardware and software and the energy efficiency. According to ASEE, RESCUE can assign the whole workload to the most energy efficient machine while keeping the same performance. We evaluated RESCUE on a private cloud  and found that  with an aggressive control policy which set the idle machines in æsleep modeÆ , RESCUE-with-sleep can further reduce the total energy consumption by 51.5% for BS See...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
