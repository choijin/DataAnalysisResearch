<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports integrated research, education and outreach activities in theoretical condensed matter physics. The research emphasis is on quantum phases and phase transitions and their connection to phenomena in a variety of solid-state systems and cold atomic gases. The research focuses on quantum critical points. Part 1 focuses on the largely unexplored thermoelectric transport properties of quantum critical points and on problems where the low-lying quantum fluctuations live on a surface in momentum space. Part 2 focuses on non-equilibrium dynamics of sweeping through quantum critical points. Part 3 involves investigating quantum phase transitions in situations where a conventional description of phase transitions based on an order parameter is not adequate. The PI will study phase transitions in bosonic models of quantum criticality to better understand these kinds of quantum phase transitions. These tractable systems can display interesting behavior not seen in classical models, especially when the critical fluctuations arise from fractionalized excitations.&lt;br/&gt;The educational and outreach activities are aimed to convey the intellectual excitement and breadth of modern quantum condensed matter physics. Within the university, new course material at the graduate level that cuts across traditional disciplines, based on ideas that underpin the research above will be developed, and lecture notes made available on a public web-site. Beyond the University, education and outreach efforts are planned in collaboration with a popular museum in Berkeley, the Lawrence Hall of Science. A dynamic physics educational web resource for the much visited Lawrence Hall of Science home page will be set up and will contain sustained input from local physics teachers. This 'Physics Mysteries' resource will expose the non-scientific public, especially young adults, to the strange quantum world and its striking consequences for materials properties. It will include results of recent research and will be updated monthly. Evaluation and continuing feedback will be provided by a five member teacher panel picked from local schools. The Lawrence Hall of Science will host an outreach event involving direct interaction of the PI and a set of students from these schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports integrated research, education and outreach activities in fundamental theoretical condensed matter physics. The research focuses on transformations between states of matter that occur at the absolute zero of temperature. It is believed that these lead to unusual properties at finite temperature displayed in materials that have presented challenges to our understanding. Matter displays fundamentally new properties in the vicinity of these transformations that are called quantum critical points. Some of these transformations lie outside the standard theory of phase transitions and part of the research aims to understand these curious phase transitions that are fundamentally quantum mechanical in origin.&lt;br/&gt;The educational and outreach activities are aimed to convey the intellectual excitement and breadth of modern quantum condensed matter physics.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Just as a cartoon reduces a scene to its most basic elements, topology, a branch of mathematics is concerned with the most essential aspects of a bodyÆs shape. Surprisingly, very similar ideas are proving to be useful in understanding the properties of certain solids, where electrons, governed by quantum mechanical laws organize themselves into states of matter that are best described as `topologicalÆ. That is, they retain certain essential features despite changes to their shape or properties.     Such topological states are not just interesting ideas, they have been detected in real materials and may even prove to be useful. We have discovered two new physical concepts related to topological states in this project that  were both intellectually exciting and hold promise for future utility.     The first has to do with defects in a special kind of insulator. A crystal is considered to be a perfectly periodic arrangement of atoms. In reality there are defects in this arrangement &ndash; one common type of defect is a dislocation, as shown in the figure. The crystal planes, instead of being independent `floorsÆ of a building, are stitched together like the levels of a parking structure. Rotating about the center of the defect leads to motion up or down the structure. We were surprised to find that if such a defect is present in special type of insulator called a topological insulator, something interesting happens. Recall, an insulator blocks the flow of electricity &ndash; but in the case of a topological insulator with this defect, electricity can flow along the defect line. That is, we have a conducting wire immersed in an insulating matrix. It is interesting to speculate whether such wires would be useful to connect miniature electronic components in a three dimensional circuit.     The second result has to do with a topological `semimetalsÆ. A semimetal is between a semiconductor and a metal &ndash; it has electrons that can conduct electricity, but much fewer than in a metal. The most famous semimetal is graphene &ndash; a two dimensional sheet of carbon, which because of its many unique properties, including its semi-metallic character, is a prime candidate as a building block for future electronic devices.
