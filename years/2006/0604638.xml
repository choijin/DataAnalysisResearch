<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0604638&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Wenxiong Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will work on a series of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, integral equations and systems,&lt;br/&gt;as well as other nonlinear problems. Most of the problems arise&lt;br/&gt;from differential or convex geometry, such as the semi-linear&lt;br/&gt;elliptic equations from prescribing Gaussian and scalar curvature&lt;br/&gt;and the Monge-Ampere equations from the well-known Lp- Minkowski&lt;br/&gt;problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Einstein, the Universe we lived in is a curved&lt;br/&gt;space, in which gravity is realized as a distortion or bending of&lt;br/&gt;space-time in the neighborhood of a massive object and this&lt;br/&gt;change of shape is measured by curvature. One of these projects is focused &lt;br/&gt;on understanding when a given function can&lt;br/&gt;become a curvature. This is a challenging problem in global&lt;br/&gt;analysis and has interesting consequences in Riemannian Geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The other of the PI's major projects, the Lp Minkowski problem,&lt;br/&gt;is the central question of the Brunn-Minkowski Theory, which is&lt;br/&gt;the very core of Convex Geometric Analysis. Results in this area&lt;br/&gt;have been applied to numerous disciplines, including stereology,&lt;br/&gt;stochastic geometry, integral geometry, number theory,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, probability, statistics, and information theory.&lt;br/&gt;The nonlinear partial differential equations and integral&lt;br/&gt;equations and systems studied in this project also have various&lt;br/&gt;applications in physics, chemistry, and biology. One example is a&lt;br/&gt;modeling of chemical reaction in rivers or in blood streams,&lt;br/&gt;which would provide useful information in controlling pollution&lt;br/&gt;in rivers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
