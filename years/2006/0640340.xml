<AbstractNarration>The investigators will generate a global climatology of mesosphere inversion layers (MILs) using satellite data.   The climatology will be used to explore the source mechanisms for the layers and to establish their contributions to the dynamics of the middle atmosphere.  MILs are fairly common occurrences in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  Their signature is an increase in temperature with respect to altitude between 65 and 75 km or between 85 and 95 km.  Satellite observations suggest that MILs can be long-lived and extend over tens of thousands of kilometers.  Both ground-based and space-based datasets indicate that MILs are more common at low and middle latitudes than at high latitudes.  The interest in MILs is sparked by their important implications for the energetics and composition of the middle atmosphere:  they can significantly alter the propagation environment and the characteristics of gravity waves which in turn affects the mean flow and tidal structures.   Since MILs appear to be fairly ubiquitous, their effects on gravity wave propagation may have to be considered in the formulation of  gravity wave parameterization schemes for general circulation models.  The climatology to be assembled will accomplish several goals: it will help establish the source mechanism for MILs which are not well understood; it will enable delineating the contributions of tides and planetary waves to the MILs as well as changes to the mean state caused by the fluxes of dissipating waves; and it will provide information on the MILs in a region where they have been rarely seen, the high northern latitudes.  To produce the climatology, the project will utilize temperatures from satellites (the TIMED,  NASA Aura, and the NIMBUS 7 missions) and from lidars at Fort Collins, Maui, and Arecibo.  Airglow images from Bear Lake, Utah, will also be examined to infer information on gravity waves. The research activities address core CEDAR themes of dynamical coupling between the lower atmosphere and the upper atmosphere as well as coupling between different latitudes.  The project is being led by a female scientist and will support the education and training of a science and engineering student.  It will also promote collaborative activities between airglow, lidar, and satellite observing teams.  The results of this investigation are expected to:  &lt;br/&gt;(1) clarify the roles of tides and transient waves in MIL theory; (2) augment the knowledge of MIL occurrences in sparsely observed areas such as the high northern latitudes; (3) guide the interpretation of MILs and ducted gravity waves viewed from ground-based platforms; and (4) inform the middle atmosphere modeling community on potential impacts on gravity-wave breaking parameterizations.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The current National Science Foundation (NSF) International Polar Year project is an international collaboration between investigators at institutions in Canada, Germany, Japan and the US, which combines satellite and lidar measurements, as well as meteorological soundings and analyses in an observational study of the Arctic troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere.   As part of this collaboration, an NSF Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) grant was awarded to examine the large scale wave structure of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, with particular focus on the connections between PWs and mesospheric inversion layers (MILs). These structures are thin layers where temperatures increase with altitude. They are a readily observable signature of middle atmosphere PW breakdown, and have important implications for ducting of GWs, which significantly shape the circulation of the upper mesosphere.   The main objectives for the team at NorthWest Research Associates and the University of Alaska, led by Dr Ruth Lieberman, were to discover the characteristics of MILs at Chatanika, Alaska, where the Rayleigh Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) system is housed at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR). The exact relationship between PW occurrences and MILs, and the effect that observed PWs have on background temperature measurements, were studied in depth. Rayleigh lidar systems are so called because they detect Rayleigh scattered electromagnetic radiation from particles &ndash; in this case, air molecules &ndash; which are smaller than the radiationÆs wavelength. The density of a cloud and aerosol free atmosphere can then be measured from the backscattered lidar signal, meaning that its temperature can then be derived.  The lidar observations and studies were conducted by students and faculty at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  The PFRR lidar is strategically located at a geographical site that is influenced by the most prominent Arctic wintertime atmospheric systems, the polar vortex and the Aleutian High, making its data uniquely useful for investigating MILs. In addition to the lidar data, the Sounding of Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument aboard NASAÆs TIMED satellite, and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the EOS Aura satellite, were employed to give a global perspective on geopotential height and temperature measurements.   MILs were seen in approximately 40 per cent of the 149 clear PFRR night-time lidar temperature profi les recorded between November 1997 and March 2009, the rate of occurrence increasing to nearly 60 per cent for MILs extending up to 80 km. Analysis of the lidar measurements at two hour time intervals showed that the lapse rate on the topside of the MIL approaches the adiabatic lapse rate during the night, indicating that conditions for convective instability and wave breaking occur at night.   Concurrent PW activity was also analysed using data from SABER and MILS; the team found that the most significant PWs to penetrate the stratosphere usually have wavelengths of 360 and 180 degrees of longitude. Westward tilt in the geopotential height was shown to be a common feature, and an inversion in the wave temperature was seen above 70 km more than 80 per cent of the time.   The fluxes of heat momentum associated with the PWs were computed for the same period. These waves exert a net westward torque upon the stratosphere and mesosphere northward of 55&deg;N. The team evaluated the changes to the temperature arising from this PW forcing using a longitudinally averaged model of the global circulation, forced by the computed PW fluxes. The circulation that develops is characterised by rising motion and adiabatic cooling at low latitudes, poleward drift over midlatitudes, and downward motion and adiabatic warming at high latitudes. The accompanying figure shows that the longitudinally averaged warming can reach 6K at the lat...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
