<AbstractNarration>The focus of this engineering education design project is two-fold: 1) to assess the epistemic frame of practicing engineers to identify the skills, knowledge, values, and ways of thinking that engineers in industry need; and 2) to assess the knowledge and skills that instructors, curricula, and guidance counselors communicate to students as prerequisites for pursuing engineering studies and for becoming successful engineers.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will collect and analysis data from practicing engineers from two groups: the 1994 cohort of undergraduates who completed the first design course as freshmen at UW-Madison and participants in professional development courses sponsored by the Department of Engineering Professional Development (EPD).  The proposed data collection methodologies for the practicing engineers provides a systematic approach, a large interdisciplinary sample, a specific longitudinal cohort from undergraduate to practicing engineer, and a thorough analysis and meta-analysis that lacking in the current literature. Second, having first-year engineering students conduct, reflect on, and analyze the interviews is a novel approach with potential benefits to student researchers that can easily be scaled up nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the conclusion of the data collection with practicing professionals the PIs expect to have a robust profile of practicing professionals including the knowledge, skills, values, identity, and ways of knowing that make them engineers. They will evaluate the utility of having undergraduate engineers\ interview practicing professionals and analyze the resulting data as a means to develop the engineering epistemic frame of undergraduate engineers. They will produce a manuscript documenting those findings, as well as curricula and professional development materials to disseminate the technique.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regarding the second thrust of the project  the PIs plan to study high school instructors' beliefs and curricula and use classroom observations to identify how engineering-related subject matter is presented to pre-engineering high school students and document how the science and mathematics education of high school students relates to engineering principles and practices. In addition, they will compare and contrast practices at the high school level to those in the first year of an engineering curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of these studies will contribute to basic theory about the nature of pre-engineering education, the curriculum structure for pre-engineering, and the beliefs that high school teachers, guidance counselors, and first-year college instructors have about the developmental trajectories of potential engineers. They will design and facilitate a professional development workshop to help instructors integrate positive experiences into STEM curricula and develop a learning module to help career development facilitators understand engineering and promote it as a career based on accurate understandings about what an engineer does.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our NSF project fondly called "How People Learn Engineering" is officially titled, "Aligning Educational Experiences with Ways of Knowing Engineering" (AWAKEN) Grant EEC0648267.  The project is a model for collaborative effort between the College of Engineering and the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin &ndash; Madison. The focus has been engineering practice and engineering education respectively.  Together, the project teams have been quite productive along several dimensions, including analysis of observational, interview and survey data from engineering professionals, and analysis of urban, high school student achievement data, classroom observations, curricula, and survey data on teacher and guidance counselor beliefs about engineering education. Inclusive in this has been the development of survey instruments, coding systems for verbal responses, and observation protocols.

Some of the work produced during the AWAKEN project is also cited in the recent report from the National Academy of Engineering, Engineering in K-12 education:  Understanding the status and improving the prospects (Katehi, Pearson, &amp; Feder, 2009; see pp. 51 and 77). The broad range of data collection and analysis activities provided insights about engineering education and professional practice.   Much of what we have learned from the different research strands of the AWAKEN Project converges on one profound principle: The explicit integration of science and mathematics concepts with engineering activities underlies successful professional practice and effective classroom learning and instruction, yet all too often it is implicit or altogether missing in curriculum design, instruction and student learning experiences. STEM integration is often talked about, but it is rarely implemented in practice (Katehi et al., 2009; Prevost et al., 2009, 2010). WhatÆs more, STEM teachers, particularly those who have been newly minted to teach in the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) program, believe in its importance, and believe that they regularly address it during classroom instruction. Therefore, based on our research in high school engineering courses and in professional engineering practice, and experiences with undergraduate courses, we see a clear need for a professional development effort that more effectively integrates the STEM disciplines and the essential skills exhibited by practicing engineers.  Results affirm criteria set forward by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET); that is, practicing engineers value effective skills in communication, problem-solving, teamwork, ethics, and lifelong learning. We have articulated a set of evidence based, actionable instructional principles for secondary and post-secondary engineering instructors, defined the engineering profession in terms of values, attitudes, skills, and ways of thinking and doing (the engineering epistemic frame), and analyzed K-12 engineering education in terms of what teachers intended to teach (intended curriculum) and what they really did in the classroom (enacted curriculum).    Survey results (N&gt;1600) on ways of thinking about and doing engineering have provided a means to compare engineersÆ values in their work and feelings about their education.  A better understanding of the variation in beliefs and practices of engineers can help to target efforts at attracting and retaining a more diverse pool of engineering talent.   Our study of engineering professional practice establishes reliable data and a clear picture of engineering ways of knowing and doing. Analyses from all data show that engineers:  1) see problem-solving and communication (rather than math or science, e.g.) as the essential skills;  2) value learning...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
