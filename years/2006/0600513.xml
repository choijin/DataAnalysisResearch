    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to advance high-throughput manufacturing methods for creating surface patterns at the nanoscale with immobilized enzymes through catalytic stamping, designated as biocatalytic nanolithography. There are three essential components to the proposed work. The first component is devoted to the development of the protein chemistry required to enable the manufacturing processes. For this component the density of both enzyme and substrate will be varied to determine the optimum conditions for enzymatic transformation near surfaces. Additionally, the surface activity of several groups of enzymes will be studied to expand the group of enzymes available for pattern transfer. The second component focuses on the development of master stamps, a parametric study of stamping conditions, and the use of instrumentation with appropriate metrology required to automate manipulation of the stamps with nanometer precision. The third component is focused on providing an integrative educational and research experience for both graduate and undergraduate students, leveraging the currently funded NSF IGERT program in biologically inspired materials and material systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, a new method of manufacturing at the nanoscale will result, utilizing nature's tools (enzymes) for catalyzing reactions on a surface and employing engineering tools required to automate the process. The development of a stamp in lithographic manufacturing processes at the nano- or micro-scale constitutes one of the costly steps. By initially functionalizing the master stamp with molecules that facilitate reversible immobilization chemistry, the masters can be re-inked with new catalyst, reducing engineering time and cost in high-throughput manufacturing. This new catalyst might simply replace inactive (worn-out) enzyme, or an alternative enzyme that catalyzes different chemistry can be substituted. Advantages of the process include 1) lack of physical transfer of molecules from the stamp to the patterned surface, enabling high resolution, 2) inherent selectivity of enzymes that facilitate orthogonal reactivity and the ability to create complex patterns through multiple stamping procedures, and 3) a green chemistry that avoids the use of expensive, toxic, and flammable solvents, heavy metals and other reagents. Students trained in this evolving field of research will contribute to the use of Nature's tools for manufacturing at the nanoscale.</AbstractNarration>
