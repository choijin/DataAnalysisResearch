<AbstractNarration>Many of the challenges of contemporary biology and medicine lie at the intersection of the mathematical and biomedical sciences making the education and training of a scientific workforce capable of integrating these fields essential. The University of Michigan's SUBMERGE (Supplying Undergraduate Biology and Mathematics Education and Research Group Experiences) program merges the subjects of mathematics and biology for undergraduate students in three important and unique ways:  i) direct involvement in interdisciplinary research at the interface of biology and mathematics, ii) exposure to experimental biology within mathematical modeling courses and exposure to quantitative analysis in biology courses, and iii) regular mentoring by teams of faculty researchers in each field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUBMERGE is ideal for undergraduates with at least two years of study remaining and who have demonstrated an interest in interdisciplinary science.  Student cohorts will consist of balanced groups of mathematics and biology majors, separated into teams of four. Students in this program will have the opportunity to investigate experimentally and mathematically the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced, to build synthetic genetic systems and model their behavior, and study the mechanical characteristics of bacterial aggregates in flowing blood.   SUBMERGE also brings together an exciting group of faculty, both senior and junior to carry out its innovative strategy and will pave the way for a fully integrated and first of its kind program in mathematical biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 21st century promises a new era of rapid growth of modern life science and biotechnology. This explosive growth of vibrant and novel scientific agendas and paradigms calls for an increase in the size as well as a shift in the philosophy of the scientifically trained work force. SUBMERGE graduates will be prepared for the interdisciplinary challenges that await them in graduate school or in industry.</AbstractNarration>
