<AbstractNarration>This is a research project in Computational Mathematics. Our goal is to &lt;br/&gt;use new algebraic ideas for the development of algorithms to solve &lt;br/&gt;discrete optimization problems. Discrete optimization is the study of &lt;br/&gt;optimization problems in which there are a finite (but usually very large) &lt;br/&gt;number of potential solutions. These are not enumerated but rather defined &lt;br/&gt;implicitly by equation or inequality constraints, e.g., linear or &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear relations. We focus in non-linear integer programs with &lt;br/&gt;polynomial constraints which are notoriously difficult and we explore &lt;br/&gt;several non-traditional tools for solving them, including multivariate &lt;br/&gt;rational functions and complex analysis, polynomial Hilbert's &lt;br/&gt;Nullstellensatz certificates, and new canonical reformulations for integer &lt;br/&gt;linear programs. We are also interested on closely related problems in &lt;br/&gt;computational convexity. Including the computation of polyhedra related to &lt;br/&gt;optimization, the practical approximation of regions by unions of &lt;br/&gt;polyhedra and the solution of geometric problems using convex programming &lt;br/&gt;methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software and algorithms for solving discrete optimization problems has &lt;br/&gt;potential applications to many fields of huge practical importance, such &lt;br/&gt;as data mining, finances and economics, transport scheduling (e.g. crew &lt;br/&gt;scheduling problems), and circuit design. Examples of discrete &lt;br/&gt;optimization problems include the minimum spanning tree problem of &lt;br/&gt;selecting the least expensive network connecting given sites or the &lt;br/&gt;traveling salesman problem (TSP) consists of selecting the least expensive &lt;br/&gt;tour of a given set of locations. Since most discrete optimization &lt;br/&gt;problems are useful but very difficult to solve, researchers have explored &lt;br/&gt;special structures to be able to solve them in practice (e.g., in the case &lt;br/&gt;of the TSP) or settle for algorithms that compute near-optimal solutions. &lt;br/&gt;In our project we try non-traditional tools based on recent mathematical &lt;br/&gt;progress as a way to approach these very difficult problems. We also have &lt;br/&gt;a strong educational component for this project. Several graduate and &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students will all play important roles in the project's &lt;br/&gt;development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
