    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is aimed at investigating a new method for fabrication of bulk amorphous magnetic material. This method is based on a novel thermal spray approach for net or near-net shaping that has demonstrated the capability to achieve the high thermal quench rates that are necessary for retention of the amorphous state. Amorphous magnetic material is desirable for low-loss power electronic applications such as the core of electrical transformers. Unfortunately, manufacturing costs of amorphous core transformers presently exceeds the costs of the competing technology of grain oriented silicon steel. It is the intent of this research to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept as an alternative and cost-saving fabrication method and to prepare for a Phase II project to further develop the technology and gain a more complete understanding of the advantages and limitations of the approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of the project is significant in that transformer core losses alone account for annual losses in the range of billions of dollars, and amorphous core transformers already realize substantial loss reduction. Any cost reduction in the manufacturing process would promote further market penetration and a more efficient power distribution network.</AbstractNarration>
