<AbstractNarration>Physics (13). This project provides help for students to improve their reasoning skills, attitudes, and beliefs about learning in order to build the foundation for successful careers in STEM. The project is: 1) creating instructional materials and methods that will be used to develop students' reasoning skills; 2) improving students' post instruction performance on measures of reasoning ability, beliefs about learning, and conceptual understanding in physics; and 3) improving retention rates and grade point averages of STEM students. This project develops instructional material and methods appropriate for college students that are based upon the Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education (CASE), Feuerstein's Instrumental Enrichment, (FIE), and Numerical Relationships (NR) programs. Intellectual Merit: Both understanding of basic concepts in physics and strong scientific reasoning ability are essential for science and engineering majors. This project provides the means to build these critical characteristics in an original, creative way. The PI and Co-PI have extensive knowledge of cognitive development, how to assess it, and its connection to conceptual understanding in physics. The external consultants are experts in physics education research, cognitive development, and an extant program in this field. The project blends research-based pedagogy and assessment. Broader Impact: The project has great potential benefit to society by making careers in science and engineering possible for many students including members of underrepresented groups who might otherwise find college-level science courses very difficult. The project impact will be broadly disseminated through local workshops for college instructors, presentations at national conferences, publications in peer reviewed journals, and distribution of web-based materials.</AbstractNarration>
