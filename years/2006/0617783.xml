<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception in 1970, the Conference on Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME) has sponsored a number of annual meetings on a variety of topics in economic theory and econometric methodology. There are currently six seminars, in Bayesian Inference, Time Series, Forecasting, Microeconometrics, Decentralization, and General Equilibrium, which meet annually. The purpose of this ongoing conference series is to stimulate discussion and research on the frontiers of econometric and economic theory, and to investigate the application of mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to empirical economic studies. It is intended to both encourage research on new topics and speed the dissemination of the latest findings by leading scholars. To this end, these meetings have been exceptionally successful, providing forums for the exchange of ideas in economic theory and methods that are not constrained by more formal frameworks of journal publications. The channels of communication are informal and regular, allowing specialists in selected topic areas to meet regularly, at widely dispersed institutions and for longer periods than is generally possible at meetings of professional societies. CEME has been especially fruitful, particularly for young scholars at the beginning of their professional careers. Recently, a number of structural changes to the CEME organization were made to ensure continuing diversity in the participants and research topics. These changes include regular appointments of new co-organizers and seminar leaders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Advances in economic theory and econometrics, the fields covered by CEME conferences, have brought several innovations that benefited society at large, in particular to the organization of financial markets, regulatory policy and the evaluation of social and economic policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference series is by nature a mechanism to promote learning.  It gives participants, often younger scholars, an opportunity to present their work and get acquainted with the work of others.  Students at host and nearby institutions attend the meetings.  In addition, conference websites provide online access to all papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
