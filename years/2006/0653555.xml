<AbstractNarration>This project is an investigation of a new approach to scalable quantum computing and communication. In this approach, small registers consisting of a few coupled quantum bits are coupled to each other by quantum optical communication channels that can be used to establish long-range entanglement and perform remote operations between distant quantum bits.  In particular individual electron spins associated with a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond coupled coherently to individual nearby carbon-13 nuclear spins in diamond lattice will be explored as qubits. The electron-nuclear spin system can be manipulated coherently and has exceptional coherence properties even at room temperature, indicating a potential for robust quantum memory.  Specific goals of the proposed project include (i) detailed understanding of the coherence properties of electron and nuclear spin quantum bits in the solid-state and development of techniques for their accurate, coherent quantum state manipulation; (ii) robust quantum optical entanglement and quantum operations involving remote spin qubits, and (iii) development of robust architectures for quantum communication and quantum computation based on such systems. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop systems for efficient, scalable quantum information processing that can tolerate large imperfections.&lt;br/&gt;This work involves a team of researchers from the Harvard University and Texas A&amp;M University.  The research will contribute significantly to the knowledge base of Quantum Information Science (QIS). Beyond providing a new avenue toward quantum computation, the experimental approach is ideally suited for the realization of repeater nodes for long-distant quantum communication.   The project provides exceptional opportunities for education and training in the new interdisciplinary area involving the interface of several fields of fundamental physics, material science, and device engineering. Innovative graduate and undergraduate courses in these areas will be developed and combined with outreach to local schools and public presentations. Finally, the concepts and techniques developed in this work will likely have a wide range of applications in diverse areas of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
