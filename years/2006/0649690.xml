<AbstractNarration>0649690&lt;br/&gt;Popper&lt;br/&gt;   This award to University of Maryland provides support for scientific participant travel and expenses for participation by US scientists in a conference to be held in Denmark in 2007 addressing issues related to the impacts of sound on marine fauna.  The topic of anthropogenic sound in the marine environment has become an issue of significant regulatory and public concern, both domestically and internationally, but the scientific information available to make informed decisions regarding actual impacts is quite limited.  In conjunction with separate support from other US and international groups, support is provided here to bring experts together to address the scientific findings and additional needs on this topic, and to produce a set of publications that help define the state of knowledge on the use of sound by various marine organisms, processes and changes in underwater acoustics and ambient noise, sources of anthropogenic noise and their characteristics, effects of noise on various animal groups, and the current national and international regulatory framework for use of noise in the marine environment.  &lt;br/&gt;   Broader Impacts:  Support provided here will improve efforts to assess potential impacts of natural and anthropogenic sounds on marine animals.  Many human activities, including scientific research, introduce sound into the marine environment intentionally or incidentally, and a clear understanding of the nature of such impacts on organisms is an important element in our effort to properly assess potential environmental impacts based on the best available science.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
