<AbstractNarration>This Comprehensive ITEST project is based on the premise that using gaming as a context in which to integrate the learning of mathematics, computer science and art would heighten student interest in the broader area of STEM education as well as develop computer science skills that students could use in a variety of careers.  Previous research on game-developer pedagogy is used as the theoretical basis for the project and the project has a strong tie with a major game development company in the Denver area.  Teachers (60 over three years) and students (135 over three years) partcipate in an intense two-week summer humane gaming camp.  The emphasis on "humane" game development is intended to attract more women into the game development community (and STEM education) where their numbers are very low.  During the year teachers implement the gaming ideas in their classroom to facilitate students' creation of games.  At the end of the academic year, students present the games at a game fair.  The summer workshop teacher professional development is supplemented by quarterly workshops during the academic year.  External evaluation, both formative and summative, takes place as part of the project.</AbstractNarration>
