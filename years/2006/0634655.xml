<AbstractNarration>0634655&lt;br/&gt;Howard&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This project is to support a US-Morocco Workshop on "Digital Archives for the Maghreb Region of Africa" to be held January 25-28, 2007 in Rabat, Morocco.  The U.S. organizer is Eric S. Howard, The Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology, Cape Elizabeth, Maine.  The foreign collaborators are Dr. Khalid Temsmani, Dr. El Majid Zayer and Dr. Ilhame Laaziz, all from the Directorate of Technology, Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in Rabat, Morocco.  A primary goal of the workshop is to develop a vision and mission statement for a digital initiative covering the Maghreb region (i.e., Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia). The meeting will bring together key constituents so that this vision can be realized: content development, management structures, networked infrastructure, research and educational applications, and training for digital managers and users. The findings will be incorporated in a report and plan of action that can inform government agencies, libraries, universities, research institutes and grant-making entities. US researchers and students will be involved in the process. Their role will be to review the background papers from the January 2006 Alexandria, Egypt workshop on the digital library and digital infrastructure, and to prepare additional ones to fill critical gaps in our knowledge as it relates to the Maghreb region. Representatives from North African countries as well as UNESCO are expected to attend.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:   Efforts to extend and enhance internet connectivity and content access to the Maghreb region are long overdue.  The proposal, building on the earlier workshop in Alexandria takes another important step forward toward building a regional resource, connecting to the global knowledge environment that will serve multiple purposes including advancing research capacity and educational resources.  The success of this long-term process is dependent upon social and organizational actions as much as upon technology advances.  The workshop is to connect important players throughout the region and to build linkages to high-speed networks and governance structures in the developed world.  It will identify existing regional efforts and prompt new efforts to collect, organize and make generally available materials related to the cultural heritage of the region, which is significant for US scientists. The Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology has the expertise and experience to organize the meeting and disseminate its findings to a large audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  Access to digital information in developing countries is a critical issue of international concern. The World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia in the fall of 2005 significantly enhanced the interest of entities in Northern Africa with respect to the digital world.  This workshop is an important step in the efforts to include North Africa in the global mainstream of scientific and educational communication which involves co-sharing of globally distributed digital content.  One area of interest is a digital archive, the creation of a networked digital library covering the cultural heritage of the Maghreb region to facilitate access to related cultural heritage resources held by different institutions around the world.  The workshop will promote a broader discussion of the potential of digital libraries to advance knowledge and to foster international cooperation.  It should result in dialogues, new discourse communities, intellectual programs of research and scholarship and coordinated infrastructure building. US junior scientists and graduate students are expected to participate in the workshop.  The project is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering, the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, and the Office of Cyber Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
