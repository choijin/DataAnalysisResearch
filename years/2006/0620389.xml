    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology that allows the stabilization of live probiotic bacteria for incorporation into food products outside the dairy case. ABN proposes a novel microencapsulation solution that involves pumping viscous liquids through a spray nozzle, followed by the capture of the resultant particles in a cross-linking fluid. The Phase II objectives are to complete the commercial acceptability of this novel process by modifying the system to make all processes steps compliant with current Good Manufacturing Processes and by designing and fabricating the final critical drying step for the microencapsulated probiotics. This final step will provide a product that is stable enough to be used by the food and feed industries to allow the use of probiotics in products that do not need to be refrigerated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manufacturing technology proposed herein is an enabling technology that will open many new commercial opportunities for a number of industries. Stabilization of the probiotics and incorporation into nutritional bars, beverages, cereals, and other food products that do not require refrigeration will greatly expand the commercial potential, and choices for consumers who will benefit from these gut-friendly bacteria. The same technology could also be used for the stabilization and delivery of enzymes, vaccines, and other small molecules whose oral delivery is limited by gastric digestion.</AbstractNarration>
