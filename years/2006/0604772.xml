<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the several subjects which this project will focus on is a&lt;br/&gt;(possibly) new type of invariant for finite group actions on toplogical &lt;br/&gt;spaces.  Let G denote a finite p-group, for some prime integer p, and let&lt;br/&gt;F denote a field of characteristic p.  Any cellular group action&lt;br/&gt;h:GxK ---&gt; K  by G on a finite CW complex K gives rise to a chain complex&lt;br/&gt;C(*) over the group ring F(G).  An "elemental chain subcomplex" of C(*)&lt;br/&gt;is any chain subcomplex E(*) such that for some integer i the boundary&lt;br/&gt;map  E(i) ---&gt; E(i-1)  is an isomorphism between principle F(G)-modules, &lt;br/&gt;and  E(j)=0  if j is not equal to i,i-1.   A chain subcomplex D(*) of &lt;br/&gt;C(*) is called a "minimal core" for C(*) if C(*) is the direct sum&lt;br/&gt;of D(*) and some elemental chain subcomplexes of C(*), and if D(*) does &lt;br/&gt;not have any elemental chain complex direct summands.  In recent work &lt;br/&gt;Jones has shown that a minimal core always exists and that its &lt;br/&gt;isomorphism type depends only on the equivariant homotopy type of the &lt;br/&gt;group action h.   In future work Jones plans to focus on the &lt;br/&gt;classification (up to isomorhism) of all minimal cores over the group ring&lt;br/&gt;F(G).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In toplogy (that field of mathematics to which this project is &lt;br/&gt;most closely associated) one studies the structure of spaces in a very&lt;br/&gt;loose manner.  Examples of the spaces which topologists study occur &lt;br/&gt;everywhere ---- from theortical physics to objects occuring in everyday&lt;br/&gt;life such as a ball or donut.  From the point of view of toplology&lt;br/&gt;all balls are the same (they have the same shape when considered as&lt;br/&gt;abstract toplological spaces); likewise any two donuts have the same&lt;br/&gt;"shape";  however a ball has a different "shape" than a donut (since&lt;br/&gt;a donut has a hole but no ball has a hole in it).  The main object of &lt;br/&gt;topology is the determination of when two differenet spaces have the &lt;br/&gt;same "shape" (such spaces are said to be "topologically equivalent").&lt;br/&gt;For well over one hundered years an important approach to this problem&lt;br/&gt;has been to associate algebraic objects (such as numbers, groups, rings,&lt;br/&gt;etc.) to each space in such a way that if two different spaces are &lt;br/&gt;topologically equivalent then all their known associated algebraic objects &lt;br/&gt;must be equal.  This approach has been very successful because the associated&lt;br/&gt;algebraic objects are generally much easier to understand then are the &lt;br/&gt;spaces themselves.  Jones has recently discovered what seems to be a new&lt;br/&gt;type of algebraic object associated to spaces.  Currently he is trying &lt;br/&gt;calculate this new algebraic object and to understand how it is related &lt;br/&gt;to the many older well known algebraic objects associated to spaces.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
