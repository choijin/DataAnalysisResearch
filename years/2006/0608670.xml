<AbstractNarration>Gartland&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0608670&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator carries out numerical modeling of problems&lt;br/&gt;in two important new areas of the physics of liquid crystals: (1)&lt;br/&gt;mean-field theories for phases of biaxial and bent-core&lt;br/&gt;liquid-crystal materials, and (2) numerical solution of&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic models for the dynamics and statics of point defects&lt;br/&gt;in liquid-crystal systems (in the absence or presence of fluid&lt;br/&gt;flow).  The investigator uses techniques from modern numerical&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation analysis together with the theories of singularities&lt;br/&gt;and bifurcations in the presence of symmetry to study the full&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation and phase behavior of recent mean-field models for&lt;br/&gt;biaxial materials, along with models that he and collaborators&lt;br/&gt;are developing for the important new class of bent-core&lt;br/&gt;materials.  The investigator adapts and extends methods from&lt;br/&gt;computational fluids with moving and deforming bodies ("moving&lt;br/&gt;overset grid methods") to provide effective techniques to&lt;br/&gt;accurately model challenging problems involving the dynamics and&lt;br/&gt;statics of point defects in macroscopic liquid-crystal director&lt;br/&gt;models, with application to surprising recent physical&lt;br/&gt;experiments on defect-pair annihilation in capillaries filled&lt;br/&gt;with a liquid-crystal material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Liquid crystals are complex fluids that possess partial&lt;br/&gt;molecular orientational order.  They can be used to control&lt;br/&gt;light, and this feature underlies many of their significant&lt;br/&gt;technological applications.  In recent years, new liquid-crystal&lt;br/&gt;molecules have been synthesized that exhibit certain special&lt;br/&gt;phases.  These new phases are termed "biaxial," because they have&lt;br/&gt;secondary ordering properties in addition to those of the more&lt;br/&gt;common "uniaxial" materials.  The liquid-crystal community has&lt;br/&gt;high hopes for potential new applications of these new materials. &lt;br/&gt;The theoretical and experimental study of biaxial liquid crystals&lt;br/&gt;is at a relatively early stage.  In this project the investigator&lt;br/&gt;analyzes a mathematical model for such materials that&lt;br/&gt;characterizes the bulk equilibrium state of the system and&lt;br/&gt;associated transitions, as a function of control parameters such&lt;br/&gt;as temperature.  This study requires both mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;numerical techniques.  In addition, the investigator and&lt;br/&gt;collaborators develop new models for the special sub-class of&lt;br/&gt;"bent core" liquid crystals, which are of high current interest. &lt;br/&gt;The merits of this work are two-fold: (1) validation of the&lt;br/&gt;models and (2) the development of predictive tools to aid in the&lt;br/&gt;design of experiments and in the identification of parameter&lt;br/&gt;ranges for technological applications.  The second main topic of&lt;br/&gt;the project concerns the numerical modeling of the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;defects in liquid crystals (isolated singularities in the fields&lt;br/&gt;that characterize the orientational properties of the medium). &lt;br/&gt;Defects are ubiquitous in liquid-crystal systems, and they cause&lt;br/&gt;considerable difficulty both from mathematical and numerical&lt;br/&gt;points of view.  The investigator and co-workers apply numerical&lt;br/&gt;procedures from other areas of computational fluid dynamics, both&lt;br/&gt;to model numerically a target problem involving the annihilation&lt;br/&gt;of a pair of point defects in a capillary tube filled with liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystal and to compare these numerical results to recently&lt;br/&gt;published experimental data.  These techniques (new to the area&lt;br/&gt;of liquid crystals) should open the door to a number of other&lt;br/&gt;numerical-modeling problems involving defects that have&lt;br/&gt;previously been hampered by unphysical numerical artifacts. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
