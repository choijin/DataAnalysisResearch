<AbstractNarration>Lee 0632231&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided in support of a study to understand exchanges across a major gateway linking the Arctic with the subpolar North Atlantic " Davis Strait (Canadian Arctic Archipelago).  The proposed study purports to quantify, with robust error estimates, Davis Strait watermass variability, volume, liquid freshwater, heat and ice fluxes at weekly to inter-annual timescales.  These measurements will be used to advance understanding of the impacts of these exchanges on large scale characteristics of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed observation system, currently under development in Davis Strait, employs complementary techniques to resolve critical aspects of the exchange. The system includes: &lt;br/&gt;(1) A sparse array of subsurface moorings, each instrumented with an upward looking sonar, an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), conductivity-temperature (CT) sensors, and (deep) conventional current meters, will provide time series of upper ocean currents, ice velocity, and  ice thickness, &lt;br/&gt;(2) Shelf sites instrumented with ADCPs, CT sensors and an innovative, low-cost package for collecting CT time series in the ice-threatened near-surface region, and &lt;br/&gt;(3) Acoustically navigated Seagliders to provide year-round, repeated, high-resolution hydrographic sections across the straits.&lt;br/&gt;The Davis Strait network will be undertaken in collaboration with the Bedford Institution of Oceanography.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
