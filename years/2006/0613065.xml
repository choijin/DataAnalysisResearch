<AbstractNarration>WORKSHOP: UINTAS 2006"The Uinta Interdisciplinary Assessment Symposium&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for partial support of a conference focused on Earth system science in&lt;br/&gt;the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah. The Uinta Mountains are a fascinating natural laboratory&lt;br/&gt;for the study of Quaternary climate changes, landscape evolution, and geoecology. The mountain&lt;br/&gt;range contains a federally designated wilderness area spanning nearly half a million acres, and is&lt;br/&gt;administered by three different National Forests. Over the past decade, numerous academic&lt;br/&gt;researchers have forged innovative collaborations with land managers working on these National&lt;br/&gt;Forests, which have greatly improved our understanding of previously overlooked aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;Uinta land system. This work began in the mid-1990s with a dedicated program of geomorphic&lt;br/&gt;mapping that formed the basis of a Forest Service land systems inventory. From that starting point,&lt;br/&gt;research has expanded in a multitude of directions, encompassing topics as diverse as Quaternary&lt;br/&gt;geochronology, periglacial landscape evolution, paleolimnology, post-glacial climate changes,&lt;br/&gt;treeline fluctuations, fluvial geomorphology, and forest ecology. The addition of new researchers&lt;br/&gt;and the establishment of new research programs have been particularly rapid over the past five years,&lt;br/&gt;with the result that more than a dozen academic scientists are actively pursuing funded research in&lt;br/&gt;the range, including two multi-year projects supported by the National Science Foundation. The&lt;br/&gt;results of this work have been presented in more than 10 peer-reviewed papers, and have&lt;br/&gt;considerable relevance to ongoing studies elsewhere in the central Rocky Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The vibrant nature and breadth of current research in the Uintas is exciting and&lt;br/&gt;presents considerable potential for interdisciplinary collaboration. However, the large number of&lt;br/&gt;researchers focused on so many varied topics is inhibiting the efficient communication of research&lt;br/&gt;goals and results necessary for the development of future collaborations. This is not the fault of any&lt;br/&gt;individual research group, but rather the inevitable outcome of an increasingly specialized scientific&lt;br/&gt;community in which researchers with different interests attend different meetings and follow&lt;br/&gt;different literature. As a result, the great potential for innovative interdisciplinary research in the&lt;br/&gt;Uintas will remain unrealized until these artificial barriers between disciplines are overcome and&lt;br/&gt;robust connections can be made between research groups with complementary interests.&lt;br/&gt;The weekend conference described in this proposal, UINTAS 2006"The Uinta Interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;Assessment Symposium, will address this situation by greatly enhancing communication between&lt;br/&gt;the academic research groups currently active in the Uintas. Through presentation of research&lt;br/&gt;overviews and results, and focused planning sessions, a foundation will be constructed for the next&lt;br/&gt;generation of innovative, interdisciplinary, projects. The conference will also highlight ways to&lt;br/&gt;better connect academic research with the needs of land managers to ensure that the history of&lt;br/&gt;fruitful collaboration between academe and the Forest Service will be maintained.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The concept for this conference has met with great enthusiasm from the research&lt;br/&gt;community currently active in the Uintas, and from the U.S. Forest Service, which is providing the&lt;br/&gt;majority of the funding. Forest Service land managers are particularly excited about the potential for&lt;br/&gt;this conference to become a model for how government land management agencies may better&lt;br/&gt;coordinate their needs with the interests of academic researchers. As such, this conference has great&lt;br/&gt;potential for impacts beyond the community of researchers currently focused on the Uintas.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, it is expected that approximately 16 presentations will be made on aspects of Earth&lt;br/&gt;system science in the Uintas at the conference. These presentations will be collected and published&lt;br/&gt;as a special issue of the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, ensuring that the conference&lt;br/&gt;presentations, and the results obtained to date by the different research groups, will be readily&lt;br/&gt;available to the broader scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
