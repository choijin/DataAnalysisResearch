<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0605639&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Katrin A. Wendland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has become a successful practice in mathematics to take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of lessons learnt from physics. In this proposal, three&lt;br/&gt;such lessons are singled out, which should be of interest in&lt;br/&gt;their own right but also contribute to the proposer's long term&lt;br/&gt;research aims, a complete understanding of conformal field&lt;br/&gt;theories (CFTs) on K3 surfaces and beyond. The first part of the&lt;br/&gt;project is devoted to classically unknown properties of&lt;br/&gt;elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds, arising from the&lt;br/&gt;conjectured heterotic-type IIA string-string duality. We will&lt;br/&gt;combine an algebraic geometric and an index theoretic approach,&lt;br/&gt;which is novel.  A new index theorem and novel insights into the&lt;br/&gt;mathematics of the duality are aimed for. A recent conjecture of&lt;br/&gt;John McKay is also tested, relating Dynkin data to sporadic&lt;br/&gt;groups. The second part of the project deals with so-called TERP&lt;br/&gt;structures, which underlie the geometry of moduli spaces of&lt;br/&gt;supersymmetric quantum field theories.  Here, D-branes and their&lt;br/&gt;stability conditions shall be studied using techniques from&lt;br/&gt;geometric analysis and integrable systems rather than the&lt;br/&gt;standard approaches. CFTs on K3 surfaces are studied in the third&lt;br/&gt;part of the project, where for a powerful new family of examples&lt;br/&gt;various techniques for the study of boundary CFTs and vertex&lt;br/&gt;operator algebras shall be tested. A generalization of previously&lt;br/&gt;obtained results about CFTs on K3 surfaces to certain&lt;br/&gt;Borcea-Voisin 3-folds is also planned. This research will&lt;br/&gt;underpin and generalize the PI's previous results, confirming and&lt;br/&gt;extending an applicable dictionary between geometry and CFT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory is as yet the most promising candidate for a&lt;br/&gt;physical model of the real world. It describes particles and&lt;br/&gt;forces of nature using one-dimensional extended objects, the&lt;br/&gt;strings, whose behavior naturally depends on the ambient&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Vice versa, one can view these strings as testing the&lt;br/&gt;ambient geometry, whose properties can be read off from the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the strings. This bi-directionality is crucial, since&lt;br/&gt;string theory on the other hand uses the language of quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theory which in many ways is richer than classical&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Hence string theory provides a natural bridge between&lt;br/&gt;two fundamental, seemingly unrelated concepts: quantum field&lt;br/&gt;theory and geometry. The proposed research aims to make use of&lt;br/&gt;this bridge. In particular, it is proposed to use classically&lt;br/&gt;unknown predictions coming from string theory to gain a deeper&lt;br/&gt;understanding of various geometric structures, including&lt;br/&gt;particular Calabi-Yau 3-folds and so-called tt* geometry in&lt;br/&gt;general.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
