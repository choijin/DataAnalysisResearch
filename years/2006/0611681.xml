<AbstractNarration>Numerical computations in multiple space dimensions have traditionally been &lt;br/&gt;based on structured grids (e.g. finite differences or spectral methods) or &lt;br/&gt;on unstructured grids (e.g. finite elements). Even in the latter case, &lt;br/&gt;there is structure in the sense that one needs to work out which subsets of &lt;br/&gt;nodes should be connected into local triangles, tetrahedra, etc. Aspects &lt;br/&gt;associated with such grid generations can at times consume as much or even &lt;br/&gt;more computer resources than do the subsequent computations on the grid. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, it has been all but impossible to achieve high (spectral) &lt;br/&gt;computational accuracy on such grids without resorting to extensive use of &lt;br/&gt;domain decompositions. Numerous mesh-free methods have been proposed &lt;br/&gt;recently. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) approach stands out in several &lt;br/&gt;respects, most notably in that it generalizes traditional spectral methods &lt;br/&gt;to entirely mesh-free settings. Furthermore, implementations are usually &lt;br/&gt;remarkably simple. For example, 20-30 lines of Matlab typically suffices &lt;br/&gt;for solving an elliptic PDE on an irregular 3-D domain, to spectral &lt;br/&gt;accuracy. Both pseudospectral (PS) methods and RBFs were first proposed in &lt;br/&gt;the early 1970's. The superior performance of PS methods for solving many &lt;br/&gt;PDEs was demonstrated early on. A NSF proposal by the present investigator &lt;br/&gt;about 5 years ago was the first time RBFs were presented  in terms of being &lt;br/&gt;a direct replacement for the traditional basis functions in PS methods. &lt;br/&gt;Recently, significant progress has been made both on overcoming the high &lt;br/&gt;computer cost and the numerical ill-conditioning that earlier were thought &lt;br/&gt;to severely limit the RBF approach. Recent NSF-DMS supported work by the &lt;br/&gt;present investigator has opened up numerous further opportunities in this &lt;br/&gt;area, which will now be pursued. These include combining spectral accuracy &lt;br/&gt;with local node clustering in a fully stable way, a new stable algorithm in &lt;br/&gt;the extremely high accuracy flat basis function limit, developments towards &lt;br/&gt;faster algorithms, and the application of RBFs to PDEs in the geometries &lt;br/&gt;that are most relevant in astro/geophysics, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last several decades, computational methods have become an &lt;br/&gt;increasingly essential part of how science and engineering are conducted, &lt;br/&gt;partly because of a rapid evolution of computer hardware, but equally much &lt;br/&gt;thanks to improvements in computational algorithms. Very often, the task to &lt;br/&gt;be solved, when formulated in mathematical terms, require the solution of &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations (PDEs), often in irregularly shaped regions &lt;br/&gt;in several space dimensions. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) methodology, &lt;br/&gt;which is the subject of the present grant, opens entirely new opportunities &lt;br/&gt;in this regard, combining very high accuracy with unsurpassed geometric &lt;br/&gt;flexibility. One of several application areas of particular interest &lt;br/&gt;(pursued in collaboration with scientists at NCAR and NOAA) concerns &lt;br/&gt;geophysical and astrophysical modeling in spherical geometries, which are &lt;br/&gt;critical issues for effective climate modeling and for studies of solar &lt;br/&gt;dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
