<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)&lt;br/&gt;Division Computer and Network Systems (CNS)&lt;br/&gt;Science of Design (SoD) Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0613971&lt;br/&gt;P/I: Sherif Abdelwahed&lt;br/&gt;PI's Department: Electrical Engineering - Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Vanderbilt University&lt;br/&gt;Award: $ 199,866&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  "SoD-TEAM: Design for Adaptivity and Reliable Operation of Software Intensive Systems"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses design techniques for Software-Intensive Systems (SIS). The scientific contribution of the project is the conversion of a significant segment of the design process of software-intensive systems, typically handled manually in an ad-hoc manner, into a systematic semi-automated process based on mathematical models and control-theoretic techniques. The model-based techniques and tools will simplify the development of a large class of distributed real-time and embedded software-intensive system, which will enable a major improvement in the ability to design and implement complex systems that will operate in uncertain environments in a cost-effective manner. The science and technology developed by this project will inform designers about how to build more effective and reliable systems.  Along with the new design methodology proposed, the PIs will develop a set of tools that facilitate the design, analysis, and verification tasks, making it easier to design and analyze systems, while offering a higher degree of confidence in assured operations. In addition to the basic research component of the project, there is an educational component that will contribute to the development of practitioners in the field. Students at this institution are introduced to systematic methods for embedded system design and implementation using modeling, analysis, and verification tools developed by the R&amp;D community. To provide students with more hands on experiences, project-related graduate-level courses will be developed that address issues in software-intensive system design and implementation on realistic test beds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program Manager: Anita J.
