    <AbstractNarration>The emergence of the primary election process during the 20th Century is widely&lt;br/&gt;thought to have transformed American politics. For example, primary elections&lt;br/&gt;allegedly weakened political parties and fueled the rise of personalistic, incumbency&lt;br/&gt;oriented politics; and primary elections are though to have made politicians much more&lt;br/&gt;ideologically extreme than the electorate as a whole, because candidates must first win&lt;br/&gt;approval of a partisan subset of the electorate before they can even qualify for the&lt;br/&gt;general election.&lt;br/&gt;Addressing even the most basic questions about this two-stage process is difficult&lt;br/&gt;because no comprehensive database on primary election results in the U.S. currently&lt;br/&gt;exists. This project assembles a database on primary elections for statewide and&lt;br/&gt;federal offices. For each state, we collect election returns for every statewide and&lt;br/&gt;federal office for major-party primary elections from the year the first primaries were&lt;br/&gt;held to the present.&lt;br/&gt;Our project yields broad educational and social benefits including useful digital&lt;br/&gt;databases archived at the ICPSR and on our own websites, publications in a variety of&lt;br/&gt;media, data sets made available to state election boards and/or secretaries of state,&lt;br/&gt;research collaboration between three major educational institutions, mentoring and&lt;br/&gt;employing research assistants who are women and under-represented minorities, and&lt;br/&gt;professionalization of undergraduates and graduate students who co-author with the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigators.</AbstractNarration>
