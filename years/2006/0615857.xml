<AbstractNarration>Markel, Vadim A. Univ. of Pennsylvania / Kim, Arnold D. Univ. Of California-Merced&lt;br/&gt;0615857 / 0616228&lt;br/&gt;Image Reconstruction Algorithms for Optical Tomography with Large Data Sets Using the Radiative Transport Equation&lt;br/&gt;It is well known that modern medical imaging has revolutionized the practice&lt;br/&gt;of clinical medicine. What is perhaps less well known is the critical role&lt;br/&gt;that advanced mathematical tools have played in the development of imaging&lt;br/&gt;technologies. In this proposal, we plan to explore fundamental mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems at the core of optical tomography. Optical tomography (OT) is an&lt;br/&gt;emerging biomedical imaging modality which employs near-infrared&lt;br/&gt;light as probe of tissue structure and function. At the heart of OT is an&lt;br/&gt;ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. We propose to develop new mathematical&lt;br/&gt;tools to attack this problem by building on recent progress made by the&lt;br/&gt;co-investigators in the areas of inverse scattering theory and radiative&lt;br/&gt;transport theory. The investigators have recently demonstrated the ability&lt;br/&gt;to reconstruct immages using reconstruction algorithms that are valid within&lt;br/&gt;the diffusion approximation to the radiative transport equation (RTE). We&lt;br/&gt;now plan to extend this development to physical situations in which the the&lt;br/&gt;full power of the RTE is required. Two key developments pioneered by the&lt;br/&gt;con-investigators makes the research we propose feasible and timely. The&lt;br/&gt;first of these is the construction of analytical methods for&lt;br/&gt;the inverse scattering problem in radiative transport. The second enabling&lt;br/&gt;development is the recent discovery of plane-wave decompositions for the RTE&lt;br/&gt;Green's function. The proposed research integrates the development of new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical methods with algorithm development and experimental validation.&lt;br/&gt;We have assembled an interdisciplinary and highly collaborative team of&lt;br/&gt;investigators with complementary skills who are uniquely&lt;br/&gt;qualified to carry out this research. The team consists of a computational&lt;br/&gt;physicist (Vadim Markel), an applied mathematician (Arnold Kim), and a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical optical physicist and physician (John Schotland).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is the development of&lt;br/&gt;efficient imaage reconstruction algorithms which are based on novel and&lt;br/&gt;original mathematical theories. One graduate student at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania will be trained in computational and analytical methods of&lt;br/&gt;image reconstruction. A postdoctoral fellow at the University&lt;br/&gt;of California, Merced will be trained in the area of forward problems in&lt;br/&gt;transport theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact will include improving the quality of reconstructed images&lt;br/&gt;in optical tomography. We expect that when the proposed developments are&lt;br/&gt;fully realized, they can significantly improve the clinical utility of&lt;br/&gt;optical tomography. Furthermore, although the proposed work is focused on&lt;br/&gt;optical tomography, some of the results may also lead to a greater&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the propagation of multiply scattered waves in random&lt;br/&gt;systems such as the atmosphere and interstellar media.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
