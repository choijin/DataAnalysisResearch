<AbstractNarration>This project will provide science research programs for rural grade 4-8 students in after-school and summer programs.  The lead partner is the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass), which is just outside Franklin County; the other higher education partner is the only college in this county, Greenfield Community College (GCC).  Other partners are the county's eight school districts plus local businesses and informal science organizations.   STEMRAYS will connect students and teachers with ongoing interdisciplinary environmental research programs in the region, providing them with authentic science experiences and interactions with scientists, engineers and college and graduate students from UMass, GCC and Smith College.  Students and teachers will collect and analyze data that will be used by the scientists and engineers in their research projects, focusing on five environmental research themes:  Arsenic, Pioneer Valley Watershed Studies, Weather RATS, Air Quality and Birds.  This coupling to active research groups has been demonstrated to provide a richer experience for students than do science "activities" that provide only a classroom-based experience.   STEMRAYS research involves major concepts in the biological, physical and earth sciences, as well as significant ideas in engineering and technology.  Analyzing, graphing and interpreting data will aid in developing mathematical skills.  STEMRAYS will support in-school curricula due to alignment with the Massachusetts Math, Science and Technology/ Engineering Framework.  Program features include an online resource bank and career awareness/workplace activities.  Project goals for students include increasing their interest in science careers, their knowledge of science content and the role of science in the world.  Teachers will increase their understanding of the process of doing scientific research, their ability to engage and motivate students in science and their knowledge of science content.  STEMRAYS will deepen the partnership among schools, institutions of higher education, informal education centers and business to support the program and to help sustain it after the grant ends.  An educational research program will go beyond the usual project evaluation in studying the impact of STEMRAYS research team model on the students and on the teachers.  The pilot phase will offer after school programs in six elementary schools and science clubs in two middle schools.  Following summer workshops for teachers and a science camp for middle school students, full-scale implementation will involve 24 teachers and approximately 288 children.</AbstractNarration>
