    <AbstractNarration>AWARD NO: AST-0607495&lt;br/&gt;PI: Pascale Garaud&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of California Santa Cruz&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Magnetohydrodynamics of stellar interiors&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This research is part of a long-term project to better understand the magnetohydrodynamics&lt;br/&gt;of stellar interiors. Towards this end, a 2-dimensional dynamical structure&lt;br/&gt;and evolution code is being constructed which incorporates the interaction between largescale&lt;br/&gt;magnetic fields and flows. The effects of small scale fields and flows are also&lt;br/&gt;modeled through turbulence closure. Here the PI will continue developing the core&lt;br/&gt;numerical algorithm (which is already producing results concerning the dynamics of the&lt;br/&gt;solar radiative region) and testing the closure model (which has been successfully tested&lt;br/&gt;against experimental data for rotating shear flows). Specific tasks to be undertaken&lt;br/&gt;include: 1) Developing computational methods to extrapolate numerical results to solar&lt;br/&gt;values of the various diffusion parameters and testing them against solar observations. 2)&lt;br/&gt;Further improving and extending the existing closure model to take into account turbulent&lt;br/&gt;energy transport and testing the model predictions against 3D numerical simulations of&lt;br/&gt;rotating convection. And 3) combining the radiative zone model with the turbulence&lt;br/&gt;closure model to obtain a complete numerical algorithm designed to study the magnetohydrodynamics&lt;br/&gt;of the interior of a solar type star, and obtaining qualitative results for a&lt;br/&gt;variety of stellar parameters (structure, internal field strength, rotation rate). Future&lt;br/&gt;planned work will then investigate in turn: the stability of the models obtained to various&lt;br/&gt;kinds of axially symmetric and non-axially symmetric instabilities; the dynamical&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the model with respect to the generation of a magnetic cycle; and the careful&lt;br/&gt;quantitative comparison with existing data from various sources (e.g. asteroseismology,&lt;br/&gt;Doppler Imaging, Mount Wilson Ca-line survey).&lt;br/&gt;The modeling approach being developed will include geometric aspects of the dynamics&lt;br/&gt;(missing from 1D models) without the heavy computational load of 3D models. Thus the&lt;br/&gt;work here will be of value to many other areas of astronomy - particularly&lt;br/&gt;asteroseismology and studies of the solar interior where the sophistication of the&lt;br/&gt;observations now demand better models. Therefore, once fully developed, these tools will&lt;br/&gt;be made available to the astronomical community. This work also supports a graduate&lt;br/&gt;student who will be trained in numerical magnetohydrodynamic modeling and&lt;br/&gt;interpreting/comparing these results with observations.</AbstractNarration>
