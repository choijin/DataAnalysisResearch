<AbstractNarration>0612063&lt;br/&gt;Bordia&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project supports collaborative research by Dr. Rajendra Bordia, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington and Dr. Zaki I. Mohamed, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute (CMRDI), Helwan, Egypt.  They plan to study the synthesis and sintering of TiC-based ceramic matrix composites for structural applications. Meeting the challenges of higher cutting speeds, higher tolerances and longer tool life requires the production of tailored microstructure with improved hardness, wear resistance and fracture toughness. This requires further developments in the processing techniques including unconventional processing methods requires a precise knowledge and control of the synthesis and sintering processes to avoid specimen distortion, cracking and high stress level due to sintering rates difference, properties variations and temperature non- uniformity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Ceramic matrix composites (CMC) with and without ductile binder are of special interest to industry. The performance of such materials depends on their properties, which in turn depends on the composition and microstructure. The PIs will study the possibility of synthesis of highly dense TiC and its composites with other materials (Al2O3, ZrO2) with and without ductile binder (Fe, Ni, Co,) in an effort to improve their mechanical properties. Self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) combined with application of external load will be used in the fabrication of these materials. The advantage of using this technique is the ability of performing synthesis and sintering at the same time and in one step. The different processing parameters controlling the physical and mechanical properties of the final object will be investigated. The two teams have complementary expertise and resources that will make it possible to address this problem. The Egyptian team will focus on the synthesis of the TiC-based CMCs materials with and without ductile binder. The effect of different parameters controlling the synthesis process will be studied. The US team will focus on the microstructural and mechanical characterization of the materials developed in Egypt. A systematic investigation of the effect of the composition and microstructure on relevant mechanical properties will be conducted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project can lead to improvements in cutting and drilling tools from TiC composites which are needed to be more effective, allow higher cutting speeds, higher tolerances and longer tool life. This project will initiate a new international collaboration and will provide both junior and senior researchers an opportunity to work in a unique international collaborative environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
