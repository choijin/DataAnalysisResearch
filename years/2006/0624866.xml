<AbstractNarration>Texas Southern University Science and Technology Enhancement Program (STEP) will implement various strategies in order to increase the number of African Americans and female graduates in chemistry, mathematics and physics.  The activities will include 1)student recruitment and retention, 2) faculty development in teaching and scholarly achievement and 3) curricular reform and enrichment through the use of information technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TSU STEP recruitment efforts has as its goal an increase in the graduation rate.  The efforts will focus on aggressively recruiting high achieving students, addressing and removing academic barriers through supplemental curriculum programming in gatekeeper courses and creating a student-centered culture of excellence and high expectations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty development will ensure appropriate integration of technology.  The project will treain faculty in the use of Blackboard, ensure full integration of technology and on-line instruction and increase the number of STEM faculty members who engage in research opportunities and in the supervision of undergraduate research.  TSU will partner with other institutions in this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curriculum reform will include the incorporation of web-based technology and computational methods as n integral part of the curricula for STEM majors.  The project will involve faculty from Biology, Chemistry, Computer Scinece, Engineering Technologies, Mathematics and Physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Texas Southern University (TSU) has implemented the comprehensive plan, Science and Technology Enhancement Program (STEP), to enhance the science and technology undergraduate program at the university. The primary objective of STEP is to increase the number of African Americans and female graduates in the STEM fields, and providing direct support for biology and engineering technologies majors. The program has achieved this overall objective through three programmatic guiding principles: (1) student recruitment and retention for academic success, (2) faculty development in teaching and scholarly achievements, and (3) curricular reform and enrichment through the use of the information technology.  The institutional focus of improving graduation rates through teaching and learning touches on multiple areas of university programming, including academic and faculty excellence, improved learning environment, and the commitment to training a STEM workforce.  The STEP received supplemental funding for an additional year.  The program was expanded to incorporate the following: Academic Excellence Workshops (AEW), a STEP Undergraduate Research Program; an International Research Experience for Undergraduates (IREU); and continuing the Summer internship STEM-READY (Research Experience and Development for Youth); and continuing student Scholarship Support.  The Historically Black College and University Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) entitled "Science and Technology Enhancement Program (STEP)" recruited 80 undergraduates for direct stipend support over the last six (6) years.  These students majored in biology and engineering technologies. The STEP program has shown evidence of having an impact on academic achievement of these scholars, with a retention rate to date of 91 percent and a graduation rate of 78 percent for students receiving direct support.  Of directly supported graduates over the years there were three valedictorians, one salutatorian, and 62 percent graduating with honors.  The STEP program has indirectly impacted over 1,700 students enrolled in the College of Science and Technology.  Academic Excellence Workshops: A major factor in the academic success of the initial STEP award was the Collaborative Learning Community (CLC).  We expanded upon this success through the Academic Excellence Workshops (AEW). Success skills training, designed to build study and communications skills, develop time management and goal setting abilities, and promote team building was a major focus of AEW. Additionally, AEW offered personal and professional development workshops. Lastly, personal counseling sessions assisted students in coping with financial problems, health problems, parental pressure, relationships, stress, and peer pressure, particularly as pertaining to alcohol and drugs, and academic competition.   STEP Undergraduate Research Program (SURP): The STEP Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) offered an academic-year research experience to students that prepared and encouraged them to pursue graduate STEM academic and career opportunities. The SURP accomplished this goal through the following strategies:  a)      Used selected COST research groups which participated in initial STEP faculty development activities as STEP research groups (SRG) to engage high performing STEM undergraduate students in mentored research activities,  b)      Six COST undergraduates were selected to participate in the SURP.  These students were taken through a battery of safety and laboratory training.  Students were then allowed to participate in a laboratory rotation through several research groups within COST.  International Research Experience for Undergraduates (IREU): The International Research Experience for Undergraduates (IREU) program provided a summer internship at Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, and P.R. China (BJTU).  In the TSU collaboration with Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, P.R. China (BJTU), BJTU accepted two exceptional s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
