<AbstractNarration>AWARD ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Fundamental Investigation and Thermal-Electrical Control of Ion, Fluid, and Biomolecular Transport through Nanochannels&lt;br/&gt;Nanofluidics, the study of ion, fluid, and molecular behavior in a highly confined nano-environment, shows great potential in single molecular sensing and manipulation, which could be invaluable for high throughput drug screening.  The design and application of nanofluidic devices, however, require complete understanding of, and control strategies for ion, fluid, and molecular transport through nanochannels, where novel phenomena occur because of nano-confinement.  At present, our knowledge of nanofluidics is far from complete since nanofluidics is still in its infancy.  The intellectual merit of the proposed research program is the advancement of nanofluidics with fundamental studies using molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements, and the development of thermal and electrical control strategies to manipulate ion, fluid, and molecular transport through nanochannels.  The research will not only address fundamental issues such as ion distribution and bubble formation in nanochannels, but also develop microdevices for single molecule trapping and investigation.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will naturally include dissemination of scientifically relevant discoveries in archival journals, but several important features of the proposed work will distinguish the far-reaching impacts of this project.  The proposed research program includes integrated research, education, and outreach activities, which involve both graduate and undergraduate students, and the acquired knowledge will be used in the classroom instruction for two courses, "Micro/NanoElectromechanical Systems" and "Introduction to Nanoscience and Engineering."  This project will also provide research opportunities to undergraduate students through summer research programs.  K-12 students will benefit from the proposed educational activities such as development of service learning and the PI's involvement in summer boys and girls science camps.  The planned guest lectures and seminars at Fisk University, a historically black university, will extend the impact to minority students.  The molecular dynamics code will be broadly disseminated through Vanderbilt's Advanced Computing Center for Research &amp; Education (ACCRE).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
