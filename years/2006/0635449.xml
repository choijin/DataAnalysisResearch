<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;DMS 0635449&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: James O. Berger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAMSI is a national institute that will deeply impact the future&lt;br/&gt;of the statistical and mathematical sciences and, through them,&lt;br/&gt;science in general, by catalyzing creation of the theory and&lt;br/&gt;methodology necessary to confront the central data- and&lt;br/&gt;model-driven scientific challenges of our time. SAMSI will focus&lt;br/&gt;on new syntheses of the statistical sciences, applied mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and disciplinary science. To illustrate the vision, consider an&lt;br/&gt;activity central to modern science and technology, and with which&lt;br/&gt;SAMSI will be heavily engaged: numerical modeling of complex&lt;br/&gt;physical processes. Developing numerical models and evaluating&lt;br/&gt;their fidelity to reality requires merging knowledge from&lt;br/&gt;multiple disciplines. Applied mathematics builds on disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;understanding to construct a fine-detail numerical representation&lt;br/&gt;of the deterministic aspects of a process; probability provides&lt;br/&gt;concepts and insight to characterize stochastic elements of the&lt;br/&gt;process; and statistics provides the mechanisms to relate these&lt;br/&gt;constructs to observational data on the real-world process. But,&lt;br/&gt;despite a multiplicity of context-specific advances, there is&lt;br/&gt;currently no general framework for combining these disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;much less a formal system for simultaneously applying them. The&lt;br/&gt;SAMSI efforts in this direction will focus on filling this gap,&lt;br/&gt;by bringing together statisticians, mathematicians and modelers&lt;br/&gt;from across the country (and beyond) to establish frameworks for&lt;br/&gt;model development and validation, at a high level that spans&lt;br/&gt;multiple application contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To carry out this synthesis of the statistical sciences, applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences and disciplinary sciences, SAMSI engages&lt;br/&gt;established researchers - from academia, industry, national&lt;br/&gt;laboratories and government - as well as young researchers&lt;br/&gt;(postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) at the formative&lt;br/&gt;stages of their careers. Each research program lasts from 6&lt;br/&gt;months to one year, and involves a host of activities ranging&lt;br/&gt;from research by intensive interdisciplinary working groups to&lt;br/&gt;broad, energizing workshops. Outreach to undergraduate students,&lt;br/&gt;high-school teachers and faculty from teaching institutions&lt;br/&gt;extends SAMSI's impact on the essential development of the&lt;br/&gt;national human resource base for science. To enable activities of&lt;br/&gt;the breadth and depth necessary for the success of SAMSI, the&lt;br/&gt;institute is a partnership between the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation and the consortium of Duke University, North Carolina&lt;br/&gt;State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. These&lt;br/&gt;partners provide a uniquely strong base for SAMSI's national&lt;br/&gt;scope. Scientific input to SAMSI comes, in part, from a National&lt;br/&gt;Advisory Council composed of eminent statistical and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;scientists. Most important, SAMSI will engage the entire&lt;br/&gt;nationwide statistical and mathematical sciences communities, by&lt;br/&gt;means of widely publicized opportunities to bring problems to&lt;br/&gt;SAMSI, or direct SAMSI's attention to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This was SAMSI&rsquo;s largest program ever and consisted of four components: Methodology, Climate Modeling, Engineering and Renewable Energy, and Geosciences.

Program leader Don Estep and coauthors undertook a systematic study of this problem in a triad of papers. They describe the uncertainties in terms of probabilities, and use a measure-theoretic approach to design numerical methods for computing these probabilities. The third paper, published in the SIAM/ASA Journal on UQ, demonstrates the effectiveness of the measure-theoretic approach in an application with simulated noisy data from Hurricane Katrina. Estimating the amount of flooding in the wake of a hurricane and identifying safe passages for naval transportation requires knowledge of the ocean floor, specifically its depth and topography (bathymetry).

IN a series of three papers, SAMSI postdoc Veronica Berrocal, with co-authors Alan Gelfand from Duke and David Holland from the Environmental Protection Agency, developed a Bayesian space-time downscaling fusion model approach to calculate predictive surfaces for air quality. Their method was incorporated into a model used by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Fused Air Quality Surface Using Downscaling (FAQSD) model, as part of its mandate to provide regularly updated reports on the nation&rsquo;s air quality.</p> <p>Table 1 gives a summary (based on program organizers&rsquo; reports) of papers, grant applications and software in all full-year programs during the project period; overall, some 286 papers, 15 grants and 11 software packages were directly attributed to SAMSI.

Table 3 shows the current employment status of all postdocs who entered SAMSI during the project period; 70% of them are currently in academic positions.</p> <p>SAMSI organizes three workshops per year aimed at undergraduate students: a 2-day workshop each fall and spring and a week-long undergraduate modeling workshop in early summer. For graduate students, SAMSI organizes the Industrial Mathematical and Statistical Modeling workshop, a 10-day workshop each summer where students work on projects suggested by industry or government researchers. Reviews from participants in these workshops have repeatedly affirmed their value in introducing students to research.</p> <p>&nbsp;SAMSI has shown a consistent track record in working to support diversity and encourage the involvement of underrepresented groups in its activities.

SAMSI organizes three workshops per year aimed at undergraduate students: a 2-day workshop each fall and spring and a week-long undergraduate modeling workshop in early summer. For graduate students, SAMSI organizes the Industrial Mathematical and Statistical Modeling workshop, a 10-day workshop each summer where students work on projects suggested by industry or government researchers. Reviews from participants in these workshops have repeatedly affirmed their value in introducing students to research.   SAMSI has shown a consistent track record in working to support diversity and encourage the involvement of underrepresented groups in its activities. Figure 1 shows how the percentages of women and ethnic minorities have varied over the years.       Last Modified: 12/15/2016       Submitted by: Richard L Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
