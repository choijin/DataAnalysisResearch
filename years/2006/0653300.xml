<AbstractNarration>A challenging problem in theoretical physics is the unification of &lt;br/&gt;the laws of quantum physics with Einstein general theory of relativity. The &lt;br/&gt;ideas in this direction that have been pursued most forcefully are superstring &lt;br/&gt;theory and noncommutative geometry. These two approaches are intimately &lt;br/&gt;related. Noncommutative geometry has provided a new framework to study &lt;br/&gt;spaces which could not be handled by the standard methods of Riemannian &lt;br/&gt;geometry. It offered a new perspective in the study of gauge theories and the &lt;br/&gt;role of the Higgs field and is a promising candidate to describe geometries at &lt;br/&gt;Planckian energies. The main focus of this proposal is to study the nature &lt;br/&gt;of space-time at sub- Planckian scales and to find its geometric properties &lt;br/&gt;and thus determine the dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is that the research involves work on the frontiers of noncommutative geometry and will be of benefit to both physicists and mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
