<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0604775&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Tamas Hausel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to understand the global analysis, geometry,&lt;br/&gt;topology and arithmetic of complete hyperkaehler manifolds of&lt;br/&gt;non-compact type and find exciting applications in other fields&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics and physics, where these manifolds naturally&lt;br/&gt;appear. The proposed research has therefore two main aspects:&lt;br/&gt;studying fundamental questions for non-compact hyperkaehler&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, such as Hodge theory and the Atiyah-Singer index&lt;br/&gt;theorem, and applying these methods in other fields. The&lt;br/&gt;hyperkaehler spaces appearing in this proposal include: moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces of Yang-Mills instantons on asymptotically locally&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean gravitational instantons; more generally Nakajima's&lt;br/&gt;quiver varieties; toric hyperkaehler varieties; moduli spaces of&lt;br/&gt;magnetic monopoles on R^3; moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on a&lt;br/&gt;Riemann surface; and more generally hyperkaehler spaces appearing&lt;br/&gt;in the non-Abelian Hodge theory of a curve (like moduli of flat&lt;br/&gt;GL(n,C)-connections and character varieties) and in the Geometric&lt;br/&gt;Langlands Program. The fields of applications include:&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, representation theory, finite group theory, low&lt;br/&gt;dimensional topology, number theory, mathematical physics and&lt;br/&gt;string theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is common in (1) the existence of a magnet with a single&lt;br/&gt;pole (2) the reliability of computer networks and (3) code theory&lt;br/&gt;and code breaking?  My research provides an answer: these&lt;br/&gt;scientific problems can all be attacked using quaternionic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Quaternions are four dimensional analogues of complex&lt;br/&gt;numbers. For problem (1) one can study magnetic monopoles using&lt;br/&gt;quaternionic equations. The possible existence of these and&lt;br/&gt;similar elementary particles could lead to new energy sources.&lt;br/&gt;For (2) the proposed research shows that the number of holes on a&lt;br/&gt;certain quaternionic surface attached to a graph agrees with the&lt;br/&gt;reliability polynomial of a computer network based on the&lt;br/&gt;graph. Qualitative properties of this reliability polynomial,&lt;br/&gt;obtained from the study of the geometry of quaternionic surfaces,&lt;br/&gt;help explain how to make computer networks, like the internet,&lt;br/&gt;more reliable. In (3) arithmetic study of certain quaternionic&lt;br/&gt;surfaces sheds light on the representation theory of finite&lt;br/&gt;groups of Lie type, which are used in various schemes in code&lt;br/&gt;theory.  Information emerging from the geometry of these&lt;br/&gt;quaternionic surfaces, could help devise better codes.  In short,&lt;br/&gt;my research is two-folded, first it studies fundamental problems&lt;br/&gt;in quaternionic geometry, and second it breaths life into these&lt;br/&gt;investigations by applying the results to other fields in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics. This yields a colourful palette of&lt;br/&gt;various fields in mathematics and physics all related in one way&lt;br/&gt;or another to quaternionic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
