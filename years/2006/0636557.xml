<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0636557&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Daniel S. Freed, Sean M. Keel,&lt;br/&gt;Lorenzo A. Sadun, Karen K. Uhlenbeck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UT Geometry Group Research Training Grant is a vertically&lt;br/&gt;integrated program to enhance the training of undergraduates,&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, and postdoctoral associates at the University&lt;br/&gt;of Texas and, through publication on the web, beyond.  The nine&lt;br/&gt;faculty members of the Group will initiate new activities at all&lt;br/&gt;levels.  Included is a new distinguished lecture series,&lt;br/&gt;Perspectives in Geometry, which will be widely disseminated.  The&lt;br/&gt;Geometry Group at UT has long taken a unified perspective on the&lt;br/&gt;field.  Our seminars reflect our approach: they include a healthy&lt;br/&gt;mix of ideas from algebraic geometry, differential geometry,&lt;br/&gt;global linear and nonlinear analysis, representation theory, and&lt;br/&gt;topology.  Often concepts and inspiration from theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics play a role as well.  The RTG training activities are&lt;br/&gt;designed to promote this view of geometry and, more broadly, of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and science to young mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, the study of Number and Space, lies at the&lt;br/&gt;foundation of science and technology.  Geometry, the study of&lt;br/&gt;Space, has long had connections with and applications to the real&lt;br/&gt;world.  In the ancient world measurement was introduced to&lt;br/&gt;facilitate commerce; more advanced concepts, such as&lt;br/&gt;trigonometry, were introduced to understand the stars.  In our&lt;br/&gt;modern world advanced ideas in Geometry underlie abstract&lt;br/&gt;theories in physics and also have more immediate practical&lt;br/&gt;implications, for example in coding theory, computer graphics,&lt;br/&gt;etc.  Effective training of the next generation of Geometers is&lt;br/&gt;vital for the continued development of this field, both within&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and for external applications.  The University of&lt;br/&gt;Texas Geometry Group Research Training Grant (RTG) promotes a&lt;br/&gt;unified view of the field.  Through local activities in Austin,&lt;br/&gt;and via dissemination on the web, the RTG will enhance training&lt;br/&gt;at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The University of Texas Geometry Group Research Training Grant (RTG) isfounded on a unified view of the field.  The work of our senior researcherspushes traditional boundaries.  We designed the activities in the RTG topromote that vision to young mathematicians.  New classes and seminars unitestudents and postdoctoral fellows working at the algebraic and analyticextremes of geometry and encompass everything in between.  The RTG fundedmany visitors from the United States and beyond.  Such visits are crucial tothose carrying out basic research in relative geographic isolation.  Thesevisitors gave lectures and interacted informally with all members of ourgroup.  The RTG provided the impetus and support to re-initiate ourUndergraduate Mathematics Club, which has been a huge success.  It is a nexusfor undergraduate mathematicians, providing them not only with mathematicalenrichment, but also career information, leadership training, and a communityof like-minded students.  The RTG supported several postdoctoral fellows andmany graduate students.  Many are already thriving in the next stages oftheir careers, and others will soon join them.   The RTG was designed to have an impact which outlives the duration of thegrant.  The local activities continue in Austin, and through our web presencethe influence is felt far beyond.
