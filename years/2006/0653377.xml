<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support the Center for Quantum Information Physics (CQuIP) at Yale University.  Research in CQuIP is exploring systems with promise for use in large-scale quantum information processing. The use of quantum effects enables new capabilities such as secure communication without cryptographic keys; exponential speedup of certain computational tasks; etc. However, these advantages can only be fully realized with systems of quantum bits (the counterpart in quantum computing to the bit of information in classical computing) that are much better controlled, and interconnected in much larger networks, than is now possible.  This project will address both issues.  Experimental studies will advance the state of the art in controlling quantum bits in several systems, including superconducting circuits; individual molecules trapped by lasers or by microelectrodes on a chip; micromechanical cantilevers; and atomic nuclei manipulated using magnetic resonance methods.  A key goal of this work is development of improved methods to interconnect such systems to each other, and to the outside world using photons (a particle of light).  Microwaves are a form of light that oscillates at a much lower frequency and this project will involve the use of both microwave and optical photons. In support of the experimental work, theoretical research will investigate new ideas for improving both the control and the networking of quantum bits.  A major part of the CQuIP effort is the education of young researchers (Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellows, and undergraduates) by involving them directly in the research.  Through participation in this research they will be propeared for future careers in academia, industry, or government laboratories.  This project receives support from the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support the Center for Quantum Information Physics (CQuIP) at Yale University.

Further development of quantum bits based on superconducting circuits and trapped polar molecules will advance the fidelity of quantum information storage and processing.  The manipulation and transfer of complex quantum states will be demonstrated using both optical and microwave photons, coupled to electrical and/or micromechanical devices.  Limitations to control of large quantum networks will be explored using coupled nuclear spins.  Finally, schemes will be devised, using the system of polar molecules as qubits, to implement recent ideas for complex many-body topological states for information storage.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Work at the Center for Quantum Information Physics (CQuIP) at Yale University centered on the study and development of systems with promise for applications in large-scale quantum information processing.  The use of quantum effects in information storage and computation can enable new capabilities such as secure communication without cryptographic keys, exponential speedup of certain types of calculations, etc. However, these advantages can only be fully realized with systems of quantum bits (the counterpart in quantum computing to the bit of information in classical computing) that are sufficiently well controlled, and interconnected in much larger networks than is now possible.  This project addressed both issues, and at the same time explored spin-off applications enabled by the scientific advances made in the course of our studies.   Our project made advances in several interrelated areas.  One major focus was the development of quantum processors based on superconducting circuits.  CQuIP researchers made dramatic advances in the design and fabrication of "transmons", small devices on circuit boards that show the same fully quantum-mechanical behavior as atoms and can be used as quantum bits (qubits).  These advances made it possible to store quantum information with these systems for unprecedentedly long times, and also to read and write information with extremely high fidelity.  These transmon qubits were coupled to single particles of light, photons, which also obey the laws of quantum mechanics.  These very long wavelength (microwave) photons were trapped for long periods within the superconducting circuit traces, and could be controlled so as to be emitted and/or absorbed by the transmons on demand.  The interconnected system of transmons and photons, known as "circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED)", enabled a series of benchmark results such as the transmission of quantum information along a "bus" wire; the demonstration of two- and three-qubit control processes essential for quantum computation and quantum error correction; etc.  In parallel, CQuIP team members explored and developed methods to connect these quantum circuits to other types of quantum systems such as individual electrons, collections of quantum magnets, and/or individual molecules.  Such interconnects hold the promise to store quantum information for longer times, and/or to convert it to the form of optical photons as needed for transmission over long distances.  At the same time, CQuIP researchers explored a wide range of other physical systems whose properties are relevant to, or useful for, quantum information processing.  The resistanceless flow of current typical of superconductors was observed to occur also in tiny rings of ordinary metal. Methods were developed to study and control the quantized vibrational motion of microscopic, drumhead-like sheets of transparent materials; this system could enable methods to circumvent irreducible quantum fluctuations in the intensity of laser beams, and thereby increase the precision of many types of measurement devices.  Members of the CQuIP team developed new techniques for cooling gases of molecules with lasers, and for trapping molecules with beams of light; these advances may enable new understanding of the quantum mechanics underlying chemical reactions, and/or the construction of a device to simulate exotic materials with useful properties, that are difficult to fabricate. Theorists on the team also devised methods to use a network of circuit QED devices for a similar type of quantum material simulator.  Finally, CQuIP researchers devised new methods to control the loss of information in large systems of couple qubits.  When applied to the spinning nuclei present in nearly all matter, this led to a new technique for magnetic resonance imaging of dry objects (including bone, granular materials, etc.) with unusually good spatial resolution.
