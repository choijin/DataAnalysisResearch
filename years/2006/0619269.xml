<AbstractNarration>MRI: "Acquisition of a High Speed-High Resolution Non Contact Strain Measurement System to Improve Research, Training and Education on the Behavior of &lt;br/&gt;Engineering Materials"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No. NSF-0619269, Principal Investigator: G. Reyes-Villanueva, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan  Dearborn. The award is for the acquisition of a High Speed-High Resolution Non Contact Strain Measurement System to Improve Research, Training and Education on the Behavior of Engineering Materials. The instrumentation will be key in a research program that addresses a number of important and timely issues in the engineering materials area including: 1) Development and analysis of multifunctional hybrid systems, focusing on the interaction between the dissimilar materials, the stress-strain distribution and concentration at the interfaces and the development of a design optimization tool for multifunctional systems subjected to static and dynamic rates of strain, 2) Evaluation the effect of strain rate on the fracture behavior of thermoplastic nanocomposites where toughening, crack initiation and propagation mechanisms will be revealed, 3) Analysis of the fatigue characteristics of spot welded joints, 4) Evaluation of the forming effect on fatigue of advanced sheet steels, 5) Study of the crush resistance of aluminum and aluminum-composite hybrid tubes, 6) Gaining fundamental understanding of the tensile and fatigue behavior of flexible polymers, 7) Investigation of the energy dissipative capabilities of polymeric materials, and 8) Shearing of advanced high strength steel; among others. The award for the acquisition of a High Speed-High Resolution Non Contact Strain Measurement System will be of extreme importance on advancing the fundamental understanding of advanced engineering materials of interest for future medical, transport and military applications.&lt;br/&gt;The incorporation of the awarded state of the art instrumentation to be used by junior and senior faculty of the College of Engineering will enhance the quality of research, education and training of undergraduate and graduate students on the important field of engineering materials. A large number of engineering students will be positively impacted resulting from the exposure to advanced analysis of the mechanical behavior of engineering materials in an educational and research context. Results, illustrations and animations will be incorporated into educational materials to make the understanding of basic engineering concepts much easier and interesting for the student. Special efforts will be placed on broadening the participation of students from underrepresented groups by providing research opportunities in these novel and emerging technologies. Thus, promoting advanced research and educational values as means of professional and economical development. A broad group of researches and educators at the college will benefit from the use of the proposed instrumentation resulting in better interdepartmental research interactions leading to multidisciplinary projects with a high quality level and originality. The award will be of extreme importance in the establishment of a high quality research in a non-PhD granting institution and will also contribute to broaden the interaction with the industry at a local and national level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
