<AbstractNarration>This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research (NEESR) payload project will utilize the experimental test set-up of the NSF-funded project (CMMI-0530759) entitled "NEESR SG:  Development of Performance Based Tsunami Engineering, PBTE" at the NEES tsunami wave basin at Oregon State University during June - December 2007.  The objective of this payload project is to install residential structural models, at a larger-scale than the mid to high-rise structures tested by the SG researchers on the other side of the wave basin, to investigate impact due to wave loading and run-up (applications to tsunami engineering) and pressure/wind driven surge (applications to hurricane engineering and science).  The payload project will install two single-family dwelling models beside each other on a flat surface above the waterline representing coastal property or a structure slightly inland.  The following new knowledge will be generated by this payload project: (1) information on fluid impact loads as a function of different wave heights and ground slopes on residential structures to enable the development of dimensionless charts for use by practitioners/planners and to facilitate innovative construction techniques in coastal regions; (2) an understanding of the load transfer mechanism and uplift forces on residential structures during wave and surge loading, both of which are not understood currently; and (3) the relationship of scale model pressure to full-scale prototype damage through existing methods, formulations, and minimal assembly testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  Whole woodframe models have never been tested in a tsunami wave basin; thus new information about the response of woodframe structures subjected to tsunami loading will be generated and made available to the earthquake engineering and broader science community.  Broader impacts: Experimental results will be made available to researchers, practitioners, designers, and public policy officials via the NEES central data repository operated by NEES Consortium, Inc. (http://www.nees.org) to facilitate innovative products and construction techniques.  This project has applicability not only within earthquake engineering but also to multi-hazards (e.g., hurricane science and engineering).</AbstractNarration>
