<AbstractNarration>This award supports the research in general relativity and theoretical astrophysics of the PI, one postdoctoral research associate, one graduate student during the summer, and two REU students. The research areas include the generation of gravitational radiation, relativistic hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and stellar dynamics, having as a common thread the crucial role of gravitation, especially relativistic gravitation. Compact objects provide the principal forum, and the dynamics of matter in a strong gravitational field is a major theme. Specific topics include the inspiral and coalescence of binary neutron stars, binary black holes, and binary black hole--neutron stars, the generation of gravitational waves from binaries and other promising astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation, gravitational collapse, the stability of rotating neutron stars and the evolution and final fate of unstable stars, gamma-ray burst sources, and the formation and growth of supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies and quasars. Most of these topics require large-scale computation for solution.  Hence the approach involves to a significant degree large-scale computations on parallel machines, as well as analytical modeling. Many of the numerical calculations employ the state-of-the-art computational resources of the UIUC's National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). They comprise both initial value and evolution computations and treat vacuum spacetimes containing black holes as well as spacetimes containing realistic matter sources and magnetic fields.  The results have important implications for astronomical observations, including those planned for gravitational wave interferometers, such as LIGO and LISA.&lt;br/&gt;The planned research bridges the fields of general relativity and astrophysics. An appreciable portion of the funding is devoted to the education, training and support of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. The grant supports the activities of the PI's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) team at UIUC in computational astrophysics and general relativity theory. The training that each of the PI's undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students receives in large-scale computations and scientific visualization, as well as in several different areas of theoretical physics and astrophysics, prepares them to pursue professional careers in a broad range of scientific and technical fields. The computer algorithms and numerical codes that are developed are useful to other groups working in computational physics and astrophysics. Through the research and outreach activities of the PI and his group, the grant helps promote the use of computers and visualization tools at all levels of education, as well as the public awareness of some the latest and most exciting developments in gravitation physics and astrophysics.</AbstractNarration>
