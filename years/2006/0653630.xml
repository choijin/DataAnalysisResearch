    <AbstractNarration>This project will use high energy photons to probe the internal structure of the protons and neutrons (together called "nucleons") making up atomic nuclei. Nucleons themselves are composite systems of quarks, and have an excitation spectrum that can provide clues as to how those quarks interact with each other. Three unique and powerful capabilities of Jefferson Lab will be used: (1) The CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab, (2) a "frozen spin" target in which the spins of the nucleons are aligned, and (3) a photon beam where the photon spins are also aligned, the decays of these excited states will be studied based on the relative orientations of the different spins to provide critical information about each of the excited states observed in order to provide stringent tests for quark models of the nucleon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is explicitly designed to involve undergraduate and graduate students in all aspects of the experiments. In addition to obtaining an in-depth understanding of experimental subatomic physics, these students will also learn complex computer programming skills working with an international collaboration operating the most complex detector ever built for nuclear physics research. As students master various aspects of the project, they will also develop leadership and communication skills working with teams of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
