<AbstractNarration>The proposal consists of five important steps. First, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator develops new dependence measures (quotient correlation)&lt;br/&gt;and analyze the resulting test statistics. It is important to&lt;br/&gt;develop test statistics for tail independence based as much as&lt;br/&gt;possible on appropriate tail observations and less on observations&lt;br/&gt;from the center which may bias the analysis. Clearly, the decision&lt;br/&gt;on "where does appropriate" stands has to be carefully analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;Second, a new measure for extreme co-movement is introduced. This&lt;br/&gt;measure allows one to calculate probabilities of occurrences of&lt;br/&gt;certain extreme events in the future given the past history of the&lt;br/&gt;extreme movement of underlying variables. Third, the proposal&lt;br/&gt;includes the development of statistical estimation methods for&lt;br/&gt;max-stable processes. This allows one to efficiently study clustered&lt;br/&gt;spatial-temporal extreme observations. Fourth, procedures of how to&lt;br/&gt;calculate portfolio risk measures -- such as unconditional or&lt;br/&gt;conditional Value at Risk -- are also introduced using combined&lt;br/&gt;Markov process and max-stable process models. Fifth, the statistical&lt;br/&gt;analysis of extreme co-movements is of considerable importance in&lt;br/&gt;practice. For example, the notion of spillover in global financial&lt;br/&gt;markets and credit loss data can be thought of as one area of&lt;br/&gt;application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal in a first instance stems&lt;br/&gt;from a precise testing procedure for extremal dependence. As all&lt;br/&gt;definitions used depend on some limit procedures and often concern&lt;br/&gt;statistical testing for parameters at the edge of a specific&lt;br/&gt;parametric space (hence possibly testing is a non-regular estimation&lt;br/&gt;problem), great care has to be taken to obtain tests with sufficient&lt;br/&gt;power. The proposal is exactly aiming at finding a solution for&lt;br/&gt;this. Several procedures for tackling this problem have been&lt;br/&gt;published, however, up to now, no clear winning approach seems to&lt;br/&gt;exist. The investigator will carefully compare and contrast new&lt;br/&gt;approaches with existing ones using simulated as well as real data.&lt;br/&gt;The real data will come from areas as diverse as insurance, finance,&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications, climatology, seismology, medicine, etc. Beyond&lt;br/&gt;these methodological merits and specific applications, the proposal&lt;br/&gt;also has a considerable broad impact. Throughout applications in&lt;br/&gt;diverse fields (like above), extreme risks play an important&lt;br/&gt;scientific, societal as well as (possibly) political role. The&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of new statistical tools leading to a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the occurrence of joint extremes is of great&lt;br/&gt;importance. This can be very well achieved at the level of new&lt;br/&gt;graduate courses, publications in journals aimed at a broaden&lt;br/&gt;audience and in discussion with scientists from other fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
