<AbstractNarration>This Communicating Research to Public Audiences (CRPA) proposal is based on current NSF-funded research, EAR 0418042, on the evolution of giant Cenozoic sharks, including the C. megalodon that lived worldwide during the Neogene from 2 to 15 million years ago.  The project is the development of a 3,000 square-foot traveling exhibit at the Florida Museum of Natural History (University of Florida), with subsequent venues at the Miami Museum of Science and the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI), Tampa.  The exhibit, "Megalodon -- The Largest Shark That Ever Lived," includes specimens from the museum's collection and many rare specimens that have been donated to the museum recently.  Exhibit activities will focus on (1) the process of science, in particular how the PI studies major factors that could have contributed to the extraordinary size of these sharks, and (2) on public misconceptions about sharks, as identified in front-end research already conducted.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
