<AbstractNarration>The nature and origin of cosmic rays remains one of the most elusive questions in high-energy astrophysics. After about a century of analysis, it is not known how and where they are produced, or exactly what mechanisms govern their propagation to earth.  A major reason for the impasse lies in the steepness of the cosmic ray energy spectrum, which can be described by a rapidly-falling power-law. To push measurements one decade higher in energy, one requires increasing the instrument size by a factor of ~100. Therefore, relatively small (i.e., affordable) balloon or space-based missions become less practical for measurements above energies much higher than 1014 electron Volts (eV). &lt;br/&gt;As the cosmic ray flux decreases, ground-based observatories become the only viable option for providing the needed detector area. However, because the atmosphere prevents primary particles from propagating to the earth's surface, direct observation of these particles is not possible. Instead, ground-based instruments have, by necessity, been forced to make indirect observations of the extensive air showers produced by the interactions of the primaries in the atmosphere. Such observations are relatively low precision. Furthermore, they are hampered by large uncertainties in the interaction models used to interpret the observables. These weaknesses exist in even the most sophisticated air shower detector systems. &lt;br/&gt;The research goal of this proposal is to perform, for the first time, high-resolution measurements of cosmic ray composition from a ground-based observatory. This will be achieved by exploiting a new technique, proposed by the PI and others, which provides excellent charge resolution by targeting the direct light produced by the primary particle prior to its first interaction in the atmosphere though a new technology. The requested funding will augment and enable this research effort, ultimately culminating in the construction and operation of a prototype instrument called TRICE, for TRack-Imaging Cerenkov Experiment.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed effort will be felt through the support of young female scientists in a hands-on, experimental small-group setting, through the development of instrumentation applicable to other fields, through the support of a fruitful cross-discipline collaboration with a National Laboratory, and through a dedicated education and outreach program designed to broaden the exposure of under-represented groups to research-based educational material.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research proposal was to enable a new technique (the Direct Cerenkov, or DC, technique) for the detection of high energy cosmic ray nuclei from the ground.  This technique offers a level of precision normally only achievable on expensive  satellite-based, or balloon-borne instruments.  It combines this precision with the logistical simplicity only available in detectors based on the ground.  Furthermore, it does all this without a large reliance on so-called hadronic computer simulations, which at this energy, have an unknown level of accuracy.  The technique works by looking for Cerenkov radiation being emitted by high-energy atomic nuclei as they enter the atmosphere.  Cerenkov radiation is generated when charged particles travel through a medium with a velocity faster than light travels in that medium.  By looking at the detailed structure of these light pulses, which are very short (less than 10 ns), we can determine the properties of the particle that created them.  The principle challenge in this research is to develop new techniques for imaging this light with higher time and spatial resolution than has ever been achieved.  This requires the development of very high density and high-speed electronics boards, combined with advanced telescope systems.  One of the main successes achieved during this grant was the development of exactly this kind of high-density, high-speed electronics system.  The systems we designed are suitable for taking movies of the Cerenkov flashes at a rate of 1 billion frames per second, with over 10,000 pixels in the camera.  These devices are currently the highest-density high-speed digitizing systems in the world and have already been adapted to use in other fields, such as the detection of radio waves from ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.  As part of our research plan, we also in the early years operated a prototype instrument at Argonne National Laboratory, which made some of the first observations of the DC phenomenon.  Following this, we also made use of another ground-based telescope system named VERITAS (which was designed to detect high-energy gamma radiation) to make follow-up observations of this phenomenon, and indeed, were able to use these specific data to make a new measurement of the flux of cosmic-ray iron nuclei at high energy.  This was another important verification of the technique and enabled us to refine our electronic and optical designs.  This work has formed the basis of one PhD thesis and has formed part of the basis of another.        Last Modified: 04/03/2013       Submitted by: Scott P Wakely]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
