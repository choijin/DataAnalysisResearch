    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site program will engage 12 undergraduate students in a 10-week summer research program in molecular biology. Students will be paired with biology faculty mentors from James Madison University, Eastern Mennonite University, or Bridgewater College. Students work on their own individual research project associated with their mentor's ongoing research program. Students select their own projects in molecular biology either at the gene, cell, tissue, or system level. Students become involved in the research project by reading literature, developing a hypothesis, gathering data using molecular techniques, and presenting the results at a symposium. Students also participate in workshops, seminars on scientific- and bioethics related topics, and social activities including river rafting, hiking, or canoeing in the Shenandoah Valley. Students receive a stipend, an allowance for traveling to and from the site, housing, meal assistance, and transportation to and from various activities. Students will be encouraged to invite faculty mentors from their home institutions to the final symposium. Some travel allowance will be provided the faculty from the home institutions for this visit. Students from under-represented groups or with minimal prior research experience are strongly encouraged to apply. To apply for this program or for more information, go to http://www.jmu.edu/biology/reu/reu.shtml. Questions about the program can be addressed to Dr. Terrie Rife at rifetk@jmu.edu, Robyn Puffenbarger at rpuffenb@bridgewater.edu or Stephen Cessna at cessnas@emu.edu.</AbstractNarration>
