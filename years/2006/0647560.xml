The Center brought 29 faculty members from 18 departments together in focused and collaborative research, leading to the development of powerful new biological and chemical detection systems and nanolithographic patterning tools that are revolutionizing many diverse fields. This research was the foundation for innovative educational outreach programs that have informed, engaged, and inspired people of all ages and broadened the participation of underrepresented minorities.  The materials and tools developed by the NU-NSEC are revolutionizing the scientific community and the community at large. The large scale patterning techniques invented and developed by the Center have turned a bench top Atomic Force Microscope into a "desktop fabrication system," allowing scientists and researchers to rapidly generate arrays of nanostructures for a variety of applications. Since expensive clean room facilities are no longer needed to create such arrays, these techniques enable experiments in chemistry, biology, and materials science that were impossible only a few years ago. Center researchers also developed rapid, high-throughput, point-of-care detection systems capable of detecting chemical compounds and biomolecules with ever increasing sensitivity and selectivity. Using these systems, disease can be detected earlier and with a greater level of accuracy, leading to more positive outcomes for the patient. Chemical and biological threats can also be detected earlier and neutralized with minimal detriment to human life.  A unique component of the Center was the development of a pipeline to rapidly translate laboratory advances to market. There are now 8 FDA-cleared panel assays based upon Center research. Since inception, 20 start-up companies were launched based on Center technologies that have raised over $650 million in venture capital funds and created hundreds of new jobs.

The NU-NSEC resulted in the development of new and substantial enhancements of existing in-house user facilities not through the use of federal funds, but by leveraging NSF support with generous funding from the State of Illinois ($2 million years 1&ndash;5, $5 million year 6, and an additional $5 million years 9-11).  The Center provided significant contributions to nanotechnology scholarship and interdisciplinary education.
