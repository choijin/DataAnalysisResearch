<AbstractNarration>Over the last few decades, iterative methods, in particular Krylov &lt;br/&gt;subspace-based algorithms, have become widely-used and indispensable tools for&lt;br/&gt;the solution of large-scale computational problems in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;While most Krylov methods were originally developed for the solution of large&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalue problems or large systems of linear equations, starting in the early&lt;br/&gt;1990s, Krylov techniques have also proven to be powerful tools for order &lt;br/&gt;reduction of large-scale systems of ordinary differential equations or&lt;br/&gt;algebraic-differential equations.  The basic idea of order reduction is to&lt;br/&gt;replace the original large-scale system with a system of similar type, but of&lt;br/&gt;much smaller dimension.  In recent years, a lot of Krylov machinery for order&lt;br/&gt;reduction has been put in place.  Still, the existing algorithms are not at the&lt;br/&gt;same level as Krylov subspace methods for eigenvalue problems or systems of&lt;br/&gt;linear equations.  For example, Krylov subspace methods combined with powerful&lt;br/&gt;preconditioning techniques are routinely used to solve linear systems with&lt;br/&gt;millions of unknowns.  However, the application of Krylov techniques for order&lt;br/&gt;reduction to such truly large-scale systems remains prohibitive for a number of&lt;br/&gt;reasons.  First, most existing algorithms generate reduced-order models via&lt;br/&gt;explicit projection after a suitable basis for the underlying Krylov subspace&lt;br/&gt;has been generated, and thus they require the storage of all these basis &lt;br/&gt;vectors.  In the truly large-scale case, the resulting storage requirements&lt;br/&gt;become excessive.  Second, Lanczos-type algorithms generate reduced-order&lt;br/&gt;models on the fly, and thus avoid the issue of keeping all basis vectors.&lt;br/&gt;However, in general, the resulting reduced-order models do not preserve crucial&lt;br/&gt;properties of the original large-scale system, such as stability or passivity.&lt;br/&gt;Third, all existing Krylov techniques involve the solution of large sparse&lt;br/&gt;linear systems of equations at each Krylov iteration.  It is usually assumed&lt;br/&gt;that these systems can be solved via sparse direct methods.  However, this is&lt;br/&gt;not the case in all applications.  The goal of the proposed work is to develop&lt;br/&gt;new and effective Krylov subspace-based methods for order reduction that&lt;br/&gt;overcome the above issues and are thus applicable to truly large-scale systems.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the focus will be on techniques that allow the use of&lt;br/&gt;preconditioned iterative methods for the solution of the inner linear systems,&lt;br/&gt;instead of sparse direct methods, and on methods that allow flexible&lt;br/&gt;shift-and-invert preconditioners for the outer Krylov iteration itself.  The&lt;br/&gt;use of nonlinear semidefinite programming to remedy the loss of stability or&lt;br/&gt;passivity of reduced-order models generated by Lanczos-type algorithms will&lt;br/&gt;also be explored.  The proposed research is expected to lead to a more complete&lt;br/&gt;understanding of Krylov subspace-based order reduction and to result in&lt;br/&gt;original algorithms that are on par with their state-of-the-art counterparts&lt;br/&gt;for large eigenvalue problems and large linear systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of computational techniques and numerical simulation is ubiquitous in&lt;br/&gt;the design and verification of today's complex engineering systems.  For&lt;br/&gt;example, a state-of-the-art computer computer chip contains about one billion&lt;br/&gt;transistors.  Despite this enormous complexity, the design and verification of&lt;br/&gt;such chips is done almost exclusively with simulation, and first-time-correct&lt;br/&gt;fabrication in silicon is the norm.  However, even with today's computing&lt;br/&gt;power, simulation of a complete system is often not feasible due to the&lt;br/&gt;extremely high dimension of the mathematical model describing the system.&lt;br/&gt;Order reduction is a key technology to make such simulation tasks possible by&lt;br/&gt;first replacing the original model by a suitable approximation of much smaller&lt;br/&gt;dimension.  The proposed research is expected to lead to new order-reduction&lt;br/&gt;techniques that will have applications in many important areas, including the&lt;br/&gt;design of computer chips, microelectromechanical systems, nanotechnology, and&lt;br/&gt;structural dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
