<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH:  NANOSTRUCTURED ALLOYS WITH UNPRECEDENTED PROPERTIES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henry T. Y. Yang (UCSB), Srinivasan Chandrasekar (Purdue) and W. Dale Compton (Purdue)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The UCSB-Purdue collaboration capitalizes on the recent discovery of a method for large-scale production of nanostructured materials. The method induces large plastic strains at the millimeter-scale by using a controlled surface deformation process analogous to machining. Direct manufacture of the materials in the form of foil, wire, and sheet of macroscopic dimensions is feasible. The materials have mechanical strength up to three times that of the parent material.  The formation of the nanostructures is a consequence of the extraordinarily high strains imposed by the deformation system. The collaboration exploits these discoveries with two coordinated thrusts. First, the wide range of controllable deformation parameters will allow for systematic examination of the parameters (e.g., strain, strain rate) affecting the formation of nanocrystalline structures. Second, models will be developed for microstructure refinement during large strain deformation to assess the interactive role of strain, temperature and material transformations. By integrating these thrusts, protocols will be developed for developing novel property combinations by cost-effective manufacturing processes.&lt;br/&gt;  Widespread use of nanostructured alloys in structural applications has been sought; however, the cost of creating these materials, quoted in excess of one hundred dollars per pound, has restricted their broad application. The research will provide an important bridge between the understanding of nanostructure refinement during large strain deformation as an important scientific phenomenon, and the utilization of nanostructured materials in products in the bio-medical, ground transportation and energy sectors.  The transition to applications will be facilitated by interactions with a rapidly growing advanced materials company and a start-up, both with market interests in Advanced Materials and Micro/Meso Systems. Complementing the research is an education program featuring industrial internships for graduate students, undergraduate research internships and strong interactions with industry and National Labs.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
