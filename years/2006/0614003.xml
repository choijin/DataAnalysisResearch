<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)&lt;br/&gt;Division Computer and Network Systems (CNS)&lt;br/&gt;Science of Design (SoD) Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0614003&lt;br/&gt;P/I: Guy-Alain Amoussou&lt;br/&gt;PI's Department: Department: Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Humboldt State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: $207,252&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: "SoD-TEAM: Teaching Creativity and Conceptual Representation, a Design Toolkit"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to provide new perspectives in teaching software design to undergraduate computer science students in both research and classroom environments. The specific goals of the project are: to build an interdisciplinary and diverse community of faculty and students around the design of Software Intensive Systems, build a foundation for teaching the science of design to undergraduate computer science students and faculty, immerse students in a five week module in methods of creativity and conceptual representation (at NSF REU sites) and other campuses, and conduct formative assessment of impact of the SoD curriculum. The core group of four faculty leading this project are from computer science, engineering and GIS. Other participating faculties are from diverse disciplines. Together, they integrate elements of design from other disciplines with the software engineering field while remaining focused on the science of design for software intensive system. Science of Design, as it relates to software and software intensive systems, is a new area of inquiry with little existing theory or foundation. An important contribution of this educational and research project is the creation of a community of individuals from diverse disciplinary and cultural perspectives to begin establishing such a foundation. This project focuses specific efforts on the creation of an undergraduate level, curricular toolkit which is introduced through curriculum developed and evaluated as a fundamental component of the research component of this project. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses three opportunities for broader impact: the primary research goal is to develop a conceptual basis for the science of design as taught in undergraduate computer science curricula. As a means to attain this goal, the project will develop a multidisciplinary community that will both contribute to the SoD as it relates to software design, and influence how participants from these other disciplines, cultures and perspectives conceptualize and teach design in their own areas of expertise along with an impact on the skills of the participants as they consider and later teach the SoD; through REU programs and cross cultural collaboration there may be a positive impact on recruitment and retention of underrepresented populations in undergraduate and graduate computer science programs. This institution, located in proximity to a dozen indigenous tribal groups, is a leader in providing educational opportunities for American Indians. By consciously involving design approaches from a variety of disciplines and cultures the project anticipates a broadening of approaches and perspectives brought to bear on design both in the United States and abroad. This broader view has value and impact beyond the specific tasks related to the SoD proposal and may help to offer participants a greater understanding and sensitivity for differing views and cultural perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program Manager: Anita J.
