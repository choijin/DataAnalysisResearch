<AbstractNarration>Large scale parallel systems are critical to take on the challenges &lt;br/&gt;imposed by highly demanding applications of critical importance. Pushing the &lt;br/&gt;limits of hardware and software technologies to extract the maximum &lt;br/&gt;performance can increase their susceptibility to failures. This arises as a &lt;br/&gt;consequence of growing hardware transient errors, hardware device failures, &lt;br/&gt;and software complexity.  These failures can have substantial consequences &lt;br/&gt;on system performance, and add to the costs of maintenance/operation, &lt;br/&gt;thereby putting at risk the very motivation behind deploying these large &lt;br/&gt;scale systems. Rather than treat failures as an exception and take&lt;br/&gt;reactive remedies, this project intends to anticipate their occurrence &lt;br/&gt;and take pro-active runtime measures to hide their impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to make three broad contributions towards&lt;br/&gt;developing a runtime fault-tolerance infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;The first set of contributions is on collecting and analyzing&lt;br/&gt;system events  from an actual BlueGene/L system over an&lt;br/&gt;extended period of time. The second set of contributions are models for&lt;br/&gt;online analysis and prediction of evolving failure data.&lt;br/&gt;The third set of contributions are on failure-aware parallel job &lt;br/&gt;scheduling and checkpointing. On the educational front, in addition to &lt;br/&gt;enhancing graduate curriculum and research, this project intends to involve &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students and women. The tools developed in this project  and the &lt;br/&gt;related results will be made available in public domain and published in &lt;br/&gt;leading journals/conferences. In addition, the PIs will also push these &lt;br/&gt;tools to be incorporated on actual systems, to enhance their fault-tolerance&lt;br/&gt;abilities.</AbstractNarration>
