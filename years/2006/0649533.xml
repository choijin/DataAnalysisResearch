<AbstractNarration>This project will develop, publish and disseminate a&lt;br/&gt;reference guide to the nation?s 35 tribally controlled colleges and universities. Tribal&lt;br/&gt;College and University Profiles will feature descriptions of each institution, as well as&lt;br/&gt;introductory information on the history and philosophy of the tribal college movement. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, it will summarize the role&lt;br/&gt;and impact of NSF-supported STEM education initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed reference guide supports the National Science Foundation?s STEM and capacity&lt;br/&gt;building initiatives targeting tribal colleges. Because tribal colleges are small, rural&lt;br/&gt;and underfunded, their needs and accomplishments are frequently overlooked by policy&lt;br/&gt;makers and funders within the public and private sectors. Publication of Tribal College&lt;br/&gt;and University Profiles brings greater visibility to the movement and creates&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for tribal colleges to showcase accomplishments and identify new&lt;br/&gt;partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in publication of a professionally written and designed book of&lt;br/&gt;approximately 96 pages. With an anticipated print run of 4,500 copies, it will be widely&lt;br/&gt;distributed among mainstream educational institutions, federal agencies, policy makers and&lt;br/&gt;nonprofits. The guide will also be distributed to tribal colleges, the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation, and associations affiliated with the tribal college movement.</AbstractNarration>
