<AbstractNarration>This research centers on accretion and outflow in rotating stars with magnetic&lt;br/&gt;fields. Examples of such objects include young T Tauri stars, white dwarfs in cataclysmic&lt;br/&gt;variables, and neutron stars in various binary systems. Here, a theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;computational effort will be undertaken in which advanced modeling codes, including a&lt;br/&gt;3D program using a cubed sphere numerical grid, will be used to investigate accretion&lt;br/&gt;and outflow processes among such stars. Specific goals are to: (1) Better understand how&lt;br/&gt;disk material interacts with stellar magnetospheres, and which instabilities are&lt;br/&gt;responsible for launching the disk matter to the magnetic field lines of the star. (2) To&lt;br/&gt;explore how the multipolar structure of a stellar magnetosphere influences the accretion&lt;br/&gt;process. And (3) to determine what is the dominant mechanism of launching outflows&lt;br/&gt;from magnetized stars.&lt;br/&gt;The techniques and numerical methods developed here will also have general value and&lt;br/&gt;are applicable in other areas of science like planetary science, geophysics, earth&lt;br/&gt;magnetospheric science, heliospheric science, and in engineering. Young scientists&lt;br/&gt;(including undergraduates and graduate students) will be trained in&lt;br/&gt;magnetohydrodynamics. A research associate will also be supported who, in addition to&lt;br/&gt;working closely with the Principle Investigators, will aid in the education of students.&lt;br/&gt;Results from this work will be incorporated into the groups outreach programs, including&lt;br/&gt;and exhibit at the local Science Center and in an outreach program being developed for&lt;br/&gt;school children and teachers.</AbstractNarration>
