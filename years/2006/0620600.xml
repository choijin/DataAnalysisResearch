<AbstractNarration>This project promotes the advancement and dissemination of knowledge pertaining to 18th and 19th century Russian colonies in North America (Russian America).  Through a multifaceted approach with Russian colleagues, the investigators will explore and interpret relationships between central Siberia and Russian America through cooperative archaeological fieldwork, workshops, examination of museum collections, and educational initiatives.  The project seeks to build an international community including students, investigators, cultural resource managers, and Native American groups affected by colonial Russian influences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars from Irkutsk, Russia, are ideal research partners.  During the 18th and 19th centuries, Irkutsk was one of the most important cities in Siberia and was key to the expansion of the Russian fur trade into North America.  Although the Irkutsk region produced a wide range of exports for Russian America, this has not been addressed through comparative studies of archaeological materials.  This project will allow American scholars to participate in joint archaeological work in central Siberia.  In Alaska and California, Russian and American scholars, along with interested members of Native and student groups, will have an opportunity to exchange information through several small, hands-on workshops in communities associated with Russian America.  This will ultimately broaden the understanding of Russian America and its historic central Siberian connections.  The information will be disseminated to professional and public audiences through cooperative museum exhibits, professional papers, the collection of relevant Native oral history, and the promotion of a 'sister museums' program for U.S. and Siberian museums that interpret Russian America.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
