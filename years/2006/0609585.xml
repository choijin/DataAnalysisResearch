    <AbstractNarration>The 1964 Alaska earthquake is the second-largest earthquake ever recorded instrumentally. Current&lt;br/&gt;estimates of the long-period source characteristics of this earthquake, including the earthquake size&lt;br/&gt;and faulting geometry and the timing and distribution of moment release, date from the 1970s. All&lt;br/&gt;of these estimates were made before the development of modern methods of seismogram synthesis&lt;br/&gt;and moment-tensor determination. The occurrence of the 26 December, 2004 Sumatra-Andaman&lt;br/&gt;Islands earthquake (MW 9.2) has returned attention to the state of our knowledge about the&lt;br/&gt;1964 Alaska earthquake, as the Alaska earthquake presents the most natural target for comparison.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will make use of existing hand-digitized, high-quality surface-wave&lt;br/&gt;seismograms from the 1964 mainshock in an inversion for the earthquake moment tensor, centroid&lt;br/&gt;location and depth, and centroid time; effects of Earth's lateral velocity heterogeneity will be accounted&lt;br/&gt;for in the inversion. Owing to the very large size of the 1964 earthquake, and to the fact that the available data correspond to late-arriving surface-wave orbits, several experiments will be carried out to validate the results obtained. Results obtained from this study will also be of direct use for comparative studies&lt;br/&gt;of other large earthquakes, including the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman Islands earthquake. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;the proposed effort to archive the available, hand-digitized data from the 1964 earthquake is&lt;br/&gt;anticipated to benefit researchers interested in both earthquake dynamics and Earth structure.&lt;br/&gt;The research will support an early-career scientist. At the conclusion of the project, the data used will be permanently archived to make them available for future use by other researchers.</AbstractNarration>
