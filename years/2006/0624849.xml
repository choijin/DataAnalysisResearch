<AbstractNarration>The investigators and their colleagues study the problem of dynamic&lt;br/&gt;resource management in large scale and reconfigurable clusters and develop&lt;br/&gt;a novel stochastic framework for modeling, analysis, resource&lt;br/&gt;allocation, and strategy adaptation of parallel applications.&lt;br/&gt;The framework features three key innovations. First, it introduces the&lt;br/&gt;methodology of sequential optimal stopping times into the field of parallel&lt;br/&gt;processing for designing optimal scheduling strategies. It relies on a&lt;br/&gt;workload evolution model that captures both dynamic load changes and&lt;br/&gt;server capacity variations in a unified structure.  Second, the framework&lt;br/&gt;contains an aggregation method that utilizes cluster structures to reduce&lt;br/&gt;computational complexities, based on treatment of two-time-scale Markovian&lt;br/&gt;systems developed recently.  Since the Markov decision processes for&lt;br/&gt;remapping problems require control actions be stopping rules,&lt;br/&gt;the proposed techniques constitute a new paradigm&lt;br/&gt;of stopping rules in two-time-scale Markov systems and make&lt;br/&gt;a broader impact on the theory of Markov decision&lt;br/&gt;processes. Third, the framework includes a novel learning methodology that can&lt;br/&gt;update scheduling strategies recursively to accommodate time-varying&lt;br/&gt;uncertain environments in which statistical properties are not available&lt;br/&gt;a priori. The methodology integrates projection and truncation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms into the Q-learning procedures to enhance its implementation&lt;br/&gt;efficiency, state bounding, and speed of convergence. This project&lt;br/&gt;establishes asymptotic properties of the algorithms, which may shed new light&lt;br/&gt;to the studies of Q-learning theory. In addition to convergence of the&lt;br/&gt;algorithm under random truncations, rates of convergence are also&lt;br/&gt;ascertained using an associate diffusion process.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An overwhelming majority of today's supercomputers are constructed&lt;br/&gt;by aggregating a large number of processing nodes to overcome the&lt;br/&gt;barrier of processor speed. Engineering such systems&lt;br/&gt;presents key challenges, including coordination of the behaviors of the&lt;br/&gt;processing nodes to achieve high sustainable performance in real applications&lt;br/&gt;and reconfiguration of the systems in response to node/link failures&lt;br/&gt;to provide fault-resilient services. Current practices often rely on&lt;br/&gt;heuristic approaches to the issues and offer little insights into the&lt;br/&gt;potential and limitation of large scale clusters. This study intertwines&lt;br/&gt;today's discoveries of cluster computing principles with advances in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences.  Not only does it develop new knowledge about enabling&lt;br/&gt;technologies of next generation of high-end computers, but also&lt;br/&gt;it advances mathematical models and theories in new applications.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, it motivates graduate and undergraduate students of diversified fields to participate&lt;br/&gt;in interdisciplinary research in both computer and mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
