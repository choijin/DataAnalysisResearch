<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0605003&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Eleny-Nicoleta Ionel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at increasing understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of the Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds&lt;br/&gt;by combining together geometric, topological and analytical&lt;br/&gt;methods. The first project aims to define the Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants of a symplectic manifold relative a singular subspace&lt;br/&gt;(with mild singularities, e.g.  normal crossings) and to use&lt;br/&gt;those invariants to prove a generalized symplectic sum&lt;br/&gt;formula. The project uses both geometric and analytical methods&lt;br/&gt;to investigate what happens to the moduli spaces of holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;maps during certain kinds of natural degenerations, revealing&lt;br/&gt;surprising new features but also new challenges and&lt;br/&gt;complications. There are several interesting applications of this&lt;br/&gt;work, one of them presented as a separate project, which involves&lt;br/&gt;the idea of using a Donaldson divisor to give a simple geometric&lt;br/&gt;definition of the virtual fundamental cycle.  The third project&lt;br/&gt;is motivated by a conjecture made by two string theorists,&lt;br/&gt;R. Gopakumar and C. Vafa. The PI has been working with Thomas&lt;br/&gt;Parker on a structure theorem for Gromov invariants in 6&lt;br/&gt;dimensions; this would have many of the same consequences as the&lt;br/&gt;Gopakumar-Vafa Conjecture, and it ties in nicely with C. Taubes&lt;br/&gt;deep work on the relation between Seiberg-Witten and Gromov&lt;br/&gt;invariants in 4 dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work lies at the intersection of string theory and&lt;br/&gt;symplectic topology.  String theory developed as a potential&lt;br/&gt;candidate for unifying general relativity and particle physics.&lt;br/&gt;The details of this theory have turned out to be extraordinarily&lt;br/&gt;rich, and have inspired many remarkable results in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. But results in mathematics have also guided and&lt;br/&gt;inspired many new discoveries in string theory.  It is hoped that&lt;br/&gt;this project will have the broader impact of adding momentum to&lt;br/&gt;the growing interaction between mathematicians and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physicists.  In particular, one of the themes running through all&lt;br/&gt;the projects in this proposal is that symplectic topology can&lt;br/&gt;contribute insights into string theory. The research and other&lt;br/&gt;activities of the PI also have impact on the education of next&lt;br/&gt;generation of mathematicians.  One of the proposed projects will&lt;br/&gt;involve graduate students, engaging them in cutting-edge research&lt;br/&gt;early in their graduate career.  The PI has also been active in&lt;br/&gt;encouraging and guiding women graduate students and will continue&lt;br/&gt;to strongly support young women entering mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
