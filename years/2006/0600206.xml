<AbstractNarration>The PI's will investigate several problems in stochastic analysis&lt;br/&gt;of pure and applied nature. Competing particle systems appear in&lt;br/&gt;various scientific models including biology and theory of&lt;br/&gt;combustion. The PI's will study various aspects of such models,&lt;br/&gt;including hydrodynamic limits, tagged particle behavior and&lt;br/&gt;properties of the associated partial differential equations. Long&lt;br/&gt;term behavior of reflected Brownian motions driven by the same&lt;br/&gt;noise will be examined. Geometric properties of Neumann&lt;br/&gt;eigenfunctions will be investigated. Uniqueness of solutions to&lt;br/&gt;some stochastic differential equations will be proved. Boundary&lt;br/&gt;behavior of harmonic functions and local and global behavior of&lt;br/&gt;heat kernel associated with jump processes will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;Brownian motion on a fractal set will be investigated. Inverse&lt;br/&gt;problem is a mathematical model arising naturally in applied&lt;br/&gt;sciences from geophysics to medicine and physics. The PI's will&lt;br/&gt;study the foundational questions related to this model, such as&lt;br/&gt;existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;equations. Other models and processes will be the subject of&lt;br/&gt;separate but related studies; they include Markov processes&lt;br/&gt;conditioned on a small time scale, a change of variable formula&lt;br/&gt;for processes with 4-th order scaling properties and non-local&lt;br/&gt;operators of variable order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brownian motion and Markov processes are models for a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of natural phenomena, such as weather and climate, various&lt;br/&gt;functions of living organisms and financial markets. One of the&lt;br/&gt;scientific goals is to make accurate predictions based on&lt;br/&gt;available data. Mathematical methods have to be developed to make&lt;br/&gt;such predictions possible and reliable. The PI's will work on both&lt;br/&gt;theoretical questions leading to general results and on specific&lt;br/&gt;models that can serve as testbeds for the general methods. The&lt;br/&gt;results of theoretical research are often used to make&lt;br/&gt;quantitative predictions in well undrstood models and to make&lt;br/&gt;qualitative predictions related to complex systems. The research&lt;br/&gt;of PI's will be mostly focused on processes that display no or&lt;br/&gt;little long time memory. Such systems are popular models for&lt;br/&gt;inanimate matter and man-made systems, but also for many&lt;br/&gt;biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
