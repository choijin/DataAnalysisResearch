<AbstractNarration>This integrated program of research and education is a renewal of the previous VIGRE grant to the Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley.  It supports undergraduate research experiences, graduate traineeships, and postdoctoral fellowships in a vertically integrated manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the undergraduate level, the objective is to increase the attraction and quality of the undergraduate program and thereby to increase the number of undergraduate majors and the number going on to graduate work in the mathematical sciences.  The project supports undergraduate research experiences, integrated with the research of graduate students, postdocs, and faculty.  At the graduate level, training in teaching and communication skills and education enables graduates to participate in interdisciplinary research and contribute to the core theory and methodology of probability and statistics.  At the postdoctoral level, researchers are prepared for careers in academia, industry, or government by providing them a stimulating research atmosphere along with mentoring for teaching and research.  Fellows develop independent research programs and broad perspectives.  This support adds vitality to the small but successful postdoctoral program and enhances the graduate and undergraduate programs through vertical integration of research and education.  Recruitment and retention of an increased number and diversity of domestic students is an important goal of the project.  The funds support 10 graduate traineeships, three postdoctoral fellowships and 12 undergraduates per year.  The VIGRE program is active during the nine months of the academic year and for two summer months.  The program includes significant outreach and dissemination components, a management plan, and evaluation procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistical ideas play a key role in the modern information age.  Stochastic models and methods are essential components of research and applications across a vast spectrum of fields.  The opportunities and challenges are enormous.  This project addresses them by infusing ideas, energy, and resources in an integrated way in all levels of the educational program, from the undergraduate major to the postdoctoral experience, recruiting students at all these levels and preparing them to participate in the extraordinary range of opportunities now available in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will be trained to work at frontiers found at the nexus with interdisciplinary research, with a resulting impact beyond the disciplines of probability and statistics.  Through dissemination, innovations will be spread to other institutions.  The program also includes the development of educational materials, which will have impact on the broader community.</AbstractNarration>
