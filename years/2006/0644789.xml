<AbstractNarration>National Science Foundation  - Division of Chemical &amp;Transport Systems Particulate &amp; Multiphase Processes Program (1415)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0644789&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kretzschmar, Ilona&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation:   CUNY City College&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  CAREER: Uniquely functionalized nanoparticles for hierarchical self-assembly of three-dimensional structures&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis of  T-structures proposed in this work could serve as an interesting model system for a plasmonic switch. The site-specific modification of particle surfaces, i.e., patch particles, and subsequent molecularly directed assembly advance the area of self-assembly by providing guidelines for the choice of binding energies, particle concentrations, and patch sizes. The T-structure assembly serves as a model system for achieving branched structures containing the elements crucial for three-dimensional assembly. Further, the patchy particles may also serve as surfactants, sensors, and particle probes for the advancement of the understanding of colloidal suspensions and emulsion stabilization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;CCNY is a recognized minority-serving institution, which serves a diverse undergraduate student body of Hispanic (36%), African American (30%), Asian (23%), and White (21%) students. The students will profit from the active research in the area of molecularly directed particle assembly. The organization of an IREU program provides CCNY undergraduates with exposure to research at an international level. Further, the individual mentoring proposed will provide female and minority students with a mentoring network early on in their careers. Collaboration with the Louis-Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) will channel students from underrepresented groups into the program. The exposure of future journalists, writers, and producers to nanotechnology is likely to have a strong impact on our media-oriented society and will help to increase the awareness of non-technical writers to the potential applications of nanotechnology and the effect of public opinion on the development of the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research and Educational Goals of this CAREER award were to develop guidelines for the directed, three-dimensional (3D) assembly of patchy particles, i.e., particles coated with specific areas of various materials   and the development of educational programs that would increase the participation and competitiveness of students from underrepresented groups as well as introduce nanotechnology at the City College of New York (CCNY) and the City University of New York (CUNY).  For the accomplishment of these two goals, seven objectives were identified: (1) Identification and testing of linker molecules and particle-particle interactions that enable patch-specific interaction for directed assembly, (2) preparation of patchy particles with one, two, and three orthogonal patches, (3) Directed assemble of these particles into structures, (4) use of computation to predict assembly and develop design rules for 3D assembly, (5) increase diversity and number of students from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines through year-round mentoring, (6) create an international research exchange program for students between CCNY, USA, and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden, (7) develop nanonuggets and nanomaterials courses for CUNY.

High school students (6) were also regularly involved in the research endeavor many of them returning for a second summer internship. An international research exchange program has been established between CCNY and KTH. The program has been running for six years and has provided 29 CCNY and 34 KTH students with an international summer research experience.
