<AbstractNarration>Karst aquifiers represent a very significant source of water for  &lt;br/&gt;public and private use. A Karst aquifer, in addition to a porous  &lt;br/&gt;limestone matrix, typically has large cavernous conduits that are  &lt;br/&gt;known to largely control groundwater flow and contaminant transport  &lt;br/&gt;within the aquifer. We will develop a new modeling approach for water  &lt;br/&gt;flow and contaminant transport in conduit/matrix systems. The flow in  &lt;br/&gt;the conduits will be described by the Navier-Stokes equations and  &lt;br/&gt;that in the matrix by Darcy's law. Convection-diffusion equations are  &lt;br/&gt;used to describe the solute transport in the two regions. The  &lt;br/&gt;conditions applied at the conduit/matrix interface are novel. We will  &lt;br/&gt;subject the new Navier-Stokes/Darcy model to rigorous mathematical  &lt;br/&gt;analyses, studying such issues as existence of solutions and  &lt;br/&gt;continuous dependence on data. This represents the first such study  &lt;br/&gt;of this kind. Analyses will also be used to take advantage of the  &lt;br/&gt;multiscale character of flows in Karst aquifiers to derive fully  &lt;br/&gt;justified model simplifications that will result in less costly  &lt;br/&gt;computational algorithms. We will also develop mixed Galerkin and  &lt;br/&gt;least-squares finite element methods for the coupled Navier-Stokes/ &lt;br/&gt;Darcy model along with a coupled convection-diffusion model for the  &lt;br/&gt;transport of contaminants.  Experiments will be a crucial aspect of  &lt;br/&gt;the proposed project. They will be used to obtain information about  &lt;br/&gt;flows and contaminant migration in conduit/matrix systems that can  &lt;br/&gt;not only be useful to water resource managers and policy makers, but  &lt;br/&gt;also for the development and validation of mathematical models and  &lt;br/&gt;computational algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certainly, advances in our quantitative knowledge of Karst aquifers  &lt;br/&gt;will greatly help in their administration, including the delineation  &lt;br/&gt;of source-water protection areas for public water supplies and the  &lt;br/&gt;design of monitoring programs to evaluate the residence and fate of  &lt;br/&gt;contaminant plumes. More generally, the methodologies we will produce  &lt;br/&gt;can also impact other underground fluid flow problems including some  &lt;br/&gt;arising in the petroleum industry. The proposed project will provide  &lt;br/&gt;a vehicle for the bona fide interdisciplinary training of students  &lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral researchers. They will gain the ability to make  &lt;br/&gt;accurate quantitative assessments of aquifiers and thus can provide  &lt;br/&gt;industrial administrators and governmental officials with the  &lt;br/&gt;information they need to make sound policy decisions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
