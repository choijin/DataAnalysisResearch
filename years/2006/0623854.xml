<AbstractNarration>The neutral thermosphere, mesosphere, E-region ionosphere, and F-region ionosphere is observed and modeled in four locations where transient effects present ongoing challenges for accurate aeronomical modeling.  The transient phenomena and regions include stable auroral red (SAR) arcs in the sub-auroral trough, equatorial plasma instabilities, mid-latitude ionospheric instabilities, anomalous winds associated with the midnight temperature maximum at low latitudes, and gravity wave generation and transmission at low-to-mid latitudes.  Nested instrumentation including all-sky imaging systems, incoherent scatter radars, ionosondes, and entire instrument suites at upper atmospheric facilities are used in the observational research, and comparisons with established Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) and other physics-based models are implemented to isolate shortcomings in our physical understanding relative to observed morphologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported research on the behavior of the Earth's upper atmosphere---those regions of our atmosphere above about 50 miles in height--called the Mesosphere-Thermosphere-Ionosphere. These are heights where "space physics" is important, in constrast to Meteorology processes that govern our daily weather patterns in the Troposphere-Stratosphere.  The Sun's ultraviolet light causes atoms and molecules to lose an electron and thus the gases in the upper atmosphere are "ionized" and hence the name "Ionosphere" for this high-altitude layer of ions and electrons.  Because the behavior of ions and electrons are controled by the Earth's magnetic field, the vast regions above the ionosphere (called the Magnetosphere, and beyond it the Solar Wind) are important to our studies as well. The ionosphere is a highly-coupled system and thus a broad spectrum of basic science knowledge, observational techniques and computer modeling are needed to further understanding of Earth's space environment ("Aeronomic") system.  At Boston University we study the behavior of the ionosphere using state-of-the-art optical instrumentation, augmented by data taken by radars and satellites.  During the period of this grant, we studied how the upper atmosphere is disturbed by activity of the Sun (called "Space Weather"), as well as the influences from actual weather patterns occuring below the Ionosphere.  To separate the effects of these upward vs. downward coupling, we observe the behavior of waves in the Mesosphere (near 50 miles), ionospheric instabilities (near 150 miles) and the infuence of the solar wind and magnetosphere that transmit energy to the ionosphere at about 250 miles.  The Sun's activity was not particularly strong during the years of this grant and, rather than being a hinderance to research, it provided a unique oportunity in the Space Age to study an extended period of an extremely quiet Sun.  With our observations at middle and low latitudes, we studied how internal processes can dominate the ionosphere when solar activity is low.  The finding that variability of the ionosphere does not vanish when the Sun is not variable is one of the major results of our work.  In particular, we were able to document how large waves in the ionosphere seen in one hemisphere (e.g., with our instrument at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico) are related to almost identical waves in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., using our instrument at the Mercedes Observatory in Argentina).  This is possible because the same magnetic field lines connect these two sites---and thus electric fields transmitted along those field lines can modify ionospheric behavior in similar ways.  This use of "Conjugate Point" research is the major capability developed during this grant, and provided the major scientific results provided to the scientific community via publications in journals and presentations at domestic and international meetings. Specifically, we showed that disturbances controled by electric fields have the same seasonal patterns in each hemisphere due to their mutual, conjugate-point linkage.  In addition to the specific scientific topics advanced under this grant, we also are proud of the many associated activities it enabled.  The state-of-the-art optical imaging systems developed and used under this grant serve as a training opportunity for future science and engineering graduate students associated with BU's Center for Space Physics (CSP).  We are one of very few research universities with such a flourishing in-house experimental program in Optical Aeronomy. Boston University's Optical Calibration Facility, supported by this grant, provides service to the community at no cost to NSF-supported colleagues.  In areas of public outreach, our Imaging Science Lab members within the CSP serve as science fair judges at one of Boston's inner city schools, offering connections between middle school students and college activities they can aspire to attain.
