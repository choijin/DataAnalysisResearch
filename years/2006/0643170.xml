<AbstractNarration>The proposed CAREER research deals with measurement of stress and strain of structural components for determination of structural integrity. Existing deficiency and technical barriers have often rendered the measurement with inadequate resolution, high cost, and restrictive testing conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal presents a novel approach incorporating molecular luminescence to break these barriers. Full-field luminescent imaging is a highly potential basis of a novel approach. Luminescence photoelastic coatings will be used to qualify the complete in-plane strain field for short-term industrial design and long-tern structural health monitoring. The research is expected to produce a superior experimental means to measure mechanical stress and strain and integrate them into engineering design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project includes a very extensive educational plan that includes course offerings for high school students and teachers, engaging undergraduate and graduate students in the research and organizing a workshop/course at a national conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a FY07 CAREER award supported Sensors Program of CMMI Division and EPSCoR Program&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
