<AbstractNarration>The project's goal is to reduce STEM attrition by 20%, leading to 75 additional graduates per year.  The investigators are building regression models to determine the major predictors of success and the key indicators of attrition and then using the results to guide their program.  They are developing a multi-tiered programmatic approach to the retention of students in the STEM disciplines by: (1) performing a complete data analysis of their student data, (2) developing and teaching first-year seminars on study tools and science exploration, (3) developing and running a summer bridge program to prepare entering students for success, (4) funding research experience for underserved STEM students during the summer between their first and second years, (5) extending STEM research opportunities to students at three local community colleges, viz. Roxbury Community College, Bunker Hill Community College, and Massachusetts Bay Community College, (6) building elements of a women in science and engineering program that supports the retention of undergraduate women, and (7) working with the Center for Teaching Excellence on faculty training and development workshops focused on curricular materials and on visitor seminar programs to address gender-bias and ineffective modes of instruction in STEM courses. Finally, these coordinated efforts are being monitored through a comprehensive evaluation effort conducted by an outside consultant who is using surveys, interviews, focus groups, and classroom observation.  The broader impacts include special programs for underserved students, that is students from large urban public high schools, women, and at-risk students, all of whom have higher than average attrition rates.</AbstractNarration>
