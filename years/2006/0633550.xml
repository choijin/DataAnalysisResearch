<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to improve the quality of science for undergraduate students, including nonscience majors and chemistry and biology majors at various stages in their academic careers. To reach this goal, the Departments of Chemistry and Biology are modifying and enhancing several of their courses. The project is incorporating guided-inquiry activities into the laboratory of the General Science course for non-science majors; restructuring the sophomore-level analytical chemistry laboratory, Quantitative Analysis; and enhancing the laboratories offered in Instrumental Analysis and Environmental Toxicology.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy is being introduced into these courses by adapting successful implementations from other institutions.  PBL is suitable for a variety of learning styles and has been shown to excite students about science. In PBL, students study real scientific issues which directly impact their lives, and discover solutions to these issues on their own. Meaningful PBL experiences result in students who have more ownership of knowledge and who can transfer that knowledge to other situations. A new inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) is being used in these courses to enable the study of interesting and relevant scientific problems. The curricular enhancements are expected to result in the following outcomes: 1) improvement in scientific literacy; 2) improvement in students' attitudes toward science; 3) improvement in students' problem-solving abilities; and 4) improvement in students' abilities to think across disciplines.  The expected outcomes are being assessed over a three-year period through biannual formative evaluations and a summative evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;Each year, approximately 250 students at Appalachian are being impacted by the proposed curricular changes, and over one-half of them are non-science majors. Of the non-science majors, 44% are pre-service K-8 teachers. High school students participating in Summer Ventures for Science and Math (SVSM) also are being impacted by the project, and many of these students come from underrepresented groups. The new ICP-OES is improving the undergraduate research opportunities for students in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Geology, and is increasing collaboration among faculty in these disciplines. A regional workshop, Hands-On Workshop for Problem-Based Learning, is being planned to bring together instructors from community colleges, four-year colleges, and universities in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia in order to expand the use of PBL and stimulate the development of new PBL activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
