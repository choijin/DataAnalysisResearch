<AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to NSF 05-1788, category Unsolicited.  The primary objectives of this research are to investigate the fundamental horizontal growth mechanism of SiC nanowires and to develop reliable methods for large scale synthesis of SiC nanowires with controlled microstructures, positions, directions, chemical compositions, physical dimensions, and electrical properties.  The influence of experimental parameters, such as the gas and solid precursors, catalysts, pressures, and temperatures on the growth modes of SiC nanowires on sapphire substrates will be investigated.  Scanning electron microscopes and transmission electron microscopes will be used to examine the nanowire microstructure and atomic structure, such as defects, interfaces between nanowires and catalysts, and interfaces between nanowires and substrates.  The experimental and characterization results will be correlated with thermodynamic and kinetic analysis to develop general criteria and guidelines for horizontal growth of nanowires.  In addition, SiC nanowire based nanodevices will be fabricated and tested.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide a generic method for large scale synthesis of horizontally aligned semiconductor nanowires with precise registry on various substrates, which could not be achieved with the-state-of-the-art technologies that separate nanowire fabrication and integration into two steps.  The proposed research may open up totally new opportunities to nanomaterial fabrication and integration for next generation nanodevices.  It is believed that the proposed research has the intellectual merit of being the first study to explore the horizontally aligned nanowires in multiple fixed directions.  The proposed work, with a creative educational plan, will provide students, the general public, and traditionally underrepresented groups with opportunities to learn more about nanomanufacturing and nanostructured materials.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
