<AbstractNarration>       &lt;br/&gt;In their everyday encounters with new information and in both formal and informal learning situations, individuals are called upon to assess what to believe and why. Whether reading a book or article, experiencing a classroom lecture, listening to the news, talking with friends, or browsing the Internet, individuals are encountering information that may prompt them to consider the credibility and veracity of various ideas as well as sources of authority. This multi-method study will explore how adolescents progress in their ability to assess and evaluate sources of information and competing knowledge claims, how they justify what they know, and the use they make of evidence, all aspects of what has been termed "personal epistemology".  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Students' beliefs about knowledge and knowing have been shown to develop in patterned ways and to have powerful consequences for learning. The majority of research, however, is with college students and less is known about this process during earlier years, or how it is related to other aspects of cognitive development. The purpose of this study is to advance and refine an understanding of epistemic development during adolescence, with potential application in secondary education. This will be investigated through surveys and interviews that assess individuals' beliefs about knowledge and knowing, both domain general and domain specific, as well as in an applied task. In this task we will ask students to think aloud during online searching for a science assignment in order to understand the epistemic processes that occur during this type of learning, typically at a metacognitive level.  The study combines both cross-sectional and longitudinal design with students from sixth grade through the initial post-high school year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study addresses a fundamental underlying developmental process that supports learning throughout the lifespan, and which is particularly pertinent to creating a citizenry with the competence to engage critical scientific issues as well as to make informed decisions in their own lives. This process is also important in the learning of science (as well as other academic subjects), both formally and informally. The project will engage a number of undergraduates in research and will provide methodological training using both quantitative and qualitative methods.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This process is also important in the learning of science (and other subjects), both formally and informally.     Results of the study include the following:  1)    Epistemic perspectives may vary more widely among adolescents than has been inferred by research with college students and existing 3-stage developmental schemes may be missing the nuance of development in adolescence.  2)    We identified ways in which students rely on direct concrete evidence as a means of knowing, and how this is becomes a platform for questioning scientific claims. This was typified by a studentsÆ comment that scientists canÆt actually know whether Pluto is a planet or not "because they havenÆt been there."  3)    Many students have a fairly simplistic understanding of the scientific method and fail to understand that hypothesis testing and experimentation do not underlie all scientific inquiry. This type of thinking was evident in their online explorations of how bees communicate, as more than a third of the participants attributed scientific uncertainty to scientistsÆ inability to experience what bees experience or to talk to bees or to access their mental states.  4)    We found that students have differing epistemic beliefs about the certainty of knowledge in science and history, and although most saw science as more certain (in part because "scientists can see the results of their experiment"), some believe that history is more certain "because it happened." This and similar claims indicated that some students have a very poor sense of the work of historians as well as scientists.

Overall we found support for the possibility that personal epistemologies may develop differently across knowledge domains.  5)    Students with more sophisticated epistemic beliefs about the certainty of knowledge were more likely to hold mastery goal expectations, while students with less sophisticated beliefs were more likely to adopt performance avoidance goals.  6)    Throughout adolescence, academic achievement was positively correlated with more adaptive epistemic beliefs.
