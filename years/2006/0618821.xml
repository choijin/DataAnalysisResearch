<AbstractNarration>Biological Science (61)                                                                                                                                            The goal of this project is to transform undergraduate biology education by training a legion of faculty and future faculty to teach science with the rigor and spirit of research. Activities in progress include: 1) evaluation of the effectiveness of two sets of interventions designed to improve faculty approaches to undergraduate biology education; and 2) development of improved evaluation tools. Expected outcomes include a set of results that rigorously test the hypothesis and a series of electronic surveys and other evaluation tools that will facilitate evaluation at other institutions nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two sets of interventions include: 1) the Scientific Teaching Seminar at the University of Wisconsin aimed at future faculty (graduate students and post docs); and 2) the annual National Academies Summer Institute on Undergraduate Education in Biology (aimed at current faculty at a variety of institutions but with a focus on those heavily involved in research as well as teaching). The Scientific Teaching seminar is taught semi-annually during the academic year. It is a three-course series including a semester of intensive coursework about teaching science and instructional materials development. During the first semester, participants use their knowledge and skills to develop instructional materials that are commented upon by their peers. In the next semester, participants teach their materials in an undergraduate biology course (in collaboration with course instructors) in the spring, and then evaluate, revise, and disseminate the materials.  The summer institute lasts one week with an academic year follow-up and accommodates approximately eighty faculty each year. Activities included mirror those in the Scientific Teaching Seminars on a concentrated scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation plan is designed to measure impacts on the participants, their students, and their institutions. Specifically being measured are: 1) the extent to which participants (faculty and future faculty) apply what they have learned to their teaching, influence other faculty in their institutions, and influence future faculty; and 2) the impact on student learning, including demonstration of deeper learning and retention of biological concepts and critical thinking skills. Evaluation includes analysis of existing data (gathered since 2003) and collection of new data.  Qualitative data from past participants include written teaching philosophies (pre and post), coursework and exams, exit interviews, and short-answer survey questions about gains in knowledge and skill. Quantitative data include electronic and paper surveys of self-reported gains in knowledge, skills, and attitudes about scientific teaching. In addition, analysis is being conducted of data about student learning from undergraduate courses in which the participants taught. Qualitative data include coursework, pre-tests, and exams. Quantitative data include weekly pre-quizzes and self-reported gains in knowledge, skills, and attitudes about biology. Results from all evaluation approaches are being used to guide changes in the design of the two interventions described and development of a set of nationally available surveys to measure impacts of faculty enhancement projects on participants, their students, and their institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
