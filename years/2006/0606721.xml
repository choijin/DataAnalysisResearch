<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0606721&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Hao Fang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to study analytic torsion on&lt;br/&gt;the Calabi-Yau manifolds. Inspired by&lt;br/&gt;Beshadsky-Coccoti-Ooguri-Vafa, the principal investigator , joint&lt;br/&gt;with Lu and Yoshikawa, has constructed a new holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;invariant of Calabi-Yau manifolds, which can be computed the&lt;br/&gt;invariant for one dimensional moduli spaces. In general, the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator suggests an approach to analysis the&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior of the new invariant, by using the local&lt;br/&gt;index theory techniques. This project should give insight on&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of the torsion invariants and the Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;moduli.  The proposed study can be viewed as an attempt to study&lt;br/&gt;problems in algebraic geometry using methods of differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry. By studying local geometry analytically near the&lt;br/&gt;singularities, the principal investigator also hopes to give new&lt;br/&gt;examples of the explicitly computable torsion invariants and&lt;br/&gt;reveal relations of torsion invariants to number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also will have broader impact. Torsion invariants&lt;br/&gt;have come from topology and high energy physics theories. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed study will shed new light on understanding Mirror&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry, which is one of the central problems in current&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics.  Understanding this theory will give&lt;br/&gt;mathematical foundation of the String Theory, which is a&lt;br/&gt;potential unified theory for high energy physics long sought&lt;br/&gt;after since Einstein's time. For example, the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;might lead to better understanding of (the number and the shape)&lt;br/&gt;of the universe. Interaction with fellow mathematicians and&lt;br/&gt;physicists is expected and will be necessary for the success of&lt;br/&gt;this research project. The principal investigator will&lt;br/&gt;participate the integrated research and education activities that&lt;br/&gt;will promote the education level of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
