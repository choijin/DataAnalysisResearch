    <AbstractNarration>One of the principal concerns of ecology is explaining patterns in the distribution and abundance of species. The proposed research aims to reveal patterns in the distribution of tropical tree species and to mechanistically explain these patterns. Plant community ecologists have traditionally focused on plant niches and habitat type, such as soil regime, to explain why certain plant species are found in certain areas. However, recently, some researchers have suggested that seed dispersal processes may be more important in determining patterns in the distribution of plant species. These claims have been based on studies of tropical tree communities. The proposed research will examine the importance of habitat specialization, competition between species, and limited seed dispersal as mechanisms for determining where tropical tree species are found. Understanding these mechanisms will be of great benefit to future efforts to preserve these species. The research is novel in using DNA sequences to confirm the species identity of individual trees and in using evolutionary trees constructed with DNA sequence data to assess the importance of competition. The investigators have many years of experience working in Amazonian Peru, where this research will be conducted. Peruvian students will be involved and trained in field biology techniques during the field component of the research. This offers the exciting opportunity to help shape the future of biological research and conservation of Peru. The laboratory component of the research will be conducted at Duke University, where Duke undergraduates will be trained in laboratory techniques as well as statistical and ecological thinking.</AbstractNarration>
