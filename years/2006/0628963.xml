<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Marc P. Bermann, Kirk Costion will analyze data gathered during his archaeological investigations at the Huaracane site of Yahuay Alta.  These investigations will consist of intensive surface collections and excavations in domestic contexts.  Yahuay Alta is located in the arid middle Moquegua Valley in Southern Peru at an altitude of approximately 1600m above sea level.  The inhabitants of this site were part of the Huaracane Tradition.  This Tradition refers to the first known agricultural communities in the valley and is currently dated between 385 BC and AD 340.  Yahuay Alta contains well-preserved public architecture, including two raised platforms and a large platform mound, and at least five separate domestic sectors.  The focus of this research will be on the residential occupations at the site, which are subdivided into five distinct spatial sectors of house remains by deep ravines and other natural topographic features.  This research is designed to investigate Huaracane sociopolitical dynamics in terms of five processes (staple resource production, long distance exchange, craft production, ritual/ceremony, and feasting/reciprocity) that are often identified as underwriting or associated with social differentiation.  In addition, the nature of intrasite household wealth/status variability will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is currently known about the social organization of the Huaracane inhabitants of the middle Moquegua Valley, although recent research suggests that there was an emergence of a system of social hierarchy late in the Huaracane sequence.  This information comes primarily from mortuary contexts and settlement surveys.  One of the primary goals of this research is to investigate how or even if the social hierarchy observed in Huaracane mortuary contexts was manifested within residential contexts.  In addition, this investigation aims to identify the activities through which higher status residents were distinguished from the remainder of the Huaracane population, and explore how these activities interrelated.  Detecting variation in the five processes mentioned above at both the household and residential sector level will contribute to an understanding of how certain segments of society were able to establish and legitimize social differences.  Because the identification of differential participation in social and economic activities and wealth/status differences is a complicated process, multiple lines of evidence will be used in this investigation.  This investigation will focus on identifying differences in the distribution of traditional artifacts (broken pottery, stone tools), which are abundant upon the site's surface, residential architecture, and residential storage facilities.  In addition, this investigation will also utilize both micro and macro botanical remains and faunal remains in order to reconstruct potential dietary differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the research question of interest to the archaeological community, this project will have a broader impact by enhancing the level of public understanding of archaeology, especially within communities in the Moquegua Valley.  Public outreach associated with this and other archaeological projects in the region has been facilitated by an excellent working relationship with the Museo Contisuyo, the local archaeological museum.  Findings from the proposed excavations will be presented to the local community at the Museo Contisuyo and with the help of the Museo staff it is hoped that the final results of this research will be disseminated among the local Moquegua schools in order to augment their already detailed curriculum on the local archaeological record.  Upon completion of the research, the preparation of a website with the results will enhance the public visibility of the project in both Peru and the United States.  Publication in professional journals will help to communicate the results to the archeological community.  In addition, this project will provide both the author and Peruvian undergraduate assistants with important training in essential archaeological methods.</AbstractNarration>
