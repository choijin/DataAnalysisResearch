    <AbstractNarration>The intellectual objective of these studies is to advance our understanding of the chemistry and physics of aqueous surfaces. An integrated coupling of experiment and theory will be involved in these investigations. One set of studies focus on deriving a fundamental picture of the structure and bonding of ions and molecules at the interface between an aqueous solution and a hydrophobic liquid (oil). The topics examined lie at the heart of understanding water behavior near hydrophobic surfaces, and environmental issues pertaining to ground water contamination, oil remediation, and the extraction of organic contaminants. The second set of studies seek to understand the molecular interactions present at the vapor/water boundary of solutions of ions and acids, and to understand how the aqueous phase composition affects the adsorption of a number of environmentally important gases and organic species. These second set of studies examine basic issues that underlie the more complex chemistry that occurs on atmospheric aerosols, and marine and fresh water surfaces. Equally important to the success of this project is the training of students and postdoctoral associates in cutting-edge research methods and advancing their communication skills to enable them to effectively disseminate their research results to the broader scientific community as well as to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hard to imagine any surface more important to our survival than a water surface. Covering more than two thirds of this planet, these surfaces provide a unique boundary layer for facilitating essential chemical and biological processes as well as playing an essential role in controlling our climate. In our bodies, water is the 'canal of life', transporting and passing nutrients, ions and other essential molecules across its boundaries into more hydrophobic membranes and tissues. Yet even with centuries of fascination with aqueous surfaces, what is known about them is dwarfed by what is unknown. In the studies to be conducted, the focus is on the molecular glue that gives water surfaces their special role in many important biological, environmental and technological problems of today. The proposed projects employ cutting-edge laser methods and high level computer calculations that will allow significant advances in our knowledge of water surfaces while training the next generation of scientists in state-of-the-art scientific techniques.</AbstractNarration>
