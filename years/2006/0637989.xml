    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing nanostructured metals in a form that can be ultrasonically welded together. Sample coupons will be manufactured and the weld zone structure analyzed to determine the effects of ultrasonic metal welding on the grain structure.Traditional powder metallurgy consolidation techniques that result in a dense product tend to&lt;br/&gt;promote grain growth. While usually this is not a concern, nanostructured powders will then tend to loose their intrinsic enhanced properties. For example, decreasing the crystalline grain size of metals makes them harder and stronger, and nanosized grains is the next goal for bulk materials. Furthermore, less energetic consolidation techniques that maintain the nanostructured phase leave detrimental porosity. Either way, the purported benefits of the nanostructuring is not fully realized in bulk forms. Nanodynamics has technology, high velocity deformation, to produce nanostructured metals in larger than powder forms. It is based upon conventional machining processes such as milling and lathing, and is inherently low cost. Teaming as a research partner, the Edison Welding Institute is a leader in ultrasonic metal welding, which is a low temperature process. As it is low temperature process, it does not promote grain growth in materials used to date. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, one of the most important goals in manufacturing is to develop the next generation of enhanced materials for component and product improvement. Nanotechnology is widely seen as one of the methods whereby enhanced materials can be developed. Specific to the proposed research, nanostructured metals hold promise to provide enhanced properties such as strength and hardness. Incorporating these materials into existing assemblies can extend the useful operational envelope of the finished products, or permit weigh reductions as less material is required to fulfill the same function. For example, the transportation industries, especially automotive and aerospace, are always desirous of such materials. Weight reductions garner greater fuel efficiencies and cost savings. Increased strength provides greater functional utility and safety. It will also be interesting to investigate if there may be as yet unforeseen other benefits, such as increased corrosion resistance.</AbstractNarration>
