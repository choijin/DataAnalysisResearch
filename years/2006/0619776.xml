<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is to develop novel metal joining and deposition equipment based on an electron beam (e-beam) shielded by a plasma arc, or so-called "Plasma Arc Window", enabling electron beam processing to be performed in air. We are planning to develop novel metal joining and deposition equipment based on an electron beam shielded by a plasma arc.  Upon demonstrating lengthy, stable operation of the plasma arc window and electron beam instrument, the project will focus on demonstrating the capability to extend the window to produce a plasma column or "skirt" of sufficient length to enable the breadth of utilization envisioned for general use and commercialization of the instrument. The final portion of instrument development will focus on demonstrating practical/user friendly means for X-ray shielding and mechanisms for inert gas management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of this equipment will enable the introduction of new directions in research, training and education related to the physics of plasma, materials science, sensing, control, and system integration that will be encountered in e-beam materials processing in air. If the project is successful, it will provide an unparalleled deposition technology for the program entitled "Development of the Direct Digital Manufacturing" launched in September of 2005 under the Next Generation Manufacturing Technology Initiative as well as for the Additive and Direct Manufacturing by Metal Deposition Program sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Both programs are focused on developing a technology, which can revolutionize the manufacturing/casting industry especially in the case of manufacturing components with high service reliability.  The PI will work with the Director of the Minority and Women Engineering program, as well as with Paul Quinn College, Dallas, TX in order to attract more female and minority students into SMU's graduate engineering program. They are also going to participate very aggressively in achieving the goals of the recently founded Institute for Engineering Program at SMU. The federal government has been helping SMU to launch a national institute that will promote engineering from kindergarten through high school. Dissemination of the project's R&amp;D results will be done through journal publications, conference presentations, seminars, website, as well as through graduate and undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
