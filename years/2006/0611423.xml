    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;06-11423&lt;br/&gt;Sheehan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this Information Technology (IT) workshop is to develop the basis of a proposal that would be submitted to National Science Foundation (NSF) to provide a significantly improved infrastructure based around the new Barrow Global Climate Change Research Facility (BGCCRF). The impetus of the BGCCRF is to house research for the next thirty years, in the same fashion as Building 360 of the Naval Arctic Research Center (NARL) which was constructed in 1969. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to architecture, the workshop will plan for the immediate future:&lt;br/&gt;hardware for running networks; storing, protecting, and retrieving scientific field data;&lt;br/&gt;communications; application, administrative, and back office servers; as well as&lt;br/&gt;workstations, printers, plotters, and the other equipment needed on the front end for&lt;br/&gt;researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will involve roughly fifteen IT specialists and researchers to discuss the science driven needs.</AbstractNarration>
