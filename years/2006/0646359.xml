<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to strengthen the national network of partnerships and resource sharing for the NSF?s Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) through the services of the Institute for Broadening Participation (IBP). IBP will serve as a hub for a wide variety of services specifically oriented toward the goal of creating a truly national network of AGEP institutions. This project will maximize connectivity at multiple levels within the AGEP community. IBP is a small, coordinating organization which has worked with the Division of Graduate Education at NSF for the past four years. IBP has developed an implementation model for supporting a national network in an effort to increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM fields. An extensive infrastructure has been built for gathering, storing and exchanging information between programs, potential students, minority serving institutions and organizations and student mentors, with a resulting increase in the number of students who successfully navigate the transition from their undergraduate programs to graduate school. IBP has also begun developing an infrastructure to assist graduate students in the next steps in their career paths, post doctoral opportunities, faculty and other positions. This new national model demonstrates how educational initiatives designed to achieve significant cultural and structural change can be implemented by a small staff dedicated to the overall objective of broadening participation in STEM. IBP is now positioned to assist AGEP in strengthening and extending its national network of program leaders, students, potential students, and student mentors. An enhanced national network will increase the visibility and capabilities of this effort, attract entry level scientists to STEM careers, and produce a diverse new cadre of scientists and leaders for the public and private sectors by increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in the academy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;By dedicating a small staff to these goals, IBP has been able to develop an innovative and comprehensive approach for addressing underrepresentation in all contexts. By researching the issue, identifying problems, and posing, testing, and refining solutions, IBP has made significant progress in developing tools and methods to reduce barriers for students from less advantaged backgrounds, to cross the technology divide and to make information accessible to students who may have fewer resources. This IBP approach and the related tools created and disseminated will make an important contribution to producing a diverse STEM workforce bringing a wide variety of talent and perspectives to these fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;IBP?s work is geared toward two broad impacts. First, increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in AGEP programs will contribute to the creation of a STEM workforce which is as diverse and inclusive with respect to social makeup. Second, IBP?s comprehensive approach can serve as a model for adaptation by any regional or national program that seeks to diversify and increase their human resource pipeline. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The AGEP Connectivity and Implementation Project was initiated in 2007 at the Institute for Broadening Participation (IBP). This organizational home provides an effective, neutral and independent base for outreach to the national network of AGEP related universities and colleges and other program partners.  IBPÆs mission is to increase diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. Since 2003, IBP has connected underrepresented students with STEM funding, research, educational and professional development opportunities, and provided resources to students and faculty to reduce barriers to participation and cultivate the positive factors that help underrepresented students navigate their STEM pathway to successful STEM careers.  The primary goal of this project was to strengthen the national network of partnerships and resource sharing for NSF AGEP through the services of a small coordinating organization, the Institute for Broadening Participation. This included:   Increasing the visibility and capabilities of the AGEP effort   Attracting entry level scientists to STEM careers   Producing a diverse new cadre of scientists and leaders for the public and private sectors by increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in the academy   IBP implemented the project via a four-pronged strategy involving 1) strategic web resources and database infrastructure 2) targeted virtual and face-to-face outreach to STEM students, faculty, and administrators at the undergraduate and graduate levels, 3) development of web-based and print materials to support both students and faculty, and 4) partnership building activities to support partnership building among AGEP projects and between AGEPs and colleges and universities nationwide. All together, IBPÆs activities support underrepresented students in their efforts to seek and successfully apply to research, funding, mentoring, and professional development opportunities and go on to succeed in their chosen academic and career pathways; assist faculty and administrators in their efforts to support and mentor students, build partnerships, and contribute to the pool of best practices; and grow diversity awareness and cultural competency in programs, departments, and institutions.  Web and Database Resources:   IBPÆs website, http://www.pathwaystoscience.org, is designed to connect students with funded opportunities and professional development resources to assist them in pursuing a STEM career.  It also is designed to connect faculty with resources and publications on mentoring and recruitment and retention, while increasing the visibility of the NSF AGEP program among both students and faculty.  During the course of this project:   annual website visits grew from just over 10,000 in 2007 to 130,000 visits in 2014  the number programs posted on the website has grown to 1,593   visits to the AGEP web portal within pathwaystoscience.org now top over 1,000 visits per month in peak portions of the academic year  using content and design input from AGEP administrators and faculty, IBP has developed an e-mentoring manual   IBP also maintains a National Student Directory and a Partners Directory, each of which plays a key role in its face-to-face and virtual outreach.  During the course of this project:    members of the Partners Directory have grown from 4,300 members in 2007 to 14,540 in 2014  the National Student Directory has grown from 12,370 members in 2007 to 58,984 members (over 70% of whom are underrepresented minority) over the course of the project   Virtual and Face-to-Face Outreach  IBPÆs outreach strategy is designed to connect students with opportunities and professional development resources, to assist them in pursuing STEM careers, to share broadening participation best practices among faculty and administrators, and increase awareness of AGEP projects among faculty nationwide.  During the course of this project, IBP:   engaged 25,928 students an...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
