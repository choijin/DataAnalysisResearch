<AbstractNarration>The environment in which organisms live is not static but changes as a consequence of human activities, as well as geological and evolutionary processes. One particularly dynamic environment is that of a biological host within which microbes live. In these environments, change can be rapidly induced by the presence of the microbes themselves when they trigger host resistance responses. How does this environmental change shape the ecology and evolution of microorganisms, and how do they survive in such fluctuating environments? The goal of this project is to dissect the ecological and evolutionary responses of bacteria that live in the leaves of a host plant, A. thaliana, to changes that are induced in host plant chemistry. In so doing, this project will attempt to (1) identify the community of bacterial species that reside in this important host plant, (2) explore the community level interactions of these species as a function of biochemical changes in the host, particularly making use of genetic mutants that differ in their capacity for defense responses, (3) examine genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in an attempt to infer the evolutionary history of these species and (4) experimentally test the evolutionary capacity of microbes  to adapt to novel host environments. The project is thus integrative, encompassing ecology, evolution, genetics, genomics and biochemistry, in an effort to develop a mechanistic understanding of biological response to a changing environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most, if not all, species are faced with changing environments, although the timescale of this change varies. Of particular practical concern is whether we can predict the capacity of species to adapt to novel environments, and whether we can anticipate the extent of community level compositional change. Discoveries about the role of plant defense on the resident microbial community in ecological and evolutionary time should yield general principles that will be applicable across a broad spectrum of microbial communities. This project aims to discern these general principles. The project will also serve important educational missions, including (1) a role for high school and undergraduate students in the research, (2) a component to train K-12 teachers in microbial ecology, (3) efforts to include both a technician and graduate students from an under-represented group, and (4) hands-on presentations on biodiversity to nursery and elementary school students, including display of student made installments at The Field Museum in Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arabidopsis thaliana is a model plant that has been used in laboratory and greenhouse experiments to explore fundamental mechanisms of plant physiology for many years.  Our goal with this grant was to expand our capacity to understand how this model plant interacts with microbes in nature.  We collected a diverse set of bacterial pathogens from wild plants in the field, identified and characterized them, and explored their evolutionary dynamics.  Some of these pathogens are highly virulent, others not, and we found this mix surprising.  One interesting finding was that the non-pathogenic forms are actually æcheatersÆ that perform better inside plants when a pathogenic strain is also present.  Given the abundance of cheaters, the next question was "why maintain the pathogenic form?"  It appears that the non-pathogenic isolates outperform pathogenic isolates when in the soil, and also enjoy a broader host range, provided that they can exploit the presence of pathogenic isolates to colonize. Another interesting observation was that microbes interacting with A. thaliana are not ahead in the arms race, despite the advantage that they enjoy due to their larger population size and shorter generation times. While this goes against theory, it is understandable in light of the fact that these microbes interact with a number of hosts, most of which exert stronger selective pressure than A. thaliana.   From the plant perspective, only a fraction of A. thaliana plants have a resistance (R-) gene that can recognize particular pathogenic bacteria; these plants elicit a hypersensitive response to wall off and contain pathogens.  Plants lacking the R-gene are harmed by infection by the pathogenic bacteria, thus having an R-gene should be highly beneficial. Nevertheless, for one particularly interesting R-gene, RPS5, only about 50% of A. thaliana plants worldwide contain the resistance allele, with most local populations containing both R and S (Susceptible) plants. This is due to the fact that there is a significant cost to producing and maintaining this protein in environments lacking the virulent pathogens.  Indeed, this cost is so large that we questioned our ability to explain the long-lived polymorphism that we discovered at RPS5 based on the interaction between A. thaliana and isolates of P. syringae that can be recognized by RPS5. Interestingly, we were able to build a simple community-level model that can robustly explain this polymorphism as a consequence of community wide, diffuse interactions.  Another goal was to relate microbial performance and community structure to host plant genetics and chemistry.  This is a massive project that we are still analyzing.  We found evidence through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that A. thaliana actively shapes its microbial community via a variety of genes that are not the classical R-genes such as those typically studied in pathogen systems.  We are now working to unravel how plants and microbes interact, both at the genetic level and the chemical level (through metabolomics).  This is significant because identifying the factors that influence the outcome of host&ndash;microbial interactions is critical to protecting biodiversity, minimizing agricultural losses and improving human health. A few genes that determine symbiosis or resistance to infectious disease have been identified in other model species, but a comprehensive examination of how a host genotype influences the structure of its microbial community is lacking.  Our work with A. thaliana should allow us to expand the theoretical framework to better understand host-pathogen systems in nature that can then be applied to other systems.
