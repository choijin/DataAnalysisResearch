<AbstractNarration>Coevolution occurs when two species reciprocally affect each other's evolution. Coevolutionary relationships vary among localities; one species can have a strong effect on the others' evolution in one locality but not in another. Consequently, in some localities, traits of one species are well adapted to traits of the other species whereas they are poorly adapted in others. This is the basis for the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. This study will examine the geographic structure of the coevolutionary interaction between Attalea palms and their main seed predator, bruchid beetles across Bolivia by quantifying traits -shaped by the interaction- that determine the fitness of both palms and bruchids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is the first study that aims to assess how geographic variation in natural selection influences reciprocal evolutionary responses in traits between coevolving species in a tropical system. It provides a new framework for understanding coevolution in different populations at a time when the geographic structure of thousands of species is changing rapidly due to landscape modifications and the introduction of exotic species. This project will build collaborations between Saint Louis University and Bolivian Universities and research Institutions. The project will offer opportunities to undergraduate students to gain research experience and enrich their education in biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
