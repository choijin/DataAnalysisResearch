<AbstractNarration>The central rationale of this project is to leverage the close proximity of multiple colleges and industry partners in the urban setting to cultivate a network of mentors and opportunities centered on City Tech, with the goal of increasing by 66 per year the number of students receiving associate and bachelor's degrees within science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The college's location, both geographically and within the City University of New York, enables CUNY graduate students who are only a subway ride away to become role models for STEM undergraduates at City Tech. In the same way, City Tech students can reach the vast resources of the University and the City.  Through coordination with existing efforts, MetroNet is establishing well marked pathways from high school through the associate and bachelor's degrees to employment or graduate education, and is providing a safety net of academic, social, and economic supports. Project activities, designed to support the development of a professional identity, promote membership in a professional community, and counter obstacles to success, extend throughout the students' enrollment in the college, from a pre-freshman summer experience to the awarding of the degree:  1. Design of two credit-bearing courses, one in the sciences and math, the other in engineering technologies, offered in a pre-freshman summer experience, to provide academic preparation through a combination of theory and hands-on experience. Featuring development of laboratory techniques, communication, teamwork, and creative thinking skills, these courses offer career information, including trips to local industries and government labs. One goal is to create a better fit between the students and their declared majors, minimizing noncontributory credits from changing majors and high dropout rates due to disenchantment.  2. Academic year block programming of the summer cohort in required general education courses such as English Composition linked to a seminar series and mentoring of undergraduates by teaching assistants in STEM. These teaching assistants in turn receive mentoring by experienced faculty at City Tech on classroom management, development of learning outcomes, and learning assessment.  3. Promotion of student involvement on campus and academic focus through research and career oriented activities. An annual poster session featuring student research increases the visibility of STEM activities on campus. Summer internships at science museums, along with research and employment opportunities are available to the students.  4. Capstone Senior Design courses in Telecommunications and Computer Engineering Technologies are being developed for students in engineering technology.  5. A project website is used to disseminate developed curriculum assessment results and student work.  The project explores development and implementation of a new model to improve graduation rates by retooling successful retention and recruitment strategies to address the specific needs of students at an urban, commuter public college. The broader impact of MetroNet includes its focus on the transfer of learning from the sciences, mathematics and liberal arts courses to technology, computer systems and engineering applications where fundamental learned principles are applied to real-world problems. Because of the demographics of the college, the project promotes the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM majors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[NSF Award No.  DUE 0622493   Program Directors:  Dr. Pamela Brown, Associate Provost and Dr. Janet Liou-Mark  Mathematics Department, New York City College of Technology of the City University of New York    Title: Metropolitan Mentors Network (MMNet): Growing an Urban STEM Talent Pool across New York City     New York City College of Technology ("City Tech"), the designated college of technology within the City University of New York, was awarded an NSF STEP1A grant, "Metropolitan Mentors Network: Growing an Urban STEM Talent Pool across New York City," commencing January 1, 2007. Outcomes from this project included a significant increase in the number of STEM graduates per year, 143 students (an increase of 33%) and a significant increase in the enrollment in STEM disciplines, 741 students (an increase of 22%).     The four major grant activities included: 1. Development of Two Summer Bridge Courses  SCI 1000: Introduction to Mathematics and Science Technologies   ENGR 1000: Introduction to Engineering and Computer Technologies SCI 1000 was designed for STEM majors in the School of Arts and Sciences and ENGR 1000 was designed for majors in the School of Technology and Design. Approximately 35 pre-freshmen students were accepted each summer. The courses combined discipline-specific and general education academic preparation with learning skills and career exploration. If scheduling permitted during the fall semester of their first year, these students were enrolled in a Learning Community: two courses with faculty working collaboratively to integrate course content to create a community of learners. Subsequent academic and social support throughout the school year included opportunities for tutoring and participation in undergraduate research. Students in the summer bridge courses demonstrated higher retention and graduation rates than other first-time-full time freshmen in the same majors, ranging from 10-40% greater rates.    2. Promotion of Undergraduate Research - including summer interdisciplinary research: The number of undergraduates conducting research each semester increased from less than 20 projects at the start of the grant in 2007 to over 200 presently, of which approximately 75% are projects conducted by members of underrepresented minority groups in STEM.  On average, 10 students each semester and summer received stipends through the STEP grant and over 60 students have received funding to travel to regional and national conferences to present their research. Three students with their faculty mentors published their research in peer-reviewed journals. Several student presentations at regional and national conferences have resulted from this effort. Faculty workshops on Mentoring students have been implemented and a faculty handbook has been developed.     3. Peer Assisted Learning (PAL): Support of Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) in STEM Courses Academic support involving undergraduates using the PLTL instructional model was implemented to provide professional development to participating faculty as well as peer leader training. A one-credit peer leader training course, MEDU 2901, was developed. PLTL workshops institutionalized and are offered in ten levels of mathematics courses ranging from Pre-algebra to Calculus III to Probability and Statistics, General Chemistry I and II, Organic Chemistry I, Biology I, Human Anatomy and Physiology I and Physics I.  PLTL participants have higher pass rates and retention rates.  Of the 74 peer mentors trained since fall 2008 (of whom 77% are from underrepresented minority groups in STEM, including women), all have either graduated with a STEM degree or are persisting in STEM majors or Liberal Arts and Sciences.  Of the 24 peer mentors earning baccalaureate degrees, four are employed in a STEM field, four are in graduate school, three are in medical/pharmacy school, 12 are applying to graduate school, and one finished a masterÆs degree and is working in a STEM field.
