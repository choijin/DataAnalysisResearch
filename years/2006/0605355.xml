<AbstractNarration>******NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT******&lt;br/&gt;Bubbles form in liquid as a result of a number of different processes. They can be produced when the pressure on a liquid that contains gas is reduced, when a can of soda is opened, for example. Bubbles also form in the turbulence around the propeller of a ship, and when a liquid is heated above its boiling point. In some situations, bubble production has undesirable effects. For example, over the course of time the bubbles produced near to the propeller of a ship damage the propeller. On the other hand, bubble generation can also be very useful, as in an ultrasonic cleaner. This individual investigator award supports a project to study how bubbles are formed and how to control their formation for technological advantage. Experiments will be performed to investigate bubble production in liquid helium under a number of different conditions. Liquid helium is chosen for these experiments because it can be produced with exceptional purity, and so effects that might arise from impurities in the liquid can be controlled or eliminated. The main aim of the project is the investigation of the effect of electrons on bubble formation. Because of the number of different experimental techniques that are involved in the research, this project provides excellent training for the graduate students working on the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT******&lt;br/&gt;In this research project a study will be made of electrons immersed in liquid helium. In previous research, it has been shown that when an electron is introduced into liquid helium, it forces open a small cavity in the liquid. This "electron bubble" has a radius of approximately 2nm. A new technique will be developed that will make it possible to observe the position of an electron as it moves through the liquid. The electron bubble will be expanded to a larger size for a time of around 1 microsecond and then illuminated with light from a flash lamp. In a second project, electrons that are attached to a quantized vortex line will be imaged, thus providing information about the topology of the vortex line. Because of the number of different experimental techniques that are involved in the research, this project provides excellent training for the graduate students working on the project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In our research we are studying the properties of superfluid helium. This liquid has unique properties. All other liquids in nature freeze if cooled to a low enough temperature, whereas helium remains liquid even at the absolute zero of temperature. At a temperature of 2 degrees above zero, the liquid enters into a new state and becomes a superfluid.  The liquid has no viscosity and can flow freely through the smallest of channels. If water in a coffee cup is stirred, after a short while the liquid stops moving. For superfluid helium, once the liquid is set moving it continues to move without slowing down.  When superfluid helium is set into motion, quantized vortices can form. These are similar to the tornadoes  that occur in the atmosphere. Just as in a tornado the liquid spins around the line of the vortex (figure 1). The velocity becomes larger and larger as the core of the vortex is approached. The vortex line can move through the liquid just as a tornado moves from place to place. The large velocity near the vortex core can pick up small objects and trap them. These objects are then carried along with the vortex as it moves in a way that is similar to the manner in which a tornado carries a cloud of dust with it as it moves.  The vortices are called quantized because their behavior is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, the fundamental theory that describes all matter. According to this theory the speed with which the liquid flows around each vortex is exactly the same.     We have been studying these quantized vortices and the way in which they trap small particles. To do this we send some small particles, "dust", into the liquid and record how the particles move and are affected by the presence of the vortices. In figure 2 we show a photograph taken with a time exposure of one second; during this time the particles move along the vortices and the vortices themselves also move. As can be seen from the figure, the result is that each particle makes an irregular motion through the liquid.
