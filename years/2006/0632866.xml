<AbstractNarration>Interest in solid-state chemistry as a discipline has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area.  MRS Symposium QQ on Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic Materials is a major international meeting. The goal of the conference is to facilitate collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in solid-state chemistry areas that include address issues such as crystal chemistry and new structures, novel methods of synthesis, functional materials such as optical, optoelectronic, polar, dielectric, ferroelectric, thermoelectric materials, multifunctional materials, materials for energy applications, novel nanophase and nanoparticulate materials and architectures, micro-, meso-, and macroporous materials and framework structures, hybrid materials, and theory and computational techniques. These topics play key roles in the preparation and characterization of novel materials for important real-life applications. The NSF support will go to students, post-doctoral scholars, and early career faculty, as well as senior U.S. session chairs and invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this conference is to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss the latest advances and challenges in the area of solid-state chemistry with the intent to promote an exchange of ideas and to build strong relationships among academic, industrial, and government researchers. Internationally known speakers and poster presentations from students, post-doctoral scholars, and early career faculty will emphasize technical advances, the presentation of unpublished work, and the discussion of new ideas and future directions emerging within the solid-state chemistry community. The speakers represent academic, industrial, and government laboratories, and there will be strong international participation. Leading scientists working in various areas of solid-state chemistry are expected to draw the interest of many researchers in the field. Current frontiers to be highlighted include synthesizing, characterizing, and investigating the properties of novel classes of inorganic solid compounds. The area impacts the entire field of solid-state chemistry and much of materials research since it spans all materials types and a wide variety of exploitable properties. As a result, the content of some sessions cuts across different materials types and uses, including multifunctional materials, and should therefore draw the interest of those working on these important and diverse classes of compounds and related technological impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
