<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to continue and to increase the effectiveness of the Carleton College Summer Mathematics Program for Women (SMP).  This vertically-integrated mentoring and support network for young female mathematicians is built around the community of alumnae of the program (1995-2005) and the over fifty additional undergraduate women who will participate over the next three years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is widespread agreement in the research literature on female persistence in science and mathematics that effective mentoring, peer support, and the existence of role models are all factors that increase persistence.  The SMP activities provide exactly these supports.  The programmatic activities funded by this award are: a continuation of the four-week SMP at Carleton College; an unstructured check-in at the Joint Meetings each January; and a three-day conference each summer for Ph.D. alumnae of the SMP.  The objectives are to improve participants' likelihood of persistence to Ph.D. and to increase the likelihood of their attaining successful and rewarding careers in mathematics.  The means to achieve these ends are: the inspirational experience of the Carleton Summer Mathematics Program; active and supportive personal mentoring from sophomore year in college through and beyond the Ph.D. and early professional career years; and regular community gatherings at the Joint Meetings and at Carleton College each summer.  These activities nurture, support, and advise these young women as they negotiate the path from early undergraduate years to established professional mathematician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that approximately 45% of the undergraduate students supported directly by this award will receive Ph.D.s in a mathematical science.  They will join the young Ph.D.s supported here in assuming positions in the mathematical community, fully aware of and committed to the transformative effects of mentoring, role modeling, and peer support.  The program itself should serve as a model for effective change in mathematics as well as in physics, computer science, and engineering.  The assessment activities will yield both longitudinal and cross-sectional information and data about the effects of mentoring, role modeling, and peer support.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
