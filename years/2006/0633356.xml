<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12).  This project is using a GC/MS instrument to drive the development of a series of project-based GC/MS laboratories that are being vertically integrated into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, from freshman chemistry through senior instrumental analysis. These project-based laboratories include a mixture of newly developed curricular materials and existing materials that are adapted to fit the institutional setting. Assessments are being administered to students in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the project based laboratories on mastery of particular content topics as well as on student attitudes towards the sciences. Faculty perceptions of the feasibility and success of the project-based labs is also being assessed. Dissemination includes publication of laboratory experiments and student and faculty assessment results in peer-reviewed chemistry education literature as well as presentations at regional and national meetings. Dissemination also includes hosting local workshops to share faculty experiences and build faculty expertise in implementing project-based laboratories. These workshops are targeting faculty colleagues in other STEM disciplines at Roosevelt University, as well as other area institutions including high schools, community colleges and undergraduate institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are fourfold. (1) The project is providing a modern instrument to an undergraduate institution that serves many underrepresented students in terms of gender, ethnicity, age and socioeconomic status in order to better prepare them for scientific employment, graduate, and professional studies. (2) The project is increasing local faculty expertise in adopting exemplary teaching practices; (3) The project is enhancing pedagogical collaboration between regional undergraduate institutions, community colleges and high schools. (4) One of the proposed project-based labs includes an environmentally-related service-learning component and is providing students with opportunities for community and environmental engagement.</AbstractNarration>
