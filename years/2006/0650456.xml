<AbstractNarration>The Center for Enabling New Technologies through Catalysis, or CENTC, led by the University of Washington,  is supported by an award from the NSF Division of Chemistry as a Phase II Chemical Bonding Center, or CBC.  CENTC brings together a group of sixteen investigators from across the United States to work on the development of efficient, inexpensive and environmentally friendly methods of synthesizing organic materials by way of activation of strong bonds.  New methodology based on using transition metals to selectively activate and functionalize strong chemical bonds has the potential to revolutionize the production of chemicals from large scale bulk processes to fine chemical synthesis, such as occurs in the pharmaceutical industry.  A broad scope of projects is being pursued in this Phase II CBC including hydroamination, oxidation, C-H functionalization, alkane metathesis, fuel cell research, the use of biomass as feedstocks and enzymatic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work occuring at CENTC is having a broad impact through the training of students at all levels.  In addition, high school teachers from various parts of the United States are participating in the center and helping in the production of presentations and videos on the advances and implications of CENTC research.  The center has an industrial affiliates program which allows for direct communication of CENTC research results to industry where it can be converted into real-world applications.  Projects supported by the center focus on greening -- economically and environmentally -- chemical, petroleum, pharmaceutical and material production and thus have significant potential to increase US competitiveness and to enhance our national security through an increase in energy independence.</AbstractNarration>
