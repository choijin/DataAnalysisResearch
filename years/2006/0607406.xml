<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation of doctoral students from U.S. universities in the eleventh SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium to be held July 16-17, 2006 in Boston, in conjunction with the 21th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-06), July 16-20, 2005. The Doctoral Consortium aims to: (1) provide a setting for feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions; (2) develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research; (3) support a new generation of researchers; and (4) contribute to the conference through interaction with other researchers at the conference. The Doctoral Consortium will strive to recruit and include students from underrepresented groups (e.g., women and underrepresented minorities) and smaller schools or schools with less established programs in artificial intelligence. Each student will give a 25-minute presentation to be followed by 20 minutes of discussion guided by a faculty participant; there were also be a one-on-one meeting with the faculty participant. There will also be opportunities to discuss career issues in both academic and other career pathways. In conjunction with the general conference's activities celebrating fifty years of AI, the committee plans to solicit participation of some of the very senior or founding members of the community in the Doctoral Consortium, for instance, by having them participate in a "20/20 Perspective: What I Wish I'd Known in Graduate School" panel. It is expected that thesis summaries of the participants will be published in the AI Magazine.</AbstractNarration>
