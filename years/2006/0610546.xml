<AbstractNarration>In this project, we will develop computational tools for modeling the complex&lt;br/&gt;interactions between the microbiological, architectural, and mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties of bacterial biofilms.  The tools will combine models for &lt;br/&gt;multi-species biofilm growth and development, elasticity properties that&lt;br/&gt;depend on the different species and their products, e.g. EPS, and the&lt;br/&gt;interaction of the biofilm with overlying fluid flow.  As a test case, the&lt;br/&gt;tools will be used to study the behavior of heterotroph/autotroph two-species&lt;br/&gt;biofilms commonly used for nitrogen removal in activated sludge reactors.&lt;br/&gt;These biofilms exhibit complex behavior in their tendency to develop stratified&lt;br/&gt;colonies where the fast growing heterotrophs cover the slow growing and brittle&lt;br/&gt;autotrophs.  The heterotrophs protect the autotrophs from fluid stresses, and&lt;br/&gt;also consume the products generated by the autotrophs as they remove nitrogen&lt;br/&gt;from wastewater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biofilms are a ubiquitous form of life that impact humans in many ways.  &lt;br/&gt;Biofilms are responsible for nitrogen loss from agricultural fertilizers, &lt;br/&gt;deplete oxygen in streams, cause disease in humans and plants, and foul pipes, &lt;br/&gt;heat exchangers, and ship hulls.  It is estimated that biofilms cost the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;billions of dollars annually in equipment and product damage, energy losses, &lt;br/&gt;and human infections.  The tools developed in this project will be general &lt;br/&gt;enough to be applied to a wide range of multi-species biofilm communities, and&lt;br/&gt;will be useful in improving our understanding of these complex systems.  In&lt;br/&gt;this project, the tools will be applied to activated sludge reactors,&lt;br/&gt;which are systems used for the treatment of wastewater.  In this system,&lt;br/&gt;bacteria and other microorganisms remove harmful substances for purposes&lt;br/&gt;of water reclamation.  For maximal efficiency of these reactors, the right&lt;br/&gt;balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria must be found.  The tools&lt;br/&gt;developed in this project will improve our understanding of this system and&lt;br/&gt;aid in the identification of the optimal operating conditions.</AbstractNarration>
