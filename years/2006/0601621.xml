<AbstractNarration>A result of Cayley implies that every group has a faithful&lt;br/&gt;representations as a transitive permutation group. Many have primitive&lt;br/&gt;faithful representations, for instance, all finite simple&lt;br/&gt;groups. Indeed the classical simple groups act primitively on the&lt;br/&gt;points of a projective or polar space.  However many groups have no&lt;br/&gt;primitive faithful permutation representation, so imprimitive faithful&lt;br/&gt;representations must be considered.  In this project Hall studies&lt;br/&gt;finite imprimitive groups that act as automorphism groups of&lt;br/&gt;geometries.  He also considers the converse---description and&lt;br/&gt;characterization of geometries that come provided with a natural and&lt;br/&gt;nontrivial equivalence relation.  Of particular interest are&lt;br/&gt;equivalence relations whose classes are the orbits of some nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;normal subgroup, the group then naturally embedded in the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding wreath product.  The geometries studied and&lt;br/&gt;characterized are highly homogeneous partial linear spaces,&lt;br/&gt;particularly those associated with isometry groups of forms, where&lt;br/&gt;imprimitivity for the group can come from degeneracy of the form.  For&lt;br/&gt;forms of degree greater than two, this leads to questions about&lt;br/&gt;possible generalizations of Witt's theorem on bilinear and related&lt;br/&gt;forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group theory is often described as the mathematics of symmetry.  That&lt;br/&gt;is, many groups are best described as collections of symmetries of&lt;br/&gt;geometric objects. Conversely many geometries are best characterized&lt;br/&gt;by their associated groups, a point of view that goes back to Hilbert.&lt;br/&gt;Finite groups appear prominently via symmetry in many fields other&lt;br/&gt;than mathematics, for example, physics, chemistry, and computer&lt;br/&gt;science.  The building blocks of finite symmetry groups are the finite&lt;br/&gt;simple groups and are realized as primitive permutation&lt;br/&gt;groups---permutation groups that in an appropriate sense are&lt;br/&gt;efficient. A general finite group is then glued together from simple&lt;br/&gt;groups, and its symmetry realization is imprimitive---constructed from&lt;br/&gt;various primitive constituents.  There has been great success recently&lt;br/&gt;in the description of simple groups and their primitive permuation&lt;br/&gt;representations.  Understanding of and facility with imprimitive&lt;br/&gt;groups is the important next step.  The project is aimed at giving&lt;br/&gt;elementary geometric descriptions of certain imprimitive groups and&lt;br/&gt;conversely characterizing and recognizing geometries starting from&lt;br/&gt;properties of an imprimitive symmetry group.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
