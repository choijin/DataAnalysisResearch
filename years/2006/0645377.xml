<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spintronics (or magnetoelectronics) is a multidisciplinary field of research which aims at developing a revolutionary new class of electronic devices exploiting the spin degree of freedom of the electron in addition to the charge. Spintronics is an integral part of nanotechnology whose rapid growth provides a challenge to the academic community to educate students with the necessary knowledge, understanding, and skills. The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to develop a first-rate spintronics research and educational program at the University of Texas at Austin that meets the future demands of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The research agenda of the project is focused on the spin transfer phenomenon which refers to a novel method to manipulate spins using an electrical current. This method offers unprecedented spatial and temporal control of spin distributions and combines interesting fundamental science with the promise of applications in a broad range of technologies. Magnetic microcontact spectroscopy technique will be developed to probe the spin transfer phenomenon on yet unexplored length and time scales. Coherent integration of research and educational activities will expose students of all levels to spintronics and prepare them to conduct research and development of economically feasible and innovative applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spintronics (or magnetoelectronics) is a multidisciplinary field of research which aims at developing a revolutionary new class of electronic devices exploiting the spin degree of freedom of the electron in addition to the charge.
