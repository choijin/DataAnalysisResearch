<AbstractNarration>Delaware State University (DSU) will establish the Center for Research and Education in Optical Sciences and&lt;br/&gt;Applications (CREOSA). Its mission will be to (1) promote multidisciplinary research and education in optics and the related fields of physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, mathematics, and biology; (2) enhance the research capabilities of DSU by engaging faculty in research that integrates the education of a diverse population of students; (3) provide a rich intellectual environment for collaborative research among faculty and students from various departments; and (4) develop research and educational collaborations with the larger community, including industry, minority-serving colleges and universities, other universities, and high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical science will be the primary research focus , because it is intrinsically interdisciplinary, offering rich capabilities with exciting applications and innovations in many fields. DSU will use existing core competencies and facilities as the foundation to build CREOSA into world-class optics center that will involve and mentor high school, undergraduate, and graduate students at DSU, preparing many underrepresented minority students for STEM graduate studies and careers. Also through CREOSA, research engagement will become a common thread from introductory coursework through graduation, and the Center will grow multidisciplinary collaborations within and beyond campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of CREOSA are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Integrate strong and dynamic research with education in optical sciences and applications&lt;br/&gt;to enhance the research environment at DSU.&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop multidisciplinary collaborations involving a diverse population of students and&lt;br/&gt;faculty from DSU and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;3. Work with STEM departments to increase the number of underrepresented undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate students in STEM, with the goal of doubling STEM degree production&lt;br/&gt;within 10 years.&lt;br/&gt;4. Create and implement STEM curricula that incorporate research engagement, including a&lt;br/&gt;senior thesis option.&lt;br/&gt;5. Strengthen the research infrastructure at DSU in terms of people, equipment, and access&lt;br/&gt;to scientific information.&lt;br/&gt;6. Lay the foundations for a PhD program in optical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
