<AbstractNarration>Portland State University continues its operation of a multidiscipline Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) site. The objective of this REU site is focused on inspiring undergraduate students to pursue careers in science and engineering by involving them in "real-life" nanometrology related research. Recruitment is nationwide, with an emphasis on students from community colleges in the greater Portland area and from four-year colleges where few research opportunities exist. The REU Site offers a variety of interdisciplinary research projects covering nanomaterial synthesis (including electronic, optical, and biological materials), nanodevice fabrication, and the development of nanometrology tools with an emphasis on microscopy and spectroscopy. In working toward this objective, the PSU-REU site is committed to bringing together students from different disciplines, ethnic backgrounds, and institutions. Through a concentrated summer program, REU participants learn the use of major research instruments such as electron microscopes and conduct research in close contact with faculty mentors. Other student activities include a workshop on laboratory safety, database searching and computer tools; a short course on the application of microscopy and microanalysis; a field trip to local high tech companies and a research symposium where students present the results of their work.</AbstractNarration>
