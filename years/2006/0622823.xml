<AbstractNarration>0622823&lt;br/&gt;Goel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conference brings together disparate bioengineering research specialties including cell and molecular engineering, tissue engineering, and functional tissue engineering - with a focus on biomechanical engineering. Sponsoring organizations include the American Society of Mechanical Engineers-Bioengineering Division (ASME-BED), the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), the U.S. National Committee on Biomechanics (USNCB), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE-EMBS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program Committee and the Plenary speakers list (from academia, industry, and health care) represent the leaders in the field. A booklet will provide program details to the participants of the conference. All technical presentations will be two-page extended abstracts in a CD format, to be distributed free to all registrants. Copies of the CD will also be provided to all sponsoring societies. The CD is to serve as the proceedings of the meeting.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;All seven of the previous Summer Bioengineering conferences have had outstanding representation of women and minorities. This years organizing committee includes several women: Drs. Jennifer Wayne (Virginia Commonwealth University); Dawn Elliot (University of Pennsylvania); and, Michele Grim (Wayne State University). The large student representation, as well as the family-friendly atmosphere of the conference, has served to promote the involvement of women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the premiere meeting for bioengineering with a focus on biomechanical engineering. The planned lectures provide important cross-fertilization of ideas, concepts, tools, and approaches.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the direct impact this conference will have on the mainstream bioengineering community, this meeting will serve an important cross-fertilization role. Bioengineers, engineers from other disciplines, cell and molecular biologists, biochemists, biophysicists, and other scientists are expected to participate in the meeting. Therefore, the conference is expected to have a much broader impact than if it were to be attended by just the bioengineering community. And, approximately 40% of the attendees are expected to be students.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
