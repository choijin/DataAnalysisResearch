<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 0631821&lt;br/&gt;Ttitle: "Qualitative Reasoning Workshop Graduate Student Travel Support"&lt;br/&gt;PI: Christopher Bailey-Kellogg&lt;br/&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to help defray travel costs of graduate student participating in the 20th International Conference on Qualitative Reasoning (QR-06) to be held July 10-12, 2006 at Dartmouth College. Qualitative Reasoning is an important core area in Artificial Intelligence and addresses issues in knowledge representation, cognitive modeling, qualitative simulation, dynamical systems, and task-level reasoning. Its concerns are at the interface of AI, Cognitive Science, Engineering and Science. The conference will hold a special session on graduate study in QR. It will be designed to enable students to receive feedback on their work from leading researchers in QR and to become integrated into the international QR community. The session will discuss the rewards and challenges of graduate study in interdisciplinary research areas such as Qualitative Reasoning. Topics to be addressed include selection of appropriate research problems, evaluation of results with respect to the standards of multiple fields, and publication in multiple venues. These activities will deepen the base of researchers by enabling graduate students to become knowledgeable in both qualitative reasoning and the rigors of interdisciplinary research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
