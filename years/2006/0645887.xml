<AbstractNarration>Hope College will host an eight week REU program for six undergraduates per year in mathematics. Pairs of students will work with one of three faculty members. Projects will be chosen from topics in algebra, probability and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary goals are to help talented and motivated students develop as mathematical researchers, to promote mathematics research as a career, and to have the participants achieve significant mathematical results in partnership with a faculty mentor. In particular, students will 1) learn new mathematics, 2) gain mathematical independence by learning to read math texts, journals, and research papers, 3) solve an original mathematical problem, 4) learn to communicate mathematics verbally, and 5) write a mathematical paper suitable for submission to a journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three student pairs will present their problems and results to each other informally throughout the summer at weekly seminars.  Students and faculty mentors will give feedback to presenters on how to more effectively communicate mathematical ideas in both formal and informal settings. Towards the end of the program students will write and formally present papers at a conference held in conjunction with other REU programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
