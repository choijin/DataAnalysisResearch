<AbstractNarration>SGER: Strategies for Increasing Stability of Self-Assembling DNA Nanostructures&lt;br/&gt;PI: Thomas H. LaBean&lt;br/&gt;DNA nanostructure self-assembly is being developed as a "bottom-up" approach for the&lt;br/&gt;fabrication of desired patterns and structures with feature sizes smaller than achievable with conventional&lt;br/&gt;lithography techniques. The exploratory research proposed here aims to increase the stability of DNA&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures by incorporating isoG/isoC base pairs within and between DNA building blocks, by&lt;br/&gt;facilitating ligation between abutting oligonucleotides, and by exploring interstrand chemical crosslinking.&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop methods for stabilizing DNA and&lt;br/&gt;biomolecular nanostructures to increase production yields, improve the halflife, and diversify the physical&lt;br/&gt;and chemical conditions under which the structures are useable. In addition, it has been noted, that&lt;br/&gt;attachment of nanomaterials, for example metallic nanocrystals or large proteins, to the component DNA&lt;br/&gt;strands prior to assembly into lattices can result in assembly difficulties and decreased size of the&lt;br/&gt;resulting superstructures. Stabilized lattices may help to overcome these issues.&lt;br/&gt;Summary of Proposed Research Tasks: 1). Develop DNA self-assembly materials and techniques&lt;br/&gt;for formation of larger addressable arrays and lattices. 2). Incorporate stabilizing strategies, including&lt;br/&gt;isoG/isoC and ligation into DNA tile lattice designs. Perform nanoscale structural characterization. 3).&lt;br/&gt;Investigate interstrand cross-linking via chemical bridges within DNA building blocks. 4). Test the&lt;br/&gt;stabilized nanostructures as templates for metal deposition and scaffolds for immobilization of&lt;br/&gt;conducting, semi-conducting, and dielectric nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project fulfills the goals of the CCF Division and of the Emerging Models and&lt;br/&gt;Technologies Program by advancing fundamental capabilities in computer science and engineering using&lt;br/&gt;advances and insights from areas as diverse as biological systems and molecular engineering. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research innovations enable fundamentally different ways of approaching the fabrication of&lt;br/&gt;computing and communications hardware. The intellectual merit of the proposed activities is high&lt;br/&gt;because the project brings together cutting-edge research in DNA self-assembly with new synthetic&lt;br/&gt;basepair options and chemical cross-linking procedures, and from the fact that the PIs lab is uniquely&lt;br/&gt;qualified and poised to execute the proposed study at this time. There is a high likelihood that the research&lt;br/&gt;tasks will be completed as described and very high scientific and technological payoffs when they&lt;br/&gt;succeed. Broader impacts of the proposed work include the possibility of stabile DNA nanostructures for&lt;br/&gt;application not only to computing but also to biomedical uses, as well as the certainty of establishing&lt;br/&gt;research training opportunities for the next generation of creative experts in bioinspired design, molecular&lt;br/&gt;engineering, self-assembly, and nanostructure templated chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
