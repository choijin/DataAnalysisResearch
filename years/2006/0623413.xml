    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0623413&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0623278&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluating fluid flow rates through permeable sediments, and the impact of this flow on ocean chemistry, has been a challenging problem. Flow may be driven by circulation of seawater through the seabed in response to pressure gradients created by the passage of gravity waves across the sea surface, or by pressure gradients generated as currents flow over irregular bottom topography. In some areas, flow may be driven by terrestrial groundwater discharge into the coastal zone, via bio-irrigation, or physical irrigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, researcher from the University of Southern California and the University of Washington, will evaluate the fluid circulation rates within offshore sediments off Huntington Beach CA, at sites where circulation is dominated by the influence of waves. Circulation rates and patterns in these permeable sediments will be deduced from reaction/transport modeling of naturally-occurring radioisotope distributions: 222Rn, 223Ra, 224Ra, and 228Ra. Previous work in this region has established regional budgets for Ra isotopes that constrain their overall input from these shallow water sediments. The goal of this study is to define how input varies with water depth and wave characteristics. Observations will provide an in situ calibration point for models describing flow through permeable sediment. In addition to the radioisotopes, oxygen, TCO2, and nutrient profiles will be measured. This data set will be used to establish fluxes of these constituents, based on the model transport parameters developed with radioisotopes. These fluxes will help to constrain the role of these permeable sediments in trapping fine-grained biogenic particles as seawater circulates through the sands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader impacts, results from this study will be of value to water quality managers who evaluate the ability of nearshore permeable sediments to filter water. The project will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students to work in laboratory and field settings. The fieldwork component of the research will be done in collaboration with the Aquarium of the Pacific Scientific Diving Program. This collaboration will not only provide an important logistical assistance to carry out the work, but also foster communication between oceanographers and the community of coastal zone recreational users.</AbstractNarration>
