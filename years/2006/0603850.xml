<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0603850&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Steve Zelditch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global harmonic analysis is concerned with the impact of global&lt;br/&gt;geometry, particularly the geodesic flow, on the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;eigenfunctions, eigenvalues and waves on a Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;manifold. By comparison, local harmonic analysis uses only local&lt;br/&gt;analysis on small balls. As an example of the impact of global&lt;br/&gt;geometry, ergodicity of the geodesic flow implies the uniform&lt;br/&gt;distribution of eigenfunctions in the unit cotangent bundle. A&lt;br/&gt;new result in this direction is part of the proposal: ergodicity&lt;br/&gt;of the geodesic flow can be used to determine the asymptotics of&lt;br/&gt;the complex nodal hypersurface of eigenfunctions.  In another&lt;br/&gt;direction, sup norms of eigenfunctions are related to existence&lt;br/&gt;of focal points for the geodesic flow and to the first return map&lt;br/&gt;on geodesic directions at the focal point (a joint project with&lt;br/&gt;C. Sogge and J. Toth). Asymptotic geometry aims to apply similar&lt;br/&gt;methods to study problems in complex geometry, in particular to&lt;br/&gt;the program of Yau, Tian, and Donaldson to study approximation of&lt;br/&gt;all hermitian metrics on a positive line bundle by Bergman&lt;br/&gt;metrics. A joint project with J. Song is to use asymptotics of&lt;br/&gt;Bergman kernels on toric varieties to study a problem of&lt;br/&gt;Phong-Sturm on how the geometry of the symmetric space of Bergman&lt;br/&gt;metrics of height N approaches the Monge-Ampere geodesic geometry&lt;br/&gt;of the full infinite dimensional space of hermitian metrics. In&lt;br/&gt;another direction, an ongoing joint project with B. Shiffman is&lt;br/&gt;to study statistical algebraic geometry of high degree varieties&lt;br/&gt;as the degree tends to infinity. This has applications in string&lt;br/&gt;theory (joint work with M. Douglas).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both topics involve the application of ideas and methods&lt;br/&gt;regarding the relation of classical and quantum mechanics to&lt;br/&gt;geometry and analysis. In each area there is a small "Planck's&lt;br/&gt;constant" which tends to zero. In the global analysis of&lt;br/&gt;eigenfunctions, it is one over the eigenvalue; in geometry it is&lt;br/&gt;the degree of a polynomial. As the "Planck constant" tends to&lt;br/&gt;zero, analytic objects (quantum mechanical) such as&lt;br/&gt;eigenfunctions or Bergman kernels tend to geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;(classical mechanics), which are much easier to&lt;br/&gt;understand. Physicists, engineers and mathematicians have been&lt;br/&gt;studying the relations between classical and quantum mechanics&lt;br/&gt;for almost a hundred years now, but the relations are so&lt;br/&gt;difficult that fundamental problems remain. To take a venerable&lt;br/&gt;example, Chladnyi first demonstrated two hundred years ago that,&lt;br/&gt;if one puts sand on a vibrating drum, the sand will move to the&lt;br/&gt;"nodal line".  Despite the two hundred years, no one knows how&lt;br/&gt;nodal lines snake around on general drums. One project above is&lt;br/&gt;to determine the "complex" nodal line when billiards played on&lt;br/&gt;the drum move in a chaotic way. Thus if one "thickens" the nodal&lt;br/&gt;line in complex directions, one can understand how it snakes&lt;br/&gt;around on chaotic drum heads.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
