<AbstractNarration>For several years now, the University of Utah has run two-week intensive summer&lt;br/&gt;minicourses in which some aspect of modern mathematics was taught to visiting&lt;br/&gt;mathematics graduate students and postdocs. In June 2007, the minicourse will be on&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and string theory, topics relevant to recent physics. The Co-PIs together&lt;br/&gt;with Eric Sharpe (a physicist at Utah U) expect this to be an important opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;young physicists as well as mathematicians. Money to support visiting mathematics&lt;br/&gt;students already exists (through the University of Utahs VIGRE grant, and potentially&lt;br/&gt;through additional MSRI support). This proposal requests support to reimburse lodging&lt;br/&gt;and travel for five visiting young physicists. The minicourse will be immediately followed&lt;br/&gt;by an AMS Summer Research Conference to be held at Snowbird, Utah, again&lt;br/&gt;organized by the Co-PIs and Eric Sharpe. This research workshop will be held on the&lt;br/&gt;same topics as the minicourse, and like the minicourse primary funding already exists.&lt;br/&gt;The physicists who attend the minicourse will also be able to attend the workshop The&lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit of this subject is justified by the current activity in both the mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and physics communities. Some research results may come directly out of this summer&lt;br/&gt;minicourse, as attendees apply what they have learned. The impact of the minicourse&lt;br/&gt;will be broadened by bringing the physicists and mathematicians together, to help them&lt;br/&gt;form good interdisciplinary contacts that will serve them well in future years.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the Co-PIs plan to videotape the lectures and make them available on the&lt;br/&gt;web, so that non-attendees can also benefit, further broadening the impact of this&lt;br/&gt;summer minicourse. Efforts will be made to encourage participation of women and&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Diary Note&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0652421 PI Name:Lee, Yuan-Pin&lt;br/&gt;Printed</AbstractNarration>
