<AbstractNarration>Yan Chen&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;0627751&lt;br/&gt;Panel:  P060969&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacks are commonplace in today's networks, and identifying them&lt;br/&gt;rapidly and accurately is critical for large network/service&lt;br/&gt;operators.  Most existing intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are&lt;br/&gt;signatures-based. But such signatures are usually generated manually&lt;br/&gt;or semi-manually, a process too slow for defending against&lt;br/&gt;self-propagating malicious codes, or worms.  To evade detection by&lt;br/&gt;signatures, attackers may also employ polymorphic worms which change&lt;br/&gt;their byte sequence at every successive infection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to thwart a zero-day worm attack, it is essential to design&lt;br/&gt;an automatic signature generation system against polymorphic worms&lt;br/&gt;which may be deployed at the network gateways/routers and satisfy&lt;br/&gt;the following requirements: network-based, noise-tolerant,&lt;br/&gt;attack-resilient, and having efficient signature matching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of the existing work satisfy all the requirements above. Thus&lt;br/&gt;the PIs design NAPOLEON( Network-based Attack-resilient&lt;br/&gt;POLymophic-worm signaturE generatiON), a network-based automatic&lt;br/&gt;signature generation system with all the aforementioned properties.&lt;br/&gt;NAPOLEON has two components which complement each other: TOken-based&lt;br/&gt;Signature Generator (called TOSG) and LEngth-based Signature&lt;br/&gt;Generator (called LESG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines theoretical computer science with practical&lt;br/&gt;network security research. The PI has extensive experience on&lt;br/&gt;network anomaly/intrusion detection. The co-PI's expertise is in&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science and algorithms and has a track record&lt;br/&gt;of applying them to various applications including security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary research will have a strong impact. For&lt;br/&gt;example, during the PIs' collaboration, they have found that certain&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic techniques in bioinformatics are directly or indirectly&lt;br/&gt;applicable to worm detection problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
