<AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with the development, analysis and &lt;br/&gt;implementation of numerical methods for balance laws. The focus is&lt;br/&gt;on systems which arise by averaging the multidimensional Euler&lt;br/&gt;equations of fluid dynamics. The averaging process produces&lt;br/&gt;source terms that are inherently in nonconservation form, whose &lt;br/&gt;presence has major consequences for the theory as well as for&lt;br/&gt;computations of solutions. Computational difficulties include &lt;br/&gt;nonuniqueness of solutions, loss of strict hyperbolicity, lack of &lt;br/&gt;guiding principles in discretizing nonconservative products and  &lt;br/&gt;difficulties to compute accurately near steady-state solutions. &lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to understand, from a numerical view &lt;br/&gt;point, how these various characteristics are interconnected, &lt;br/&gt;to identify numerical features that need to be respected&lt;br/&gt;and provide design principles which lead to simple and efficient&lt;br/&gt;numerical schemes. This research program will be carried out by studying&lt;br/&gt;a series of nonconservative models, and offer numerical frameworks within &lt;br/&gt;which the computational difficulties may be addressed:  (i) a &lt;br/&gt;relaxation approach addressing the loss of hyperbolicity, and &lt;br/&gt;inaccessibility of eigenstructure; (ii) discrete averaging models, &lt;br/&gt;giving accurate estimates on closure terms and providing unambiguous &lt;br/&gt;approximations for nonconservative products; (iii) hybrid algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for two phase flows, which preserves the correct jump conditions across &lt;br/&gt;discontinuities in coefficients. As an application, the methods will be &lt;br/&gt;used to study two layer exchange flow between reservoirs, and extended&lt;br/&gt;to multilayer shallow water flows through a channel contraction. &lt;br/&gt;Analytical predictions are available and will be used for validation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physical equations of the type considered in this project are used to &lt;br/&gt;model a wide range of fluid flows. They are used to model large scale &lt;br/&gt;atmospheric and oceanic flows over terrains, and to describe ground flows &lt;br/&gt;in porous media. They model river and coastal flows, dam breaks &lt;br/&gt;and flooding, such as the flow in the Rigolets strait connecting &lt;br/&gt;the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Ponchartrain near New Orleans. They are used &lt;br/&gt;in hydraulics, to describe and control exchange flow between reservoirs. &lt;br/&gt;In multiphase flows, they model the dynamics of droplet suspensions such &lt;br/&gt;as sprays in environmental applications, or cloud dynamics, which may be &lt;br/&gt;important in visibility military applications. Alongside experiments&lt;br/&gt;and theory, numerical simulations constitute a major tool of study in &lt;br/&gt;these applications areas, and the issues addressed in this project are &lt;br/&gt;fundamental to their development. To date, numerical methods for balance &lt;br/&gt;laws are still facing major challenges, and provide incomplete and &lt;br/&gt;unsatisfactory answers. The directions outlined in this project address &lt;br/&gt;these challenges, they are original, they are new and they emphasize &lt;br/&gt;general design principles that can be exported to other systems of &lt;br/&gt;similar structure. The completion of the proposed project is expected &lt;br/&gt;to have a significant impact on computational practices in these &lt;br/&gt;communities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
