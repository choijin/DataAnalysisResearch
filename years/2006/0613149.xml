    <AbstractNarration>Andreas Acrivos&lt;br/&gt;CTS - 0613149&lt;br/&gt;CUNY City College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flow of multiphase materials, such as suspensions of solid particles, drops &amp; bubbles in&lt;br/&gt;liquids, is encountered frequently in a variety of industrial processes as well as in nature, hence&lt;br/&gt;the subject has received a considerable degree of attention from both the fundamental &amp; practical&lt;br/&gt;points of view. Yet, compared to the more traditional area of single-phase fluid mechanics, the&lt;br/&gt;research activity in multiphase fluid dynamics has not been on a scale commensurate with the&lt;br/&gt;importance and complexity of the field. For example, although it is well known that the dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of single -phase materials can be accurately described by means of the Navier-Stokes equations,&lt;br/&gt;which at present can be solved using a variety of analytical or numerical techniques, a&lt;br/&gt;corresponding set of fundamental equations for multiphase materials is currently unavailable&lt;br/&gt;except for special cases. Similarly, there is a dearth of experimental methods able to capture the&lt;br/&gt;detailed structure of multiphase flows compared to those currently available for their single-phase&lt;br/&gt;counterparts. It the purpose of this Symposium to try and remedy this situation by bringing&lt;br/&gt;together some of the key researchers in a subset of this broad field and, through active discussions&lt;br/&gt;&amp; interchange of ideas, lay the foundations for organizing a concerted effort to attack some of the&lt;br/&gt;major issues which need to be resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium is entitled "Recent Advances in Multiphase Flows: Numerical &amp; Experimental"&lt;br/&gt;and will take place 11 14 June 2007, in Istanbul, Turkey. The meeting is under the auspices of&lt;br/&gt;the International Union on Theoretical &amp; Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) and is co-sponsored&lt;br/&gt;by the Istanbul Technical University. IUTAM, in existence for the better part of a century, is a&lt;br/&gt;well-known international organization. It organizes the IUTAM Congresses every 4 years and&lt;br/&gt;sponsors about a dozen or so Symposia every year all dedicated to the advancement of&lt;br/&gt;mechanics. This particular Symposium is organized by the Principal Investigator, together with&lt;br/&gt;Professor Can Delale (Istanbul Technical University), plus a 6 member international scientific&lt;br/&gt;committee. This proposal seeks partial support from the National Science Foundation in order to&lt;br/&gt;facilitate the attendance of several American students and other researchers who would otherwise&lt;br/&gt;not be able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will bring together a small but select group of researchers active in the fundamentals&lt;br/&gt;of multiphase fluid dynamics especially as concerns the development of: (a) fundamental basic&lt;br/&gt;equations for describing such systems; (b) general purpose numerical techniques for solving such&lt;br/&gt;equations; and (c) novel experimental methods for measuring the detailed structure of such flows&lt;br/&gt;and thereby testing the model predictions. Potential applications include micro- and nanosystems&lt;br/&gt;involving particulate and other multiphase flows, suspension flows, mixing, drop break-up &amp;&lt;br/&gt;coalescence, combustion, electric and magnetic field driven phenomena, etc.&lt;br/&gt;The number of attendees will be capped at 70-75 to maintain a workshop atmosphere where&lt;br/&gt;future research directions in the subject field will be identified for the benefit of the community in&lt;br/&gt;general and the National Science Foundation in particular. There will be no parallel sessions, but&lt;br/&gt;there will be plenty of opportunities for fruitful discussions. The intellectual merit of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed activity lies in bringing together 3 communities in this field who seldom interact with&lt;br/&gt;one another, viz. those involved with: (a) developing rational fundamental equations for modeling&lt;br/&gt;multiphase flows; (b) those developing simulation techniques for solving these equations; and (c)&lt;br/&gt;those developing novel experimental tools for testing in detail the theoretical predictions.</AbstractNarration>
