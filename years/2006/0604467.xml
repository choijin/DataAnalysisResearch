<AbstractNarration>Almog&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0604467&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project covers both the Ginzburg-Landau model of&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity and the Landau-De Gennes model of liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals.  The investigator studies several fundamental&lt;br/&gt;theoretical problems related to these models.  In particular, he&lt;br/&gt;examines:&lt;br/&gt;1. The structure of boundary layers of superconducting or smectic&lt;br/&gt;states that are both characterized by exponentially fast decaying&lt;br/&gt;solutions. For the case of superconductors this phenomenon is&lt;br/&gt;called surface superconductivity.&lt;br/&gt;2. The emergence of periodic solutions, known as Abrikosov&lt;br/&gt;lattices for superconductors and as twist grain boundaries for&lt;br/&gt;smectic liquid crystals.&lt;br/&gt;3. The loss of stability, in the presence of a combination of&lt;br/&gt;electric and magnetic field, of the normal state in&lt;br/&gt;superconductors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Superconductors are metals that when put under a&lt;br/&gt;sufficiently low temperature exhibit two important properties:&lt;br/&gt;1. They lose entirely their electrical resistivity.&lt;br/&gt;2. The magnetic field is excluded from the superconducting area.&lt;br/&gt;Superconductors have enormous technological potential for&lt;br/&gt;applications ranging from magnetic sensors, through generators of&lt;br/&gt;large magnetic fields, to high power transmitters.  Liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals contain elongated molecules whose direction and density&lt;br/&gt;determine the material's mechanical, optical and other&lt;br/&gt;properties.  They are already at the heart of a large industry,&lt;br/&gt;particularly in display devices, and they are being explored for&lt;br/&gt;further application in a variety of optical devices.  Liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals with uniform density are called nematics, and those with&lt;br/&gt;non-uniform density are termed smectics.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies the behavior of the above materials when the material is&lt;br/&gt;either superconducting or smectic only in a thin layer near the&lt;br/&gt;boundary.  The project could shed light on the transition from&lt;br/&gt;the normal state to the superconducting one, or from nematics to&lt;br/&gt;smectics.  It can also have some industrial applications because&lt;br/&gt;it aims at finding the maximal current a superconductor can carry&lt;br/&gt;before reverting to the normal state where the material&lt;br/&gt;resistivity would cause energy losses.</AbstractNarration>
