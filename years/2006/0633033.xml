<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is connecting research trends in science, engineering, and medicine with current mathematical undergraduate education through development of a course entitled Mathematical Introduction to "Medical Imaging". This course serves as a model for integrating mathematics with the biological sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Interweaving the latest technological and science achievements into mathematics education is of fundamental importance because to influence progress and development in industry, research laboratories, universities, and medical centers, it is necessary for graduates in the sciences to be able to apply mathematical methods and tools to study problems quantitatively and qualitatively. The focus of the project is on medical imaging, one of the most important tools in detection of various human diseases at early stages. The design, implementation and evaluation of the course and associated laboratories involves innovative strategies and collaboration with faculty from different areas of mathematics; from various departments, schools, and centers at the university; from local corporations; and from universities in Canada and Great Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The goal of this project is enhancement of the education of a new generation of problem-solving scientists who can do cutting edge interdisciplinary research. The project activities are improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education by introducing an innovative curriculum design and by developing a general strategy of how mathematical knowledge can be combined with current technology needs. A significant pool of female and minority students at Arizona State University is enabling the project to help prepare a diverse scientific community for the future. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
