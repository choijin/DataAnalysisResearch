<AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring a mobile humanoid robotics platform as the centerpiece of a Human-Centered Robotics Lab, aims at assisting a broad population in need, based on the belief that the most suitable form of multi-purpose assistive machine for humans will be human-like. This new kind of robot, not highly accurate, stationary, single task machine with sensing abilities as for typical industrial applications, is richly equipped with multi-model sensing, a high level of dexterity, compliance for safe operation, and mobility. Endowed with the appearance and behavior of a social system appropriate for human environments, it can perform a large number of assistive tasks, autonomously or in collaborative instruction with humans. A humanoid robot instigates a variety of original research. Developing humanoid behavior advances robotics and automation technology while promoting interdisciplinary interaction with natural sciences</AbstractNarration>
