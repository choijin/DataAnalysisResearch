<AbstractNarration>Multiscale systems abound in science and engineering.  Their comprehensive treatment requires&lt;br/&gt;accurate mathematical modeling of processes at the fine scales and a mathematical framework for&lt;br/&gt;flow of information across scales.  This proposal addresses this problem in the context of heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;explosives.  These have a complex microstructure with fragments of the energetic material, voids and&lt;br/&gt;pores existing within the granular aggregate.  When subjected to a sufficiently strong shock, a detonation&lt;br/&gt;is initiated.  Although the crystalline homogeneous explosive has a high ignition threshold, relatively&lt;br/&gt;weaker stimuli are sufficient to initiate the heterogeneous aggregate.  This is caused by the appearance&lt;br/&gt;of discrete sites, or hot spots, where burning commences and then spreads to consume the entire bulk.&lt;br/&gt;The multi-scale nature of the system is a daunting obstacle in the way of any attempt at ab-initio modeling&lt;br/&gt;of the detonation phenomena, at least at the present time.  Two major approaches to mathematical&lt;br/&gt;modeling have been proposed.  Both generate continuum equations at the macro scale, wherein a certain&lt;br/&gt;degree of homogenization is implicit and fine-scale processes have been included as subgrid models.&lt;br/&gt;The first approach, typified by the ignition-and-growth model, treats the explosive as a homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;mixture of two distinct constituents, the unreacted explosive and the products of reaction, at pressure and&lt;br/&gt;temperature equilibrium.  To each constituent is assigned an equation of state, and a single reaction-rate&lt;br/&gt;law is postulated for the conversion of the explosive to products.  The second approach explicitly&lt;br/&gt;recognizes the two-phase character of the explosive mixture.  The resulting model has separate&lt;br/&gt;balance laws of mass, momentum and energy for each phase, plus a rule that allows compaction of&lt;br/&gt;the solid phase driven by pressure difference between the phases.  Terms representing interfacial&lt;br/&gt;exchange of mass, momentum and energy appear, corresponding to the nonequilibrium processes of&lt;br/&gt;reaction, drag and heat transfer. These models are systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;that can be considered as generalizations of the Euler equations of gasdynamics.  This proposal is aimed&lt;br/&gt;at studies of existing continuum models as well as the investigation of fine-scale phenomena.  The primary&lt;br/&gt;objective will be to study how the strength and distribution of hot spots depend, in a quantitative way,&lt;br/&gt;upon the constitutive properties of the explosive and the size of the igniting stimulus, thus providing&lt;br/&gt;important information that can be used in attempts at multi-scale descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many areas in science and engineering, including weather, combustion, pollution, and biological systems,&lt;br/&gt;among others, involve behavior at the scale of observation that is determined by the events occurring at&lt;br/&gt;micro scales.  A thorough treatment of such systems requires, on the one hand, a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding and accurate mathematical modeling of processes at the micro scales, and on the other, development of a theoretical and computational framework that would facilitate flow of information&lt;br/&gt;across scales, so that behavior at the scale of observation can be predicted reliably and accurately.&lt;br/&gt;Attention to such systems is particularly timely and apt in the context of science-based stewardship of&lt;br/&gt;explosive devices, and it is problems from this arena that form the core of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
