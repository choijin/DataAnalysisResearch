<AbstractNarration>Prop No: 0643319&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER:Robust Design for Scaled CMOS Technologies&lt;br/&gt;PI: Subhasish Mitra&lt;br/&gt;Inst: Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on creating novel core technologies for designing robust computing and communication systems, and educating future generations of engineers who will be responsible for designing such systems with robustness as a fundamental design objective.  Such systems constitute an inseparable part of human lives today, and will be further integrated in the future over a wide range of complex applications such as information appliances, transportation, health, bio-medical, and finance.  The project is motivated by an imminent paradigm shift in hardware design resulting from the growing problem of hardware failures in future semiconductor process technologies.  The traditional hardware design paradigm assumes that semiconductor process technologies always produce perfect hardware that will never operate incorrectly during its lifetime.  Continuous push for smaller semiconductor process geometries  also called technology scaling which is the key to the success of the semiconductor industry is approaching a point where such a design paradigm will be infeasible due to fundamental limitations.  This project breaks this barrier by adopting the following principle: accept the fact that the underlying hardware will be imperfect, and develop technologies and tools for designing efficient, cost-effective, and failure-aware robust systems that ensure high quality of service, data integrity, availability, security and safety.  This advancement in Computer Engineering will enable the semiconductor industry to continue technology scaling with immense impact on future electronic products.  It is also expected that the research ideas developed in this project will have a far-reaching impact on robust designs in emerging revolutionary nanotechnologies far beyond contemporary CMOS technologies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Malfunctions in these systems have consequences ranging from annoying computer crashes, loss of data and services, to financial and productivity losses, or even loss of human life. For example, in 2009, a glitch in a single circuit board in the air-traffic control system resulted in hundreds of flights being canceled or delayed. Such impacts continue to increase as systems become more complex, interconnected, and pervasive.  Robust system design is required to ensure that future systems perform correctly despite rising levels of complexity and increasing disturbances. Hardware failures are especially a growing concern because:  Existing test and validation methods barely cope with todayÆs complexity. New techniques will be essential to minimize the effects of defects and design flaws going forward. For coming generations of silicon ICs with remarkably small geometries, several failure mechanisms, largely benign in the past, are becoming visible at the system-level. A large class of future systems will require tolerance of hardware errors during their operation.   This inter-disciplinary research addresses key challenges in robust system design, ranging from immediate concerns blocking progress today to major obstacles in exploratory nanotechnologies. The research results constitute significant progress toward these goals, and have received wide-spread academic recognition.

Our results have received wide-spread recognition from the technical academic community and industry. We emphasize the direct impact of the research on research and development at major chip and system builders, and design automation tool suppliers.  Honors include:  Best Paper Award at the IEEE/ACM Design Automation Conference. Best Paper Award at the IEEE VLSI Test Symposium. Best Student Paper Award at the IEEE International Test Conference. Selection by ACM as "Research Highlight" and an invited feature in the Communications of the ACM (CACM). An Intel Fellow and Director of Microprocessor Research characterized these techniques as "breakthrough" in CACM. Several keynotes, invited papers, and invited speeches at major conferences and journals.   Broader impact:  The PI got actively involved in undergraduate and graduate teaching, creation of new courses, training and research opportunities for high-school students and undergraduates, and curriculum development.  The PI created a new advanced graduate research course on robust system design. This course brings together students with a broad spectrum of expertise &ndash; circuits, architecture, software, control theory, and space applications.
