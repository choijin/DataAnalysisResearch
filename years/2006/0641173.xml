<AbstractNarration>The control of growth is a fundamentally important area of investigation in developmental biology.  Growth factors, such as members of the TGF-beta family of proteins, are known to control the growth and differentiation of a variety of tissues.  While components of the TGF-beta signaling pathway have been identified, many questions still remain as to how these molecules are involved in growth and differentiation. To address this problem, Dr. Padgett has identified a set of genes in the Drosophila brain that are highly conserved in other species, but for which little information is known and whose connection to TGF-beta signaling is poorly understood. Mutations will be made in these three genes to determine their relationship to TGF-beta signaling and to brain growth control. The mutant phenotype of these genes and those of previously identified components of the TGF-beta pathway will be dissected and compared. Given the diverse developmental roles of the TGF-betas, studies in a genetically tractable organism, such as Drosophila, will provide insight into common mechanisms of growth control during development. Dr. Padgett has a strong record of involving undergraduates and high school students in his research and believes that students learn best about science by being engaged in research.</AbstractNarration>
