<AbstractNarration> CMMI - 0652129&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A focused, bi-lateral US-Japan Workshop is proposed for October 10, 11 and 12 of 2006 at the University of Tokyo, Japan, with leading researchers and engineers in the targeted area of building systems out of nanoscale elements. The workshop will explore the opportunities, barriers and challenges to these novel nanomaterials and systems. The possibilities for international collaboration between the two countries with major investment can be envisaged as a result of the Workshop. We will review the field by leading experts in both countries. This comes at an opportune time. Many exciting results on the structural, electronic, optical, and transport properties of nanoscale building blocks have already been achieved, and this symposium aims to provide a forum where experts in different aspects of nano systems get together, share information on the state-of-the-art of related research and discuss future prospects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits of the proposal activities.&lt;br/&gt;A nano system is a highly integrated system composed of many elements that have dimensions of nanometers. Unlike nano materials that are currently used in bulk or film form, the fabrication of the nano system requires nanometer accuracy in patterning, machining, positioning and interconnecting individual components. In order realize the nano system, it is necessary to combine different disciplines such as electronics, optics,mechanics(MEMS), material science, bio technology and chemistry in terms of fabrication and application. In other words, so-called bottom-up and top-down approaches are both required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact Resulting from the Proposed Activities.&lt;br/&gt;Observers from NSF and silicon valley companies will attend the Workshop. We will also advertise the workshop to selected academic and industrial labs to attract interested researchers to the audience to maximize the impact of the Workshop. The results of the Workshop will be presented in a report to NSF and made available for wide distribution, including presentation slides. The possibilities for international collaboration between the two countries with major investment can be envisaged as a result of the Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
