<AbstractNarration>This project will evaluate uranium isotope ratios of clastic sediments as a measure of the&lt;br/&gt;time required for bedrock to be reduced to small grains by weathering, and then&lt;br/&gt;transported and deposited as sediment. The method may open up new ways of studying and&lt;br/&gt;understanding sediments, the processes that produce them, and how sedimentary processes&lt;br/&gt;are dependent on climate and tectonics. Detailed physical and chemical characterization&lt;br/&gt;of natural sediment from well-controlled environments will be combined with isotopic&lt;br/&gt;measurements. Fieldwork consists of collecting samples of terrestrial sediment from&lt;br/&gt;lakes, loess deposits, streams, and alluvial fans. The work is designed to further&lt;br/&gt;evaluate the approach and also investigate variations in sediment transport time as a&lt;br/&gt;function of climate and depositional environment. The combination of U-series isotopes&lt;br/&gt;and cosmogenic nuclides (Be-10 and Al-26) may yield information about timescales of soil&lt;br/&gt;generation, erosion, transport, and storage, and may allow important types of continental&lt;br/&gt;sedimentary deposits to be dated. Intellectual merit: The research will contribute to&lt;br/&gt;understanding of fundamental aspects of sedimentology and landscape evolution. The PI has&lt;br/&gt;28 years experience in geochemical research, an extensive publication record, and has&lt;br/&gt;trained more than twenty Ph.D. students who have gone on to successful careers in&lt;br/&gt;academia, government, and private industry. U.C. Berkeley has a long record of support of&lt;br/&gt;advanced scientific research, and provides ample facilities, support personnel, and&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure for research and graduate education. Broader Impacts: The research has&lt;br/&gt;broad applicability to geology and environmental studies. It requires knowledge and&lt;br/&gt;training in mass spectrometry, analytical and nuclear chemistry, and hence is an excellent&lt;br/&gt;venue for advanced education. The funding will help support a research facility that, in&lt;br/&gt;the previous 15 years, has benefited 22 graduate students (10 women) 10 postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;fellows (5 women), plus more than 20 visitors, undergraduates and collaborators.</AbstractNarration>
