<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support the attendance of young scholars at the 2006 Gordon Research&lt;br/&gt;Conference on the Chemistry and Physics of Nanostructure Fabrication that will be held&lt;br/&gt;on July 16 - 21, 2006 at the Tilton College in Tilton, NH. The technical program is being organized&lt;br/&gt;by Prof. Theresa S. Mayer, Penn State University (Chair) and Prof. Dawn Bonnell, University&lt;br/&gt;of Pennsylvania (Chair-Elect) and will emphasize ground breaking research at the intersection&lt;br/&gt;between nanostructure synthesis and the devices and systems that are enabled using these&lt;br/&gt;advanced fabrication techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The topics that will be discussed at this meeting are vital not only to today's&lt;br/&gt;information revolution but to the fields of imaging and manipulation of chemical and biological&lt;br/&gt;structures. The organization and atmosphere of Gordon Research Conferences stimulates open&lt;br/&gt;discussion among leading researchers of recent results and new techniques, which is particularly&lt;br/&gt;important in the rapidly growing and changing field of nanoscience and technology. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;the highly interdisciplinary nature of the research discussed at this conference provides and excellent&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for cross fertilization of research ideas and methods. The topics that will be&lt;br/&gt;highlighted at this conference include nanostructure synthesis and self assembly, nano-patterning&lt;br/&gt;and printing, nano-electronics, -biosystems, -optics, -mechanics, and -fluidics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The conference format  a week of continuous interaction with experts in interrelated&lt;br/&gt;fields in a casual setting  provides a particularly rewarding opportunity for young&lt;br/&gt;scholars including graduate students, post-doctoral research associates, and assistant professors&lt;br/&gt;to exchange ideas with and to learn from this gathering of leading researchers. The availability&lt;br/&gt;of this travel support will also assist in our efforts to maintain a high level of diversity among&lt;br/&gt;conference attendees.</AbstractNarration>
