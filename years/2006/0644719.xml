<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Micro-structured Colloidal Suspensions: Nano-scale&lt;br/&gt;Hydrodynamics and Macroscopic Rheology and Thermal Conductivity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central principle of the proposed research is that particles or nanotubes in suspension can be precisely tuned to rotate and/or self-assemble under electric or magnetic fields. The PI proposes to use this basic concept to 1) study the nanoscale hydrodynamics of carbon nanotubes forced to rotate under carefully controlled torques induced by an external electric field, 2) investigate the reversible and dramatic changes in the rheological properties of dilute suspensions of carbon nanotubes under electric fields, and 3) study the dramatically increased and anisotropic thermal conductivity of microstructured suspensions under external fields. The latter two projects in particular are related by the underlying theme that "smart" fluids with tunable thermal and flow properties can be made by inducing microstructure in colloids. Such smart fluids could have practical applications as advanced heat-transfer fluids for micro-processor cooling and other industrial applications, as well as in such devices as clutches, dampers, and automotive shock absorbers.  The research effort will be integrated into an outreach, educational, and mentoring program aimed at female students, who are historically under-represented in engineering. In collaboration with the Douglass Project, an established STEM outreach program at a women's college, the PI will provide: 1) a hands-on introduction to engineering to 9th-and 10th-grade girls through "Weekend Academies," and 2) in-depth laboratory experiences and mentoring for undergraduate women. The material that is developed for the Weekend Academies focusing on engineering will be made available to other students through an interactive web page. The general theme of the proposed research, micro-structured nanotube and nanoparticle suspensions, should be effective at attracting and retaining new students to engineering, because it is novel, of topical interest, and inherently multidisciplinary in nature.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Nanoparticles, particularly non-spherical nanoparticles like nanotubes and nanowires, can be readily manipulated with external electric- and magnetic- fields. As a result, external forcing of nanoparticles in liquid suspension offers a simple and highly controllable system for exploring the nanoscale physics, as well as the macroscopic consequences, of field-induced ordering, alignment, and assembly of nanoparticles in a fluid. In this work, we have shown that the application of electric- or magnetic- fields to nanoparticle suspensions can drastically change the effective thermophysical properties of the suspension, creating novel "smart" fluids with actively controllable thermal, flow and acoustic properties.  We have also developed methods to precisely manipulate individual nanowires and nanotubes in liquid suspension with controlled external fields.  This has led to the development of a new method for the electronic characterization and sorting of 1-dimensional nanoparticles that is both simple and compatible with further solution-based processing for the manufacturing of  complex nano-electronic devices.  The fundamental knowledge developed from this project has made possible the development of a new method for the scalable fabrication of polymer membranes containing aligned-carbon-nanotube pores.  Such nanocomposite membranes have potential as highly breathable membranes for protective clothing, as well as energy efficient water-filtration membranes.  Ten papers and one book chapter have been published based on the work supported by this project.  The broader impact of the work has included the education of four PhD students, two Masters students, and over 10 undergraduates, many of whom have continued their education in graduate school.  The impact of the project has been further extended to a local high-school teacher, who was provided research opportunities for two summers.  Over the course of the project, focused outreach efforts have also been made each summer to middle- and high- school girls through day-long modules on engineering design and testing based on water guns that can be made from commonly available materials.  The project has also provided hand-on research experience and mentoring for first-year women from Douglass College, a historic womens college.
