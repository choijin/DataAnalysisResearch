<AbstractNarration>Many emerging next-generation Internet applications, such as videoconferencing, multimedia distribution, and high-performance scientific computing, are characterized by high bandwidth requirements, multi-source and multi-destination communication paradigms, strict quality of service (QoS) requirements with respect to delay and loss, and high reliability and survivability requirements.  In order to support these diverse requirements, emerging networks must be able to manage resources in a flexible manner.  This project investigates a service-oriented optical network architecture that is enabled by an underlying optical transport network capable of dynamic and agile resource allocation.  An optical transport layer provides the basic mechanisms for reserving resources, and an optical service layer builds a set of services over the basic optical transport layer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the project, specific problems to be addressed include 1) investigating mechanisms for supporting manycast communication services in optical networks, 2) investigating mechanisms for providing survivability in such networks, and 3) developing methods for supporting reliable transport in optical networks. The proposed activity will result in a framework and an architecture for deploying a wide range of services in optical networks in order to support the requirements of the most demanding next-generation applications. The project will also result in the development of new algorithms and protocols for implementing manycasting and providing reliable services, and will lead to the development of analytical models for evaluating these algorithms and protocols.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed activity is that it will provide valuable training for graduate students, preparing them for careers in research and engineering in the field of optical networking.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
