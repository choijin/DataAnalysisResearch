<AbstractNarration>The existing Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Identification Technology Research at West Virginia University will continue to focus on research in identification that includes iris, fingerprint and face recognition and will significantly enhance the research database available for the disciplines involved with security biometrics technologies.  Research is needed in large scale fully automated distributed systems in several applications ranging from drivers license, passports and visas for example.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CITeR is the National Science Foundation (NSF)  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) focusing on  serving its affiliates, companies and government agencies, in the rapidly growing areas of Biometric  Identification and Credibility Assessment Technology.  CITeR project outcomes are intertwined with the active participation of its affiliates.   Over the duration of the project, Affiliate Advisory Board selected for funding nearly 80 precompetitive proof-of-concept projects.  The topical areas of the projects included human credibility assessment, fundamental and applied studies of biometric modalities, biometric system vulnerabilities, biometric image coding and quality, as well as techniques for modeling ane performance assessment.  Over 20 faculty researchers and more than 100 students participated in these projects, creating multidisciplinary research synergies.  Research results were published in leading scientific journals, cofrerences and a dozen authored and edited textbooks.  Students educated through the Center activities are filling in critical positions in biometrics and security industries and in the government.  We will mention only a few most significant research success stories.   Biometric fingerprint authentication has been shown to be vulnerable to spoofing.  CITeR funded projects resulted in the liveness detection algorithms based on the distinctive spatial texture characteristics of the moisture in live fingerprints, designed to minimize the risk of spoofing. The work resulted in two patents so far and a  start-up company.  The inventions have been incorporated into millions of computers with fingerprint sensors and are spreading into mobile devices.   Eye-print biometrics utilizes the veins exposed and easily seen in the veins in the white of the eye (sclera).  In contrast to retinal and hand vein scans, eye-prints do not need specialized scanning devices and can be easily imaged with cell phone cameras.  Eye-print biometrics have been invetned by CITeR researchers, patented, licensed to and commerciallized by a start-up company which is developing secure mobile transaction systems.  With the widespread deployment of Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS), there have been growing instances worldwide where individuals, particularly criminals wish to conceal their true identity. Such individuals alter (mutilate or destroy) their fingerprint patterns by means of abrading, cutting, burning, or performing a plastic surgery to evade identification.  CITeR resarchers  led to the development of an innovative approach for automatically detecting altered fingerprints.  The toolset  developed with CITeR support and in the follow-on project has been licensed to a major international security firm, making AFIS systems more trustworthy.   Tattoo images on human body have been routinely collected and used in law enforcement to assist in suspect and victim identification. With the rise in number of individuals having a tattoo there is renewed interest in law enforcement to utilize tattoos for solving crimes and idetifying criminals. Recognizing that current practice of matching tattoos was based on keywords, CITeR researchers studied the problemn and developed a content-based image retrieval system for a tattoos. The new system automatically extracts image features and with side information about the location of tattoo on the body and tattoo class improves the speed and accuracy of tatoo matching.  The toolset  developed with CITeR support and in the follow-on project  has been licensed and commercialized.  New automated identification systems for law enforcement are emerging on the market modernized and improved with the automated tatoo matching capability.
