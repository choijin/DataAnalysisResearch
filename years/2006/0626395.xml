<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Allan Guymon &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Iowa&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0626395&lt;br/&gt;Title: Kinetic Control of Polymer Nanostructure in Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary:  The use of self-organizing liquid crystals is a means of achieving structural and chemical control of organic polymers on the nanometer scale for enhanced performance.  One area that has recently received a great deal of interest is the development of functional nanostructured polymer materials based on lyotropic (i.e., amphiphilic) liquid crystals (LLCs) which have the ability to self organize in the presence of water into ordered assemblies with periodic nanometer-scale porous domains.  Both polymerized LLC monomers and polymers templated by LLCs have recently shown great promise in applications such as solid-state organic catalysts, size-selective membranes, and tissue engineering scaffolds. The major obstacle in using polymerized LLC materials is the ability to retain and control this structure throughout the polymerization.  Typically, thermodynamically driven phase separation occurs during polymerization, leaving little or no liquid crystalline order.  The polymerization kinetics in LLC systems are highly dependent on order, but the direct correlation between the polymerization rate and ultimate polymer nanostructure has not been explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The goal of this research is to use the speed of photopolymerization to predict and control the nanostructure produced in LLC systems.  Research will focus on reactive surfactant monomers that form LLC phases and both polar and non-polar monomers templated by nonreactive LLCs.  The photopolymerization of materials spanning a wide range of LLC phases will be monitored to understand changes that occur during polymerization.  Factors that may influence polymer morphology including LLC phase structure and stability, cross-link density, monomer polarity, and double bond location will be examined.  Radical photopolymerization provides the ability to polymerize in fractions of a second at a wide range of temperatures, thereby allowing kinetic trapping of otherwise thermodynamically unfavorable polymer nanostructures.  Polymers formed from both traditional chain and thiol-ene step growth polymerization mechanisms will be investigated.  With the importance of nanostructure in this project, a number of powerful characterization tools (polarized light microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy) will be used to elucidate polymer structure.  Photopolymerization kinetics and double bond conversion will be monitored in real-time using photo-differential scanning calorimetry, infra-red and Raman spectroscopy.  The results obtained will facilitate development of a complete model outlining the factors, both kinetic and thermodynamic, governing the ultimate polymer nanostructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: One of the most promising advances that could result with the recent emphasis on nanotechnology is the ability to control properties based on nano-scale architectures produced in organic polymers.  This work proposes methods to reproducibly produce nanostructures based on LLC geometries using the inherent speed of photopolymerization allowing control of polymer properties based on nanoscale geometries. If such control can be achieved, substantial advances in applications as diverse as separation technology, hydrogels, and tissue engineering could be realized. A prevailing theme will be student education. Extensive involvement of undergraduate and graduate researchers in a discovery learning environment will be emphasized. The PI has a strong record of including minority student researchers at both the graduate and undergraduate level.  At least one minority graduate student will directly participate in the proposed research, and minority undergraduate researchers will be recruited as part of the AGEP Summer Research Program at the University of Iowa.  Additionally, the importance of polymers in nanotechnology will be brought to high school students as part of a module presented by the PI to chemistry classes at both local and rural high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Polymers impact virtually every aspect of our lives. Often associated with plastics, they can also be found in coatings, drug encapsulation, cosmetics, clothes, and contact lenses to name a few examples. Polymers are simply long molecules with a large number of molecular repeating units called monomers. The process which chemically binds these multiple monomers together to form a polymer is called polymerization. In our work, growing polymers are linked to each other ("cross-linked") during polymerization to "lock in" the structure of the final material, often called a polymer network or gel. Polymerization induced by ultra-violet or visible light, or photopolymerization, is used in numerous applications, including dental resins for tooth cavity fillings. The goal of our research is to induce nano-organization into photopolymerized networks to enhance their inherent properties, such as transport properties or strength.  The structures we study are between 1 and 100 nanometers, which is 10,000 to 1,000,000 times smaller than a period on this page, or 10 to 1000 times smaller than bacteria. This nano-scale morphology is obtained by use of surfactants, small molecules with a hydrophilic (which likes water) head and a hydrophobic æoilyÆ tail. Surfactants are utilized in soaps and detergents to dissolve dirt and oils, which are usually hydrophobic, in water, thereby cleaning our hands, clothes or dishes. At high concentrations in water, surfactants may self-assemble into different types of nano-scale morphologies (i.e. hexagonally-packed cylinders, sponge-like or lamellar mesophases), segregating into continuous hydrophilic æaqueousÆ domain and organized discontinuous æoilyÆ domains. These self-assemblies are called lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs).  For this work, we have utilized LLCs as a polymerization template to produce nanoporous or nanostructured polymer networks (Image 1).  Unfortunately, the growing polymer often reorganizes during templating, and the nano-scale morphology of the parent self-assembly is not always retained. We have explored the role of the speed of polymerization, or polymerization kinetics to more precisely trap the polymer nanostructure before reorganization can occur, and thereby control the final morphology. We have seen that higher rates of polymerization allow much better retention of nanostructure. In fact, if the polymerization is faster than the reorganization of the growing polymer network, the morphology appears to be locked-in by the cross-linking of the system. These results also show why the inherently fast photopolymerization is needed to facilitate nanostructure when using LLC templates.  Additionally, we have demonstrated that the rate of polymerization of monomers is enhanced as order of the template increases (Image 2), which illustrates why some morphologies are more stable during polymerization than others. Further, we have found that the use of surfactant monomers and higher concentration of cross-linking monomers helps in stabilizing the template during polymerization and enhances retention of the nanostructure.  The control of nanostructure enabled by understanding and controlling the polymerization kinetics has a large effect on the polymer properties as well.  In most polymeric materials, improvements in one characteristic are usually counterbalanced with decreases in others.  When nanostructured hydrophilic gels (hydrogels) are produced using kinetically controlled photopolymeriation and LLC templating, however, synergistic enhancement of both transport and mechanical properties are observed.  Additionally, long-range nanopores of the material offer a more direct route for water, improving transport properties (see Image 3). As nutrient transport and the nanoroughness of the surface are enhanced, templated gels have shown greater cell attachment and faster biodegradation than their controls without nanostructure. These properties make nano-templated gels good candidates for bio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
