<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;New materials with novel open-framework structures will be synthesized from molecular building blocks such as individual metal atoms, metal complexes, and metal clusters. The metal centers will be linked by coordination to multidentate organic linkers such as polycarboxylates or  polyphosphonates. The cationic metal complexes, on the other hand, will be interconnected via extensive charge-assisted hydrogen bonding to organic disulfonates. Lastly, metal clusters such as the recently developed molbydenum-polyoxometalates have external phosphate or phosphonate groups that are readily available for covalent interlinking. The use of appropriate organic diphosphonates will bridge such clusters into frameworks with extra large openings resulting from the large size of the interconnected cluster nodes. The exchange properties of these open-framework materials as well as changes in their optical and magnetic properties that may occur upon such exchange of solvent molecules or charge-balancing cations will be addressed. The synthetic techniques, structure characterization, and properties measurements will provide opportunities for training graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge tools and methodologies for doing research in both solid-state chemistry and solution chemistry. The project, in combination with the existing University of Notre Dame infrastructure and programs for recruiting students from underrepresented groups, will be used to attract minority and female coworkers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to impact various important areas of the economy such as the development of new catalysts, new membrane materials for separation and ion exchange, petroleum cracking, nanotechnology, and optical and sensor materials. Many of these applications will, in turn, lead to better chemical processing and to higher energy-use efficiencies. An example is the potential use of these materials as safe and environmentally benign containers for gas storage and transportation. The broader impact of the project will be also on providing highly educated and practically trained Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows to advance high quality research at the forefront of science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
