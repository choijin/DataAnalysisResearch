    <AbstractNarration>The new generation of engineers/scientists in the US will determine the country's future success in the general field of innovation, the key ingredient for economic and educational success. Supporting students' travel expenses, and awards for best papers, will give the incentive needed to students who could otherwise not afford to attend the conference and interact with other researchers. Radio &amp; Wireless Symposium (RWS) is an IEEE leading interdisciplinary forum for the latest results in wireless technology, providing a unique comprehensive view of wireless field from system level design to implementation, particularly for commercial wireless communication systems, up to mm-wave frequencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The main goal and the award's impact are primarily educational, as these awards allow graduate students' participation in RWS 2007. This participation is an important part of the graduate school education. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more experienced researchers, and to be exposed with new areas of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;By promoting this activity, Radio &amp; Wireless Symposium (RWS) promotes not only education in wireless field inside a major conference but fosters the next generation of microwave engineers.</AbstractNarration>
