    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research project is concerned with the development of molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) and its application to in-cylinder engine flows. The proposed research is partly concerned with expanding an existing MTV system to enable measurements of three velocity components (instead of two components) in a planar region within a cylinder. Further, extension of MTV from nitrogen flows to airflows is proposed. Presence of oxygen in air reduces the fluorescent lifetime and poses challenges for MTV measurements. Novel solutions to this problem are proposed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed technology would enable more efficient and environmentally friendly IC engines and other combustion devices. This would help save fossil fuel energy and minimize air-borne pollutants. Additionally, research applications of the proposed MTV system would help improve modeling of engine flows and transport phenomena. The new computational tools would have wide applications in simulation of reacting flows throughout the process industry.</AbstractNarration>
