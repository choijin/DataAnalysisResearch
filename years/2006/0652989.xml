<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides support for the Berkeley Particle Data Center, the headquarters of the international Particle Data Group, whose primary task is to provide particle physicists with up-to-date compiled and evaluated particle-properties data, reviews, and other information they most frequently need. This information is made available to about 30,000 researchers, teachers, and students through the biennial publication of the "Review of Particle Physics" and the "Particle Physics Booklet," and through the annual publication on the Web. The Center provides World Wide Web access to the information in its publications and databases. The Center has a large impact in science education and awareness. The "Review" and "Booklet" are used by thousands of students and teachers. The Center collaborates on several educational projects, including the QuarkNet program, the Contemporary Physics Education Project, and the award-winning "Particle Adventure" website, and plays a leading role in the outreach program of the ATLAS Collaboration.  The Center's primary publication, the "Review of Particle Physics," is widely respected and is the most frequently quoted publication in particle physics, having been cited more than 15,000 times in the past decade. As a result, the Center's reviews remain an up-to-date, valuable, and cost-effective resource for the particle physics community.</AbstractNarration>
