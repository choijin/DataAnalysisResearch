    <AbstractNarration>This Phase I SBIR research project is directed to extending the unique 3D micro-fabrication capability of Multiphoton Induced Polymerization (MPP) technology to incorporate highly spatially selective metallization, in a three-dimensional micro-fabricated device or subsystem using a single-step fabrication process, fabricating the structure and defining the metallization sections simultaneously. Metallization and electrical conductivity are critical capabilities for any micro-fabrication technology in which the fabricated components are active elements. This creation of specific electrical paths throughout a microstructure is an intrinsic need for the extension of micro-fabrication to a truly monolithic scale of integrated components and systems by providing power delivery to components and control circuitry. The ability to do this in 3D structures enables a broad base of applications for micro-fabrication that are inaccessible with existing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is directed towards extending the fabrication capabilities of MPP to include the ability to selectively position metallic paths and surfaces within such structures simultaneously with the structure formation itself. MPP's material base of organic polymers can be used in electronic, semiconductor and photonic devices. This enhanced MPP has the potential to fabricate extremely high quality optically flat surfaces without the need for polishing.</AbstractNarration>
