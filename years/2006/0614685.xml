<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to understand sensory mechanisms allowing animals to chemically defend themselves against predators. Although much is known about chemical defenses in predator-prey interactions, studies of sensory mechanisms are rare.  This proposal asks, how does a single prey species defend itself against a diversity of predator species whose behavior and sensory systems are highly divergent?  The research will have impact because it will explain sensory mechanisms of chemical defense, from the behavioral to the molecular level.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will combine the use of two model systems.  The Aplysia sea hare serves as a model of neuroscience and chemical defenses.  The sea hare predators are the spiny lobster and sea catfish that serve as models in chemosensory neurobiology and behavior involving predators. This proposal builds on work where novel mechanisms of chemical defense and new candidate defensive molecules were identified from the ink and opaline defensive secretions of sea hares.  The proposal has four objectives: 1) Determine the sensory mechanisms of feeding aversive compounds in the opaline secretion of sea hares against spiny lobsters; 2) Determine the role of 'escapin', an L-amino oxide oxidase in sea hare ink and with antimicrobial activity; 3) Determine the ubiquity of phagomimicry and sensory disruption; and 4) Determine the molecular nature of the alarm cues in ink and opaline of sea hares - chemicals that cause sea hares to avoid ink from conspecifics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposal is to promote teaching and training of students through the participation of underrepresented groups in these research projects.  In addition, the project will provide outreach and public dissemination of information; deepen the relationship between those at GSU and the Georgia Aquarium; continue development of technologies associated with the patent on escapin; and enhance the infrastructure for research and education at GSU; and stiumlate activity with the NSF National Science and Technology Centerfor Behavioral Neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
