<AbstractNarration>AST-0650471&lt;br/&gt;McCray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernova 1987A: 20 Years After; Supernovae, and Gamma-Ray Bursters&lt;br/&gt;Aspen, Colorado, February 19th to the 23rd, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outburst of supernova (SN) 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud on February 23, 1987, the brightest SN in the past four centuries, has led to an enormous amount of research and has sparked the interest and imagination of the public.  This meeting is being held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of SN1987A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the broad SN 1987A research topics will be covered, including theories for the nucleosynthesis and explosion mechanisms, progenitor stars, pulsar and supernova remnant formation, interaction with the circumstellar medium, and particle acceleration mechanisms.  Observations at all available wavelengths, and in non-electromagnetic emissions, will be discussed in detail, and the conference will expand to include other supernovae, supernova cosmology, and gamma-ray bursters.  The core program will comprise review and invited talks from an international set of highly respected speakers.  There will be contributed talks and poster presentations, as well as a public lecture.  The concentration of astronomers and astrophysicists from all parts of the world and from all of the subspecialties of the field will lead to a better understanding of supernovae and gamma-ray bursters and their effects on all areas of modern astrophysics.  Significant US and international participation will strongly enhance the broader impact of this meeting.</AbstractNarration>
