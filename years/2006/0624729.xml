<AbstractNarration>The University of Hartford is requesting funding for a youth-based project that will serve 352 economically disadvantaged and underserved middle and high school youth in Hartford, CT. The project will enable participants to gain IT skills in computer engineering and web applications. Partners include the University of Hartford Center for Professional Development and Hartford Public Schools. During the first year students are "Explorers" and the content focus will encompass computer architecture, network systems, web design and communications. During Year 2 "Specialists" learn software development, advanced communications and business skills. Finally, in Year 3 students are "Entrepreneurs" and may provide computer skills training for community members at "Our IT," a business that is student-operated. "Our IT" will be located on the University of Hartford Asylum Avenue campus. Concurrently with the IT training, students receive career counseling and complete a business skills workshop that will enable them to design and develop "Our IT." Each summer participants will complete a four-week practicum in which they receive training in workforce skills, mentoring, A+ certification and participate in paid internships. Students will also produce a DVD on IT careers, a project website,  and learn to refurbish computers that are then donated to community members.</AbstractNarration>
