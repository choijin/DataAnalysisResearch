<AbstractNarration>The Midwest Dynamical Systems Seminar is a research conference series that has met for over thirty-five years. Typically it will meet once a year in the fall and this grant is to provide partial support for the participants for the next three years (Fall 2006-Fall 2008).  A typical conference lasts three days with about ten one-hour research lectures, but sometimes the conference is longer. Although regional in origin it is now a national institution. The conferences are held at a variety of universities, with future locations to be determined by a scientific advisory committee and it will be administered through the University of Cincinnati.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems is that branch of mathematics which describes the evolution of systems in time.  It grew out of the qualitative theory of differential equations and was strongly influenced by problems in mechanics, engineering and biology. At typical seminar will have talks on smooth dynamical systems, ergodic theory, celestial mechanics, mathematical biology etc.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
