    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this study is to develop the analytical models for the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of ZnO nanowires, nanobelts and nanosheets. We will study&lt;br/&gt;both the nonlinear single mode and the dual mode responses of these&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures subject to the electric field. These investigations will establish the&lt;br/&gt;link between the single crystal structure of ZnO and the nonlinear dynamics&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the nanostructures in nanowires, nanosheets and nanobelts. The study&lt;br/&gt;will lead to an exploration at a later stage of a series of different nanostructure&lt;br/&gt;oxides in different molecular structures for their behaviors in higher complexities,&lt;br/&gt;such as the coupled modal responses and chaotic synchronization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this research will push forward the sensor development in biochemistry and bioengineering, as well as for high precision instrumentation and field effect&lt;br/&gt;transistors, among others. Oxide-based nanostructures exist mostly in single crystal molecular structures. By a controlled growth mechanism, single-crystal semiconducting oxides in various forms of morphology have been synthesized, i.e. in the forms of&lt;br/&gt;nanowires, nanobelts, nanosheets and nanodiskettes as well as of nanorods. The&lt;br/&gt;diverse properties of the oxides show promise as future sensors in the areas of&lt;br/&gt;high precision scanning probes, gas sensors, and drug delivery carriers, as well as&lt;br/&gt;piezoelectric sensors and actuators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will focus on the nonlinear dynamics of the single crystal nanowire,&lt;br/&gt;nanobelt and nanosheet subject to an electric field. A series of Nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics models will establish the quantified relations between the&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures and their dynamic behaviors under the applied field. These&lt;br/&gt;analytical models for ZnO-based nanostructures will be used for sensor&lt;br/&gt;development and characterization.</AbstractNarration>
