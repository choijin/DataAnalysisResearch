<AbstractNarration>This award is to provide continued support for activities at the Institute for Theoretical&lt;br/&gt;Atomic and Molecular Physics (ITAMP) at Harvard/SAO. The activity has been and&lt;br/&gt;remains a resource for the theoretical atomic, molecular and optical physics community&lt;br/&gt;since 1988. The ITAMP has a world wide, competitive postdoctoral program, supports&lt;br/&gt;long and short term visitors and runs a number of workshops in forefront problems in&lt;br/&gt;AMO physics. ITAMP postdoctoral fellows have been the major source of junior faculty&lt;br/&gt;positions in theoretical AMO physics for the past ten years and have led to two senior&lt;br/&gt;appointments to Harvard physics and chemistry departments where these individuals&lt;br/&gt;can train some of the best and brightest students in AMO theory in the US.</AbstractNarration>

ITAMP  also invited several internationally renowned scientists to give joint  lectures with the Harvard Physics and Chemistry departments. ITAMP postdocs were  able to obtain faculty positions in the U.S. and the U.K. in physics and  chemistry, continuing on the long tradition of successful employment in  academia by ITAMP postdocs.
