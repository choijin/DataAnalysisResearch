<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the interplay between molecular biology, computer science, &lt;br/&gt;and evolution to probe a complex form of biological information processing: gene&lt;br/&gt;unscrambling in ciliated protozoa. A long-term goal is to develop a multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;approach to this problem that will enable us to tap into this biological process as a&lt;br/&gt;computational tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is the unique combination of three&lt;br/&gt;approaches experiments, computational biology, and modeling to improve our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the function, mechanism, and logic of this phenomenon. Because&lt;br/&gt;gene unscrambling in stichotrichous ciliates has the ability to assemble thousands of&lt;br/&gt;genes from tens of thousands of scrambled segments within a single genome, it is&lt;br/&gt;our opinion that DNA unscrambling in ciliates remains the most complex and&lt;br/&gt;spectacular, yet least explored, type of DNA computation known in biology. This&lt;br/&gt;proposal uses gene unscrambling as a model system to explore the mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;underlying complex gene and genome rearrangements, the steps through which&lt;br/&gt;these processes have evolved, and their capacity to solve hard computational&lt;br/&gt;problems in vivo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the prior NSF ITR award has been an influx of&lt;br/&gt;new ideas and direction from computational sciences into the study of a complex&lt;br/&gt;biological system of programmed DNA rearrangements in ciliated protozoa and&lt;br/&gt;training of a varied, interdisciplinary group of students. The broader impacts resulting&lt;br/&gt;from the proposed activity would be expansion of the current work and&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary student training, with even more synergy between different members&lt;br/&gt;of the group from the computational and experimental sides, with the ultimate goal of&lt;br/&gt;harnessing this process for the purpose of performing in vivo computation. The&lt;br/&gt;strength of the combined approach is its ability to recognize underlying quantitative&lt;br/&gt;principles, which would otherwise be missed in descriptive studies of gene&lt;br/&gt;unscrambling alone, and the continued building and refinement of a strong&lt;br/&gt;quantitative framework to understand this natural computing paradigm. This is&lt;br/&gt;especially germane as we enter the stage of post genomic data for ciliates,&lt;br/&gt;heightening the need for rigorous quantitative tools and analysis to understand how&lt;br/&gt;nature implements complex data structures in molecular biology. These studies of&lt;br/&gt;'BioWare' offer a glimpse into one of nature's attempts to explore the diverse range&lt;br/&gt;and capacity of modern genetic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
