<AbstractNarration> 0626741  Kamal&lt;br/&gt;High-performance networks are expected to support applications with multipoint traffic type, e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many. Since high-performance networks usually employ optical network infrastructures, and since most applications require sub-wavelength bandwidth, several streams are usually groomed on the same wavelength.  It is therefore important that such networks be designed in a way that is optimal in terms of cost, while effectively supporting this type of traffic.  This project deals with the design and analysis of survivable optical networks for multipoint traffic grooming.  The project considers the design of the traffic multiplexing equipment to support multipoint traffic grooming.  It also investigates the use of network coding and its implementation in such devices, and how such a technique can be used to reduce network implementation cost, enhance network traffic handling capabilities, and support network survivability.    Both static and dynamic traffic conditions are considered.  Optimal as well as accurate heuristic approaches will be developed for network design and operation under static traffic conditions.  Under dynamic traffic conditions, the dynamic provisioning of multipoint sessions, subject to the availability of resources, and the dynamic nature of sessions and users within sessions is considered, and algorithms to facilitate this provisioning will be developed.  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research includes the development of algorithms, which can be used by network designers and operators to support high performance applications efficiently.  It also includes training of students in the area of optical networks, as well as enhancing existing and creating new graduate and senior undergraduate-level courses.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
