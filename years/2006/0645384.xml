<AbstractNarration>Growing consensus views emotions as psychological mechanisms designed to shape cognition and behavior to meet adaptive challenges.  Although the functional role of many negative emotions in guiding behavior has been well established, similar evidence for the importance of positive emotions in shaping judgment and behavior in adaptive ways is only beginning to emerge.  Emerging evidence suggests that the functions of positive emotions may focus on challenges related to social interactions (e.g., building social support, trust, status). Embracing this view, the goal of the current project is to investigate the function of gratitude as a distinct positive emotion with respect to challenges presented by social exchange and relationship building.  To function adaptively, humans must regularly engage in social and economic exchange. Indeed, reciprocal giving and receiving of resources and support, whether physical, psychological, or fiscal, stands as a fundamental necessity for society to flourish.  Yet for all the potential benefits one might receive through exchange or cooperative actions, decisions to engage in such behaviors are fraught with risk.  Any exchange of resources entails not only the receipt, but also the offering, of goods or assistance, and in so doing, raises the potential for an asymmetric loss or gain.  To explain why humans engage in such risky and/or costly exchange behaviors, psychologists have historically pointed to the development of a social norm for reciprocity.  However, given the high adaptive value of social exchange, it is likely that such behaviors may also be shaped by specific emotional responses.  Gratitude, in particular, has been theorized to be sensitive to cost/benefit ratios.  If true, identification of gratitude as a mediator of such behaviors would be among the first evidence to demonstrate the existence of a discrete positive state designed to meet challenges associated with the building of social capital (i.e., supportive social relationships).  To investigate this theory, the current project consists of five experiments in which gratitude and other positive emotions will be manipulated through interpersonal interactions.  The effects of these manipulations on reciprocity (e.g., costly assistance provided to a benefactor) and measures of relationship building (e.g., trust, decreased self-interest in favor of a benefactor) will be assessed to determine the distinct role of gratitude.  In addition to scientific contributions, this project will advance scientific training of undergraduate and graduate students through their participation in data collection, analysis, and presentation at scientific meetings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
