<AbstractNarration>Jabbour&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0605039&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Morphological and compositional instabilities are of central&lt;br/&gt;importance in the study of nanocrystal growth.  In particular,&lt;br/&gt;controlling the onset and evolution of step bunching, meandering,&lt;br/&gt;and faceting, as well as phase segregation and chemical ordering&lt;br/&gt;during the growth of self-organizing films, paves the way to the&lt;br/&gt;systematic production of nanostructures, e.g., quantum wires and&lt;br/&gt;dots, various two-dimensional nanoscale patterns, etc.  The&lt;br/&gt;overall objective of this project is four-fold.  Its first part&lt;br/&gt;is concerned with a novel instability during single-species&lt;br/&gt;epitaxy that results from the presence of a nonstandard term, the&lt;br/&gt;jump in the terrace grand canonical potential, in the step&lt;br/&gt;evolution equations.  The goal here is to characterize this&lt;br/&gt;instability both in one and two dimensions and to determine if it&lt;br/&gt;can be offset by anisotropic step and terrace kinetics.  In the&lt;br/&gt;second part, the focus is on an instability triggered during the&lt;br/&gt;growth of binary compounds where surface chemistry plays a&lt;br/&gt;genuine role.  This instability differs from that resulting from&lt;br/&gt;the presence of impurities and is not due to an effective inverse&lt;br/&gt;Ehrlich--Schwoebel barrier for one of the two deposited species. &lt;br/&gt;Hence the need to better understand its underlying mechanisms and&lt;br/&gt;to identify, via phase diagrams, the unstable regimes in&lt;br/&gt;parameter-space.  The third part is based on experimental&lt;br/&gt;evidence of step faceting.  The goal there is to derive, in a&lt;br/&gt;dissipative setting, a thermodynamically consistent regularized&lt;br/&gt;model that captures the features of this faceting instability&lt;br/&gt;both during growth and sublimation.  This is followed by the&lt;br/&gt;numerical investigation of the resulting free-boundary problem&lt;br/&gt;via algorithms recently developed to tackle the problems of&lt;br/&gt;faceting and coarsening at the mesoscale.  The last part deals&lt;br/&gt;with intermixing, phase separation, and domain coarsening during&lt;br/&gt;the step-flow growth of multicomponent films, with emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;binary substitutional alloys.  In contrast with existing&lt;br/&gt;theories, the microstructure of the vicinal surface is explicitly&lt;br/&gt;accounted for.  Moreover, novel boundary conditions at the&lt;br/&gt;evolving steps are carefully derived and used to complement the&lt;br/&gt;Cahn--Hilliard PDE's that govern atomic bulk diffusion.  The&lt;br/&gt;proposed model captures the multifaceted physics (surface&lt;br/&gt;kinetics, bulk elasticity and atomic diffusion, phase separation,&lt;br/&gt;etc.) that underlies growth and is multiscale in that the film is&lt;br/&gt;modeled as a layered structure, a view that permits the&lt;br/&gt;resolution of the disparate length scales in the lateral and&lt;br/&gt;epitaxial directions.  Finally, its finite-element implementation&lt;br/&gt;yields much needed insight into the interplay between step flow&lt;br/&gt;and alloying/segregation/ordering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     With the advent of nanotechnologies, it has become feasible&lt;br/&gt;to manufacture devices at the nanoscale, from quantum computers&lt;br/&gt;to nano-electro-mechanical systems for biomedical applications. &lt;br/&gt;This has generated a wealth of experimental and theoretical work&lt;br/&gt;which, importantly, is interdisciplinary in nature, involving&lt;br/&gt;materials engineers, condensed-matter physicists, and applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians.  At the nanoscale, much more so than at the&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic one, theory is an indispensable guide to experiment&lt;br/&gt;by providing a sound basis for experimental observations and,&lt;br/&gt;more ambitiously, by predicting the behavior of material systems&lt;br/&gt;under experimentally uncharted conditions.   Of central&lt;br/&gt;importance are instabilities in the film morphology and&lt;br/&gt;composition, as they lead to the self-assembly of, e.g., quantum&lt;br/&gt;wires and dots.  Controlling these instabilities is therefore&lt;br/&gt;crucial to the production of various nanostructures.  This in&lt;br/&gt;turn requires a mathematical understanding of the physical and&lt;br/&gt;chemical mechanisms underlying the onset and evolution of&lt;br/&gt;instabilities.  The investigator develops and analyzes&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models showing the evolution of nanostructures in&lt;br/&gt;films of materials.  His effort combines mathematical modeling,&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and computation, and relies on knowledge of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying physics and thermodynamics.  The work has the&lt;br/&gt;potential of yielding a better understanding of growth&lt;br/&gt;instabilities.  Finally, the project involves the training of a&lt;br/&gt;doctoral student for whom this experience serves as an&lt;br/&gt;introduction to physical applied mathematics, mechanics, and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics of materials.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
