<AbstractNarration>Student Analysis of Data Driving Learning about the Earth (SADDLE): A Next Generation GLOBE Proposal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Student Analysis of Data Driving Learning about the Earth (SADDLE) project is providing GLOBE students and teachers with opportunities to conduct inquiry-based investigations related to watershed science.  The project is creating student-friendly interfaces that allow students to interact with the real-time and archived databases associated with the large-scale scientific observatory being constructed by the Consortium of Universities for Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI).  Specific topics being explored include the flow of water though a watershed, how human activities impact watersheds and vice versa, and land use impacts on watershed ecosystems.  Two new, open-ended science investigations will enable students to conduct investigations using CUAHSI and GLOBE data from their own watersheds.  In middle school grade levels, students will investigate the water budget for the watershed and developing data collection strategies to explore the origins of any flux imbalances in the system.  A more advanced study allows high school students to consider the impacts of land use changes on stream flow and the effects of urban and agricultural development on water quality.  Unlike many other GLOBE projects, the emphasis of this award is on data analysis and interpretation, rather than data collection.  New interfaces and visualization tools, including GIS techniques, are being customized to provide non-scientists with easy, seamless access to the CUAHSI and GLOBE databases, allowing students to conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis within the "Learning-for-Use educational context.  Both browser-based and desktop environment strategies (based on My World) are being developed, to accommodate the variable technological capabilities that exist at individual schools.  New learning activities that help students master the scientific content needed to conduct the open-ended investigations are also being created.  Hydrologic scientists at several institutions are providing content expertise during the design of these resources, which are being field-tested by a cohort of teachers before widespread dissemination.  Three types of professional development workshops (basic and advanced for teachers; outreach for CUAHSI personnel) will provide training on the use of these learning activities and watershed investigations during the dissemination phase of the award.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This project has taken a multi-faceted approach to bringing CUAHSI science and data into classrooms in support of Next Generation GLOBEÆs mission and education goals. The project has completed the following: 1)    designed scientific investigations for middle and high school grades that use GIS technology that support student inquiry through data analysis using live links to CUAHSI (&amp; GLOBE) data servers; 2)    conducted targeted outreach and professional development activities for middle and high school teachers and CUAHSI researchers including both live workshops and online courses; 3)    created an online community of practice connecting teachers with each other and scientists; 4)    engaged in software and data library development activities to assemble a suite of technological tools that provide a student-friendly "front end" for accessing and analyzing CUAHSI and GLOBE data; and 5)    conducted an evaluation to assess how well the project achieved its objectives and identify issues for future work.  We have demonstrated how web-based tools can connect teachers and scientists to support both professional development as well as the creation, sharing, and adaptation of high-quality, standards-aligned investigation activities.  Specifically, we have designed two open-ended science investigations that students can conduct using data for their own watershed. In the middle school level investigation of the water budget for a watershed, students are asked to calculate the water fluxes in the watershed system based on the hydrology data, identify any surpluses or deficits, attempt to explain any net difference, and develop a data collection plan to attempt to account for the difference.

The GIS tool for the first investigation is located at http://wd.fieldscope.org (U.S. data) and http://wdi.fieldscope.org (International data). The GIS tool for the second investigation may be found at: http://wd2.fieldscope.org.  A recent pilot test assessed the effectiveness of a student-scientist interactive Forum. We recruited three scientists to serve as the collaborative team of scientists who would introduce the FieldScope investigation and provide generalized feedback to students. They responded to biographical questions, posted an introduction to the activity online. After students submitted work, the scientists wrote a response, describing trends in student findings and explaining the connection of the activity to their own research projects.
