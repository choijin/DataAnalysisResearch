<AbstractNarration>Luc Rey-Bellet works in several directions in statistical mechanics,&lt;br/&gt;both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium. (a) The construction and the&lt;br/&gt;ergodic properties of stationary states for stochastic partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations arising from a model of a nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;Klein-Gordon equation coupled to one or several heat reservoirs.  (b)&lt;br/&gt;The validity of the fluctuation theorem for entropy production in some&lt;br/&gt;class of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, such as billiards. This&lt;br/&gt;involves the development of large deviations techniques for such&lt;br/&gt;systems. (c) The validity of the fluctuation theorem for the entropy&lt;br/&gt;production in classical and quantum open systems.  (d) The development&lt;br/&gt;of higher-order coarse-graining numerical schemes for Monte-Carlo&lt;br/&gt;methods.  Many fundamental problems in non-equilibrium statistical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics remain poorly understood, both at the conceptual and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical level: for example the characterization of non-equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;stationary states of driven open systems. The fluctuation theorem of&lt;br/&gt;Gallavotti and Cohen is a new universal property of these states and&lt;br/&gt;its study in various systems (deterministic, random and quantum) will&lt;br/&gt;be one of the main theme in the work of the investigator. Multiscale&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods and the general question of extracting the relevant&lt;br/&gt;degrees of freedom out of complex systems is a problem of paramount&lt;br/&gt;importance in modern applied mathematics.  The investigator proposes&lt;br/&gt;to use probabilistic techniques from statistical mechanics (cluster&lt;br/&gt;expansion and renormalization group) to develop efficient numerical&lt;br/&gt;schemes for the coarse-graining of Monte-Carlo methods.  The proposal&lt;br/&gt;of the investigator, besides its theoretical aspects, has a number of&lt;br/&gt;applications to various concrete physical models. These applications&lt;br/&gt;are integrated (via numerical or analytical work) into graduate&lt;br/&gt;research projects.  The project involves several collaborations with&lt;br/&gt;researchers in U.S. institutions and abroad. The project also helps to&lt;br/&gt;the dissemination of modern mathematical tools, in particular&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic ones, into applied sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of statistical mechanics is the physical and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theory which attempts to link the microscopic and macroscopic worlds.&lt;br/&gt;The microscopic world, the world of atoms and molecules, is described&lt;br/&gt;by the laws of Newtonian or Quantum mechanics which involve a huge&lt;br/&gt;number of equations. The macroscopic world on the contrary is usually&lt;br/&gt;described by a few parameters or equations, such as pressure,&lt;br/&gt;temperature, electrical and thermal conductivity, etc... This&lt;br/&gt;reduction comes from the fact that a very large number of particles,&lt;br/&gt;seen from through macroscopic lenses, behave in a very regular&lt;br/&gt;fashion. For example, in a well isolated room, the temperature&lt;br/&gt;throughout the room will be nearly constant. Another example is a&lt;br/&gt;piece of metal heated at one end and cooled at the other end: there&lt;br/&gt;will be a flow of energy from the hot part to the cold part but&lt;br/&gt;(almost) never in the opposite direction. This phenomena are similar,&lt;br/&gt;both in spirit and in mathematical terms to the following: if one &lt;br/&gt;throws an unbiased coin very many times then the proportion of head&lt;br/&gt;will be extremely close to one half and (almost) never exhibit&lt;br/&gt;significant deviations. It turns out that to study this typical&lt;br/&gt;behavior it is very useful to study and characterize the rare events&lt;br/&gt;corresponding to untypical behavior, i.e., "large deviations". Having&lt;br/&gt;a detailed understanding of the atypical behavior of a very large&lt;br/&gt;number of particles is in fact the clue to a fundamental understanding&lt;br/&gt;of what is really typical. Theses ideas, which go back to the founding&lt;br/&gt;fathers of physics and probability theory, and their implementations&lt;br/&gt;in various physical situations form the core of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
