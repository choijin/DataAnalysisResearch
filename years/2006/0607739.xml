<AbstractNarration>AST-0607739&lt;br/&gt;Kulkarni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evolution of galaxies and the production of chemical elements in the Universe are fundamental issues in astrophysics and cosmology.  A powerful tool for tracing the evolution of stars, gas, and metals in galaxies is provided by the spectral lines of damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorbers that lie along the sightlines to quasars.  Fundamental tests of galaxy evolution models come from constraining the cosmic density of metals and stars in galaxies.  At present, DLA observations contradict the predictions of most cosmic chemical evolution models.  However, the existing low-redshift samples are still relatively small, and include far too few sub-DLAs or dusty DLAs, and there have been very few high-resolution imaging studies of the absorbers.  This project will investigate these issues by obtaining high-resolution spectroscopic and imaging observations for a large sample of low-redshift DLAs and sub-DLAs with known neutral hydrogen column densities.  This will provide fundamental tests of galaxy evolution models by constraining the cosmic density of metals and stars in galaxies.  This research will use publicly available archival data as well as new data to be obtained at state-of-the-art facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational benefits accrue from the research training of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of South Carolina, in a region with very few astronomers, and especially very few minority or women astronomers.  Thus, the program provides unique career advancement, recruiting, and mentoring opportunities for under-represented groups.  The Principal Investigator will also continue active development of new graduate and upper level undergraduate courses, and her extensive outreach activities through the USC Melton Observatory and the South Carolina State Museum.</AbstractNarration>
