<AbstractNarration>   Abstract&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0601994&lt;br/&gt;SCHOONEN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hurricane Katrina caused wide spread flooding in New Orleans and surrounding&lt;br/&gt;Parishes. Sediment deposited in the affected area contains as much as 5 weight %&lt;br/&gt;framboidal pyrite. The pyrite in the sediment is in a respirable size fraction. As the sediment is drying out and the cleanup and rebuilding effort gets underway, workers and citizens returning to the area may be exposed to framboidal pyrite via inhalation. Recent work has shown that pyrite produces hydrogen peroxide spontaneously and decomposes nucleic acids (RNA and DNA). Human lung cells exposed to pyrite show the production of hydrogen peroxide within the cell as well as cytokines, which are a signature of inflammation of the cell. These recent results give rise to a concern that workers and returning citizens may experience adverse health effects as they are exposed to the sediment during the clean up and reconstruction effort.&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed study, sediments collected and characterized by the USGS, will be tested for their ability to produce hydrogen peroxide, decompose nuclei acids, and disregulate human lung cells. In addition, the trace metal concentration and their distribution in framboidal pyrite will be determined using synchrotron-based XRF. The study will be tightly integrated with the ongoing effort by the USGS team, led by collaborator Dr. Geoff Plumlee.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The proposed study will provide a rapid first assessment of the cytotoxcity of the sediment deposited as a result of the hurricane-related flooding.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work also provides a blue print for future studies involving other earth materials.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The specific results of the work may be of use to local officials in the affected area and provide guidance on the possible health effects of the sediment.&lt;br/&gt;Long-term medical studies will need to be conducted to determine the impact of exposure to the muck, but the results of this study will provide a useful rapid first assessment. The proposed study integrates concepts and techniques from the fields of geochemistry and biochemistry. The integration of these fields will provide new avenues of research for geochemists and attract students with an interest in health-related problems to the&lt;br/&gt;Geosciences. The results of this work will be published as joint publications with the&lt;br/&gt;USGS. The results will also be presented in a lecture for the general public in November 2005 and at an upcoming short course in 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
