<AbstractNarration>Shvydkoy&lt;br/&gt;0604050&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Instability of fluid motion is the main subject of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal. Although it was a classical and rather experimental&lt;br/&gt;branch of the hydrodynamics in the early days, it now stands as&lt;br/&gt;an actively developing area of modern analytical fluid dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;and it provides many challenging problems to mathematicians. The&lt;br/&gt;motion of an ideal incompressible fluid is governed by the Euler&lt;br/&gt;equation. Because of the particular structure of the nonlinearity&lt;br/&gt;present in the equation it appears to be notoriously difficult to&lt;br/&gt;answer even the most basic questions in a rigorous mathematical&lt;br/&gt;way. One of these questions is to justify the Lyapunov&lt;br/&gt;linearization method for stationary fluid flows. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;if the Euler equation linearized about a given equilibrium has&lt;br/&gt;unstable spectrum, does this imply that the equilibrium is&lt;br/&gt;unstable in the nonlinear sense, say, in the basic energy norm?&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies this and other questions related to&lt;br/&gt;instability and spectra. These include: the question of finding&lt;br/&gt;unstable shortwave perturbations for general fluid flows;&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the spectrum for the Euler equations and the&lt;br/&gt;relationship with the spectrum of weakly viscous flows in the&lt;br/&gt;limit of vanishing viscosity. The investigator examines these&lt;br/&gt;problems using modern WKB-type asymptotic analysis for the Euler&lt;br/&gt;equations, pseudo-differential calculus, as well as newly&lt;br/&gt;developed connections between the cocycle theory and fluid&lt;br/&gt;dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The questions addressed in this particular project are&lt;br/&gt;closely related to the fundamental problems of environmental&lt;br/&gt;science such as weather prediction, climate change, and oceanic&lt;br/&gt;motion. Instability of large fluid masses is inherent in the&lt;br/&gt;nature of those processes, while large scale instabilities often&lt;br/&gt;grow out of small scales. The investigator presents mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;for such small scale instabilities and gives them a precise&lt;br/&gt;mathematical description. Understanding instabilities in fluid&lt;br/&gt;flows is important for a broad range of questions in atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;science and geophysics.</AbstractNarration>
