<AbstractNarration>For the first time, a Doctoral Consortium is being held at the Human Language Technology conference - North American chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics annual meeting (HLT-NAACL) 2006 in New York City on June 4, 2006.  The event is designed for Ph.D. students who are in the last few years of their doctoral program (who have settled on a research direction and have typically submitted a thesis proposal).  Participants will submit an application containing an overview of their research, and they will be selected based on a review process involving both students and established researchers in the area.  The participating students will reflect the variety of research areas of the HLT/NAACL conference (natural language processing, speech processing, and information retrieval) and reflect a diversity of students in groups underrepresented in science and engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The event will provide an opportunity for a group of senior Ph.D. students to discuss their research and career objectives with a panel of established researchers.  The event is also an opportunity for students to gain exposure for their work among the HLT/NAACL research community (especially from professionals outside of their thesis committee).  Students will also attend professional development sessions and present their work to a broader audience during a poster session held during the main HLT/NAACL conference.  The event has also been primarily organized and run by students -- providing all the students involved with invaluable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with senior researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
