<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The proposed experiment-based study will add to the understanding of the interplay between the nano- and micro-morphology of polymeric crystallization of carbon nanofiber (NF) and carbon nanotube (NT) reinforced polymer composites (NRPC).  Studies will be conducted to elucidate how the interactions between the NF or NT and polymer matrix account for morphological changes therefore affecting specific macro- properties.  The outstanding properties observed for NRPC have gained much attention and have prompted a need for more studies of their morphological behavior given the vast number of different utilized processes and potential applications that result in different nano-micro-structures.  Reinforcements, and especially in the nanoscale can significantly alter the nano/micro morphology of the polymeric matrix and add up to the complexity of the existing microstructural studies. Nanoscale reinforcements present a challenging area given that due to the large total interfacial area, it is likely that the interface will be formed by unexpected structural conformations. These types of morphologies change material properties resulting in the need of new theories and/or interpretations for observed (or expected) macroscopic behavior.  The composite properties depend strongly on the developed new morphology which given the outstanding electrical and thermal properties of the CNF and CNT is prone to be also altered by electromagnetic radiations and heat related applications. The results obtained from this grant, will advance the fundamental knowledge on principles of composite material behavior to promote reliability on exciting macro-properties for a vast number of potential applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Nano reinforced polymer composites (NRPC) have now been widely studied given their interesting properties and therefore potential high-technological applications. Given that the technology pathway is now moving into the manufacturing of tools and structures where the developed NRPC composite materials can be applied, it is imperative to understand the effect that differences in processing techniques and environmental related issues will have on the nano-microstructure and therefore on the reliability of the materials. This will promote a more systematic development for processing of materials with tailored properties for high technological applications that will impact the efficiency of systems and will provide enhanced performance, reliability, and safety. Prior funding to Dr. Lozano has allowed the development of a strong research group that has greatly enhanced UTPAs (non PhD institution, Hispanic population of &gt;85%, located in the 4th fastest growing US region with 89% Hispanic population) research vision and has promoted student and faculty research development. Dr. Lozano has and will continue (with this grant) to promote high quality research, especially in areas of national importance such as engineering. She provides opportunities for undergraduates to conduct state of the art research in emerging technologies. Dr. Lozano is highly committed to the community and recognizes (and had witnessed) that the development of a successful engineer spreads out to all members of their family and therefore to the community in general. A high percentage of Dr. Lozanos research assistants (95% Hispanics) have enrolled in graduate programs increasing therefore the number of underrepresented minorities in the science and engineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
