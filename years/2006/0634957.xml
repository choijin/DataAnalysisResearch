<AbstractNarration>Spectral Graph Theory or Algebraic Graph Theory, as it is also known,&lt;br/&gt;is the study of the relationship between the eigenvalues and&lt;br/&gt;eigenvectors of graphs and their combinatorial properties. Random&lt;br/&gt;walks on graphs, expander graphs, clustering, and several other&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial aspects of graphs are intimately connected to their&lt;br/&gt;spectral properties.  Recent approaches to the analysis of&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional data have exploited the fundamental eigenvectors of&lt;br/&gt;the data. These data sets are large and ever increasing requiring&lt;br/&gt;``real-time" accurate responses to the given queries. This creates the&lt;br/&gt;need for very fast algorithms, that also provide strict theoretical&lt;br/&gt;guarantees on their output. Spectral techniques have been applied to image&lt;br/&gt;processing, both by computers and in the primary visual cortex of&lt;br/&gt;monkeys.  Critical component to all these application is algorithms&lt;br/&gt;with efficiency and accuracy guarantees for solving these linear system&lt;br/&gt;and finding their fundamental  eigenvectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multidisciplinary team consisting of Theoretical Computer&lt;br/&gt;Scientists, Machine Learning Scientist, and Neuroscientist will&lt;br/&gt;develop and apply spectral graph theory to applications from data&lt;br/&gt;mining to clustering, and image processing.  Enabling technology&lt;br/&gt;develop will include: 1) linear-work or O(m log m)-work algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that run in poly-logarithmic parallel time for computing extreme&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues and generalized eigenvalues of diagonally-dominant&lt;br/&gt;matrices, including Laplacian matrices, as well as algorithms of&lt;br/&gt;similar complexity for solving the related linear systems. 2) Better&lt;br/&gt;estimates for Fiedler values and generalized Fiedler values.&lt;br/&gt;Application development: 1) Improvements in spectral image&lt;br/&gt;segmentation. 2) The use of generalized eigenvalues in data mining and&lt;br/&gt;image segmentation to combine multiple sources of information. 3) The&lt;br/&gt;use of preconditioners for approximate inference in graphical models.&lt;br/&gt;and 4) Combine insights into the problem of image segmentation gained&lt;br/&gt;from spectral algorithms with knowledge gained from recent experiments in visual system&lt;br/&gt;of monkeys to better understand how the primary visual cortex functions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
