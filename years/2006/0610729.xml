    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the development of unique, graphite-organic matrix materials for application as a thermal interface material (TIM) for use in high power electronics packaging. The research objective of this project is the development of an understanding of the relationship between the physical design of the proposed graphite-organic TIM and its resultant mechanical properties and thermal performance. The proposed graphite-organic TIM technology is expected to have a thermal resistance that is up to 10X lower than current TIMs. This SBIR Phase I project will develop the fundamental understanding of the basic design know-how as well as the thermal and mechanical characteristics for the proposed graphite-organic TIM technology for use in high temperature, high power electronics packaging. The properties of graphite-organic matrix TIM materials are not well understood. This research will establish the fundamental relationship between the graphite-organic TIM design and its performance. The research will produce the key design and performance knowledge required to enable a graphite-organic TIM that meets the high thermal performance, low-cost requirements of a variety of commercial electronic packages. The resulting graphite-organic TIM technology will have superior thermal performance compared to currently used TIMs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, the proposed technology will be key in accelerating the adoption and commercialization of high temperature, high power electronic packages based on next generation wide band gap semiconductor technology. The adoption and wide-spread use of the higher performance graphite-organic TIMs for use with the high temperature, high power semiconductor materials will support the development of commercial products that are more efficient and will provide benefits to society in the form of reduced energy consumption and improved environmental quality.</AbstractNarration>
