<AbstractNarration>Structural biology -- the determination and analysis of macromolecular structures in relation to their biological functions -- rests not only on its core experimental methodologies but also on the computational approaches that make it possible to collect and interpret the relevant data. A primary objective of the SBGrid Research Coordination Network (RCN) is to provide a uniform level of computing grid access and software availability to all structural-biology groups, including those in geographically underrepresented communities and smaller universities. The RCN will consolidate the high-performance computing resources of a large number of participating laboratories and build a bridge between the structural biology and the physical-sciences communities, through federation with Open Science Grid. The award will enhance the capacity of individual laboratories to solve challenging and ambitious structural biology problems, particularly ones that require use of multiple experimental technologies. The network will adapt a number of structural?biology applications to take advantage of grid resources and contemporary hardware technologies. It will encourage development of parallelized, grid-compatible software in affiliated laboratories, and will coordinate their installation, testing, and distribution. In this connection, the RCN will also support short courses in computer programming for structural biologists. By enabling access to a wide array of institutions and investigators, this RCN will have significant broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

The RCN also pursued exploratory projects. To assist developers with selecting appropriate software licenses, we developed a set of guidelines and published them as a quick guide (Morin et al., PLoS Computational Biology, 2012). We also worked with a number of prominent software creators to develop a proposal that would pave out a number of concrete steps that funders, publishers and research institutions should adapt to support community-wide dissemination, sharing, and publication of scientist-created software and source code  (Morin et al., Science, 2012). Moreover, in collaboration with synchrotron beamlines, we developed a prototype system for managing experimental data (Stokes-Rees et al., JSR, 2012). Such a system would complement the existing Protein Data Bank repository of macromolecular structures and would address the data management struggles of the structural biology community.  In addition to the infrastructure and methods development activities, the RCN completed a number of educational activities that were geared towards students and structural biologists at large.
