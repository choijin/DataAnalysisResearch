    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project will develop and commercialize a new paradigm for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) manufacturing process. ALD provides unparalleled quality and thickness control, however its low deposition rates (~1 nm/min) preclude ALD from competing with conventional thermal and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD/PECVD) techniques in a number of markets. Based on fundamental reactor engineering principles the standard PECVD process has been engineered to provide ALD control through pulsed power modulation. This approach dramatically simplifies ALD processing by eliminating both purge steps and the need for mechanical flow rate actuation. Since purging comprises 50-90% of a typical ALD cycle, deposition rate enhancements of up to an order of magnitude may be achieved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALD is a rapidly expanding business fueled by its importance in the manufacture of vital electronic components such as organic light emitting diodes and thin film transistors. In addition, the use of ALD in integrated circuit manufacturing will undoubtedly expand as the industry strives to keep up with Moore's Law. The process simplifications and rate enhancements provided by the proposed approach will strengthen these areas and open new markets such as barrier coating in applications ranging from food packaging to&lt;br/&gt;medical instrumentation.</AbstractNarration>
