<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I research project combines 3-D computer graphics and gaming technology to provide a non-linear, immersive learning environment for science education in the human anatomy and physiology domain. Modern computer-simulations present a unique ability to present scientific information in an easy to understand manner. Technology advances in computer graphics present opportunities to present higher quality visual models in an interactive fashion that can convey the scientific process in a way which makes learning science fun and interesting for the students while capturing their enthusiasm for science. The proposed toolkit will consist of 3-D visualizations for teaching human anatomy and physiology and interactive simulation environments for exploring the human body from a first person point of view. Simulation will be used in conjunction with traditional lecture while the interactive environments will provide immersive reinforcement learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will play a role in increasing achievement and interest in science. In order for the nation to remain competitive in the life science industries, the nation must produce an adequate number of students who pursue degrees in life sciences. Recent years have seen a disturbing drop in United States' student interest in pursuing science education and careers. At the same time, demand for science-based degrees is rapidly increasing in the labor market. The proposed research is targeted at improving students' interest and achievement in science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
