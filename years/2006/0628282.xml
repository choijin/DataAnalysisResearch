<AbstractNarration>0628282 &lt;br/&gt;Spear&lt;br/&gt;The feasibility of up-scaling the generation of single-cell protein (SCP) from wastewater from the food-processing industry for use as food in aquaculture will be evaluated in this project funded by the Materials Use: Science, Engineering and Society program. The project includes three tasks: (1) development of a SCP-production apparatus; (2) assessment of human and social impacts of the technology in Mexico, India and Bangladesh, where great potential for adoption of the technology is expected; and (3) economic analysis of the concept in one of the test countries. This multi-disciplinary project addresses an important topic and effectively integrates the various tasks to be performed. The project involves working in remote areas of developing nations in Latin America and south Asia, which involves some risk and cultural challenges, but this is mitigated by the experience of the researchers, strong connections to a prominent NGO, and a well-developed implementation plan. The proposed work has potentially positive societal Impacts in that it will convert a waste stream into a beneficial product for another food production process and could be implemented in many countries around the world. The project fits within the goals of the MUSES program in that it involves materials use with reduction of environmental impact. It is intended to reduce environmental impacts of a major and growing global economic activity (aquaculture) and also reduce waste streams from beer brewing. The range of disciplines involved in the study is appropriate, and intellectual diversity is strong. The proposed work is quantitative, especially in the economic and social components. This project is being co-managed by the BES (lead) and CMS Divisions.</AbstractNarration>
