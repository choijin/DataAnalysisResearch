<AbstractNarration>The investigator applies emerging computational methods in circle&lt;br/&gt;packing to study conformal structures on surfaces, with particular&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on complex, nonplanar surfaces.  The global realization of&lt;br/&gt;conformal structures which are local in nature is known classically as&lt;br/&gt;uniformization. Circle packing methods have led to notions of discrete&lt;br/&gt;uniformization which both mimic and approximate the classical notion.&lt;br/&gt;However, the geometric nature of the discretization raises&lt;br/&gt;computational issues outside traditional numerical mathematics. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, uniformization is a self-assembly process which is&lt;br/&gt;extremely challenging in practice --- for instance, with circle&lt;br/&gt;packings containing millions of circles. In the central computational&lt;br/&gt;work, the investigator implements a recursive framework for managing&lt;br/&gt;this self-assembly which avoids global distortions while accommodating&lt;br/&gt;efficient parallel implementation. The computational issues are not&lt;br/&gt;considered in isolation, but rather in relation to ongoing&lt;br/&gt;applications by the investigator and his collaborators to topics&lt;br/&gt;including brain imaging, conformal tiling, dessins d'enfants, and&lt;br/&gt;conformal welding. Of the many theoretical issues raised in&lt;br/&gt;applications and experiments, the investigator pays special attention&lt;br/&gt;to the notion of ``flow uniformization'' and to its potential use in&lt;br/&gt;discrete conformal welding and shape analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surfaces --- a smooth soap film, the convoluted gray matter of the&lt;br/&gt;brain, a faceted crystal lattice --- are ubiquitous in the natural and&lt;br/&gt;physical sciences, engineering, computer visualization, and scores of&lt;br/&gt;other areas. The tools for studying and describing surfaces&lt;br/&gt;mathematically came out of work in the nineteenth century, with a&lt;br/&gt;particularly rich geometric vein associated with angular measure going&lt;br/&gt;by the name "conformal structure". Among the most celebrated results in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics is the Riemann mapping theorem of 1851 which proved that&lt;br/&gt;every surface with a conformal structure, no matter how complicated,&lt;br/&gt;can be identified with one of three very simple familiar surfaces&lt;br/&gt;--- a ball, a plane, or a disc --- in a way that preserves conformal&lt;br/&gt;structure, that is, that preserves angles. Wonderful as this theory&lt;br/&gt;is, and despite the availability of huge computational resources, it&lt;br/&gt;has been only in the last decade that new mathematics in the form of&lt;br/&gt;circle packing has provided a practical means for actually realizing&lt;br/&gt;Riemann's theorem. The investigator develops the mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational aspects of circle packing in the context of several&lt;br/&gt;applications. Among these are the flattening of human brain cortical&lt;br/&gt;surfaces to aid analysis by neuroscientists, the study of plane&lt;br/&gt;shapes through a process known as conformal welding for use in&lt;br/&gt;computer vision, and the construction of mathematical Riemann surfaces&lt;br/&gt;in various topics which are now amenable to experimentation&lt;br/&gt;for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
