<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: 10th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference:  Student Scholarships&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0628832&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:    Kathryn E. Parent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:    Green Chemistry Institute (American Chemical Society)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF and the Green Chemistry Institute (American Chemical Society) have partnered with EPA and other federal agencies over the past several years to support the annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference. The meeting focuses on scientific approaches that are essential for the design, development, and implementation of chemical processes and products that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances in a way that is both feasible and economically viable.  Green chemistry and engineering are important tools in preventing pollution at the source and in providing solutions to long-term global environmental challenges.&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding for student participation at the 10th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference, June 26-30, 2006, at the Capital Hilton in Washington D.C.  The theme of the meeting is "Designing for a Sustainable Future.  The program will include important emphasis areas such as cutting-edge research in green chemistry and green engineering, education, metrics, making the business case, and safety and security.  Technical talks will be given in areas such as catalysis, process design, bio-based materials, renewable feedstocks, sustainable energy and agriculture systems, alternative solvents and systems, innovations in the pharmaceutical industry, water technologies, toxicology, green nanotechnology, industrial applications, alternative synthesis, and design of safer materials.  The conference will feature plenary speakers, expert panelists from industry, government, and academia, and paper/poster presentations.  Topics involving fundamental scientific and engineering advances related to green chemistry will be presented by faculty and student participants.&lt;br/&gt;The broader technical impacts of the conference are significant since green chemistry and engineering are important tools in preventing pollutions at the source and in providing solutions to long-term global environmental challenges.  The meeting is highly interdisciplinary and provides students with an excellent opportunity to present their research.  A diverse group of students from geographical locations across the United States has typically attended this meeting.  All NSF-sponsored have been involved in oral or poster presentations.  Students have an excellent opportunity to learn about the newest research developments in their areas, dialog with other academic, industrial, and governmental researchers, and advance their participation in professional societies. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
