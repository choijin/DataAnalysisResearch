    <AbstractNarration>AST-0602290&lt;br/&gt;Groppi, Christopher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Groppi is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Arizona, where he will participate in the development of leading-edge submillimeter-wave spectroscopic imaging arrays. These arrays will be used to survey the Galactic Plane in several important astrophysical lines to better understand the life cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, Dr. Groppi will lead the instrument team for SuperCam, which will be an order of magnitude larger than any existing spectroscopic imaging array at submillimeter wavelengths. Exceptional mapping speed, combined with the efficiency and angular resolution of the Heinrich Hertz Telescope, will make SuperCam a uniquely-powerful instrument for probing the history of star formation in our Galaxy and the distant Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Groppi will also re-commission the Steward Observatory Student Radio Telescope (SRT) to bring the same science and engineering synergy of the SuperCam project to undergraduate and secondary students. With a team of undergraduate astronomy, physics and engineering students, he will upgrade the electronic and computer control systems in the SRT and construct a Java-based web browser plug-in that will allow secure remote operation of the SRT with data display and analysis capability. This will allow access to the SRT by thousands of secondary school and university students around the country and the world.</AbstractNarration>
