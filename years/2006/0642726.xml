    <AbstractNarration>The 2007 Cold Spring Harbor Conference on Plant Genomes will be held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, from March 15 through March 18, 2007. This is the sixth in a series of scientific conferences on plant genomes; the earlier meetings were held in 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004. This meeting will focus on functional and evolutionary genomics in a diverse range of plants, and will serve to explore themes and technologies from other genomes including those of animals and fungi. It is hoped that this meeting will provide a mechanism for the establishment of new collaborations, and a forum for discussing new experimental and conceptual approaches. The conference will be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on March 15 to 18, 2007. Twenty-four speakers of international renown have agreed to give oral presentations, and approximately thirty others will be selected from submitted abstracts from applicants to the meeting. The conference will include three keynote addresses, a number of invited talks and approximately 25 talks chosen from openly submitted abstracts, as well as a resource workshop. At least one poster session will be included in the schedule to encourage meaningful participation by those attendees not giving talks. Approximately 150 scientists are expected at the meeting. The organizers have included plans for the broad representation of women, minority, and next-generation scientists.</AbstractNarration>
