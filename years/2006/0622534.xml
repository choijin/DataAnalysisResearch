<AbstractNarration>Economics (82) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economics is a critical component of the undergraduate curriculum, and the integration of experiments into economics courses has proven beneficial in helping students to learn microeconomics principles.  Such experiments enable undergraduates to reflect on their responses to economic incentives and on the role of institutional arrangements, thus gaining a deeper understanding of economic models than they have acquired using less-interactive learning environments. However, many institutions lack the resources to develop their own dedicated experimental economics facilities.  Building on work to develop EconPort, an economics digital library, this project is undertaking a national effort to disseminate experiments to hundreds of instructors from a diverse set of two- and four-year colleges around the country.  Instructors learn about the experiments, and how to integrate them into their courses, at workshops that are held primarily in conjunction with economics conferences around the country.  Formative project evaluation is informing the development and presentation of the workshop materials; summative evaluation addresses the efficacy of the workshops and how the use of economics experiments shapes successful teaching strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
