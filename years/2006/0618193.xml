<AbstractNarration>Global sustainability and human prosperity ultimately depend on biodiversity and ecosystem services that result from ecological functions such as primary productivity and nutrient cycling.  With accelerating biodiversity loss worldwide, it is critically important to understand how biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) are related.  However, current knowledge is incomplete because almost all BEF studies so far have been conducted in artificial grasslands, focusing solely on plants.  This project will directly manipulate plant diversity in large-scale experimental plots and measure a number of ecosystem function variables to test existing BEF and evaluate new hypotheses regarding ecosystem function for multiple trophic levels (plants, herbivores, and soil microbes) in the Inner Mongolian Grassland, part of the largest natural grassland in the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will permit a better assessment of potential impacts of future global and local biodiversity loss.  It will also improve management practices for arid and semi-arid ecosystems.  The project will provide exceptional educational, cultural, and research experiences for US and Chinese scientists and students, and contribute to the development of a globally engaged workforce.  Finally, it will help establish a long-term scientific platform in the Inner Mongolia Grassland for US-China collaborations on ecological research and sustainability science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collaborative Research:  Testing Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning Relationships in an Ecological Stoichiometry Framework in the WorldÆs Largest Natural Grassland     Principal Investigators  Jianguo (Jingle) Wu (PD, Arizona State University)  James Elser (Arizona State University)  Shahid Naeem (Columbia University)     Global sustainability and human prosperity ultimately depend on biodiversity and ecosystem services that result from ecological processes and functions such as primary productivity, nutrient cycling, and soil formation.  With accelerating biodiversity loss worldwide, it is critically important to understand how biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) are related.  However, current knowledge is incomplete partly because most BEF studies have been conducted in artificial grasslands in geographically rather limited areas, focusing primarily on plants.  This project &ndash; Inner Mongolia Grassland Removal Experiment (IMGRE) &ndash; examined biodiversity and ecosystem functioning relationships involving plants, insects, and domestic grazing animals in the worldÆs largest natural grassland.  Specifically, IMGRE directly manipulated plant diversity in large-scale field experimental plots and measured a number of ecosystem function variables to test existing BEF and ecological stoichhiometry theory, and evaluate new hypotheses regarding ecosystem function for multiple trophic levels (plants, herbivores, sheep, and soil microbes).      The IMGRE project is the only BEF experiment that simultaneously employed two parallel biodiversity removal schemes: complete vs partial (equal disturbance) removal protocols.  While exceedingly labor-intensive, this provides a unique opportunity to directly compare and contrast how these two removal experimental approaches.  It provides new lights on our understanding of the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning relationship.  For example, decreasing plant functional diversity (i.e., the number of functional groups through the complete removal scheme) led to significant reductions in ecosystem productivity and increases in its variability, whereas removing certain members of plant functional groups (i.e., the partial removal scheme) had smaller effects on ecosystem productivity and its variability.  For the complete removal, changes in aboveground biomass depended on functional richness, identity, and PFG composition of the community; for the partial removal, patterns of aboveground biomass change were similar among treatments.  Several important findings were discovered from this project concerning the effects of grasshoppers on plant biomass, production, and elemental stoichiometry in the Inner Mongolia grassland.  For example, we demonstrated significant grazing impacts that differentially affected biomass and C:N:P ratios of aboveground biomass.  Also, we were able to relate stoichiometric ratios of plants and insects in the context of BEF relationships.  Among the most important results was the finding that the degree of stoichiometric regulation in the C:N:P ratios of various plant species was highly correlated with their temporal and spatial stability while the overall dominance of different taxa with different degrees of stoichiometric homeostasis was associated with community-level production and stability.  In addition, the project produced some exciting results on the effects of grasshopper density, plant quality, and nitrogen cycling on dynamics and performance of the Asian locust.      The results of this study are useful for assessing potential impacts of human land use activities and global climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functions particularly in dryland regions.  They are also helpful for improving management practices for arid and semi-arid ecosystems.  The project has provided exceptional educational, cultural, and research experiences for US and Chinese scientists and students, and contributed to the development of a globally engaged workforce. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
