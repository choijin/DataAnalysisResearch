<AbstractNarration>5th International Conference on Photo-Excited Processes and Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for the NSF Web Site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5th International Conference on Photo-Excited Processes and Applications (ICPEPA) will take place in Charlottesville, Virginia, in September 2006.  5-ICPEPA will bring together an interdisciplinary group of materials scientists, engineers, physical scientists, and biologists and will create an environment for active exchange of knowledge and ideas in the rapidly evolving research field of photo-excited processes and applications.  The forefront of the research into the fundamentals and applications of laser-matter interactions will be identified and current research needs and shortcoming will become more apparent.  The conference will feature 16-18 invited lectures given by established leaders in the field and bright young researchers, as well as approximately 140-170 contributed oral and poster presentations.  The traditionally broad representation of researchers from around the globe will be maintained as the ICPEPA makes its debut in the United States.  Approximately half of the delegates to the conference are expected to be international participants.&lt;br/&gt;The NSF funding of travel grants to US students and young researchers will enable their participation in a top-level research conference, and provide them with training opportunities in a scientific area of high current interest.  The support for senior participants will help to attract well-established leaders in the field and to maintain a high scientific level of the conference.  Broad international participation of young and established researchers from different countries will be equally beneficial for the US and foreign researchers, facilitating exchange of ideas, providing opportunities to establish collaborations, attracting best international researchers and students to the US, and exposing the US students and young researchers to international opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://www.seas.virginia.edu/academic/icpepa5/&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
