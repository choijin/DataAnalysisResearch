<AbstractNarration>A Year in the Life of a Northern River: A Geoscience Education Pilot Project on the Nenana River, Alaska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This University of Alaska Fairbanks project offers K-12 students and teachers in rural Alaska opportunities to conduct hands-on research activities that document changes in local rivers and their ice cover during a time of rapid environmental change in the Polar Regions. In this project on the Nenana River in central Alaska, teachers and students will record freeze-up and break-up, and thus duration of the ice cover. These ground-based observations will be supplemented by satellite remote sensing imagery using AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and ALOS (Advance Land Observing System) data. Between freeze-up and break-up, students will measure ice thickness, and the depth, density and water equivalence of snow on the ice. Throughout the year, water samples will be obtained for simple geochemical analysis of a river that originates at a glacier in the Alaska Range. Teachers will participate in classes and workshops that will provide content knowledge as a background to making river ice, snow and water observations and measurements in a changing climate; prepare them for spring break student workshops; and address classroom transfer and alignment of observations and measurements with educational standards. Formative and summative evaluation will document the impact of using the focal point of networked observations of a river system as a geoscience education strategy in a highly distributed, rural community.  The partnership of K-12 teachers, students and professional scientists is expected to yield valuable new information about freeze-up, break-up and ice duration, ice thickness, and the depth, density and water equivalence of the snow on the ice along the Nenana River. Successful completion of this project is expected to enable the implementation a larger, Alaska-wide river science and education network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
