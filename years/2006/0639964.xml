<AbstractNarration>This project will study how plants respond to infection by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Pathogens and pests cause major crop loses and therefore an understanding of how the Plant Immune System works is of both intellectual and practical importance. In particular, this project will analyze the proteins that help plant cells under attack signal neighboring plant cells to initiate appropriate defense responses. The signal that is used is a derivative of common oxygen, an oxygen radical called superoxide. Superoxide is generated on the outer surface of the plant cell by an enzyme called NADPH oxidase. The genes encoding this enzyme are the focus of the project. The research will use tools of genetics, biochemistry and cell biology to understand the regulation of superoxide production in response to infection. The project focuses on a model plant species called Arabidopsis thaliana, but results derived from these studies are directly applicable to crop plants. The expected results will also describe other proteins whose action regulates the production of superoxide and add to the understanding of how plant cells sense superoxide. The Broader Impacts of this work will be to train post-doctoral, doctoral and undergraduate researchers in plant molecular biology. In addition the PI will present lectures to the general public on plant biology and genetic modification of foods.</AbstractNarration>
