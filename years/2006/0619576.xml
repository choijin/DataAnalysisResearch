    <AbstractNarration>This award is for the acquisition of a high resolution mass spectrometer with ESI, APCI, APPI, MALDI, MS/MS, and exact-mass capabilities. The instrument will provide much needed analytical support for a broad range of research programs in eight different laboratories. Their research programs are concentrated primarily in the areas of chemical biology, biochemistry, and synthetic organic chemistry and include the followiing: (1) Chemical Tools to Dissect Nonribosomal Peptide Natural Product Biosynthesis, (2) Uncovering the Cellular Interactions of Isoprostanyl Phospholipids, (3) Peptidointercalator Conjugates as Models of Protein and DNA Damage, (4) Sequence-specific Targeting of DNA, (5) Use of Mass Spectrometry in Studying Membrane/Protein Interactions and Archaeal Metabolomes, and (6) Biomimetic Catalysts for Asymmetric Synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new instrument will enhance the education and training of graduate students, undergraduates, and postdocs. Collectively, the eight research laboratories comprise a group of 84 graduate students, 19 postdocs, and 25 undergraduate research students, the great majority of whom will be users of the requested mass spectrometer on a regular basis. Mass spectrometry experiments will be incorporated into the undergraduate curricula for chemistry and biochemistry majors. To educate and engage as many undergraduate students as possible in the theory and practice of modern mass spectrometry, samples will be run also for students at nearby undergraduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>
