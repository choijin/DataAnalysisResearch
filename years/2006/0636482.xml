<AbstractNarration>The Second International Conference on Complementarity, Duality, and Global Optimization in Science and Engineering (CDGO-07) will be held at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, from February 28 to March 2, 2007.  This year's conference is the second event in the series of conferences started with The First International Conference on Complementarity, Duality, and Global Optimization in Science and Engineering (http://www.conted.vt.edu/cdgo/) held at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia, in August 2005.  More than 140 participants from different countries have attended the first meeting, and their contributions will appear in special issues of the Journal of Global Optimization, and a volume of the Springer book series on Advances in Mechanics and Mathematics.  A high rate of participation is expected this year as well.  Complementarity and Duality are fundamental concepts that play an important role in global optimization, large-scale computation, and multi- disciplinary research in engineering and science.  This fascinating conference will provide an exciting forum for the exchange of ideas in this highly fertile and ever-expanding area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of this conference is to bring together the most active mathematicians, engineers, and scientists from a variety of scientific disciplines who are working on complementarity, duality, and global optimization in nonlinear systems, engineering mechanics, and computational methods, with an emphasis on applications in science and engineering.  They will exchange new ideas across discipline boundaries of applied mathematics, computer science, engineering, computational chemistry and biology and present new computational methods and applications of global optimization.  The conference proceedings will be published in a hardbound volume by the Springer Series on Optimization and its Applications as well as in several special issues of the Journal of Global Optimization and Computational Management Science.  It is expected that this conference will open new trends in optimization and engineering science.  Furthermore, it will stimulate young faculty and students to venture into this rich domain of research.</AbstractNarration>
