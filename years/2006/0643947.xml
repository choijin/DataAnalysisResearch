<AbstractNarration>On the surface, analyzing the 2003 blackout in New York City, evaluating transportation systems for bottlenecks and emergency preparedness, and imaging a cell's genetic activity are very different challenges. However, these and many other important problems are all characterized by limited measurements of discrete events, such as a cascading series of system failure events, vehicles passing a small number of checkpoints in a transportation network, or tiny pulses of light emitted by a gene-triggered dye. This research is focused on the development of innovative theoretical and computational tools based on sophisticated statistical analyses for extracting meaningful information from small numbers of indirectly observed discrete events. Several educational programs are tightly coupled with these research pursuits, including the development of novel hands-on student activities focused on deriving information from indirect measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These programs are designed to stimulate interest in engineering disciplines through real-world examples and ultimately improve technical literacy. Data-starved inference on high-dimensional point processes encompasses a wide variety of fundamental theoretical challenges coupled with many critical applications, including fluorescence microscopy, network traffic analysis, astrophysics, and spectroscopy. This research comprises the development of a theoretical and methodological framework for analyzing and guiding the design of high-dimensional, data-starved, and complex event-based systems which may be dynamically changing, marked with auxiliary feature vectors, or supported on irregular topologies. The educational aspects of this work are tightly integrated with the research activities and help further advance the understanding of signal processing challenges and tools among both engineers and society at large. In particular, the investigators are designing outreach activities for primary and secondary school students and developing undergraduate- and graduate-level courses on multidimensional and statistical signal processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project was focused on data-starved inference for high-dimensional point processes. In general, point processes arise when indirect observations of a physical phenomenon are collected by counting discrete events (such as photons hitting a detector, cars passing a highway sensor, packets traveling through an Internet router, or people interacting in a social network). The challenge here is to use extremely small numbers of random events to perform inference on the underlying very high-dimensional and intrinsically complex phenomenon (for instance, the distribution of tissue in the body, or distribution of traffic in a network). Cutting-edge  and critical applications in biology, network traffic analysis,  astrophysics, and spectroscopy all rely upon our ability to perform fast  and accurate inference on high-dimensional point processes using a  meager supply of event-based data.    This project led to new theory and methods which exploit the complex interplay between low-dimensional or sparse models of signal structure and discrete event data generated by real-world systems. For example, one key outcome of this project is a fundamental new understanding of how a compressed sensing camera might perform in very low-light settings. Low-light or night-vision cameras are important in defense and surveillance settings, but current technology is large and expensive. Compressed sensing theory suggests that cameras can be made smaller if, instead of directly imaging a scene, they measure a carefully chosen set of scene projections, and several scientific endeavors have been dedicated to the design and implementation of cameras built upon this theory. However, the PI examined the statistics of night-vision data and showed that a naive application of compressed sensing theory is doomed to failure in low-light settings. The theory provides additional insight into how to optimize the design of next-generation night-vision cameras.   Another major outcome of this project is a new theoretical and methodological framework for spectral imaging. Spectral information can be vital for tasks such as monitoring the health of a forest ecosystem, increasing our understanding of solar physics, or examining tissue and organisms used to study cellular dynamics. Spectral imaging data contains information about how much light is reflected by a material at each location (as in a typical image) and each wavelength of light (i.e. spectral band). However, accurate spectral images can be difficult to acquire because the amount of light available to sense in a given spectral band may be very small. The PI has addressed this challenge with theory and methods for photon-limited spectral intensity estimation, the results of which are presented in the first attached image.  This project also led to the development of the current state-of-the-art in photon-limited image analysis, as displayed in the second attached image. The new method displayed estimates the structure in the underlying scene by learning key features and patterns in the image from very noisy data.       Data-starved inference for point processes also plays a key role in a wide variety of non-imaging contexts. For example, when monitoring interactions within a social network, meetings or contacts between different members of the network are recorded, and understanding the underlying pattern for a series of events makes it possible to identify structure and correlations among the people. The method developed under this project was applied to social network data extracted from the Enron email database and allowed the PI to correctly identify anomalous email patterns corresponding to significant events in the companyÆs history.            One common thread underlying all the research is this project is the importance of exploiting signal structure to make signal reconstruction robust to noise, missing data, or constrained sensing resources.
