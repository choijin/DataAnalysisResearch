<AbstractNarration>What are the comparative and combined effects of Institutional and Entrepreneurial factors in explaining the emergence and rapid growth of a new industry in an emerging economy?  This study examines this question in the context of a period of rapid growth in the Indian software industry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between 1978 and 2005, India's software industry revenues grew from 1.3 million to 17.5 billion US dollars. The number of software companies grew from 18 to 4,962. Several explanations have been proposed for this exceptional performance. This study will examine the impact of entrepreneurial variables related to founders such as caste and community effects, educational backgrounds, and employment experiences within the Indian software industry and/or in established software multinationals.  It will also assess the effects of institutional variables such as industry-focused economic liberalization policies, locating in technology parks, and venture capital financing infrastructures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to findings, the study will generate a unique longitudinal dataset of Indian software firms that can serve as a resource for scholarly investigation in multiple fields. The data collection effort will cover an estimated 4962 software organizations founded over 40 years between 1966 (when India's first software firm was established) and 2005. The pooled panel data will match institutional variables and entrepreneurial characteristics of the founder and top management team for all firms by year of founding. Archival data sources will be complemented by a survey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to contributing to knowledge about the institutional and entrepreneurial dynamics underlying the evolution and rapid growth of new industries, the results of this work will have broader applicability for understanding innovation and industrial change in general.  The work should have policy implications for underdeveloped economic sectors seeking quick industrial transformation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
