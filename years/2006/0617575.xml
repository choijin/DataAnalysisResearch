<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit will enable the PI and a Rutgers University post-doctoral associate to travel to South Africa in order to develop a joint research project in the area of carbon nanotubes with Dr. Diane Hildebrandt and her research group at the University of the Witwatersrand (South Africa). Carbon nanotubes are recognized as unique nanostructures with remarkable features and fascinating mechanical and electronic properties. Despite this large interest, the synthesis of carbon nanotubes and their use in several applications remain very challenging. The work proposed in this planning visit is of fundamental interest in that it concerns the synthesis of carbon nanotubes in a continuous process and their use in supported catalysis. Supported catalysts are essential to a large number of industries including the petroleum and refining industries. Poor catalyst quality can lead to reduced reaction selectivities and yields, which can result in large quantities of waste, requiring costly purifications and use of solvents. Many limitations of traditional supported catalysts can be overcome by using carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which have a predominantly meso-porous structure. The two research groups will bring unique and complimentary expertise, Rutgers on novel solid-supported catalysts and Witwatersrand on nanotechnology reactor systems and networks, to the collaborative project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration will open a conduit of communication that will facilitate ongoing and future exchanges between the two research groups. By bringing together these two research groups, we will be able to tackle a new set of problems that could not be approached by each group separately. The research project has potential to benefit partners in industry and to train students in the graduate research programs at Rutgers University and the University of the Witwatersrand to become highly skilled and internationally-engaged scientists and engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
