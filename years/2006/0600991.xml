    <AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with problems from commutative&lt;br/&gt;algebra and its interactions with computational algebra and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. The focus of the proposal is on the theory of&lt;br/&gt;blowup algebras. These algebras appear naturally in many&lt;br/&gt;constructions both in algebra and geometry. For example they arise&lt;br/&gt;in the process of resolution of singularities. An essential tool in&lt;br/&gt;their study is the concept of reduction of an ideal. Several key&lt;br/&gt;invariants emerge in this context such as the reduction number,&lt;br/&gt;which among other things controls the Cohen-Macaulay property of&lt;br/&gt;blowup algebras. To study all reductions at once one considers the&lt;br/&gt;core of an ideal, defined as the intersection of these reductions.&lt;br/&gt;This object, related to coefficient, adjoint and multiplier ideals,&lt;br/&gt;plays a crucial role in Brian\c{c}on-Skoda type theorems. A main&lt;br/&gt;thrust of this proposal is to give a combinatorial description of&lt;br/&gt;the core of monomials ideals, to clarify the connection of the core&lt;br/&gt;with the reduction number, the first coefficient ideal and the&lt;br/&gt;adjoint or multiplier ideal, to investigate the core in arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;characteristic and to establish formulas that were previously known&lt;br/&gt;only in characteristic zero. In addition, the project also studies&lt;br/&gt;other areas such as integral closures of ideals. The concepts of&lt;br/&gt;integral extensions and integral closures of rings and ideals are&lt;br/&gt;central to much of commutative algebra. One of the goals of the&lt;br/&gt;project is to find a priori measures for the complexity of computing&lt;br/&gt;integral closures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often real life problems involve many unknown parameters that are&lt;br/&gt;related by equations which are impossible to solve exactly.&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, using commutative algebra methods, much valuable&lt;br/&gt;descriptive information can be gained about the potential sets of&lt;br/&gt;solutions, if not the exact solutions themselves. Commutative&lt;br/&gt;algebra has seen a great deal of activity and success over the past&lt;br/&gt;two decades with the solution of important conjectures, its&lt;br/&gt;application to diverse fields such as computer science,&lt;br/&gt;cryptography, coding theory, robotics, pattern recognition and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics, and the discovery of unexpected connections to&lt;br/&gt;other parts of mathematics, ranging from topology to combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;and from computer algebra to statistics.</AbstractNarration>
