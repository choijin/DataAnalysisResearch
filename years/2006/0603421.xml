<AbstractNarration>The project (NaMCATE) is developing benchmarks for nanomanufacturing and six nanomanufacturing curriculum modules for upper high school and community college levels. The project is a collaborative effort of high school, community college and university faculty in New York State and at Arizona State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The project is developing a set of cutting-edge curriculum materials for high school science and technology education programs that provide opportunities to address important new content and meet the needs of the growing number of community colleges wishing to implement nanotechnology programs. NaMCATE builds on work done by MATEC at Maricopa County Community College District and is developing the first set of high school (HS) and community college (CC) benchmarks for nanomanufacturing. The curriculum modules are being developed in cooperation with industry, NSF nanotechnology research centers, and other faculty active in nanotechnology education.  In addition to the instructional modules, the project is developing learning tools and providing access to inexpensive equipment and devices specially designed for HS and CC students and faculty.  Recognized experts in nanotechnology and experienced educational materials developers are collaborating to ensure fidelity to standards, technical accuracy, and pedagogical correctness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. NaMCATE aims to significantly advance the capacity of community colleges and high schools to provide instruction in the burgeoning area of nanoscale manufacturing. The project methods and materials are being disseminated through a wide variety of means and sustained by collaborating partners. All project processes, products, collaborative relationships, and outreach efforts are being formally evaluated by an external evaluator.  The material is being used by a diverse group of students in the cooperating colleges and universities.  The project can introduce high school and community college students and faculty to the methods, applications, and processes of nanomanufacturing and can become a stimulus to the pursuit of further education and careers in this promising field.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
