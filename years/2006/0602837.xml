<AbstractNarration>+The mathematical development of wavelet theory and the accompanied&lt;br/&gt;computational algorithms reached a mature, satisfactory, level in one&lt;br/&gt;dimension. The situation is far less satisfactory in higher dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;As a matter of fact, the  current approaches for the construction of high-D&lt;br/&gt;wavelet representations scale poorly with the dimension. On the one hand,&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic constructions become hopelessly complicated already at relatively&lt;br/&gt;low dimensions. On the other hand, the simple approach of lifting&lt;br/&gt;univariate systems to higher dimensions becomes eventually immensely&lt;br/&gt;non-local. As a result, the construction of effective, efficient, wavelet&lt;br/&gt;representations in high dimensions remains a major challenge and an elusive&lt;br/&gt;target.  The premise of this proposal is that the only way to meet this&lt;br/&gt;challenge is to fundamentally change the principles of wavelet&lt;br/&gt;constructions. The ambitious goal of this project is to develop&lt;br/&gt;representations that scale correctly with the spatial dimension: constants&lt;br/&gt;in the complexity estimates of the algorithms that are independent of the&lt;br/&gt;dimension; linear functionals that have limited, controlled, overlapping in&lt;br/&gt;their supports; and performance grade that does not degrade with the growth&lt;br/&gt;of the dimension. The project is expected to contribute in tangible ways to&lt;br/&gt;NSF's broad criteria. This is first and foremost due to the intrinsic&lt;br/&gt;importance of the research area, and the fact that the problem attacked in&lt;br/&gt;this project is a major hurdle in the relevant research area. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;the initiative offers a highly valuable training and education  opportunity&lt;br/&gt;to mathematical science students,  education in  areas that  are at the&lt;br/&gt;interface between mathematics on the one hand and science and technology on&lt;br/&gt;the other hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our era is marked by breathtaking improvement in sensor acquisition&lt;br/&gt;capabilities and an explosive increase in communication over wired and&lt;br/&gt;wireless channels. As a result of these and similar trends, the correct&lt;br/&gt;handling of massive datasets is, these days, at the core of almost every&lt;br/&gt;technology that deals with scientific data.  The most fundamental issue in&lt;br/&gt;this regard is the fact that the size of the dataset is merely an artifact&lt;br/&gt;of the acquisition technology; it is not related to pertinent information&lt;br/&gt;that the data encode, nor to the actual applications that are sought for.&lt;br/&gt;Data representation is the scientific discipline that deals with challenges&lt;br/&gt;like the above.  It resolves the above problem by transforming the data into&lt;br/&gt;a new format which allows an efficient and effective extraction of&lt;br/&gt;information, storage, transmission, and the like.  There is probably no way&lt;br/&gt;to overstate the importance of research on data representation: Development&lt;br/&gt;of novel data representations is ranked among the top scientific priorities&lt;br/&gt;of our nation. Indeed, the innovators in this field are richly recognized&lt;br/&gt;for their contributions: even after restricting attention only to research&lt;br/&gt;on the mathematical  and statistical aspects of data representation, one&lt;br/&gt;finds, in the last eight years alone, two Medal of Science awards,  as well&lt;br/&gt;as five or more elections to the National Academy of Science.  The wavelet&lt;br/&gt;representation is among the most important contributions of the data&lt;br/&gt;representation community to science. It was introduced in order to provide&lt;br/&gt;an answer to the main shortcoming of the Fourier representation, i.e., the&lt;br/&gt;fact that the latter never provides a sparse representation to transient&lt;br/&gt;events.  The research community succeeded in constructing very good wavelet&lt;br/&gt;representations in 1D.  Those systems are computed and inverted by fast&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and strike as good balance as can be between performance and&lt;br/&gt;localness. The same it not true in high spatial dimensions.  Armed with&lt;br/&gt;that observation, the intent of this ambitious project is to develop novel&lt;br/&gt;classes of wavelet representations that are efficient and effective in high&lt;br/&gt;dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
