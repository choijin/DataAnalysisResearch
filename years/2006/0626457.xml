<AbstractNarration>The proposed research focuses on algorithms to solve illumination problems,&lt;br/&gt;which are a class of geometric optimization problems that focus on where to&lt;br/&gt;place, or how to move, groups of guards in such a way as to illuminate&lt;br/&gt;environments or targets of interest. The objective is to solve this class&lt;br/&gt;of geometric optimization problems, through visually-guided agents, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;robotic agents with line-of-sight sensors and line-of-sight communication.&lt;br/&gt;The technical approach is based on a novel set of "incremental partition&lt;br/&gt;and deployment" algorithms that effectively solve the classic art gallery&lt;br/&gt;problem for robotic guards with visibility sensors.  Our solutions rely on&lt;br/&gt;novel geometric structures that reflect the environment topology, on&lt;br/&gt;navigation algorithms to explore these structures, and on distributed&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to manage the information gathered via local sensing and&lt;br/&gt;communication.  The broad research objective is to design distributed&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for various illumination and motion coordination&lt;br/&gt;problems. Useful scenarios arise by considering a hierarchy of&lt;br/&gt;environments, a variety of illumination models, and different tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will impact the emerging technologies of robotic and&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks.  The focus is on situations where groups of robots with&lt;br/&gt;cameras and other controllable sensors will provide pervasive coverage and&lt;br/&gt;sensing in urban environments.  Example applications could include civil&lt;br/&gt;rescue operations and adaptive aerial surveillance.  This technology holds&lt;br/&gt;the promise to affect society at large by facilitating a number of critical&lt;br/&gt;tasks in national security, industrial automation, and novel commercial&lt;br/&gt;applications.  This research will achieve broad dissemination through&lt;br/&gt;regular publications as well as through the development of lecture notes&lt;br/&gt;and a course on cooperative mobile robotics.  The PI will develop software&lt;br/&gt;for distributed illumination problems, geometric optimization and algorithm&lt;br/&gt;visualization. The PI will supervise teams of undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;performing senior design projects on robotics and controls related&lt;br/&gt;to the broad themes of this proposal, including sensor networks, mobile&lt;br/&gt;robot control, and visual sensing.  The PI plans to advertise opportunities&lt;br/&gt;to work on proposal-related projects as widely as possible to attract&lt;br/&gt;under-represented and minority students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
