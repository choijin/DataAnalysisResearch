    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will develop a new manufacturing process for hermetically sealing sensitive electronic and optical packages. The new process utilizes composite reactive preform-based sealing to produce true metallic hermetic seals without significant thermal exposure of the components. Reactive composite preforms are composed of reactive wire-based materials embedded in&lt;br/&gt;a solder matrix. The wires consist of an intimate distribution of two materials with high heats of mixing which, upon initiation with a small energy pulse, undergo a self propagating exothermic reaction. By inserting the composite preform between two components and initiating the reaction the heat generated melts the solder and bonds the components. The localized heating associated with the bonding technique avoids thermal damage to the components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hermetic sealing of electronic and optical packages can constitute up to 70% of the total manufacturing cost of the device. Devising a low-cost method of sealing would therefore represent a major advance in the commercial potential of this field. The composite reactive preform-based sealing process proposed here will produce metallic hermetic seals at a cost three to four times lower than laser welding, the major competing&lt;br/&gt;technology. In addition, as opposed to laser welding, the new process will require minimal capital outlay by the manufacturer and will lend itself to high volume in-house sealing by device manufacturers. Finally the composite preform sealing process lends itself to sealing existing package designs, avoiding the expense associated with changing package designs.</AbstractNarration>
