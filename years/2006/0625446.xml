<AbstractNarration>The proposed research is a targeted investigation to develop the understanding of intelligent power assist systems. Intelligent power assist systems are distinguished from conventional power assist devices and haptic devices. The role of conventional power assist devices is limited to amplifying or augmenting the power supplied by users.   Haptic devices supply users with feedback information on the environment, but the information is synthesized.  In other words, haptic devices do not provide direct physical coupling between the user and the environment. Intelligent power assist systems add assistive power (or force) to the power (or force) input supplied by a human operator. The technical objectives of the research are: 1) to study intelligent power assist systems which adaptively handle the interaction between human-machine-environment,  2) to develop signal processing and control algorithms for the system to assist the operator by sensing the human's intention, optimally augmenting assistive power  and isolating the human from undesired environmental disturbance inputs while retaining essential bilateral physical coupling between the human and the environment, and 3) to demonstrate the advantages of such algorithms by experiments with an electric bicycle-based system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many modern technologies, in particular automation and mechatronics, were originally intended to achieve higher productivity and better product quality.  They are now steadily penetrating our daily lives.  We are surrounded by mechatronic products and interact with them in many ways. Consequently, it has become critically important to consider human factors in the design and development of mechatronic products, and the proposed research aims to provide a scientific foundation for these considerations.  The technical objectives impact a wide range of applications, including wheel chairs, power assist steering systems and electric bicycles. Achievement of the objectives promises to enhance the quality of life of a large section of the population, including the physically impaired. An electric bicycle is adopted as the experimental testbed. Electric bicycles are an attractive means of transportation from the standpoints of energy, environmental impact and public health.  Intelligent power assist devices hold the potential for making electric bicycles a more appealing means of transportation to a wider population.  The broader impacts will be on education, outreach and international collaboration.  The project team includes the Principal Investigator, a graduate student researcher and undergraduate researchers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
