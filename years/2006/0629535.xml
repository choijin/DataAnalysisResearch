<AbstractNarration>The National Academies' Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP), at the request of Congress, will assist the National Science Foundation in the design of an inducement prize to support the advancement of scientific and engineering research.  The prize will emphasis innovation, focus on research activities with high risk and reward potential, and promote science and engineering objectives outside of traditional support mechanisms. The STEP Board will convene a highly interdisciplinary committee of expert volunteers to develop recommendations and rationale for general prize design criteria.  Crafting a prestigious prize, to complement NSF research investments, has the potential to fulfill unmet societal needs, and create new partnerships and collaborations in a transformational area of scientific research.  The prize should engage and inform the public about science and engineering research important to the NSF and the Federal government.</AbstractNarration>
