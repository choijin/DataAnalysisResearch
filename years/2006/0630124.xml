    <AbstractNarration>This project will evaluate the robustness, resolution, and required &lt;br/&gt;complexity of global seismologic and geodynamic models of upper &lt;br/&gt;mantle azimuthal anisotropy in order to improve our understanding of &lt;br/&gt;mantle dynamics. Recent years have seen a refinement of &lt;br/&gt;seismological models of anisotropy, presumably indicative of shearing &lt;br/&gt;in mantle flow. Particularly surface wave inversions have been linked &lt;br/&gt;to models of mantle circulation with some success. Such findings make &lt;br/&gt;it appear feasible to test hypotheses for regional tectonic models &lt;br/&gt;using sophisticated synthetic data sets in the near future. However, &lt;br/&gt;while several questions about the implications of anisotropy remain &lt;br/&gt;unanswered, it is also true that comprehensive and quantitative &lt;br/&gt;models with thorough estimates of uncertainties are still lacking. &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses some of the relevant issues of seismological &lt;br/&gt;analysis and improved geodynamic models, such as: How stable are &lt;br/&gt;azimuthal anisotropy patterns with respect to data selection and &lt;br/&gt;inversion methods? How well constrained is anisotropy under &lt;br/&gt;continents and oceanic regions? What are the characteristic to &lt;br/&gt;convection models, from Newtonian to power-law rheology, from &lt;br/&gt;laterally constant to varying viscosity, and from finite strain to &lt;br/&gt;texture modeling. A range of resolution and synthetic model tests &lt;br/&gt;will be performed to evaluate the robustness of the seismological &lt;br/&gt;models. Such a combined seismologic and geodynamic research program &lt;br/&gt;will lead to new insights into upper mantle structure, anisotropy &lt;br/&gt;formation, and mantle convection. The aim is to formalize our &lt;br/&gt;understanding of lithospheric and upper mantle deformation based on &lt;br/&gt;mantle flow, in order to develop models with specific regional &lt;br/&gt;predictions that are useful for the design of field campaigns and &lt;br/&gt;geologic hypothesis testing.</AbstractNarration>
