    <AbstractNarration>Principle Investigator: Patrick H. Masson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal Number IOB-0642865&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Proteomics and Reverse Genetic Approaches to the Study of Root Gravitropism&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract. Gravitropism dictates upward shoot growth to environments that are suited for photosynthesis, gas exchange and reproduction, and programs downward root growth into the soil for water and nutrients uptake. Gravity sensing occurs mainly within specialized gravity perceiving cells at the tip of roots and around the vasculature in shoots. To better understand the mechanisms that govern gravity sensing in roots, root-tip proteins whose abundance, modification or targeting were affected by plant reorientation were isolated. Initial study of these proteins suggested a role for two plant-signaling molecules, cytokinins and polyamins, in the regulation of root growth behavior. In this project, a combination of genetic, molecular and cell biological strategies will be used to elucidate their role in gravitropism. These experiments will lead to a better understanding of these regulatory compounds' contribution to the regulation of root gravitropism, will elucidate some of the molecules that contribute to their action, and identify gravity-regulated genes whose expression in the root tip is dependent upon them. Overall, these studies will shed light on the mode of action of two regulatory compounds that contribute to multiple and fundamental aspects of plant growth and development, with potentially profound impact on agriculture and ecology. Two graduate students, including an African-American woman, will carry out this project, and train undergraduate students to scientific experimentation. Furthermore, an outreach program will be implemented whereby a K-12 teacher will join the lab each summer of the project to work in partnership with the PI, the students and other lab members to design instructional materials from our research to be subsequently tested in the classroom.</AbstractNarration>
