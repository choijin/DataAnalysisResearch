<AbstractNarration>Seattle Pacific University is awarding five $10,000 two-year scholarships annually to STEM undergraduate teaching candidates pursuing certification at Seattle Pacific University and three $10,000 one-year awards annually to STEM professionals holding either a Bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree in a science (especially physics or physical science), math, or engineering who are earning a teaching credential.  The 27 new science and mathematics teachers serve two years teaching in Seattle Public Schools (or other high need district) for each year as a Noyce award recipient. With a focus on grades 5 through 10, the project is responding to the growing local and national need for better prepared and better qualified teaching professionals in the STEM fields, for more math and science professionals from diverse groups serving in professional/industry positions and ultimately for a scientifically literate population.  A principal objective of the project is to increase the diversity of the teacher workforce in the Pacific Northwest. This diverse pool of candidates, serving in high need school districts, provide much needed role models of individuals proficient in the STEM field who are from the fields' traditionally underrepresented populations. The teacher preparation program provides a mentoring component that begins during the student teaching period and extends for six years after graduation from the program.  Each student completes four different field experiences enabling them to experience a variety of classroom settings. The project is affecting the professional practice of the mentor (collaborating) inservice teachers who are involved in the program through professional development and training. Teacher candidates participate in programs guided by results of educational research and participate in authentic physics research activities as part of their preparation. Because STEM teaching candidates learn in an environment where physics, mathematical, engineering and scientific research are taught along with methods of teaching, STEM teaching candidates gain knowledge of the most current research as it is applied in a classroom environment. As these teaching professionals enter the work force, they are equipped with a teaching method that integrates research into their classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
