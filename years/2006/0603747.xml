<AbstractNarration>Introduction: With the goal to address the severe national shortage in the number of&lt;br/&gt;domestic members of underrepresented populations (i.e., African Americans, Hispanics,&lt;br/&gt;American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders) pursuing&lt;br/&gt;doctoral degrees in the STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics),&lt;br/&gt;the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) Program was initiated by the&lt;br/&gt;NSF in 1998. During the last 7 years, the program has grown from few alliances in 1998 to 27&lt;br/&gt;AGEP alliances nationwide in 2005. While these AGEP alliances are required to collaborate&lt;br/&gt;amongst themselves in order to better fulfill the program goals, transaction costs and financial&lt;br/&gt;constraints prevent them from collaborating more effectively on a regional or national basis.&lt;br/&gt;This limitation may hinder the full potential and growth of the AGEP Program because&lt;br/&gt;individual alliances may miss out on opportunities for the identification and sharing of best&lt;br/&gt;practices and lessons learned from other AGEP alliances. The purpose of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;explore the degree to which the strategic deployment of cyberinfrastructure can broaden and&lt;br/&gt;deepen collaboration amongst AGEP alliances in NY State, as a pilot study, and to lay the&lt;br/&gt;empirical foundation for a larger proposal to strengthen the national integration of AGEP&lt;br/&gt;alliances.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: To accomplish these goals for enhanced collaboration and sharing of&lt;br/&gt;best practices and resources throughout the national AGEP community, we have designed our&lt;br/&gt;study to be implemented in two phases: The focus of Phase One will be to build a pilot&lt;br/&gt;collaboratory for the emerging partnership of the New York AGEP alliances. This pilot NY&lt;br/&gt;AGEP Collaboratory will serve as the prototype of a National AGEP Collaboratory that may be&lt;br/&gt;proposed after evaluation of the pilot data. In Phase Two of the proposed project, we will&lt;br/&gt;expand membership in the pilot collaboratory to the remaining three AGEP alliances on the East&lt;br/&gt;Coast. Again, this pilot East Coast AGEP Collaboratory will help us to learn valuable lessons as&lt;br/&gt;we plan for a proposed National AGEP Collaboratory project. Guided by literature on the&lt;br/&gt;development of Cyberinfrastructure and Collaboratories, we propose to study the three&lt;br/&gt;overarching domains around collaboratory practices. We characterize these domains as: (1)&lt;br/&gt;people-to-people; (2) people-to-information; and (3) people-to-facilities. Each of these domains&lt;br/&gt;is critical to the needs of the AGEP alliances. Formative and summative evaluation of the pilot&lt;br/&gt;study will be undertaken to provide the analysis that will help in making decisions about the&lt;br/&gt;subsequent phases of the project, leading up to the national AGEP Collaboratory. Areas that will&lt;br/&gt;be evaluated include administrative capacity, planning and research, affiliate capacity building,&lt;br/&gt;and enhancing outreach capacity.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Societal Impacts: In addition to the project's direct impact on the participating&lt;br/&gt;AGEP alliances in terms of building their capacities and increasing their efficiency to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;the achievement of their objectives to support the development of more members of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented populations achieving the doctorate in the STEM disciplines and entering the&lt;br/&gt;professoriate, the project has broader impact at regional and national levels. The universities and&lt;br/&gt;their student populations in general will benefit from increased opportunities for collaboration&lt;br/&gt;amongst the participating universities, including brown bags, courses, seminars, and research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities. These technologies will make it easier to engage local communities in research&lt;br/&gt;activities where relevant. Nationally, the lessons learned form this project can be applied not&lt;br/&gt;only to the future AGEP collaboratory, but to other loose networks and alliances of&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary and multi-institutional actors.</AbstractNarration>
