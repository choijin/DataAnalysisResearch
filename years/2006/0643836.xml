<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to develop new algorithms for data acquisition that mitigate fundamental limitations in real-world measurement devices.  All measurement devices are limited in their speed and timing accuracy.  The corresponding primary goal is to develop algorithms to compensate for effects of timing inaccuracy and to extract information effectively from samples taken slowly.  This could enable cheaper, smaller and lower-power measurement devices and thus hasten the deployment of large-scale and battery-operated sensing systems.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems are limited by the homogeneity of the induced magnetic excitation.  A second project goal is to optimize excitation sequences for homogeneity without increase in excitation time.  This would make ultra high-field MRI more useful clinically and in physiological research, with a significant impact on health care.  Key to the technological advances is the careful integration of tools from approximation and compression into data acquisition.  The research plan is complemented by the development of a textbook, a graduate course, and materials to be shared online at MIT Open Course Ware and FourierAndWavelets.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has three parts: (a) Algorithms to mitigate jitter in sampled, quantized data will be developed.  Since some power consumption is inversely proportional to the variance of jitter, these algorithmic improvements can enable lower power.  The project further seeks to determine fundamental scaling laws for the effect of jitter.  (b) The project addresses the estimation of signals from a small (sub-Nyquist) number of samples.  Preliminary results demonstrate that approximation theory and information theory give quite different perspectives on the efficacy of existing techniques, and new acquisition and reconstruction algorithms will be developed. (c) MRI excitation design is posed as an approximation problem amenable to sparsity-based optimization&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project advanced the understanding of several fundamental aspects of acquiring and representing information at an abstract level and at the same time developed and demonstrated new concepts for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical imaging.  These contributions are significant within their subdisciplines, and they also demonstrate the value of integrated study of theoretical foundations along with concrete technology development for applications.  A dozen students gained knowledge and hands-on experience in technical innovation through their participation in the project.  The project also contributed to the creation of a new course and a pair of textbooks on signal processing.   MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING  Our advances in MRI have the potential to improve patient safety and comfort; reduce cost and scanning time; improve utilization of multiple contrast preparations and multiple transmit and receive channels; and improve diagnostic quality of images and hence improve patient heath outcomes.  This work is in two major clusters: new image formation algorithms and a new methodology for excitation design.   Clinical imaging with structural MRI routinely relies on multiple acquisitions of the same region of interest under several different contrast preparations.  This project introduced a reconstruction algorithm to jointly reconstruct a set of images from data acquired with several contrast preparations.  The images have significantly higher fidelity than when images are reconstructed either individually or jointly by a previously proposed algorithm.  Commonality of image spatial structure across contrasts is exploited without assuming too much about correlation across contrasts.  Examples demonstrate improved reconstruction quality (up to a factor of 4 in root-mean-square error) compared to previous algorithms.  This enables reduction in the amount of data acquired for each contrast preparation and hence a reduction in scan time.  Another method for forming high-quality images despite reduced scan time is to acquire data with a multi-channel receive coil array rather than a single-channel coil.  This project introduced new reconstruction algorithms to exploit the multiplicity of channels.  The key contributions are to effectively combine both the transform-domain sparsity of MR images and the sensitivity profiles of the coil array, whereas previous techniques could exploit only one or the other.  The methods introduced in the project are especially effective when the acceleration factor -- the speedup of acquisition relative to using conventional spacing of k-space samples -- is large.  For 32-channel acquisition, we have exhibited acceleration factor 14 at an image quality level where a conventional technique exploiting only coil sensitivities achieves acceleration factor 7.  The work in excitation design could be especially important in hastening the adoption of ultra high-field MRI systems, which promise previously-unseen spatial resolution as well as observation of tissue metabolism and function.  A major issue impeding the use of these systems is B1-inhomogeneity, which is essentially a spatially-varying signal intensity arising from the interaction between an MRI systemÆs B1-field, the systemÆs main field, and the subject being imaged.  At high field strengths, these intensity variations are severe.  We have cast the MRI excitation process as an approximation problem and have found that the fundamental constraint of limited excitation time can be addressed by sparse approximation.  Sparse approximation has proven to be useful not only in decreasing B1-inhomogeneity, but also in providing other improvements to MRI excitations.  We introduced a novel algorithm for the design of fast slice-selective spatially-tailored MRI excitation pulses.  To achieve comparable homogeneity as our pulses, those produced with conventional techniques are about 37% longer, adding proportionately to scan time.   OPTICAL IMAGING  This...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
