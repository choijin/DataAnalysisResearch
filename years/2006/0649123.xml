<AbstractNarration>This award is for an REU program in Physics at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.  The REU program will involve ten students for ten weeks in the summer.   Research opportunities will be offered in a wide range of fields in Physics, including astronomy, biological physics, and condensed matter physics, nanoscience, laser physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics.  The research mentors are all well funded researchers and all have committed to personally directing the students. These mentors have also committed to participating in a program of mentor training geared toward creating a collaborative community of scholars.  The program is designed to build a sense of community among the students and the participating faculty as well as expose the students broadly to many areas of forefront physics and astronomy.  Social group activities will further help to foster a group identity for the students and enhance their educational experience.  Vanderbilt has extensive research facilities, including several centers, which are be available to REU students.  As a capstone experience, there will be a final joint banquet with the Fisk University REU program, preceded by a poster session where each student will summarize their work.  Vanderbilt has a strong interest in recruiting underrepresented minorities and will use existing ties with Fisk University to help facilitate such recruitment.</AbstractNarration>
