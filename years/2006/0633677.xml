<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99) Most problems that students encounter in science courses present exactly the information needed to solve a problem that has a single unique correct solution.  However, outside the classroom environment, there are three types of problems: those with either no answers, or a single answer or multiple answers.  Additionally, accompanying the problem may be insufficient information readily available to find a solution; exactly the information required or more information available than is necessary to solve the problem.  This project is teaching mathematical problem solving that more nearly reflects "real world" situations.  Using the situations described above, a 3 by 3 matrix characterizing nine possible problem categories can be created.  The typical classroom problems populate only one cell in this matrix; those that contain within the problem the exact information needed to solve for the single correct answer.  Problems to populate the other eight cells of the matrix are being generated. Students are being exposed to all nine problem types and receiving appropriate instruction to determine if this instructional method will lead to improved problem solving abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an absence of rigorous studies on this approach to developing higher problem solving skills.  The research being conducted is expected to make a significant contribution to understanding how students' problem solving abilities can be improved.  The outcomes of the study have the potential to influence future textbooks and pedagogy.&lt;br/&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
