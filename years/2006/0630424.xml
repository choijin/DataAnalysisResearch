<AbstractNarration>Indiana University at Bloomington (IUB) is using Noyce stipends and scholarships to address the shortage of highly qualified mathematics teachers in high-need Indiana districts. The Secondary Transition to Teaching Program (ST-to-T), a one-year, full-time, heavily field-based, graduate-level certification program, is awarding stipends to 21 college graduates with baccalaureate degrees in mathematics over three years. The project is also using Noyce scholarships to recruit 12 undergraduate mathematics majors to pursue teacher certification through focused study in three education blocks that include education courses and field work for two semesters, with a culminating full-time student teaching semester. There are two undergraduate cohorts of six students, each supported for two years of study. Both teacher education programs are grounded in strong mathematics preparation, cutting edge pedagogy, diverse school-based field experiences in grade 6-12 school environments, and educational research reflecting inquiry-based learning and teaching. Recruitment strategies include offering mathematics linking courses that connect college-level mathematics to the secondary school curriculum. Noyce scholars are being prepared to serve as leaders in high-need schools, using technology and inquiry-based approaches to mathematics teaching at all secondary-school levels. To build a sense of community, the project is organizing an annual mini-conference involving presentations by mathematicians and mathematics educators, outstanding secondary teachers, and Noyce scholars (both current and past, returning as teachers). Professional support is provided through distance technology mentoring during student teaching and into the first two years of teaching. IUB's Center for Evaluation and Education Policy is implementing a research-based strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of project efforts.  Strategies are being developed for institutionalizing the program and for disseminating findings broadly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
