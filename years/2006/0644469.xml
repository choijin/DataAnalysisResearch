<AbstractNarration>Pacific Resources for Education and Learning (PREL), in collaboration with the University of Hawaii and ten regional state departments of education, is proposing to implement a master's degree program in evaluation, via distance learning. with the goal to improve educational programs in the Pacific region, including science, technology, engineering, and math. (STEM) This project will continue the work of an earlier grant from NSF/REC for curriculum development, by completing and implementing a course of study specifically designed to meet the unique needs of participants in the Pacific region. The project will incorporate a specialization in evaluation to a preexisting master's degree program within the University of Hawaii (UH-Manoa campus), College of Education, Department of Education Foundations. The program of study will require completion of 30 credit hours over the course of 6 semesters. The two-year program will consist of courses offered in a hybrid asynchronous/synchronous format and is modeled after PREL's distance learning Master of Science degree program in Instructional Technology and Telecommunications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to increase the capacity of the Pacific region to conduct high quality, innovative, useful, and credible evaluations of educational programs, including STEM. The project will enhance the attainment of this goal by pursuing the following objectives: (1) to increase regional capacity to provide graduate training in evaluation via distance; earning; (2) to increase consideration of culture and context in conducting evaluations;  (3) to increase the capacity of regional education agencies to engage in high quality, innovative, useful, and credible evaluations; and (4) to strengthen regional capacity to apply the results of program evaluations in educational program and policy decisions.  Long-term impacts of the program are anticipated to include improved data collection systems, continued application of evaluation data in program and policy decision-making, and ultimately higher levels of student engagement, achievement, and competencies in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Family, community, and supervisors should understand and accept participantsÆ commitment. If family, community, and job supervisors understand and accept what is expected of enrollees, competition for studentsÆ time should be reduced.  Consider revising courses. Students preferred active participation and practical application of what they learned. Most college texts, therefore, may need to be revised to be more relevant to student learning preferences.  Extend program to 21/2 or 3 years. Students needed more time to complete course requirements, and the pace of the cour...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
