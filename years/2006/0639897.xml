<AbstractNarration>SGER: Past Futures and Technoscientific Innovation:&lt;br/&gt;Science Fiction in the Lives of Scientists and Engineers&lt;br/&gt;Studying how past futures, or futures envisioned in the past through the visionary eyes of science fiction&lt;br/&gt;writers, have shaped the present can help us to improve the future. The goal of this pilot study is to&lt;br/&gt;explore the influence of science fiction in shaping the intellectual development of scientists and&lt;br/&gt;engineers, especially during their formative years. This project meets the requirements for a Small Grant&lt;br/&gt;for Exploratory Research (SGER) because it constitutes preliminary work on untested and novel ideas.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, it proposes to explore the idea that science fiction influences the career choices and research&lt;br/&gt;trajectories of scientists and engineers, a notion for which anecdotal support can be mobilized yet which&lt;br/&gt;has never been substantiated through empirical research. This pilot study will serve as the foundation for&lt;br/&gt;a larger proposal for an NSF Scholars Award to conduct follow-up research on the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;technoscience and science fiction.&lt;br/&gt;This project emerges at the intersection of the fields of science and technology studies (STS) and&lt;br/&gt;library and information science (LIS), and seeks to explore how exposure to science fiction influences the&lt;br/&gt;career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. In so doing, it merges the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;strand of the social shaping of technoscience from the STS literature with work on mass media in the life&lt;br/&gt;of the reader/listener/viewer/visitor/player from the field of LIS. The project is made possible by the&lt;br/&gt;hybrid expertise of the PI, whose Ph.D. is in STS and whose current faculty position is in LIS, and who&lt;br/&gt;has previously conducted NSF-funded research projects on the ethical implications of values embedded in&lt;br/&gt;information technologies such as dissection simulations and computational models. This project will&lt;br/&gt;allow the PI to further his research agenda at the intersection of the fields of STS and LIS, and to conduct&lt;br/&gt;research that will make significant contributions to both fields.&lt;br/&gt;The three primary objectives of this study are to develop a more robust understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between technoscience and society, mass media, and science fiction. This study hypothesizes&lt;br/&gt;that the career choices and research decisions of scientists and engineers are influenced by science fiction&lt;br/&gt;as well as other mass media and social factors as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;Data collection includes ten semi-structured, open-ended interviews with scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;Interview data will be analyzed using grounded theory such that research findings will be continuously&lt;br/&gt;integrated to further refine the research design, leading to the construction of a theory that can provide a&lt;br/&gt;preliminary explanation how society, mass media, and science fiction influence scientists and engineers&lt;br/&gt;and which can be tested and refined through additional research. Results will be disseminated via&lt;br/&gt;academic conferences and peer reviewed journals.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This study will contribute to the STS literature by exploring the social factors that&lt;br/&gt;influence the career decisions and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. The contribution to the&lt;br/&gt;LIS literature will be detailed exploration of the relationship between technoscience and mass media&lt;br/&gt;through an in-depth case study of mass media in the lives of scientists and engineers as&lt;br/&gt;readers/listeners/viewers/visitors/players. Finally, this study will also contribute to the literature on the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between technoscience and science fiction by exploring if and how science fiction might&lt;br/&gt;influence the career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study also aims to produce broader impacts that focus on the recruitment and&lt;br/&gt;retention of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students. First, by improving&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how science fiction shapes the career choices of scientists and engineers, educators will&lt;br/&gt;be able to determine when and how to use science fiction to promote student interest in STEM, potentially&lt;br/&gt;reinforcing and legitimating existing educational programs. In addition, this study may also be able to&lt;br/&gt;provide insights into how science fiction can promote diversity among STEM students, through emphasis&lt;br/&gt;on female and non-white authors and characters and feminist and multicultural themes. Finally, this study&lt;br/&gt;may discover ways that science fiction can help students majoring in STEM to become more conscious of&lt;br/&gt;the social and cultural dimensions of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
