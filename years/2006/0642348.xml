<AbstractNarration>Because most caterpillars feed on a very small subset of the plant species in their environment, the existence of species with broad diets (generalists) is enigmatic. In this project, a set of generalist forest caterpillars will be used to test two alternative hypotheses for how their broad diets are maintained: the 'ecological tradeoffs hypothesis' and the 'risk-spreading hypothesis.' To test these hypotheses, the survival, growth, and reproduction of four caterpillar species will be examined on eight unrelated host plant at two sites over three years. The risk of attack from natural enemies (predators and parasites) will be compared among host plants at multiple life stages. In addition, the background pattern of host plant preference will be quantified through field censuses of caterpillars at each site to determine if insect preferences are adaptive.  The results of this study will illuminate the unresolved debate over the importance of natural enemies in the evolution of insect diet breadth. Because a large number of economic pests are generalists, developing our understanding of how host plant associations develop and are maintained can aid long-term biological control efforts. An important facet of this project is the development and implementation of an elementary education module on insect evolutionary ecology. In addition, the project will train a team of undergraduates in ecological research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we tested the relative importance of host plant quality and risk of attack by natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) for patterns of host plant use by two generalist caterpillars in the family Limacodidae:  Euclea delphinii and Acharia stimulea.  Across six common tree species, we found consistent differences in the survival and growth of caterpillars due to variation in nutritional quality among plant species.  In the absence of natural enemies, black cherry was the consistently the highest quality plant and black gum was the lowest quality plant with the others intermediate.  Mortality from natural enemies also varied among plant species in each year of the sudy, but the pattern was temporally variable.  For one of the two caterpillar species, Euclea delphinii, we found partial support for an 'ecological tradeoff' between nutrition and risk of attack from natual enemies:  plants that were highly nutritious were also the most dangerous; however, this tradeoff was not found for the other species, Acharia stimulea.   These caterpillars were host toa  diverse community of parasitoid wasps and flies, almost all of which are specialized, using these caterpillars and their close relatives exclusively as hosts.  As part of this project, we characterized the insect host associations of each of these parasitoids and worked with specialized taxonomists to develop a taxonomic key to help identify them.  In addition, the ecology of host-parasitoid interactions in this study system were investigated and we found evidence that host size largely dictates patterns of attack by different species of parasitoid, but most species were able to find their caterpillar hosts on an array of different host plants.  The food web was extemely connected, indicating that Limacodid caterpillar species overlap considerably in both their host and parasitoid associations.  Overall, natural enemies varied much more in their effects on insect survival and performance than plant quality, lending support to a the notion that broad diets of generalist insects may be favored by 'bet-hedging' strategies that maximize offspring fitness in an unpredictable environment.  As part of this project, we developed an educational module on insect adaptation that we piloted with several local K-5 schools.  In addition, we did outreach to in excess of 1000 elementary school students through our annual 'Caterpillar zoo' in support of local science curricula.  Through this project, one postdoctoral researcher, one Ph.D. student, one K-5 teacher, and ten undergraduates received training in field ecology.
