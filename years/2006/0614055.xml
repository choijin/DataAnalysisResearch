<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While, tropical forests support perhaps 60% of all flowering plant species and 50% of all terrestrial NPP and carbon stored in terrestrial biomass, few long-term studies of tropical forests have been conducted, particularly studies of factors affecting flowering, seed production and seedling establishment, growth and mortality. Knowledge of the forces that maintain diversity during the reproduction and regeneration life history stages is critical to understanding and maintaining tropical forest diversity. The absence of long-term, quantitative studies of reproduction and early regeneration of tropical forest plants has made it difficult to identify relationships with natural climate variation as well as possible long-term trends caused by anthropogenic forcing. The research will maintain long-term quantitative studies of plant reproduction and seedling establishment in three Neotropical forests varying in disturbance regime, seasonality and diversity.  Ecuador, Panama and Puerto Rico vary in the influence of climatic forcing by the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, hurricane disturbance and the potential effect of anthropogenic global change. These data on temporal and spatial patterns of seed rain and seedling recruitment allow tests of hypotheses concerning causes of interannual variation and roles of different mechanisms in facilitating species coexistence including recruitment limitation, competition-colonization trade-offs, density-dependence and regeneration niche differentiation; all mechanisms hypothesized to be important to species coexistence and forest dynamics. This LTREB project will support the training of undergraduate and graduate students, provide new data to the scientific community, and inform the general public on the importance of global change research. Publishing all data and associated analyses on a web site here will insure maximum societal benefit from the data collected. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The objectives of the collaborative research of which this award is a part were to develop a better understanding of regeneration dynamics in tropical forests through long-term monitoring of seedfall and seedling recruitment across multiple sites, analyses of these data, and advancement of relevant ecological theory.  The very modestly budgeted University of Minnesota part of this collaborative research was focused on developing and applying methods for characterizing the light environments experienced by seedlings, as well as associated analyses of historical light data and development and evaluation of related ecological models.  We collected data on light environments over each seedling plot by taking upward-pointing 180-degree fisheye photos of the canopy, henceforth referred to as hemispherical canopy photos.  These photos are analyzed to classify each pixel as sky or non-sky, and to estimate light availability at the location where the photo was taken based on consideration of how much light would penetrate the canopy at different times of the day and year and under different conditions of cloudiness.  In the past, classification of pixels as sky or non-sky was done manually by a person choosing a threshold level of grey that seemed to best distinguish sky and non-sky.  However, we found that manual classification of photos was inadequate for our study sites in  the understory of tropical forests, which are mostly very dark.  Manual classification proved inconsistent across people, and resulting light estimates were entirely uncorrelated with seedling growth and survival, contrary to previous work in this forest.  Thus, a major objective of our work became the identification, testing, and implementation of automated algorithms for classifying pixels in hemispherical photos as sky or non-sky, a critical step towards using these photos for estimating light environments.   We tested existing software at the outset, and found that none was satisfactory for our purposes: the freeware programs lacked automation capabilities, and commercially available software was based on unknown proprietary algorithms that changed between versions.  Thus, we developed our own programs to implement a variety of published image classification algorithms, and also to process classified images to estimated light availability, and identify and properly orient the field of view.  We implemented these in Matlab and R.  We also built a sizeable dataset to use for evaluating alternative algorithms:  We deployed light sensors that continuously monitored light availability at seedling plots for several days each (at the same time measuring light above the canopy with a sensor on a tower), and took hemispherical canopy photos over these photos during the same time period.  Based on these data, we identified the best camera settings and the best classification algorithms for processing the photos.  We are preparing a manuscript for scholarly publication that will make our programs publicly available, and we anticipate that these will be broadly used by many ecologists.  We also developed and evaluated relevant theory regarding the role of spatial variation in light availability in tropical forest seedling communities.  At the outset, we reviewed existing theory on how various differences in regeneration strategies among tree species might enable multiple species to coexist (published in a scholarly book chapter in 2008).  We showed that existing theory is a poor match to patterns in tropical forests.  One of us then formulated a new hypothesis that a tradeoff among species between seed production and tolerance to stressful conditions (such as shade) could enable species coexistence, and presented new theory on how such a tradeoff would work (published in the scholarly journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2010) .  Finally, we analyzed our empirical datasets to better understand seedfall and seedling regeneration in tropical forests a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
