<AbstractNarration>CT-ISG: Cryptographic Foundations for Next-Generation Security&lt;br/&gt;Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boaz Barak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tackles some of the foundational challenges to the&lt;br/&gt;advent of the networked society and pervasive databases pose to&lt;br/&gt;cryptography. Specifically, it studies the existence of&lt;br/&gt;cryptographic protocols that allow mutually distrusting parties to&lt;br/&gt;achieve a common goal with a minimal sacrifice in privacy. This&lt;br/&gt;includes as a special case protocols for electronic elections, electronic&lt;br/&gt;auctions, privacy-preserving data mining and many more applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central issue in such protocols is the effect on security of executing&lt;br/&gt;multiples instances of one or several protocols over a network.&lt;br/&gt;It is known that in some cases such interaction can lead to subtle&lt;br/&gt;but fatal security flaws, and so constructing protocols whose security&lt;br/&gt;is robust with respect to such interactions&lt;br/&gt;is a central question in this cryptography. This project uses&lt;br/&gt;recent and new ideas and techniques to attack this problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More concretely, the research involves&lt;br/&gt;studying the tradeoff between trust and interaction.&lt;br/&gt;There are known protocols with robust security assuming the existence&lt;br/&gt;of completely trusted third parties. This project focuses on reducing the&lt;br/&gt;assumption of a trusted party, and aims to discover to what extent&lt;br/&gt;this can be done without compromising security. The goal is to get both&lt;br/&gt;positive results- protocols obtaining robust security under weaker trust&lt;br/&gt;assumptions than was previously known, and negative results- showing&lt;br/&gt;that certain security goals are impossible to achieve without some&lt;br/&gt;trust assumptions. This will allow the users of secure applications&lt;br/&gt;to know what is and is not achievable in terms of trust and security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also tackles the main sources of inefficiency in current&lt;br/&gt;constructions of robustly secure protocol, in order to find out to what extent&lt;br/&gt;the current efficiency bottlenecks in such constructions are inherent.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
