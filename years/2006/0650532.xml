<AbstractNarration>Sharing the Land: Building Tribal Earth Science Expertise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaborative effort designed to increase the number of Native Americans who have access to a well-rounded, place-based education in the Earth sciences and who understand the utility of the geosciences for tribal resource management and the connections between the geosciences and indigenous culture and knowledge.  The Indigenous Earth Sciences Project has the dual goals of increasing on-reservation expertise in the Earth and environmental sciences and developing a better understanding of how to most productively and appropriately integrate culturally-held, indigenous, scientific Earth science knowledge into the teaching of the Earth sciences in American Indian communities.  Partners in this collaboration include San Diego State University, regional Native American reservation communities and the high schools and educational programs that serve these communities.  This project has formally united cooperating programs in adult education, a well established middle- and high-school to college bridge program operated by and for local tribal communities, high-school science departments, and an early outreach program in outdoor science for younger children.  Together these programs have combined into a complete and culturally responsive recruitment and retention pipeline.  Many local Native American children participate in our Explorers Clubs outdoor science programs, learning to understand and enjoy the connections between their environment, culture and science.  We have seen many of these children grow up and move on into the Young Native Scholars high school to college bridge program.  With cooperatively designed high school curricula based in local issues and the local geological setting, students become well prepared for college science and aware of career options in the Earth sciences.  All efforts are augmented by project-supported work experience for participating students in tribal environmental management offices on their home reservations.  Students continue to San Diego State University Geological Sciences for B.S. and M.S. degrees, and join the growing ranks of local Native Americans educated by the department who return to work and live in their home communities, helping complete the cycle and grow the next generation of Native American geoscientists.  This project has produced and continues to produce insights into best practices in Native American geoscience education, adding unique information to the growing body of research into the best approaches to the inclusion of all under-represented groups in the earth science enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
