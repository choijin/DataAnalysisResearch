<AbstractNarration>Experimental work on membrane proteins faces many technical challenges.  Therefore, computer modeling could have important impact in this field.  Over the last few years the PI and his group have developed an implicit approach to modeling membrane proteins by adding to the force field a term that describes the solvation free energy of a protein in the heterogeneous membrane environment.  In the previous grant period the implicit membrane model (IMM1) was extended to proteins with an aqueous pore and the effects of membrane surface charge and transmembrane voltage were incorporated.  The model has been implemented into the CHARMM package and has been used to obtain insights into the forces that drive transmembrane helix association.  Methods have also been developed for the calculation of absolute free energies for peptide-peptide association and peptide-membrane binding.  The goals for the next grant period fall into two categories: methodology and applications.  The methodological improvements include: a more accurate treatment of the solvation free energy of aligned dipoles, an improved treatment of the ionic sidechains incorporating long-range contributions, salt dependence, aqueous/nonaqueous environment dependence, examination of the need for a lipid alignment potential, incorporation of the dipole potential, and implicit solvent modeling of metal ions.  The applications include: prediction and rationalization of the effect of mutations in membrane protein stability, studies of transmembrane helix association, prediction of the membrane binding mode of peripheral membrane proteins, and modeling the membrane insertion mechanism of colicin-type toxins.  These studies will be carried out in collaboration with experimental groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be carried out at an institution where 60% of the students belong to underrepresented groups and several programs support the participation of undergraduates in research.  The project will also train Ph.D. students in the Molecular Biophysics program at CUNY.  The methods developed are available to the research community through the CHARMM program and can be used by researchers in academia and industry.  They are useful to theoreticians and experimentalists alike and are applicable to important biological problems, such as membrane protein structure prediction, or understanding the mechanism of action of membrane proteins.   This project is jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Interactions between proteins and lipid membranes are critical in biology.  Experimental methods have provided a great deal of information about these interactions but an atomistic view is often lacking.  Computer simulations have emerged as a useful complementary technique that can provide such an atomistic view.  Our lab has developed an efficient approach for modeling protein-membrane interactions by representing the lipid and water components as a continuum.  The goal of this grant was to develop enhancements to our model and apply it to interesting biological problems.     17 publications have resulted from this grant dealing with a range of problems: analysis and prediction of the oligomeric state and topology of coiled coils, computing the contributions of ordered water molecules to solvation thermodynamics, determining optimal orientations of peripheral membrane proteins (including &alpha;-synuclein, a protein that plays a central role in ParkinsonÆs disease), computing the binding free energy between transmembrane helices, the role of peptides in stabilizing membrane pores, the conformational changes that the colicin toxins undergo when they bind to biological membranes, the strength of interaction between pairs of ionizable amino acid side chains at the interface of explicit lipid bilayers, the ability of effective energy functions like ours to discriminate the correct, native state of membrane proteins, the influence of membrane dipole potential on orientation and binding free energy of peptides to membranes, and the origin of the large difference in kinetics of binding and dissociation between neutral and anionic quinones from photosynthetic reaction centers.   Broader impacts from this project included the training of five PhD students (including a member of an underrepresented minority) and four postdocs (all women), and exposure to research of several undergraduate and high-school students. The computational tools we develop are used widely in the Biophysical community.       Last Modified: 07/15/2012       Submitted by: Themis Lazaridis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
