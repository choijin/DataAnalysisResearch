<AbstractNarration>This project will develop and validate a community-based whole magnetosphere model that simulates the interaction of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field with the near-Earth space environment. The model will extend from 100km above the Earth's surface to outside of the magnetospheric bow shock. The Community-based Whole Magnetosphere Model (CWMM) will model the magnetic and electric fields, neutral and plasma composition, pressure, and velocities, and energetic particle environment. Data assimilation will be used to make the model more consistent with the data. To achieve this goal, models of individual regions developed by various teams in the space sciences community will be used as components in the CWMM. The models will be coupled together using the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF). The resulting coupled model will be made available to the space science and space weather communities through the Community Coordinated Modeling Center. A rigorous validation process will quantify how the accuracy of the model changes as more components are added. The project will move the coupled model toward operational status for use by the Air Force Weather Agency and  NOAA's Space Environment Center (SEC). Results from this project will also be used in the Space Weather curriculum that is being developed at the University of Michigan.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by NASA and NSF.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ People are generally becoming more reliant on technology.  Many technological systems are dependent on satellites or other things that can be effected by the conditions in the space environment.  For example, GPS position accuracy can be strongly influenced by the state of the ionosphere.  Also, the lifetime of low-Earth orbiting satellites is quite dependent on the density in the upper atmosphere.  As a final example, strong currents in the ionosphere can disrupt power grids. This grant focused on improving our ability to model this region of space and these effects.  The atmosphere is composed of many different layers that are all dominated by different processes. This trend continues into the space environment, also.  The thermosphere is the upper-most part of the neutral atmosphere, and it can strongly effect satellite orbits.  Mixed in with the thermosphere is the ionosphere, which is the bottom-most part of the space environment - it is fully of charged particles that are controlled by electric and magnetic fields.  Higher than the ionosphere is the magnetosphere, where geosynchronous satellites orbit.  There are many different processes that occur in the magnetosphere, which are all modeled by different types of models.  For example, the radiation belts have really high-energy particles that could kill humans who travel through them, while the outer magnetosphere is controlled by the magnetic fields that can change dramatically and quite rapidly.  One single model can not really capture all of the physics within the magnetosphere, so many different models exist.  One of the main things that this grant accomplished was the coupling of these models, so the entire region could be modeled together (not with a single code, but with a bunch of codes all talking together).  Further, this grant really focused on making sure that we understand how accurate the models are.  For example, weather models sometimes get the weather accurately and sometimes they don't.  You can go statistics on these predictions to determine how well they work.  We ran our models over and over for different time periods to determine how well they worked, and then published our results.  These publications let the community know when they can trust the model and when they can't trust it.   Finally, we did a lot of science.  We studied thing like how conditions on the sun effect the aurora (Northern Lights).  This is important because the aurora is an important source of heat in the upper atmosphere.  When the aurora becomes quite active, it can heat the thermosphere up a lot, which causes it to swell (like a balloon).  The swelling can greatly influence the path of satellites in low Earth orbit, which makes it hard to tell when they may collide with each other.  If we can't accurately predict this, then we can't move them out of way, and it makes collisions much more likely.  More collisions means more junk in space (when satellites collide, they break apart - turning one big object into thousands of smaller objects).  We need to better understand how the sun influences the aurora and how the aurora effects our atmosphere so we can prevent these types of collisions from occurring. This grant enabled us to study this.          Last Modified: 12/29/2011       Submitted by: Aaron J Ridley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
