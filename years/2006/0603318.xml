<AbstractNarration>This UMEB proposal builds upon a successful model developed with initial UMEB funding. New program elements guided by lessons learned through program assessment have been added. The goal is to provide intensive support and mentoring for 24 students from under-represented groups, particularly Native Americans. Student's interest is nurtured beginning freshman year through senior year, using shared student activities in the field as well as on campus. An intensive 2-year experience of mentoring, research and community outreach activities begins in the junior year. A three-stage field experience is initiated by weekend field trips to the Adirondack Ecological Center (AEC) during the freshman and sophomore years, a 5-week summer field course at the Cranberry Lake Biological Station (CLBS) after the sophomore year, and the capstone experience of mentored summer field research at the AEC or CLBS after the junior year. Shared coursework in the field, 4 semesters of focused UMEB seminars and a close-knit community for collaborative learning are hallmarks of the program. Students also work with a stewardship mentor-- a scientist from a collaborating environmental organization or agency. Research projects are student-driven under the theme of "Science and Stewardship in the Adirondacks".  The proposed activities bridge the gap between traditional classroom learning and application of the knowledge in the field. Pairing of students with professional stewardship mentors from the conservation community benefits both UMEB students and the work of stewardship organizations. Communication of research results via community outreach programs will benefit ESF partners in the Adirondack Mountains by further integrating sound science into decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

We are very proud of our accomplished students, every one of whom has publicly presented their research findings. A number of our students have received award recognition for their outstanding research.  Our UMEB program was recognized by the Organization of Biological Field StationsÆ Human Diversity Award, for which we are most honored.      Through our intensive multi-level mentoring and research preparation seminars every semester,  students gained skills and experience essential for professional development as a scientists, including  accessing the scientific literature through library research skills, development of an annotated bibliography and literature review for their specific area of research interest, formulation of a good research question and research rationale, development of a research proposal, hypothesis development, experimental design and sampling strategy, field and laboratory techniques, data analysis and interpretation, development of research paper and poster for publication and presentation, experience in professional oral and written communication. In addition the UMEB seminars and collaborations provided significant exploration of environmental and scientific careers, graduate school preparation and professional networking. Students were paired with "stewardship mentors", professionals in the field who provided a scientific and community context for the research undertaken by the students and opportunities to see the application of their research to on the ground conservation practice.     Our program facilitated the coupling of scientific knowledge and social responsibility, so our UMEB students engaged in a wide array of outreach activities to share their knowledge and experience with the public. Their outreach projects included bringing environmental science programming to local schools serving under-represented populations, sponsoring an "Explore Environmental Science Day" at SUNY ESF for local schools, conservation education activities at a local nature center and serving as mentors and science fair judges in the community.
