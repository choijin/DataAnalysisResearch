<AbstractNarration>Violi, Angela   &lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0644639&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Uptake, fate and transport of environmental nanoparticles: from&lt;br/&gt;atomistic simulations to membrane diagnostics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project revolves around a novel theoretical effort to explore the interaction of man-made carbon-based nanoparticles with biological structures such as membranes. Knowledge on the basic and critical issues of how such anthropogenic particles "fit in" and modify biological assemblies, whether they be in plant or animal, is still very limited.&lt;br/&gt;This project is therefore devoted to providing some of this critically important environmental information through a highly synergistic scientific approach.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Particulate matter (PM) ranks as one of the principle pollutants linked to acute and chronic physiological ailments.  These particles, sized less than 200x smaller than a grain of sand, are generated by both natural and anthropogenic sources with the latter primarily consisting of fuel combustion processes from utilities, vehicles and industrial emitters.  With an understanding of the toxicity of micrometer-sized pollutant particles becoming clearer, a new frontier in epidemiology is emerging with attention directed toward smaller, nanoparticle pollutants.  Due to their prevalence, nanoparticles certainly pack a punch compared with the larger particulates.  In fact, it has been estimated that these "ultrafine" particles of less 0.1 mm (PM0.1) account for 80% of the particle number concentration in urban environments.  With this in mind, we have developed a set of approaches to specifically study the biochemical interactions of carbonaceous nanoparticles.  Computer simulation is a standard R&amp;D tool used to gain a fundamental understanding of macroscopic phenomena and optimize design.  Once established, models and simulations can minimize development cost or time and elucidate mechanisms in a manner sometimes unobtainable by experiments, e.g., the correlation between contaminant particle size and toxicity.  Many biological, chemical, and material processes, however, are too large to be efficiently simulated by conventional molecular modeling approaches, but require molecular level insight that can not be provided by the continuum based methods.  We developed a computational approach designed to fill that void and provide the necessary tools to tackle simulation of these mesoscopic-sized systems.  This study combines classical biological experiments, biophysical methods and computational modeling for a more detailed determination of carbonaceous nanomaterial interaction with a biological membrane than classical biology alone would have provided. Biological experiments in RAW 264.7 immortalized macrophages with fullerenes showed that nanomaterial is endocytosed, present in the cytosol, and able to enter the nucleus. Computational modeling of both single molecule and a small cluster of fullerenes predicts that low concentrations of fullerenes enter the membrane individually and cause limited perturbation; however, at higher concentrations the clusters in the membrane cause a bulging of the head group. These combined, complementary findings suggest that the presence of nanomaterials can alter the normal functioning of cells.
