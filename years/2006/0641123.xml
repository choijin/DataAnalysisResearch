<AbstractNarration>Dr. Martha Soto studies the molecules that allow cells to move.  Her long-term goal is to understand how these molecules are used for the growth and regeneration of neurons. The human central nervous system is one of the most complex structures known.  Understanding how this large number of neurons is assembled correctly into a functioning nervous system is one of the most important goals of developmental biology. Changes in the cytoskeleton are needed when neurons and axons migrate and contact other cells during development and during regeneration.  Regeneration requires the reorganization of the cytoskeleton of the neuron.  However, little is known about how the cytoskeleton gets reorganized after spinal cord injury, or even during regular neuronal growth. The strands of proteins that make up the cytoskeleton, molecules called tubulin and actin, can assemble or disassemble when cells need to change shape or to move.   Dr. Soto's laboratory has uncovered several molecules that are essential for the proper organization of the actin cytoskeleton.  They have evidence that without these proteins, neurons do not make the correct structures.  In addition, they have evidence that once axons form, if they are deprived of these proteins they stop functioning normally.  They propose to characterize the role of these molecules in nervous system growth and to identify new molecules that work with these proteins to ensure neuronal growth and survival.  They will determine how molecules that are critical for cell movements contribute to the growth and survival of neurons using the strengths of the C. elegans animal model system, including neuronal markers and genetics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will integrate education and research through the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students to perform research using the C. elegans model organism.  The students represent underrepresented groups including women, minorities and economically disadvantaged persons. Funding from the NSF will support a new investigator interested in expanding work on actin nucleation into the field of neuronal morphogenesis. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
