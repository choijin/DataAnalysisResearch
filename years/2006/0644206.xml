<AbstractNarration>The intent of this research project is to support adaptive and personalized information environments. Central to this vision is the need to improve activity discovery and representation of user behavior. This will necessitate the development of novel machine learning algorithms for building models of that activity. (An extension of the ABL agent language with support for looping prediction suffix trees is proposed.) This approach will be applied to two innovative domains, user interactions with smart appliances and semi-autonomous agents in online gaming environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the basic research necessary to build intelligent agents that would need to exist and work with many other agents, some of whom would be human. To that end, the research team focused on the discovery of intelligent activity in others (as opposed to just recognizing predefined behaviors); adaptive programming; and the incorporation of fundamentals from game theory  into the problem of multi-agent learning.     Over the course of this work, we have developed language constructs for adaptive behaviors. As we hoped, we have been able to define the problem in terms of both formal programming language theory and practical software engineering. We have published work on the game theory of multi-agent RL, providing strong theoretical results for solving multi-agent games under threats and leading to the development of  provably optimal and computationally efficient solutions. We have also integrated models of human influence into our algorithms. Our major finding is that we can steer human behavior without the participants feeling manipulated. Better yet, an author of a system can use these models without having to a programming expert. This work dovetails very nicely with recent efforts in what is often referred to as interactive machine learning.   These results are available in a number of high-impact conference and journal venues.     Because this project is a CAREER award, the team also focused on educational and curricular changes, particularly around Threads, Georgia Tech's novel approach to developing contextualized computing curricula. This work has been integrated with work supported by another NSF grant to create mechanisms for: (1) creating processes to best develop and assess our own curriculum and (2) to explain the process of developing threads to other departments.
