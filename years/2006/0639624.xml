<AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: 0639624&lt;br/&gt;Title: Error Power and Reliability for Nano-Silicon and Beyond&lt;br/&gt;PI: Sanjukta Bhanja&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of South Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, the underlying design philosophy of electronic design and analysis tools has undergone paradigm shifts from area optimization to timing optimization to power optimization and now is shifting to reliability-centric design optimization. Understanding of the interplay between errors, power dissipation in a chip with its associated side effects, and reliability problems will be the key to commercial success of sub-30nm silicon and nonsilicon technologies. It is expected that statistical theories and probabilistic methods will play significant role in the design of such reliability-centric CAD tools. In this context, the career research goal of the PI is to construct reliability-centric design and analysis tools for the inter-coupled issues of error, power and redundancy for nano-CMOS and other emerging nano-devices, such as quantum-dot cellular automata. There are two main thrusts : one in medium term problems and the other in long term problems. First, in the medium term category are problems related to nano-CMOS for which the PI will research reliability-centric design optimization and analysis tools at logic level for error, power, and reliability of nano-CMOS, taking into account process variability and circuit topology. These models would allow probabilistic abstraction of technology-dependent parameters, such as device characteristics, process parameter variations, and thermal issues, in addition to, structural dependencies among the interconnected components and input uncertainties. In the long term category are problems in novel computing paradigms using emerging nano-devices such as field-coupled computing architectures using quantum-dot cellular automata. The basic issues considered will still be the same, i.e. error, power, and reliability; however, the modeling of these will be driven by the physics of these devices to a larger extent than nano-CMOS. The career teaching goals of the PI spans traditional pedagogic activities, such as developing new courses, and educational research related to VLSI education, such as testing the hypotheses that (a) active learning, based on sensory mode of a student, or (b) "Learning by doing" promotes deeper understanding of VLSI concepts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The  research outcomes are:  We proposed a probabilistic error model based on minimal graphical probabilistic model namely Bayesian networks to estimate this expected output error probability, in the context of probabilistic computing.  We also provide upper bounds of errors that are circuit-specific and can actually diagnose the worst case input vectors for which special redundancies have to be employed.

We modeled the QCA cell arrangement in each zone using a graph-based probabilistic model, which is then transformed into a Markov tree structure defined over subsets of QCA cells. Using this model we studied the trade-off between switching errors and clocking zones.   Designed a power model for Quantum-dot cellular automata  paradigm. Due to their small sizes, power is an important design parameter.

Proposed reliability and defect characterization for Magnetic cellular automata based on fabricated nanostructures. Most important work in this domain was magnetic in-plane crossings and reliability characterization of magnetic wires. Proposed clocking schemes and magnetic layouts for single layer and multi-layer magnets that can be integrated with CMOS to access and control. We  also proposed variation-aware read mechanism for the the multi-layer Magnetic tunnel junction based logic. We were the first to experimentally show Field coupled computing using Magnetic tunnel junctions. This work leads to  not only a very dense memory but also a thermally robust logic as a backup computing element in memory. We have created a framework for non-Boolean computing by creating a new phase plots for coupled magnetic nanodots and experimentally observed the two ground states vortex and single domain at the same fabricated dimension which could have treendous impact on future non-Boolean frameworks.   Career Education Outcomes  We have proposed a knowledge module in the undergraduate logic design course introduced to electrical engineering and computer science students exposing them to nano-computing concepts. A preliminary implementation of the proposed knowledge module that exposes undergraduate students to nano-computing concepts yielded the following responses,      Students showed motivation towards learning more about  nanotechnology and nanocomputing in an effective and understandable way. It also strengthened their knowledge in Kmaps and helped them develop cognitive skills to apply this knowledge in a very novel way.
