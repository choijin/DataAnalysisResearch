<AbstractNarration>The proposed research continues a long-term investigation of regeneration in mangrove forests on Panama's Caribbean coast.  Mangrove forests are a dominant vegetation type along tropical shorelines and are inhabited by a unique fauna and flora that are often distributed in zones along the tidal gradient.  Mangroves also provide resources and services to humans, including nursery grounds for harvested crustaceans and fishes, shoreline protection, and trapping of sediments and pollutants carried in runoff from upland areas.  They are now among the most threatened of coastal habitats due to deforestation associated with resource exploitation (e.g. aquaculture, mining) and development.  In the study area, mangrove forest structure and dynamics are the products of regeneration across a mosaic of differently aged canopy gaps created by lightning.  This study employs long-term observations and field experiments to identify the mechanisms that determine patterns of regeneration following disturbance and the distributions of mangrove species along the tidal gradient.&lt;br/&gt; This is one of the most comprehensive studies of mangrove community ecology ever conducted.  In addition to enhancing our general understanding of the contributions of abiotic and biotic processes to forest dynamics, it is providing vital information for predicting and remediating human-caused alterations that endanger these valuable wetlands.  The project provides research experience to numerous university students, and supports the environmental education program at Smithsonian's Galeta Marine Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined the processes that determine the structure and dynamics of mangrove forests on the Caribbean coast of Panama.  A suite of observational and experimental studies demonstrated that mangrove forest dynamics and zonation patterns are generated by interacting effects of canopy disturbance, propagule dispersal, habitat-specific herbivory, and interspecific competition.  Species-specific differences in physiological tolerance of edaphic conditions, traditionally invoked to explain mangrove forest structure, do not account for patterns in this study system.  Mangrove forests are the predominant wetland vegetation type along tropical coastlines and estuaries around the world.  The support highly productive ecosystems that afford a variety of ecosystem services, including nursery habitat for important fishery species, wintering habitat for migratory birds, catchment for terrestrial sediments and pollutants, protection against storm surge, and sequestration of large amounts of below-ground carbon.  Despite their multi-faceted value, these unique wetland ecosystems are disappearing at an alarming rate due to clearing and filling for coastal development, pollution, resource overexploitation, and rising sea-levels.  Relatively little is known about the natural processes that structure mangrove communities, information that is essential for predicting their responses to anthropogenic stressors.  Our study has helped fill this void.  The investigation had three major goals: 1) document patterns of natural disturbance in the study forests; 2) identify the mechanisms that control regeneration of canopy trees following disturbance; 3) evaluate prevailing theories concerning the factors that account for the zonation of mangrove species along the tidal gradient.  The study forests contain three species of canopy trees: Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans, and Laguncularia racemosa.  Lightning strikes are the primary natural agent of mangrove canopy disturbance on the Caribbean coast of Panama.  Panama is rarely affected by hurricanes, which are a major source of disturbance to mangroves at higher latitudes.  A single lightning strike can kill up to 60 trees, forming a gap in the canopy (Fig. 1).  This disturbance increases the availability of light and soil nutrients, and initiates canopy tree regeneration (Fig. 2).  Our experiments have examined the patterns and mechanisms of canopy tree replacement.  Initiated in 1995 and 1997, and monitored through 2013, they tested for the effects of interspecific competition and insect herbivory on the growth and survival of juvenile mangroves (Figs. 3 and 4).  In addition, these experiments included reciprocal transplants of the species along the tidal gradient to test the role of physiological tolerance in limiting species distributions.  The results were surprising -- all three species were able to survive and grow at any tidal level; physiological responses to soil chemistry are not limiting their distributions.  Regardless of tidal elevation, all three species grow and survive better inside gaps than in adjacent, shaded understory.  Juvenile Rhizophora and Avicennia are shade-tolerant and can survive for years under a canopy, persisting as slow-growing saplings until a gap opens nearby, promoting rapid growth.  In contrast, Laguncularia seedlings are shade-intolerant and must establish inside a gap if they are to have any chance of growing into the canopy.  The experiments also revealed the strong impacts of two specialist herbivores, the scolytid beetle, Coccotrypes (Fig. 5), and larvae of the nymphalid butterfly, Junonia (Fig. 6), which killed a high proportion of the experimental seedlings of Rhizophora and Avicennia, respectively.  Their impacts were felt most strongly in forest stands in which their host species dominated the canopy: low intertidal Rhizophora/Laguncularia forests for the beetle and high intertidal Avicennia forests for the caterpillar.  Within low intertida...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
