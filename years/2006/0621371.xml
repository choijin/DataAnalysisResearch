<AbstractNarration>0621371&lt;br/&gt;Hering&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Phosphorus release and metal redox cycling associated with sediment reworking in&lt;br/&gt;the Colorado River Delta, Lake Powell, Utah&lt;br/&gt;Abstract. As a result of the drought that began in 2000 and reservoir operations that provided a&lt;br/&gt;constant water supply to the lower Colorado River basin states, Lake Powell is currently at only&lt;br/&gt;46% capacity. Under these conditions, the river inflows cut through sediments previously&lt;br/&gt;deposited in the Colorado River Delta. We hypothesize that the consequent resuspension of&lt;br/&gt;sediments may result in enhanced phosphorus release and metal redox cycling. In recent years, it&lt;br/&gt;has been observed that anoxia develops in bottom water intersecting the delta sediments, which&lt;br/&gt;could also result in P release due to reductive dissolution of iron oxide carrier phases in the&lt;br/&gt;sediments.&lt;br/&gt;Primary production in Lake Powell is phosphorus limited and changes in phosphorus&lt;br/&gt;availability could have significant ecological consequences. Suspended sediment transported by&lt;br/&gt;the Colorado River is the principal source of phosphorus to Lake Powell; much of this sediment&lt;br/&gt;load is deposited as the Colorado River flows in to the lake (i.e., the river-lake boundary). Thus&lt;br/&gt;previously-deposited delta sediments represent a substantial reservoir of phosphorus.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The proposed project will examine the coupling of biogeochemical and&lt;br/&gt;physical processes and their impacts on phosphorus and trace metal dynamics. Speciation of&lt;br/&gt;phosphorus in solid phases (specifically the suspended sediment and delta sediments) will be&lt;br/&gt;determined and related to the conditions under which phosphorus may be released from the&lt;br/&gt;sediments. The role of reductive dissolution of metal (e.g., iron) oxides in phosphorus release&lt;br/&gt;will also be examined.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. Phosphorus dynamics exert a key control on primary production in&lt;br/&gt;Lake Powell. We anticipate that our results will show whether phosphorus and trace metal&lt;br/&gt;dynamics are altered under the current conditions where Colorado Rived inflows cut through&lt;br/&gt;previously-deposited delta sediments. If phosphorus dynamics are affected, patterns of primary&lt;br/&gt;production and the development of bottom water anoxia during the recovery from drought&lt;br/&gt;conditions may be significantly different from historical patterns.&lt;br/&gt;This SGER project will also support the graduate training of Mr. Richard Wildman, a&lt;br/&gt;third year graduate student in Environmental Science &amp; Engineering at Caltech. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;his academic studies, Mr. Wildman has been actively engaged in outreach and curriculum&lt;br/&gt;development at the Environmental Charter High School in Lawndale, CA, a public school&lt;br/&gt;located in an underserved area of Los Angeles County.&lt;br/&gt;SGER Justification. Because of the current low lake level, there is a unique opportunity to&lt;br/&gt;examine the effects of sediment reworking on nutrient dynamics, specifically phosphorus release&lt;br/&gt;from sediments. Currently, previously-deposited sediments are exposed to river inflows. As the&lt;br/&gt;lake levels rise, these sediments will be resubmerged. Since the extreme drawdown in the 2000-&lt;br/&gt;2004 drought and the above-average inflows of the 2005 run-off are creating unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;physical conditions in the sediment delta, we are requesting SGER funding to examine the&lt;br/&gt;phosphorus and trace metal dynamics in this changing system. This work is also timed to&lt;br/&gt;coincide with planned field sampling by the Bureau of Reclamation, which will provide&lt;br/&gt;logistical support for sampling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
