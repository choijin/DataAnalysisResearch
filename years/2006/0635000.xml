<AbstractNarration>Geometric data derived from sensors is becoming ubiquitous, ranging from temperature and pressure data sampled over wide areas to continuous 3D scans of entire city streets.  Although many more examples can be given, the above share the common characteristics that the relevant sensors are geographically dispersed and that the data itself is dynamically generated, often unstructured, highly variable, and possibly massive.  The goal of this project is to investigate the intrinsic computational complexity and to develop fundamental algorithms for geometric problems involving such distributed networked spatiotemporal data. Potential applications include analyzing environmental data for ecological forecasting (e.g., predicting bio-diversity), landslide or debris flow prediction over extended areas, mining data on trajectories of vehicles or people for traffic management, detecting similar shapes across geographically separated regions for security or asset tracking, and many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional geometric algorithms assume that all data is centrally available and that random access to the data is efficient --- assumptions that are clearly violated in the distributed networked setting. A key component of the project is to develop geometric summaries that preserve the essential features and structure of the data and to study the fundamental trade-offs between the relevant parameters, including the size, accuracy, utility, stability, and computational complexity of these summaries.  The project builds upon the existing sophisticated techniques such as epsilon-nets and approximations, coresets, discrepancy theory, range searching, persistent homology, surface reconstruction and simplification, kinetic data structures, and others. The research involves developing lightweight distributed and streaming algorithms as well as enhancing the theoretical underpinnings of large-scale sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Large Scale Analysis of Sensor-Based Geometric Data  Pankaj K. Agarwal, Duke University  Leonidas J. Guibas, Stanford University     Geometric data derived from sensors is becoming ubiquitous, ranging from temperature and pressure data sampled over wide areas to continuous 3D scans of entire city streets.  Although many more examples can be given, the above share the common characteristics that the relevant sensors are geographically dispersed and that the data itself is dynamically generated, often unstructured, highly variable, and possibly massive.  This project focused on developing fundamental algorithms for geometric problems involving such distributed networked spatiotemporal data.  It required going beyond the traditional algorithmic framework in geometric computing, which assumes that all data is centrally available, data is precise, and that random access to the data is efficient --- assumptions that are clearly violated in the distributed networked setting.  A key component of the project was to design methods for computing summaries of many kinds of flavors that preserve the essential features and structure of the data. We obtained fundamental trade-offs between relevant parameters of summaries, including the size, accuracy, stability, and computational complexity of these summaries.  We also developed lightweight distributed and streaming algorithms as well as enhanced the theoretical underpinnings of large-scale sensor networks.  Using techniques from differential and computational geometry, we investigated the problem of feature analysis and reconstruction of shape data from a more rigorous point view, and obtained reasonable conditions under which our estimations or reconstructions are provably valid.

For example, we designed algorithms for processing the data that is changing continuously &ndash; input objects are moving or deforming continuously.

We used a probabilistic framework to model uncertainty in data and designed  algorithms for some fundamental geometric problems under this framework. We also developed methods for answering various queries under these complex data models.  The research conducted under this project led to over forty publications in high-quality,  peer-reviewed journals and conferences proceedings; four of these publications received best-paper awards, one of them received a best student paper award, and one received the second-best paper award.  Six graduate students, one undergraduate student, and four postdoctoral fellows were partially supported by this grant.
