<AbstractNarration>Jacob Schmidt&lt;br/&gt;0644442&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current technologies for creating freestanding planar lipid bilayer membranes in the laboratory are essentially unchanged over the past 30 years. Scientific studies, clinical research, and technological applications of channel proteins would all benefit greatly from a robust, long-lived, compact, and easily operated membrane platform. The objective of this research is to address these technological needs through the development of two innovations: (1) long-lived, mechanically stabilized membranes and (2) microfluidic systems capable of forming membranes quickly and automatically in an on-demand manner. Preliminary work by the principal investigator's (PI's) laboratory has shown significant improvements in mechanical stability and longevity of a free-standing lipid bilayer membrane can be achieved by encapsulating the membrane within an in situ photo-polymerized hydrogel. In the proposed work, the gel properties will be varied to optimize durability and extend the lifetime of the encapsulated membranes. The PI's laboratory has also developed a novel method of automated membrane formation in a microfluidic device driven by the solvent extraction properties of polydimethylsiloxane. In the proposed work, the existing prototype device will be optimized and generation device--consisting of a planar array of membranes individually addressable through multiplexed channels--will be developed and constructed. In addition to training graduate students, the PI is part of a number of programs to attract and host high school and undergraduate students in his laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
