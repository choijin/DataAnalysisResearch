<AbstractNarration>As high end computing systems (HECs) grow to several tens of thousands of nodes, file I/O is becoming a critical performance issue. Current parallel file systems such as PVFS2 and others, can reasonably stripe data across a hundred nodes and achieve good performance for bulk transfers involving large aligned accesses. Serious performance limits exist, however, for small unaligned&lt;br/&gt;accesses, metadata operations, and accesses impacted by the consistency semantics (any time one process writes data that is read by another).&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research would  study scalable metadata operations, small, unaligned data accesses, reliability through redundancy, and management of I/O resources. The employed techniques  include active caching and buffering, server-to-server and client-to-client communication, and autonomics.  To enhance portability and control complexity proposed research intend to employ middleware whenever possible, and use PVFS2 file system  that allows a large degree of configurability. The proposed research intends to enhance that file system so that it will scale to very large sizes.</AbstractNarration>
