    <AbstractNarration>0630367 &lt;br/&gt;Beck&lt;br/&gt;Computer-based modeling activities are critically important to the success of NSF's proposed environmental observatories (EOs). Models provide the ability to analyze and synthesize large and diverse databases and thus provide increased understanding of behavior of large, complex environmental systems. In this sense, models serve as important components of decision support systems. A major goal of the EOs is to enable the forecasting of future conditions and system behavior, and computer-based models are the only reasonable means to achieve this ability. Models are used widely in science to evaluate the adequacy of existing information and conversely to define information gaps, and models will be used in the EOs to determine what kinds of information needs to be gathered to answer specific science questions. Given the complexity of the field facilities (e.g., networks of sensors) and high costs of deploying such systems, EO planners also expect to use models to evaluate in the optimal geographic distribution of these facilities. In short, modeling will be a pervasive activity in the EOs. The observatories are being designed to transform the ways scientists and engineers conduct research on large, complex systems. New kinds of models and modeling approaches are needed to take advantage of the cyberinfrastructure and collaboratories that the observatories will employ. New types of models also will be needed to address the complex questions that the observatories will be studying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many common elements to the challenge of developing appropriate modeling tools and platforms among the EOs. This workshop, which will be held in Tucson, Arizona in May 2006, is a first step in building collaborations among scientists and engineers from the EO communities to address these common issues in a more efficient manner than each EO community could achieve working separately. The workshop will bring together model developers and model users from the following NSF EOs: NEON and LTER, CLEANER and CUAHSI (Hydrologic Observatories), which comprise the WATERS Network, and OOI. These individuals respectively represent the fields of ecology, environmental engineering, hydrology, and ocean sciences.</AbstractNarration>
