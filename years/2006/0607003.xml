    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: ECS-0607003&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Markovic, Milica&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: California State University-Sacramento&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Student Paper Competition at the 2006 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above referenced proposal requests travel support for 10 students from several U.S. universities that will be the finalists in the Student Paper Competition at the 2006 IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) International Microwave Symposium (IMS). This year it will be held in San Francisco, CA on June 11-16.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The IMS is the major international forum in the microwave research and wireless communications. Each year, students present their work not only to a technical audience but also to a group of technical judges while developing their communications and presentation skills and interacting with experts in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;By promoting this activity, IMS promotes not only education in microwave theory and techniques by building an integrated program inside a major conference but fosters the next generation of microwave engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support of this activity is recommended at the level of $5,000.</AbstractNarration>
