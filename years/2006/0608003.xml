<AbstractNarration>The Deinonychosauria is the group of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs that evolved over 140 million years ago. The group consists of the sickle-clawed Dromaeosauridae (Velociraptor and its kin) and Troodontidae, which many consider the most intelligent of dinosaurs based on their cranial anatomy and size of their braincase relative to their body size.  Deinonychosaurs are generally regarded as the closest relative to birds based on numerous morphological and behavioral characteristics.  As part of this project, the researchers will describe and illustrate the morphology of abundant new material of Dromaeosauridae and new specimens of primitive Troodontidae, which still have their bones attached at the joints. These newly discovered Chinese and Mongolian dromaeosaurids and troodontids display interesting mosaics of primitive and advanced traits and raise several issues concerning evolutionary relationships among deinonychosaurs and birds. This study will include a comprehensive analysis of over 70 dinosaurs that will result in an evolutionary tree for the group.  The study of the evolutionary relationships and character change within the Deinonychosauria will shed light on the origin and evolution of flight within modern birds.&lt;br/&gt;           &lt;br/&gt;The results will be broadly disseminated to the public and scientific communities through presentations at professional society meetings, incorporation into course curriculum and museum exhibitions, and through public lectures.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
