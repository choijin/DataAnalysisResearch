<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;0601734&lt;br/&gt;Peumans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to improve the performance of future very-large-scale-integrated systems by developing molecular-scale transistors that have improved switching (on-off) characteristics. By reducing the static power consumption, large gains in overall power consumption and system performance will be achievable. The approach is to exploit polaronic effects present in engineered molecular materials to cause electrons to bind together, leading to the formation of electron bunches in the molecular channel that behave as charge carriers with several times the elementary charge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach uses the novel concept of carrier bunching to improve the performance of field-effect devices. This may result in a revolutionary improvement in performance without requiring a change in circuit design paradigms. Moreover, since the proposed approach is scalable through molecular design, it provides a path toward the very dense and very large integrated circuits of the future. Indeed, lowering the switching power,  , while maintaining a high on/off ratio will remain perhaps the most important engineering challenge for the semiconductor industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program integrates research and education to explore novel, nanoscale electronic devices which employ novel charge-lattice interaction effects. The research will be conducted in close collaboration with industry such that the participating students will be trained to apply advances in nanotechnology for real-world solutions. Public education in nanoscience and nanotechnology is an integral part of the program through engaging public advocates in the research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
