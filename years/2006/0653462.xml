<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the Penn State group's participation in and support of LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) activities.  Work supported under this award includes the analysis of LIGO data for gravitational wave bursts arising from astronomical sources, including but not limited to supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and black hole mergers; the development of simulated data sets to support the analysis activities of other LSC research groups; investigations into detector noise sources and their mitigation; and the interpretation of LIGO observations with the goal of astronomical discovery.&lt;br/&gt;All these activities center on making tighter the connection between LIGO observations and their astrophysical interpretation, and increasing the sensitivity of LIGO observations through more sophisticated and discriminating analysis techniques, and through improved data quality and understanding of the detector.  The broader impact of these activities includes enabling the broader LIGO mission, the development of gravitational wave observations as a tool of astronomical discovery, the research education and training of postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Gravitational Wave Astronomy with LIGO Data" (NSF award PHY 0653462) was devoted to the US national effort to detect gravitational waves and harness their potential for increasing our understanding of the fundamental physics of gravity and as a tool of astronomical discovery.   Gravity is, on a cosmic scale, the most significant of the four fundamental forces which are believed to govern all natural phenomena. It is responsible for the most energetic phenomena, observed or hypothesized, in the Universe. Unlike the other fundamental forces of Nature (the electromagnetic, the strong and the weak) it is inextricably linked to the very nature of space and time themselves.Understanding gravity is akin to understanding the space, time and their connection to each other.
