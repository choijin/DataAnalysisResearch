<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Page A&lt;br/&gt;Urban Massachusetts Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The Urban Massachusetts Alliance for Minority Participation (UMLSAMP) is comprised of the&lt;br/&gt;University of Massachusetts Boston, UMass Dartmouth, UMass Lowell, and Wentworth Institute&lt;br/&gt;of Technology and their community college colleagues Bunker Hill, Roxbury, Bristol, and&lt;br/&gt;Middlesex Led by UMass Boston, The UMLSAMP is designed to address three interrelated&lt;br/&gt;problems. First, the number of underrepresented students at the Alliance institutions&lt;br/&gt;majoring in STEM fields is relatively small. In Fall 2004, only 820 Alliance&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates were enrolled in a STEM major, 12% of the total. Of the students who do&lt;br/&gt;enroll in a STEM major, far too few graduate--only 99 STEM BS degrees were awarded to&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students by Alliance institutions in 2004. Finally, there is a&lt;br/&gt;lack of alignment between courses and programs offered by community colleges and the&lt;br/&gt;four-year institutions to which the majority of their students transfer. Lack of&lt;br/&gt;alignment also often greatly increases the amount of time it takes students to progress to&lt;br/&gt;degree completion.&lt;br/&gt;The Urban Massachusetts LSAMP (UMLSAMP) will aggressively recruit underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minority students from local high schools and partner community colleges who have an&lt;br/&gt;interest in STEM. The UMLSAMP will implement new and expand existing bridge programs for&lt;br/&gt;incoming freshmen and for community college transfer students where students will take&lt;br/&gt;intensive math courses, interdisciplinary STEM courses and work part-time in research&lt;br/&gt;labs. The UMLSAMP will implement facilitated study groups for the gateway courses to&lt;br/&gt;further ensure success. AMP students will be provided mentored research experiences and&lt;br/&gt;other scholarly activities, including opportunities to attend research seminars, talks,&lt;br/&gt;and conferences. AMP students will have access to a drop in center and will receive&lt;br/&gt;intensive mentoring from peers, faculty, advisors focused on making sure the students,&lt;br/&gt;especially during the first two years, successfully progress into and through college and&lt;br/&gt;helping them develop and define their academic and career goals. Finally UMLSAMP members&lt;br/&gt;will focus on articulation and alignment of STEM courses and degree programs between the&lt;br/&gt;community colleges and the four year institutions.&lt;br/&gt;The Alliance members value the synergy that results from working collaboratively and, in&lt;br/&gt;addition to joint governance of the Alliance, have planned several activities to&lt;br/&gt;capitalize on the group?s collective wisdom and energy, including joint planning and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of activities, common data metrics and benchmarks and identification of&lt;br/&gt;institutional obstacles that impede the progress of underrepresented students in STEM&lt;br/&gt;majors, and an annual research and best practices conference will be rotated among the&lt;br/&gt;Alliance Institutions. We expect to achieve the following outcomes by the end of five&lt;br/&gt;years:&lt;br/&gt;1. 50% increase in the number of Black, Hispanic, and Native American students majoring in&lt;br/&gt;STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;2. 150% increase the number of BS STEM degrees conferred on Black, Hispanic, and Native&lt;br/&gt;American students&lt;br/&gt;3. 150% increase the number of students who successfully transfer from Alliance community&lt;br/&gt;colleges into BS STEM majors.&lt;br/&gt;Each of the Alliance members have extensive experience in minority student development and&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Page A&lt;br/&gt;have drawn upon the literature on the retention of low income, first generation, and&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented students and studies of best practice in minority student development in&lt;br/&gt;the sciences (intellectual merit) in designing the proposed LSAMP. The Alliance will&lt;br/&gt;implement activities with intellectual merit which will have several broad impacts. First,&lt;br/&gt;the impact of project activities on student success in gateway math and science courses&lt;br/&gt;will be carefully evaluated and those that are most effective will be institutionalized.&lt;br/&gt;Second, because the project has a particular focus on underrepresented students and on&lt;br/&gt;transitioning community college students to baccalaureate degree programs, it will&lt;br/&gt;contribute important knowledge to the field. Finally, project results and effective&lt;br/&gt;strategies will be disseminated to other institutions through an annual report on "Lessons&lt;br/&gt;Learned" and "Best Practices."</AbstractNarration>
