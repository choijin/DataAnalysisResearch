    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel chemistry to prepare metal fluorides by the direct reaction of metals with fluorocarbons. The new process is highly suited to the manufacture of: (1) wires for optical communications; (2) high-surface-area metal fluoride catalysts used in the generation of fluoropolymers; and, (3) optical thin films such as anti-reflective coatings. The final example represents an $8 billion market at this time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As compared with the deposition methods presently employed by industry, the chemistry proposed is inherently cheaper and faster; in addition it does not use the extremely hazardous reagents that are now required. The project aims to involve under-represented students as interns, and to support the retention of these and other graduates in Iowa by helping to build a high tech research base in the state.</AbstractNarration>
