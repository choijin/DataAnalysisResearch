<AbstractNarration>Chemical communication by pheromones is the predominant mode of information &lt;br/&gt;transfer in most vertebrates. The female garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) sex &lt;br/&gt;pheromone, a nonpolar, hydrophobic blend of saturated and monounsaturated methyl &lt;br/&gt;ketones, is insoluble in aqueous solutions. This pheromone is detected by the &lt;br/&gt;vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is specialized for the reception of nonvolatile &lt;br/&gt;chemical cues, but the mechanism by which the pheromone gains access to the &lt;br/&gt;aqueous environment of the organ is unknown. Preliminary data indicate that the &lt;br/&gt;Harderian glands' (HG) secretions, which duct exclusively into the VNO in snakes, &lt;br/&gt;contain solubilizing and/or pheromone-binding properties. For over 300 years, the &lt;br/&gt;function of the cephalic HG has been the subject of speculation from numerous &lt;br/&gt;sources.  Certainly their relatively large size, their phylogenetic age, and persistent &lt;br/&gt;conservation in almost all tetrapod groups as they emerged from an aqueous to an &lt;br/&gt;air/land environment suggest that they probably play an important role in the &lt;br/&gt;physiological adaptation to terrestrial life.  This project will examine the role of the &lt;br/&gt;HG as a mediator in providing access for the female sex pheromone to the VNO of male &lt;br/&gt;garter snakes.  Using radiolabeled garter snake sex pheromone, studies will be &lt;br/&gt;conducted to determine the solubilizing effect of HG secretion on the female sex &lt;br/&gt;pheromone and the potential of the HG secretion to possess pheromone-binding &lt;br/&gt;proteins.  &lt;br/&gt;The effects of HG removal on courtship behavior and prey attack, both known to require &lt;br/&gt;a functional VN system, will also be investigated, as will the effects of seasonal and &lt;br/&gt;hormonal variation on the composition of the HG. The integrative research described &lt;br/&gt;here will provide demonstrations of a novel mechanism by which nonpolar, hydrophobic &lt;br/&gt;pheromone molecules reach the VNO, using a very well characterized system: the VN &lt;br/&gt;system of garter snakes.  If a pheromone-binding protein is involved, it will be the &lt;br/&gt;first identified in a non-mammalian species.  This research will provide a compelling &lt;br/&gt;model for the examination of HG involvement in perireceptor events mediating VNO &lt;br/&gt;function of other mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates.  In addition, this study &lt;br/&gt;takes advantage of two unambiguous, quantifiable behaviors exhibited by a species in &lt;br/&gt;its natural habitat that not only offers a robust model for insights into seasonal shifts &lt;br/&gt;in reproductive behavior and feeding, but also proposes a physiological mechanism &lt;br/&gt;mediating these seasonally regulated changes.  This proposal involves an integrative, &lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary approach including field and lab studies that will yield significant &lt;br/&gt;insights into the unifying principles of pheromonal communication common to many, &lt;br/&gt;if not most, vertebrates. The broader impacts of this proposal include multidisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;training in research and education through the mentoring of graduate students, &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates and outreach to high school and grade school students.  &lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates are an integral part of the PI's laboratories, assisting in animal &lt;br/&gt;husbandry, field work and behavior experiments.  These undergraduates have been &lt;br/&gt;co-authors on 23 published papers from the two laboratories.  The PI's have a &lt;br/&gt;long-term commitment to mentoring, with more than a dozen high school students &lt;br/&gt;involved in minority training programs and Intel/Westinghouse competitions, and an &lt;br/&gt;additional nine high school students having worked in an NSF-initiated Apprenticeships &lt;br/&gt;in Science and Engineering program.  These experiences, coupled with appropriate &lt;br/&gt;course work, will provide a firm foundation for these scientists-in-training to &lt;br/&gt;experience the joys and frustration of field and laboratory work. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
