<AbstractNarration>The research goal of this project is to advance the capabilities of the University of Wyoming (UW) King Air research aircraft for cloud, aerosol, and water vapor observations through the development of two new airborne lidar systems.  The instrument development is coupled with development of some retrieval algorithms that combine multiple remote sensor measurements and others that combine remotely sensed and in situ measurements.  Project objectives are to develop:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) a compact airborne elastic lidar to be used onboard the UW King Air alongside the Wyoming cloud radar, a 183 GHz radiometer, and in situ cloud and precipitation probes for studying cloud processes and properties;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) retrieval algorithms to provide cloud microphysical properties in ice-, mixed-phase, and warm clouds including: ice water content, ice particle effective radius, liquid water path, water droplet effective radius, and drizzle size;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) a compact airborne Raman lidar system and associated data processing/analysis software to measure aerosol backscattering and extinction coefficients and to derive water vapor mixing ratio profiles in the boundary layer; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and to conduct&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) exploratory experiments to test and refine the two lidars plus the microwave radiometer, and to collect data for algorithm development and validation; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) studies of the evolution of mid-level, mixed-phase clouds using these new observational capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main intellectual merit of this project is development of an advanced airborne observation instrumentation suite and associated data processing algorithms that will be capable of providing better observations to study the aerosol direct and indirect effects, cloud microphysical processes, and land-atmosphere and air-sea interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Enhancing the capabilities of the UW King Air research aircraft as a combined in situ/ remote sensing platform.  Following the development and demonstration of these capabilities, they will become available to the atmospheric research community as part of the UW King Air national facility (A NSF-supported, lower-atmosphere observing facility).&lt;br/&gt;2) Use of the new observational capabilities to help improve our of understanding of clouds, aerosols, and boundary layer processes, which are needed to confidently predict human impacts on climate.&lt;br/&gt;3) Training the next generation of researchers to use observations to address current science questions.&lt;br/&gt;4) Strengthening the atmospheric observation curricula and teaching at UW.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Wave cloud cases during the WAICO showed a strong evidence of temporal dependent of heterogeneous ice generation in wave clouds. The enhanced boundary layer observation capabilities from UWKA open new opportunities to study boundary layer processes and phenomena. For example, we observed strong horizontal gradient of water vapor up to 10 g/kg/km and complex dynamics interaction across the dry line during the KAPEE.
