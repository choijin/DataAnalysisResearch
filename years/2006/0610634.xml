<AbstractNarration>                                                                Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In partnership with the Science.gov Alliance, the principal investigator, Dr.&lt;br/&gt;William E. McHenry and the co-principal investigator Dr. John S. Colonias propose to&lt;br/&gt;create a web-based comprehensive one-stop science, technology, engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics (STEM) educational resource tool  the Science Education Resource Virtual&lt;br/&gt;Diversity Center (SER Virtual Diversity Center). The SER Virtual Diversity Center will&lt;br/&gt;feature: (1) STEM education programs by category of federal support; (2) promising&lt;br/&gt;practices and lessons learned from federal STEM education supporting agencies as well as&lt;br/&gt;from the institutions they support; (3) STEM-based educational resources for students and&lt;br/&gt;parents; and (4) a virtual electronic campus designed to assist institutions in sharing&lt;br/&gt;STEM educational courses and degree programs using the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merit. The SER Virtual Diversity Center will serve as the major STEM education content&lt;br/&gt;portal for federal programs that target increasing participation from women,&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities in the STEM workforce and&lt;br/&gt;eventually serve as a tool for sharing information on all strategies designed to address&lt;br/&gt;the nation's STEM workforce needs. The SER Virtual Diversity Center will use&lt;br/&gt;technology-enabled processes to connect federal agencies with each other and with higher&lt;br/&gt;education faculty and administrators; K-12 teachers, counselors, administrators; students&lt;br/&gt;and parents in order to achieve dramatic improvement in efficiency for those involved in&lt;br/&gt;increasing minority participation in STEM -- especially federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact. As outlined in the BEST Report, the participation of American students in STEM&lt;br/&gt;fields must dramatically increase if America is to remain competitive in a global economy.&lt;br/&gt;With the American population becoming more diverse, students from groups that are&lt;br/&gt;traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields must be encouraged to participate.&lt;br/&gt;Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions&lt;br/&gt;(HSIs), and Tribal Colleges have a record of unparalleled success with these students. The&lt;br/&gt;NSF's HRD Programs, especially the Model Institutions for Excellence (MIE) and alliance&lt;br/&gt;programs, are examples of the impact partnerships between the federal government and&lt;br/&gt;minority-serving institutions can have on increasing the capacity of those institutions&lt;br/&gt;for producing STEM professionals. Purposively, the SER Virtual Diversity Center will&lt;br/&gt;enable federal agency program officers to better access information across agency lines,&lt;br/&gt;coordinate science education initiatives, and connect agencies more directly with higher&lt;br/&gt;education institutions and their faculty and school districts and their teachers,&lt;br/&gt;counselors, students, and parents to create STEM knowledge-based communities.&lt;br/&gt;The authors propose to create a one-stop SER Virtual Diversity Center through which&lt;br/&gt;federal agency program officers and others can view:  (1) STEM education programs by&lt;br/&gt;category of federal support; (2) promising practices and lessons learned from federal STEM&lt;br/&gt;education supporting agencies as well as from the institutions they support; (3)&lt;br/&gt;STEM-based educational resources for students and parents; and (4) a virtual electronic&lt;br/&gt;campus designed to assist institutions in sharing STEM educational courses and degree&lt;br/&gt;programs using the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
