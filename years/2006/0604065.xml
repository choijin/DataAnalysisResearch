<AbstractNarration>McKenzie will investigate algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;questions which involve properties of finite algebras determined by the&lt;br/&gt;varieties and quasi-varieties they generate, and&lt;br/&gt;structural questions which involve the necessary algebraic properties&lt;br/&gt;that must be true throughout a locally finite variety or quasi-variety &lt;br/&gt;as a consequence of that class possessing some natural property defined &lt;br/&gt;through logical or set-theoretic means.  &lt;br/&gt;The outstanding algorithmic questions:  Is there an algorithm to&lt;br/&gt;determine if the quasi-equations valid in a finite algebra  F  &lt;br/&gt;are finitely based?  Is there an algorithm to determine if the &lt;br/&gt;quasi-variety generated by  F  possesses a natural duality?  &lt;br/&gt;Is the class of finite algebras possessing a finite equational basis &lt;br/&gt;recursively enumerable?  Is the class of finite algebras generating &lt;br/&gt;a residually large variety recursively enumerable?  &lt;br/&gt;Among the important structural questions:  What collection of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;properties is necessary and sufficient for a finitely generated variety to&lt;br/&gt;be finitely decidable, or to have few models?  &lt;br/&gt;He will work on an algebraic conjecture that, if proved, would establish an&lt;br/&gt;important case of the&lt;br/&gt;dichotomy conjecture for the constraint satisfaction problem of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science:  every finite algebra  F  in a meet semi-distributive&lt;br/&gt;variety has finite relational width.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator believes that research&lt;br/&gt;into the interplay between, on the one hand, the existence or nonexistence&lt;br/&gt;of algorithms to recognize fundamental properties of finite algebras, &lt;br/&gt;and on the other hand, the levels of structural complexity manifested &lt;br/&gt;in the algebras---what this project is all about---has the potential &lt;br/&gt;not only to expand our understanding of the structural possibilities in &lt;br/&gt;finite algebraic systems (which it has already done), but to produce&lt;br/&gt;fundamental breakthroughs in theoretical computer science.&lt;br/&gt;The most likely place for this to occur soon is in the algebraic approach&lt;br/&gt;to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP).&lt;br/&gt;Specific instances of the constraint satisfaction problem, &lt;br/&gt;including graph homomorphism problems,&lt;br/&gt;are ubiquitous in many areas of artificial intelligence, computer&lt;br/&gt;science, database theory, scheduling, networking, hardware verification, etc. &lt;br/&gt;The algebraic approach puts some of the most developed areas of&lt;br/&gt;universal algebra, especially the machinery of tame congruence theory&lt;br/&gt;developed by the principal investigator, to work in the study of combinatorial problems &lt;br/&gt;related to the CSP;&lt;br/&gt;and it may have potential applications&lt;br/&gt;in the study of other computational paradigms, such as approximation &lt;br/&gt;and randomized algorithms, and quantum computation.</AbstractNarration>
