<AbstractNarration>The PI is proposing the combination of theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to improve the performance of direct methanol fuel cells.  The direct methanol fuel cell offers advantages over the hydrogen fuel cell that would allow for applications requiring low power over long periods of time, such as portable electronic devices, ease of operation without the need for pressurized fuel, low operating temperatures, and high energy density.  The purpose of the proposed research is to develop predictive multi-scale models to describe the chemistry/transport interactions in DMFC anodes on a detailed level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single crystal electrode test fixture is innovative and works well with the proposed experimental approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A concern was expressed that the scope is too narrow and other important aspects of direct methanol fuel cells were not being addressed with this work.  However, the scope that the PI has defined is of sufficient breadth for a major advancement in multi-scale modeling that will influence future design.  Where appropriate the PI should consider the other reaction mechanisms, the role of water, the potential for a three-electrode experimental system, and the distance between the membrane and the Pt electrode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The popular knowledge of fuel cell technology will be an advantage for attracting high school and undergraduate students to consider science and engineering as potential career fields.  One approach that is proposed is to host a high school teacher during the summer to work with the research group and take back experience and insight to the classroom.  The second approach is to bring a high school student into the research group as an intern.  Portions of the research geared to the appropriate level would be assigned be assigned to the high school student.  The third approach is to include undergraduate students in the research group as summer interns.  The proposed approaches will extend opportunities for science and engineering careers to under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are teaching and research activities effectively (sufficiently) integrated?  The PI concentrated on addressing educational aspects outside of the graduate level.  There are indications that new courses will be developed that are directly related to this research.  However, no details were provided about the nature of these courses.  The PI should address this and provide information about the integration of the research in current teaching if appropriate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
