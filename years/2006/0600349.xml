<AbstractNarration>Algebraic Approaches to Flow and Cycle Conjectures for Graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed project will focus on applying certain algebraic ideas in an&lt;br/&gt;attempt to prove the major open conjectures about flows and cycle covers&lt;br/&gt;in graphs. The ultimate goal is to prove all of the major open conjectures&lt;br/&gt;about flows and cycle covers in graphs, while the realistic expectation is&lt;br/&gt;to produce plenty of good mathematics in the attempt. Two big conjectures&lt;br/&gt;in this area are Tutte's 5-flow conjecture (T5FC) and the Cycle Double&lt;br/&gt;Cover Conjecture (CDCC) of Szekeres and various strengthenings of CDCC,&lt;br/&gt;including the Orientable Five Cycle Double Cover Conjecture (O5CDCC) of&lt;br/&gt;Archdeacon and Jaeger, which implies both T5FC and CDCC and many other&lt;br/&gt;strengthenings of CDCC. These in turn are all implied by the PI's&lt;br/&gt;Petersen-or-K_4 Flow Conjecture (P10vK4FC), the proof of which is the&lt;br/&gt;ultimate goal of the proposed project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These conjectures, which are very well known to graph theorists,&lt;br/&gt;especially T5FC and CDCC, are in the same family of mathematical problems&lt;br/&gt;as the Four Color Theorem (4CT) which is even much more widely known to&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and the general public. Most research on these problems&lt;br/&gt;depends primarily on combinatorial graph theoretic techniques. The novelty&lt;br/&gt;of the PI's approach is to apply many algebraic, as well as topological,&lt;br/&gt;ideas in addition to all the usual combinatorial graph theoretic ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
