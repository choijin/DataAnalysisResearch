<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to partially support the organization of HSCC'06 Ninth International Workshop on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control, to be held in Santa Barbara, California, from March 29 to March 31, 2006.  The annual workshop on hybrid systems attracts researchers from academia and industry interested in modeling, analysis, and implementation of dynamic and reactive systems involving both discrete and continuous behaviors. Representative topics include modeling and representation, analysis and verification, computability and complexity, synthesis and design, control and optimization, and identification and estimation for hybrid systems, and applications to sciences and engineering disciplines, such as biology, avionics, automotive control, embedded systems, manufacturing, and robotics. The workshop is interdisciplinary and brings together researchers from computer science, applied mathematics, and control engineering.  This award also supports an additional event entitled Topics in Computation and Control,which will be held in the two days preceding HSCC'06 (March 27 and 28). In this event, renowned researchers working in domains at the intersection of computation and control will give in depth tutorial presentations covering both theoretical and practical aspects of control and computation, with special emphasis on (1) computationally efficient analysis methods for hybrid systems and (2) emerging application domains such as systems biology and the mutual interaction between communication and control.</AbstractNarration>
