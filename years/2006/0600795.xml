    <AbstractNarration>With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the work of Professor Angel E. Kaifer, of the Chemistry Department at the University of Miami, Miami, FL. This research will examine the relationship between supramolecular structures and their spectroscopic and electrochemical properties. A number of novel dendrimers containing a covalently attached redox active group will be synthesized and characterized. These molecules will be designed to undergo self-assembly upon electron transfer. Thus, control of molecular aggregation will be achieved through redox mediation. The chemistry and binding properties of a series of cucurbituril molecular cavities will be investigated with the aim of learning more about the molecular recognition properties of these novel hosts and their behavior in the presence of redox active guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of these investigations will make important contributions to the development of molecular devices and in other nanotechnological applications. This research is designed to foster training across the traditional disciplines of chemistry ranging from synthesis to electrochemistry. Special emphasis will be placed on training underrepresented minorities at all levels, from high school students to postdoctoral associates.</AbstractNarration>
