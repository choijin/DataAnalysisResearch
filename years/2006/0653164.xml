<AbstractNarration>The University of South Carolina (USC) is increasing the number of graduates of its science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs through a combination of recruitment and retention efforts. A particular focus is on reaching students who are on the edge of dropping out of STEM careers due either to insufficient background or being a "late bloomer," only recently discovering an affinity for the sciences. To support these efforts the project team has established strong ties between faculty at USC and the students, counselors, and faculty from the state technical colleges, the USC branch campuses, and regional secondary schools. The recruitment plan includes i) outreach to high school career and guidance counselors, ii) continuing education credit in STEM counseling granted for successful completion of an associated professional development curriculum, and iii) the use of broad-based interdisciplinary seminar courses, along with history and philosophy of science and technology courses to attract non-STEM students to STEM disciplines. The retention plan features i) new bridge courses to prepare students for the rigors of STEM disciplines (especially calculus), ii) development of a Summer Institute to improve the "math readiness" of students and to coordinate STEM research experiences, and iii) broad-based student support activities for all STEM majors and activities that target majors with the lowest retention rates. The intellectual merit of the project rests in the strong and diverse team of faculty and administrators committed to the project and their wide-ranging interests and experiences, which are focused particularly on the "at risk" students described above. The broader impacts of the project are being felt through the comprehensive involvement of leading institutions at all levels in the state's higher education system. Such involvement affects in turn a large number of in-state students with resulting benefits to increasing the state's STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

In our own published research we have confirmed that it is important for universities to take steps to improve transfer studentsÆ sense of community, not only for reasons pertaining to transfer studentsÆ quality of life and their needs for belonging, but also in light of our findings suggesting that sense of community has a positive influence on transfer studentsÆ academic performance.  In continuing research efforts, we have examined studentsÆ sense of community ratings in relation to two comparison groups and found that there was a trend (see Figure 3) such that program participants reported higher sense of community compared to transfer students not participating in the program.
