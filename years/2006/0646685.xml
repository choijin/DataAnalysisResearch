    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project will lay the foundations for an international conference on women&lt;br/&gt;in leadership to be held in Fall 2007. This exploratory research project will examine&lt;br/&gt;what is known about women in leadership throughout various sectors and identify what&lt;br/&gt;further research is needed to improve our understanding and knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;This project will encompass&lt;br/&gt;A. Research Review: a thorough review of the research on women's leadership in&lt;br/&gt;different sectors.&lt;br/&gt;B. Development of Comprehensive Bibliography: from the research review, a&lt;br/&gt;bibliography will be developed and made widely available.&lt;br/&gt;C. Identification of Researchers: researchers working in the different sectors will be&lt;br/&gt;identified; a selected number will be invited to participate in the conference.&lt;br/&gt;D. Development of Conference Framework: the issues and questions to be addressed at&lt;br/&gt;the conference will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;E. Preparation of Grant Proposal: grant to support the conference will be developed and&lt;br/&gt;submitted.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project and conference will provide insight into our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of STEM women in leadership and of women's leadership in STEM,&lt;br/&gt;across different sectors and disciplines, in an interdisciplinary way that has not been&lt;br/&gt;broached.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The interdisciplinary approach of this project will lead to a clearer&lt;br/&gt;understanding of women in leadership, and will yield strategies and approaches to crossfertilize&lt;br/&gt;successes across different sectors. The potential impact of knowledge transfer&lt;br/&gt;from one sector to another could lead to strategies for significantly increasing the&lt;br/&gt;advancement of women to leadership positions.</AbstractNarration>
