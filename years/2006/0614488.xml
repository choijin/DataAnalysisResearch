<AbstractNarration>Understanding factors that regulate the composition and diversity of communities is a key aim in ecology, but is also necessary to anticipate and mediate impacts of environmental change on ecosystems. A long-term field experiment will be established to investigate the role of seed availability, local ecological interactions and chance factors in governing the dynamics of grassland communities along gradients of nitrogen fertilization. Experimental communities will be planted to establish a variety of initial conditions with respect to species diversity, composition and abundance. Once established, these communities will be exposed to varying levels of nitrogen fertilization to evaluate the extent to which fates of species and changes in the community are predictable based upon functional traits and initial population sizes of species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to understanding of community formation along gradients of nitrogen availability, but also yield information applicable to grassland management and restoration. This project will contribute to education and training of female graduate students and undergraduates from University of Kansas (KU) and Haskell Indian Nations University. Minority students will present at meetings of the Ecological Society and the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans. The project will be integrated into an existing public outreach program run by the KU Field Station. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
