<AbstractNarration>John T. Fourkas, Robert A. Walker, John D. Weeks (University of Maryland College Park) and Bruce J. Berne (Columbia University) are jointly supported to study the structural and dynamic properties of liquids at solid surfaces. The team will combine experimental and theoretical approaches to develop an accurate and quantitative description of the behavior of different classes of liquid-silica interfaces. Efforts will focus on important issues including 1) the effects of inter-phase forces between a solid and a liquid on interfacial structure and dynamics; 2) the effects of liquid structure and connectivity on interfacial structure and dynamics; 3) differences in interfacial behavior among alkanes, alkane nitriles, and aromatic molecules; and 4) the influence of surface topology on interfacial solvent structure and dynamics. The team will use a variety of spectroscopic tools, including ultrafast optical Kerr effect spectroscopy and surface-selective, second-order, nonlinear-optical spectroscopies to study liquids at solid interfaces, and will develop a hybrid of the techniques that can probe the orientational dynamics of liquids at interfaces while excluding any singnal from molecules in the bulk liquid. Theoretical efforts will focus on developing realistic models of the solid substrates, on determining how short-range interactions between these substrates and an adjacent liquid force interfacial solvent species to organize at the liquid/solid interface, and on how this organization influences dynamics. Once validated, the models will be used to predict interfacial solvent dynamics and guide the development of new experimental methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing a detailed picture of structure and dynamics at solid/liquid interfaces will have a direct impact on many areas of chemistry, physics, biology, and other sciences.  Examples of areas in which the knowledge gained will be useful include corrosion, bone calcification, lubrication, separations and oil recovery.  This project is funded through the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program (CRC) and provides collaborative training and research opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proximity to an interface can change the chemical and physical properties of a liquid dramatically.  This project used a combination of experiment, simulation and theory to develop a detailed understanding of how the behavior of a set of prototypical organic liquids changes near a silica surface.  The work was performed within four different research groups, those of , John Fourkas (University of Maryland) and Rob Walker (University of Maryland, now Montana State University), John Weeks (University of Maryland) and Bruce Berne (Columbia  University).  Here we summarize some of the major project outcomes.     Intellectual merit.  Our experimental research involved two major techniques.  Vibrational sum-frequency-generation (VSFG) spectroscopy provides detailed information regarding the organization of interfacial liquids, while optical Kerr effect (OKE) spectroscopy is sensitive to the manner in which molecules change their orientations.  By combining these techniques with molecular dynamics simulations, we were able to gain detailed new insights into the properties of three important classes of organic liquids at the interface with silica.  One of our key discoveries is that a silica interface causes a common solvent, acetonitrile, to form ordered structures similar to those seen in cell membranes.  Furthermore, this type of structure repeats several times as one moves away from the interface into the bulk liquid.  This novel structuring has important ramifications for chemical processes such as separations and catalysis.  Studies of liquids closely related to acetonitrile allowed us to determine the crucial factors that govern this ordering and how these factors change with simple modifications to molecular structure.  Work on another common solvent, methanol, revealed a different type of interfacial ordering.  Due to the strong interaction of methanol with a silica surface, there is a dense, strongly adsorbed layer at the interface.  This layer is so tightly packed that it prevents the formation of a corresponding second layer.  Spectroscopic experiments revealed, in particular, that the electrostatic properties of the interface differ strongly from those of the bulk liquid.  Thus, this unique surface organization has a direct impact on the chemistry of the interfacial liquid.  A third common solvent that we studied was benzene.  Due to its high symmetry, benzene is not expected to yield a signal in VSFG spectroscopy.  However, we found that the signal was strong at all interfaces studied.  Based on this observation, we developed a new model that explains how intermolecular interactions can lead to a VSFG signal under circumstances where none is expected.  This model should also be applicable to liquids that are expected to give a strong VSFG signal.  In addition, we observed experimentally that benzene appears to take on a greater density near a silica surface than in the bulk.  We developed a new scheme for using simulations to determine liquid density in confinement.  Results from this method support the picture of benzene densification in confinement.  The method we developed was also found to work in a broad range of other confined fluids.     Broader impacts.  Silica is arguably the most important solid interface on Earth.  In a geological context, silica plays a major role in problems ranging from oil recovery to remediation of environmental contamination.  From an industrial standpoint, silica is involved in crucial technologies that include chemical separations and catalysis.  The knowledge we have gained regarding the behavior of liquids near silica is directly applicable to all of these processes and many more that are important to society.  In the course of pursuing this research we have also developed technologies that will be of great values to others in the field.  We designed and fabricated a new type of spectrometer for performing broadband VSFG spectroscopy.  This instrument has increased the sensitivity o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
