<AbstractNarration>EAR-0630535&lt;br/&gt;HOCHELLA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has recently been determined that the behavior of minerals and other naturally occurring phases with at least one dimension in the nanometer range deviates, sometimes dramatically, from the behavior of larger examples of the same phases. Given that these&lt;br/&gt;nanophases are widespread and abundant in nature, it is critical to understand these deviations in the context of essentially all geosystems. As a result, the nanoscience of nature, including the closely associated field of molecular geochemistry, are emerging fields that are becoming key components of environmental geochemistry in terrestrial, ocean, and atmospheric studies. The payoff is large, in that new explanations of Earth's processes will emerge.&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed that an NSF-sponsored working group be assembled for two days to discuss the frontiers of molecular- and nano-environmental geochemistry research, and subsequently to produce an article on this subject for submission to a high profile, widely read publication such as Science or EOS. The working group can assemble in Arlington,&lt;br/&gt;Virginia, and therefore they will be able to present their findings on the second day to NSF program managers interested in this topic. The group members are listed in this proposal with their permission and willingness to participate. The members include two relatively senior members (one of these is the PI of this proposal), one mid-career member, and four relatively early-career members. The idea is to have experienced leaders, but for the most part early-career scientists whose groups are performing particularly novel and ground-breaking research. These groups will represent this central and vital research field long into the future.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The timing for this type of activity, on this particular subject, is right. Research in this field is exploding in directions that are influential across the spectrum in all areas of fundamental to applied Earth research (terrestrial, oceans, atmosphere, biological). Beyond this, over the last several years, there has been a continuous, growing, and broad-based groundswell of interest, enthusiasm, and need in the geoscience research community to develop a strong funding base focused on this particular research direction. Scientific revolutions in molecular-based and nano-based science and technology are well on their way in all other fields of the physical and biological sciences; the potential for and realization of important new discoveries in these areas of geoscience research are just as great.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
