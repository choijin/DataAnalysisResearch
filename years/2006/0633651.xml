<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99) This project is developing an interdisciplinary minor encompassing the sciences, economics, and art that emphasizes computational visualization and modeling (CVM), which are two key aspects of computational science. Implementation of the minor includes two new interdisciplinary courses: "Data Visualization" and "Principles of Computation and Modeling," along with customized software and exercises based on  (i) the BioGrapher Excel front-end developed at Beloit College for the AT&amp;T GraphViz graphical visualization package, and (ii) GNU Octave and Scilab simulation and modeling Integrated Development Environments. Innovative pedagogy and curricular design for an enhanced STEM curriculum that encompasses the new challenges in many disciplines caused by an avalanche of complex, multivariate, and multidimensional data undergird the intellectual merit of this project. In addition to modeling and simulation materials, techniques for graphical visualization, including 3D visualization using the Geowall projection system, are emphasized. The broader impacts of the project leverage the leadership role played by the PI's institution in national undergraduate teaching and research consortia in a number of different disciplines. For example, enhanced dissemination at the national level is taking place through faculty workshops hosted by the BioQUEST/BEDROCK Consortium headquartered at Beloit College. In addition, each year thirty sixth grade girls, their science teachers, and their parents are taking part in hands-on exercises in visualization and modeling in the dedicated CVM computer laboratory as part of the Girls and Women in Science (GWIS) two-day Conference organized annually by Beloit College.</AbstractNarration>
