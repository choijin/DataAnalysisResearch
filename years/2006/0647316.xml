<AbstractNarration>This award provides participant travel support for a two-day conference for undergraduate women in physics that focuses on the critical transition from undergraduate to graduate study. On January 13-14, 2007 the University of Southern California will host the Second Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics. The conferences overarching aim is to give young women the confidence, motivation and resources to apply to graduate school and successfully complete a PhD. Specifically, the conference objectives are that participants leave with increased awareness of current research and career options in physics, greater familiarity with the graduate school experience, resources for applying to and being successful in graduate school as well as general resources for women in physics, and a network of women in physics. The two-day event will bring together female undergraduate students in physics to learn about current research and career opportunities in physics, the graduate school application process and experience, and resources for women in physics. Additionally they will have the opportunity to present original research, discuss physics topics with other students, and meet women faculty who have successful physics careers. The conference techniques and results will be widely disseminated. A conference report will be sent to physics departments and administrators at other universities, the APS Committee on the Status of Women in Physics, politicians involved in education and budget decisions on the state and federal levels, and the NSF.&lt;br/&gt;Sharing the details of the conference will remind the recipients of the need for greater representation of women and other underrepresented groups in the sciences and provide them with a model of successful ways to work toward this goal. This award is funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
