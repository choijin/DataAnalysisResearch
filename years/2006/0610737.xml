    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates large-scale classification problems in enterprise network security. If successful, the project will forward a technology that can detect new protocols and applications in the wild without human intervention. The objectives of the Phase 1 research are: (1) To distill and quantify event classification investigations; (2) To parallelize the findings across an existing proprietary platform; and (3) To test, measure, and compare the results of the integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovation is relevant to the enterprise network security market because security events are characterized by a proliferation of data that is ever-changing. It is difficult for IT professionals and their existing tools to keep pace with the iterations of new security risks. Current solutions tend to over-report or under-report security events leading to inefficiencies in labor allocation in IT departments. The proposed innovation will lead to a network security platform that will draw deeper and richer correlations than is currently available, leading to savings in personnel and a sharper focus on legitimate security events.</AbstractNarration>
