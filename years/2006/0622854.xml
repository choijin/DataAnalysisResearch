<AbstractNarration>Objectives: The purpose of this research proposal is to test the hypothesis that present day&lt;br/&gt;computer-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems can be effective and costefficient&lt;br/&gt;alternatives to human-generated text generation systems or sign language interpreters,&lt;br/&gt;and that the method of displaying the information plays a crucial role in the learning process.&lt;br/&gt;The Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf&lt;br/&gt;(NTID), one of eight colleges of RIT, together with a consultant from the Georgia Tech Research&lt;br/&gt;Institute (GTRI), will test this hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Working with Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HOH) student participants&lt;br/&gt;mainstreamed in baccalaureate programs at RIT, we will test three text-generated systems, and&lt;br/&gt;three different text presentation systems, under realistic but well-controlled lecture-venue&lt;br/&gt;conditions. We will compare these systems for accuracy in rendering the lecturer's narrative,&lt;br/&gt;evaluate students' comprehension of lecture content, and analyze ease of use and deployment&lt;br/&gt;from both the student participants' and the lecturers' points of view.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, we will evaluate three&lt;br/&gt;different speech to text systems: (1) CART, a word-for-word real-time speech-to-text closed&lt;br/&gt;captioning service driven by a steno machine operator; (2) C-Print, a meaning-for-meaning&lt;br/&gt;display and note-taking system driven by a captionist using abbreviation-expanding software;&lt;br/&gt;and (3) ASR speech-to-text transcription driven by the most powerful conversational speechrecognition&lt;br/&gt;software available on personal computers (Dragon Naturally Speaking 8 Preferred).&lt;br/&gt;In Stage 2, we will use the best text-generation system from Stage 1 to perform display tests&lt;br/&gt;comparing three different methods of putting text and non-text content into close visual&lt;br/&gt;proximity: (1) a heads up display of the text generated by the text generation system; (2) a PCbased&lt;br/&gt;system developed at RIT that allows continuous broadcast of the text stream, a PowerPoint&lt;br/&gt;display, and/or video stream of the lecturer to adjacent panes of conventional web browsers on&lt;br/&gt;the participant's personal computer; (3) the same composite display projected on a screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HOH) individuals, as well as people with other&lt;br/&gt;disabilities such as learning disabilities (LD), dyslexia or attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD),&lt;br/&gt;are often denied full participation in educational, civic, cultural, medical and employment-based&lt;br/&gt;activities. Some venue operators do provide sign language interpreters, real time display systems&lt;br/&gt;or note-taking systems, but the practice continues to be rare because logistics are challenging and&lt;br/&gt;expenses are significant. Recent advances in ASR systems have the potential to expand&lt;br/&gt;availability of near-real-time display and/or transcription, and reduce communication and&lt;br/&gt;educational barriers that still distance D/HOH from the rest of society.&lt;br/&gt;Our findings will offer expanded strategic options and data-based guidance to people who&lt;br/&gt;are D/HOH and to providers and administrators of services to D/HOH people. The results from&lt;br/&gt;this study will also be of great benefit to people who have other disabilities, and for people for&lt;br/&gt;whom English is a second language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
