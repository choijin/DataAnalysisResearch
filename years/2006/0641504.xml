<AbstractNarration>The insect trachea, similar to the vertebrate vascular system, is a multi-branched tubular organ that forms as a consequence of branching and fusion events during embryonic development. This process involves cell movement, cell recognition, cell adhesion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and formation of adhesive junctions. The fusion process is mediated by cells at the tip of each branch that are specialized for leading the migratory process and mediating branch fusion. The long-term goals of this project are to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie Drosophila tracheal fusion by mechanistically examining the regulation of the transcriptional, cytoskeletal, and other cellular changes that occur in fusion cells during development. The aims of the project involve: (1) comprehensively analyzing the transcriptional regulation of genes that are expressed during fusion cell development, and (2) studying the cell biology and molecular genetics of a novel GTPase proposed to control cytoskeletal assembly and vesicle trafficking during fusion. This project has broad significance for understanding how complex cellular events associated with branching morphogenesis are regulated during development, and how transcriptional mechanisms control developmental pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One major component of the proposed research is educational. Funds will be used to support training of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates, and summer high school students. The projects are designed to provide a multidisciplinary learning experience for each student, involving training in genetics, cell biology, and molecular biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
