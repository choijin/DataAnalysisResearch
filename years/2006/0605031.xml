<AbstractNarration>Brenner&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0605031&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator focuses on the coupling of the analytical&lt;br/&gt;methods of applied mathematics to numerical computation, in the&lt;br/&gt;context of both research and education.  The topics considered&lt;br/&gt;address a range of problems in engineering and science using a&lt;br/&gt;combination of approximate analysis, computation, and experiments. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues conduct the following projects:&lt;br/&gt;(1) A mathematical analysis of ion beam sputtering, aimed at both&lt;br/&gt;improving understanding of the surface patterns produced&lt;br/&gt;technique (e.g. why do particular morphologies form for given sets &lt;br/&gt;of conditions?) and at understanding whether ion beams can be used &lt;br/&gt;to create and control prespecified surface morphologies;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Studies of the self-assembly of two-dimensional elastic&lt;br/&gt;sheets into three-dimensional structures.  Here there are&lt;br/&gt;important issues both with respect to assembly kinetics and in&lt;br/&gt;determining the shape of the sheet that leads to the lowest&lt;br/&gt;energy structure, when folded into a given topology;&lt;br/&gt;(3) An analysis of the shapes of pollen grains, and the&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms through which they dry up; and&lt;br/&gt;(4) A mathematical analysis of droplet impact on a solid substrate &lt;br/&gt;-- in particular, whether or not a droplet produces a splash &lt;br/&gt;depends on an as yet unknown event that occurs immediately after &lt;br/&gt;the impact. &lt;br/&gt;The educational activities center around the general issue of how&lt;br/&gt;the concepts of applied mathematics should be taught, given the&lt;br/&gt;prevalence of computation.  The two main issues addressed are:&lt;br/&gt;How can computers be used to increase the mathematical (as opposed &lt;br/&gt;to computational) sophistication of students?  And secondly, how &lt;br/&gt;should mathematical modeling be taught, in order to clearly &lt;br/&gt;differentiate modeling (which produces understanding of a&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon) from computer graphics (which produces a picture&lt;br/&gt;reproducing it)?  The investigator is developing new courses (and&lt;br/&gt;modifications of old courses) to address these issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over the past decade, computers, and computer simulations,&lt;br/&gt;play an ever increasing role in science and scientific arguments. &lt;br/&gt;It is clear this trend will continue.  On the other hand, for&lt;br/&gt;complicated systems there are serious issues in understanding&lt;br/&gt;when to judge whether a computer simulation is correct.  This&lt;br/&gt;project addresses this general question both in the context of&lt;br/&gt;specific research projects and also through the development of&lt;br/&gt;educational courses and tools to help students learn how to&lt;br/&gt;answer this question.  The research projects include analyses of&lt;br/&gt;complex, technologically important phenomena for which both&lt;br/&gt;computer simulation and mathematical analysis can be combined. &lt;br/&gt;These project include a study of ion beam sputtering, a complex&lt;br/&gt;process that occurs when surfaces are irradiated with high energy&lt;br/&gt;ions.  The investigator and his colleagues study this problem&lt;br/&gt;using both computer simulations and analytic methods, coupled&lt;br/&gt;with experiments, in an effort to understand whether ion beams&lt;br/&gt;can create specific, technologically useful, patterns in a&lt;br/&gt;surface.  Another project studies the self-assembly of elastic&lt;br/&gt;sheets, in an effort to understand whether it is possible to&lt;br/&gt;create small objects which self-assemble into useful components&lt;br/&gt;in three dimensions.  A third project studies the process when a&lt;br/&gt;droplet of liquid splashes on a solid substrate.  Despite the&lt;br/&gt;ubiquity of this phenomenon it is not known why a droplet creates&lt;br/&gt;a splash.  On the educational front, the project aims to develop&lt;br/&gt;material to teach students both how to carry out computer&lt;br/&gt;simulations, and equally importantly how to evaluate whether they&lt;br/&gt;are correct.</AbstractNarration>
