<AbstractNarration>A one day symposium to convey the successes of integrated approaches to addressing issues in environmentally benign design and manufacture (EBDM) is proposed for June 27, 2006, in Arlington, Virginia, at the National Science Foundation.  Systems thinking is not only relevant for determining particular solutions to problems, but also for developing research and achieving systems operation that reflects fully integrated concepts. Several manufacturing industry sectors will be represented by individuals with expertise in each field, where these concepts have shown success. Plenary speakers from these sectors will bring expertise in policy, economics and competitiveness, and can address the impacts of EBDM success on the US workplace and workforce. Panel discussions with these experts will expose best practices, limitations, road blocks and areas for future work in EBDM. The structure of the day will include talks and panels from plenary speakers and posters from twenty current Design and Manufacturing Innovation (DMI) grantees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the symposium is to discuss the successes in EBDM, particularly, the research and development that leads to transfer and adoption of new technologies or management strategies. The speakers and panels will be arranged thematically, and include representatives from industry and academia. The speakers expertise ranges from science and engineering to policy, but all speakers will present an interdisciplinary spectrum of ideas. A Poster Session will be held during the morning and afternoon breaks, as well as during a short reception at the end of the day. Panel discussions are expected to provide intellectually stimulating question and answer sessions for an audience of industry representatives, university faculty, and NSF staff as well as staff from other government agencies and Congress.</AbstractNarration>
