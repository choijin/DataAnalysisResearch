    <AbstractNarration>This workshop, proposed by the Sitka Tribe of Alaska, will bring together scholars and Native American cultural experts to discuss and share their research on Tlingit and Haida culture, history, and language with other scholars, students, Alaska Native community members, and the general public. An additional goal of the workshop is to provide a forum in which Native and non-Native experts can share information and learn about each other's work. Modeled on the highly successful "clan conferences," the last of which was held a decade ago, the workshop hopes to draw upon the scholarship that has occurred in the region in this time period, much of which has been in collaboration with local communities, including anthropology, linguistics, archaeology, ethnohistory, biogeography, etc, In addition, it has support for the participation of students and plans for web, print, professional publications and other mechanisms of distribution in order to give both academics and local communities access to the information shared at the three day planned gathering.</AbstractNarration>
