<AbstractNarration>SUMMARY. Funds are requested from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for&lt;br/&gt;attendee / speaker support for the title symposium. The ACS Division of Polymer&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry has established a unique and diverse team of organizers from industry,&lt;br/&gt;academia, and government focused on the important topic of entrepreneurship in polymer&lt;br/&gt;science and technology. Polymer science and technology is an important component of&lt;br/&gt;materials research which overlaps with many current NSF initiatives. The global&lt;br/&gt;competitive demands on polymer chemists today require that they be well trained in&lt;br/&gt;science and that they behave more like entrepreneurs to feed an insatiable technologically&lt;br/&gt;innovative economy. An entrepreneur transforms creative ideas into successes and many&lt;br/&gt;of the entrepreneurial success are directly related to NSF programs. This symposium will&lt;br/&gt;focus on breakthrough inventions enabled by experimentation on novel, emerging, and&lt;br/&gt;pioneering technologies oriented toward materials research. Closer collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between industry, academia and government should increase the number, speed and&lt;br/&gt;impact of success stories and place prominent emphasis on the necessity of&lt;br/&gt;entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will cover basic research leading to new technology development and&lt;br/&gt;commercialization. Entrepreneurial activities ranging from identifying a need, to basic&lt;br/&gt;research, to developing novel and useful technology, to protecting the invention, to&lt;br/&gt;obtaining funding, to becoming a self-sustaining business will be reviewed. Our objective&lt;br/&gt;is to provide current, practical information that is based on scientific breakthroughs&lt;br/&gt;leading to real world experiences. The symposium will begin with a tutorial on&lt;br/&gt;entrepreneurship. Discussions will focus on fundamental polymer and related science,&lt;br/&gt;challenges and opportunities for scientists and engineers in the market to facilitate an&lt;br/&gt;understanding of entrepreneurship. Scientists, engineers and technologists interested in&lt;br/&gt;the latest developments and advances in this diverse and growing area are invited to&lt;br/&gt;contribute oral and poster presentations.</AbstractNarration>
