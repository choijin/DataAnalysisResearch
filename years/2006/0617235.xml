<AbstractNarration>0617235&lt;br/&gt;Adams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identification of microorganisms and biocatalysts for bioenergy conversion processes remains a key objective in the development of alternative fuels. Recently available genomics-based approaches offer unprecedented access to novel enzymes and pathways for biomass conversions. The objective of this research is to identify novel biocatalytic and metabolic strategies for bioenergy conversion by using functional and structural genomics-based methods, in conjunction with microbial and biochemical approaches. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is the strategic use of classical and modern approaches to study extremophile biology and biotechnology as this relates to bioenergy conversion. The specific objectives of the project are: (1) to use whole genome transcriptional response analyses of four hyperthermophilic hydrogen-producing anaerobes to identify novel biocatalyst targets for processing biomass to substrates that can be readily converted to biofuels; (2) to produce key biocatalysts for biochemical characterization and to assess their roles in bioenergy production; (3) to compare hydrogen production rates and yields for the four hyperthemophilic anaerobes. (4) to evaluate bioprocess strategies for biohydrogen production at elevated temperatures by hyperthermophile cultures. The broader impact of this work relates to the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in the use of functional genomics for studying biocatalysis and biotransformations in extremophilic microorganisms. The two participating laboratories will continue their longstanding efforts to involve undergraduate students and students from underrepresented minority groups in the research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
