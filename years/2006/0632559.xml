<AbstractNarration>Astronomy (11) The project is producing three types of exploratory products to enhance on-line interactive learning in undergraduate astronomy and physics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Updating an existing on-line hypertext of introductory astronomy and augmenting it by adding a quantitative layer by which the students can explore the underlying physics of the phenomena described in the top layer of the text;&lt;br/&gt;2. Developing applets by which students can explore physical and astrophysical phenomena, similar to those already developed; and&lt;br/&gt;3. Developing and field-testing several on-line learning modules that guide students to explore and understand physical phenomena illustrated by the applets, along the lines of the "Planetfinder" learning module that has already been developed as a prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed projects all lead students to an understanding of the physics underlying some of the most active areas of current research in astrophysics. Moreover, the PI is carrying out research to continue to learn how best to incorporate online learning facilities in introductory astronomy and physics courses to improve student learning and engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The resources that are being produced serve as prototypes for similar efforts by publishers to provide on-line learning resources. Moreover, the resources, suitably modified, are useful for learning in secondary schools and in informal learning environments such as planetariums and science museums. Therefore, the project is  modifying and field-testing a few of the resources in those venues.</AbstractNarration>
