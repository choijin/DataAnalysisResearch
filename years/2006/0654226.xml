<AbstractNarration>The overriding theme of this experimental research program is investigation of phase transitions in ultracold atomic vapor. Over the past decade, experimental and theoretical advances have led to exquisite control, manipulation, and understanding of dynamic and kinetic properties of ultracold vapor-phase matter.  However, in spite of enormous progress in studying strongly correlated systems in ultracold atomic gases, important aspects of the complexity of condensed system remain to be explored. One of these is the critical influence that disorder has on transport properties of realistic physical systems. The research program is focused on experimental exploration and understanding of localization of electromagnetic waves in ultracold atomic gases.  As individual photons are essentially noninteracting bosons, a nearly idealized system can be realized with a spatially disordered gas of stationary scattering atoms.  The research also can have an important impact on an array of problems in quantum linear and nonlinear optics and quantum information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program has significant broader impact on science education, infrastructure, and diversity.   A potential application of the work is the use of photon localizing samples as quantum repeaters.  The current technical limitations of such devices is a main impediment to long-distance secure quantum communications.  Educational impact is partly accomplished by substantially involving undergraduate and graduate students in all parts of the scientific projects, including attendance at undergraduate-focused symposia at professional conferences. Students will also participate in undergraduate and masters degree independent projects associated with the experiments. Finally, the research impacts international science education and infrastructure through involvement of Ph.D. students and faculty in international components of this research with academic colleagues and students in Russia and France.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Development and refinement of techniques and technologies of ultracold atomic physics have revolutionized many areas of science and technology.  In fundamental physics, for instance, cold and ultracold atom studies have revealed novel phases of matter and clarified many subtle effects more traditionally associated with condensed matter physics, materials science, and plasma physics.   In areas of developing technologies, cold atoms have proved essential to realization of exquisitely sensitive detectors of magnetic fields, rotational motion, and gravitational forces, among other physical quantities.   The newest generation of atomic clocks have at their core ultracold samples of atomic cesium.    Cold atoms characteristically have temperatures less than 0.0001 K above absolute zero.   One might think that such samples would be so extraordinarily fragile, and would evaporate at the smallest disturbance, that no practical devices could be constructed from them.  And yet it is possible to utilize, for instance, in sensor and other applications, ultracold samples which are held only a short distance above the surface of traditional circuit boards.  This permits coupling of electronic or optical signals into atomic samples, which serve as the sensor.   A problem which plagues miniaturized electronic devices, among others, is the inevitable presence of impurities in the devices.   These can significantly impede the flow of electricity and reduce the effectiveness of electronic circuitry.   At the same time, imperfections in optical fibers and more general optical instruments suffer from scattering of light from optical irregularities or contaminants on the surfaces or inclusions in the interior of optical elements.  The role of impurities and imperfections are universal, in that the broad features do not depend on the nature of the scatterers.   This research project was concerned with the role of impurities and scattering in the transport of light through a controllably disordered medium.   A key element is that the disorder can be controlled, and hence studied systematically.   The specific realization which promises a broad range of manipulatable quantities, and through them precise experimental control, is a gas of ultracold atoms.   For technical reasons, this gas is selected to be rubidium, but the general conclusions are free of the particulars of the type of atom studied.  A principal focus of this research was to examine conditions for the ultimate realization of the effects of disorder, the so-called Anderson localization transition.   Effects related to Anderson localization have been seen in the propagation of acoustic and ultrasonic waves, optical disturbances, matter waves comprised of ultracold atoms, and even waves in the solid Earth (these being related to the vibrations associated with earthquakes).  In spite of these extensive studies, aspects of Anderson localization remain poorly understood.  Of particular scientific interest in this study was the role of the quantum nature of the scatterers (atoms) and the scattering objects (photons), and the interactions between them.  This project has had significant impact in a number of areas, both scientific and of broader societal impact.  Scientific advances were made in the capacity to form ultracold atom samples under the proper conditions to study disorder effects, in the capability to experimentally identify signatures of Anderson localization, and in the theoretical description of light scattering by cold and ultracold gases under these severe conditions.   Significant contributions to scientific and technological human resources were also made, in that eight graduate students and six undergraduate researchers have gained significant research experience and training through their involvement with this project.  All of these students are either furthering their scientific and technical studies, or have gone on to professional positions in industry or academia.  For ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
