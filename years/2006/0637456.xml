    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will design and implement a method of detecting and preventing buffer overflows in a C/C++ code, while maintaining execution efficiency. When a C/C++ program is compiled with the proposed approach, all buffer overflows are guaranteed to be intercepted. The main intellectual merit is not detecting all buffer overflows, but doing so in a way that does not destroy the efficiency of the program. The approach uses compilation techniques pioneered for speeding up code for high-performance computers to eliminate or minimize buffer overflow checks. The approach will use whole program information as available, and a link-time phase for final optimizations and verifications. If successful, the end result will be a safe and secure program with minimal performance degradation compared to its unsafe insecure counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposed project could be significant. Buffer overflows in C and C++ programs are a major problem in two main cases: hackers deliberately attempting to disable or take control of a system, and programs running on critical embedded systems (such as those in sophisticated military equipment) that receive unexpected sensor input. Serious damage can be caused in either case.</AbstractNarration>
