<AbstractNarration>Project Summary: LSAMP Phase IV (2006-2011) Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities&lt;br/&gt;(WAESO)&lt;br/&gt;WAESO combines the efforts of an alliance of 35 colleges and universities, 8 professional organizations, 2&lt;br/&gt;government laboratories, 9 educational organizations, 21 corporations, 147 academic and support programs, 500&lt;br/&gt;resource individuals, approximately 85% of whom are scientists, engineers, and other faculty, and 15%&lt;br/&gt;administrators with just over 40% of these resource individuals being underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;Overall Objective: Phase IV WAESO is a comprehensive, concerted, sequenced effort that proposes to use&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP NSF funding for underrepresented undergraduate student activities, including the transition of college&lt;br/&gt;sophomores, juniors, and seniors toward graduate school and the development of high technology products with&lt;br/&gt;application or dissemination both regionally and nationally. Through the Bridges to the Doctorate program our&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP will continue our successful multidisciplinary faculty mentoring network to transition these students to&lt;br/&gt;STEM Ph.D. programs. Moreover, with NSF Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP)&lt;br/&gt;support, PHASE IV WAESO students will be assisted through the doctorate and even beyond to faculty status or&lt;br/&gt;careers in the corporate or government sectors.&lt;br/&gt;Based on the successes of Phase I and Phase II in doubling the number of graduates per year of our target population&lt;br/&gt;and being on pace for a similar doubling goal in Phase III, we propose to take on the formidable task of achieving&lt;br/&gt;B.S. degree rates reflective of our substantial underrepresented minority population. Using the information form the&lt;br/&gt;census bureau (http://www.census.gov) USA July 2004 reports for Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah state&lt;br/&gt;that our region has a population which of the 12,370,000 people estimated in this report, 34% (compared with 28%&lt;br/&gt;nationally) are American Indian, African American, and Hispanic. In order to move much closer to achieving parity&lt;br/&gt;with the relatively stable overall STEM B.S. degree production rate for the proposed Phase IV cohort of 10,551, we&lt;br/&gt;propose the numerical goal in the year 2011 of 2,630 STEM B.S. degrees awarded to American Indian, African&lt;br/&gt;American, and Hispanic as accomplishing much towards achieving parity with our regional population of these&lt;br/&gt;Americans, which would result in a representation of greater than 25% and put us well on the way to successfully&lt;br/&gt;reaching parity.&lt;br/&gt;Specific Goals: Based on the tremendous success of our current WAESO LSAMP Phase III alliance that has been&lt;br/&gt;funded in part by a NSF cooperative agreements since 1990, we specifically propose to:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Further institutionalize our highly successful Phase III activities to ensure that alliance goals and objectives will&lt;br/&gt;continue to be achieved beyond NSF support;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Double once again the annual BS degree rate from a new (adjusted due to cohort membership changes) current&lt;br/&gt;baseline of 1,315 underrepresented student science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) BS degrees&lt;br/&gt;to 2,630 within five years (by 2011);&lt;br/&gt;(3) Further expand, sustain, and connect LSAMP BS graduates, especially LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate&lt;br/&gt;fellowship students, with our MGE@MSA AGEP and other AGEPs nationally to create, enhance, and&lt;br/&gt;institutionalize permanent pathways to successful graduate study and academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of our proposed activity is that we will draw upon and expand our alliances large existing&lt;br/&gt;communities of underrepresented minority STEM scholar/researcher/teacher/mentors and student apprentice&lt;br/&gt;scholar/researcher/teacher/protgs working collaboratively to further structure and sustain a research-based hot&lt;br/&gt;house environment to create wide-spread regional systemic change with dramatically positive national implications&lt;br/&gt;and repercussions.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of our proposed activity is to achieve and sustain a level of admission, development,&lt;br/&gt;graduation, placement, promotion, and tenure of baccalaureate, masters, doctoral, post-doctoral, junior faculty, and&lt;br/&gt;senior faculty underrepresented STEM scholars in proportion to the diversity of our society as a whole. We have&lt;br/&gt;strong reason to believe that our WAESO LSAMP alliance will become a national model for the strengthening and&lt;br/&gt;diversification of STEM students and faculty to ensure that the U.S. will continue to lead the world in research and&lt;br/&gt;technology despite the increasingly intense global competition of the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>
