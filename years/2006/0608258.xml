<AbstractNarration>The study of biological diversity has immense scientific and social &lt;br/&gt;value, especially today as biodiversity is under serious threat. This &lt;br/&gt;dissertation project deals with the investigation of a group of insects &lt;br/&gt;that, with approximately 7,000 described species world-wide, is one of &lt;br/&gt;the most species-rich families of true flies. Robber flies (Asilidae) &lt;br/&gt;are easily recognized and play an important role as insect predators. &lt;br/&gt;Although many scientific publications deal with these flies, &lt;br/&gt;evolutionary relationships of the species remain obscure. This study &lt;br/&gt;focuses on species of the subfamily Leptogastrinae, currently known &lt;br/&gt;from 462 species. This group is distinct due to peculiar morphological &lt;br/&gt;characteristics associated with a narrow body that are most probably &lt;br/&gt;adaptations to a life among grasses. Many other robber-fly species &lt;br/&gt;inhabit prairies and grasslands as well, but lack such a distinctive &lt;br/&gt;suite of similar morphological features. This project enhances the &lt;br/&gt;knowledge about robber flies by (1) presenting well-corroborated &lt;br/&gt;hypotheses of the evolutionary relationships of species of robber &lt;br/&gt;flies, (2) providing species descriptions and identification keys for &lt;br/&gt;species of the subfamily Leptogastrinae, and (3) analyzing the &lt;br/&gt;distribution and species richness of species of Leptogastrinae with &lt;br/&gt;respect to biodiversity hotspots sensu Conservation International. The &lt;br/&gt;findings will allow a discussion of character evolution with respect to &lt;br/&gt;habitat preferences of all robber flies, emphasizing grass-inhabiting &lt;br/&gt;species and comparing them to species of Leptogastrinae using both &lt;br/&gt;morphological characters of the adult flies and DNA sequences. &lt;br/&gt;Fieldwork is conducted in South east Asia in order to collect species &lt;br/&gt;of robber flies for the analyses, as this region hosts the least-known &lt;br/&gt;and sampled fauna. Two major natural history museums housing specimens &lt;br/&gt;of Asilidae from South east Asia - London, UK, and Amsterdam, The &lt;br/&gt;Netherlands - are visited to examine historical specimens of &lt;br/&gt;outstanding importance for identification of freshly collected &lt;br/&gt;material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among many target groups used for studies addressing the biodiversity &lt;br/&gt;crisis, insects are always under represented. This dissertation project &lt;br/&gt;incorporates one of the most species-rich fly groups into analyses of &lt;br/&gt;biological diversity. The dissemination of scientific knowledge to all &lt;br/&gt;parts of the world is of immense importance. The species descriptions &lt;br/&gt;and identification keys assembled in this project are being published &lt;br/&gt;in required printed format in scientific journals as well as on the &lt;br/&gt;world wide web as integrative biodiversity databases, therefore making &lt;br/&gt;this knowledge available for world-wide audiences including &lt;br/&gt;entomologists and conservation biologists. An undergraduate student is &lt;br/&gt;trained in revisionary taxonomy during a summer internship under the &lt;br/&gt;NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program in order to &lt;br/&gt;educate a future scientist in methods of identifying, describing, and &lt;br/&gt;illustrating species and publishing the results. The extensive &lt;br/&gt;NSF-funded research project Assembling the Tree of Life - True Flies &lt;br/&gt;will directly benefit from the proposed study of the evolutionary &lt;br/&gt;relationships of Asilidae.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
