<AbstractNarration>For many decades, scientists have been exploring the Earth's oldest rocks for traces of early life.  Claims that these ancient rocks contain evidence for life have largely relied on interpretations of the isotopic composition, chemical structure, and morphology of carbon compounds found in the rocks.  Recently, however, the biological origin of carbon in several of the oldest rocks has been called into question, and an alternative non-biological (abiotic) origin of the compounds proposed.  Resolving the source of these compounds has significant implications for determining the timing of the origin of life, and for understanding the distribution and characteristics of the earliest lifeforms on our planet.  In order to clarify the source of carbon in ancient rocks, the proposed research is a laboratory experimental investigation that will more clearly define the characteristics of organic carbon compounds formed by abiotic processes in geologic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distinguishing biologically derived carbon compounds in ancient rocks from those that may have a non-biological origin requires clearer definition of conditions that allow abiotic organic synthesis to occur and better characterization of the molecular and isotopic composition of compounds that are produced under those conditions.  Accordingly, the proposed research will investigate reaction pathways for abiotic organic synthesis through a series of laboratory experiments.  Experiments will focus on two reaction pathways for abiotic synthesis (polymerization of methane and siderite decomposition) that have been invoked as pathways for formation of reduced carbon compounds in ancient rocks, but that have not been well characterized experimentally.  In addition, experiments will be conducted to explore whether products of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a reaction often invoked for abiotic synthesis in geologic systems, can be converted to the type of reduced carbon compounds found in ancient rocks (e.g., kerogen, graphite) during metamorphic heating.  It is anticipated that the research will help to define the potential contribution of abiotic sources of organic matter on the early Earth and aid in the interpretation of the origin of reduced carbon in the Earth's oldest rocks.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
