<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Planar optical waveguides are the basis for devices used in optical signal processing and telecommunication.  To fabricate such devices, small channels with particular light-guiding and light-amplifying properties are created on a glass plate, by changing its chemical composition along specific patterns near the surface.  Adding elements that are most effective from optical and photonic points of view is curbed due to poor compatibility with the glass structure.  This research is to develop a novel technology for the eventual manufacture of planar waveguides, based on ion beam implantation of the optically active elements into a precursor of the glass.  A new manufacturing process is expected to improve the performance of planar waveguide devices manifold and help facilitate new technologies, such as optical computers and data storage.  In carrying out this project, future engineers and scientists are trained in glass science and computational materials research.  The findings of this work will enter the public domain and contribute to the body of information used in public and industry outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  The focus of the proposed investigation is the insertion of atomic and nano-sized particles into a glass matrix to achieve particular functions, such as light guiding or photoluminescence.  Non-equilibrium processing routes, combining low-temperature sol-gel synthesis and ion implantation, will be explored to create porous and dense amorphous structures that can accommodate optically active embedded species at concentrations and spatial distributions that significantly improve the performance of planar optical waveguides compared to current capabilities.  The fundamental aspects of how precursor chemistry, implantation doses, and processing schedules affect the structure and properties of the waveguide materials will be investigated through in-situ structural characterization using concurrent Brillouin and Raman light scattering measurements, complemented by MD simulations, Rutherford backscattering, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and photoluminescence measurements.  This research leverages the NSF-sponsored acquisition of a new ion implanter at the University of Michigan, which provides the ability to implant rare-earth elements at sufficiently high energies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
