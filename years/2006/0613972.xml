<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;CHE-0613972&lt;br/&gt;De Stasio Gilbert/Wisconsin - Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomineralization is the production of minerals by living organisms.  The structure and formation of natural biominerals are controlled at the molecular scale by proteins, but most aspects of key organic-inorganic interactions remain unclear.  With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Material Research, Gelsomina "Pupa" De Stasio Gilbert and her group in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Physics are employing and developing spectroscopic methods to study molecular-scale interactions at the interfaces between peptides or proteins on one hand, and minerals or their precursor nanoparticles on the other.  This will reveal how mineral structure and protein conformation influence one another, and how they evolve together during biomineralization.  In particular, they focus on the interactions between peptides and calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, which are relevant to the early steps in bone, teeth and shell formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in the proposed experiments, and are assisting with preparation of biomineralization instructional materials for college and high school students.  These materials will integrate the research results acquired by the students themselves, thereby integrating research, teaching and learning.  Students will also invent and prepare demonstration stands and hands-on experiences on biomineralization for the broader community at the UW Synchrotron Radiation Center annual Open House, which hosts more than 200 people from the general public once a year, and for the "Microscopy of Life" course, which the PI teaches every spring (40 graduate and undergraduate students from 8 departments).  Research in biomineralization is a multidisciplinary field, including chemistry, physics, biology, and materials science.  The impact of the proposed experiments, therefore, will reach far beyond the boundaries of chemistry and physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
