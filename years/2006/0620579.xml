<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The cornerstone of the Bonanza Creek (BNZ) LTER research has been the state factor&lt;br/&gt;approach, which allows prediction of ecosystem properties based on independent controls such&lt;br/&gt;as climate, parent material, topography, potential biota, and time and interactive controls, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;processes internal to ecosystems that both affect and respond to ecosystem processes. The&lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit of the proposed research involves expansion of this theoretical framework to&lt;br/&gt;address processes underlying ecosystem resilience and vulnerability. Our objective is to identify&lt;br/&gt;factors that buffer systems from radical changes in structure and functioning (resilience) vs.&lt;br/&gt;factors that might precipitate changes to alternative states (vulnerability). This requires an&lt;br/&gt;extension beyond the assumptions of steady state dynamics to ask under what conditions changes&lt;br/&gt;in drivers might trigger a fundamental change in the nature of boreal ecosystems. The central&lt;br/&gt;question of our research is: How are boreal ecosystems responding, both gradually and&lt;br/&gt;abruptly, to climate warming, and what new landscape patterns are emerging?&lt;br/&gt;We study the dynamics of change in several steps. (1) Climate sensitivity of physical&lt;br/&gt;and biological processes to temporal variation in the environment, which defines the limits of&lt;br/&gt;resilience to climate change; (2) changes in the successional dynamics caused by changes in&lt;br/&gt;climate and disturbance regime, which define the points in the adaptive cycle of disturbance and&lt;br/&gt;recovery at which ecosystems are most vulnerable to change; (3) threshold changes that are&lt;br/&gt;likely to cause the boreal forest to function in a qualitatively new way and (4) integration and&lt;br/&gt;synthesis in which we integrate these modes of climate response across multiple temporal and&lt;br/&gt;spatial scales and explore their societal consequences.&lt;br/&gt;The research design combines long-term observations, long-term experiments, and&lt;br/&gt;process studies to identify ecological changes and to document controls over ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;processes and successional dynamics in three landscape units: floodplains, uplands, and&lt;br/&gt;wetlands. We test hypotheses about controls over ecosystem dynamics by manipulating selected&lt;br/&gt;interactive controls. These plot-level studies are extended to larger spatial scales (watersheds,&lt;br/&gt;regions, and the state of Alaska) in a hierarchical research design, using extensive measurements,&lt;br/&gt;remote sensing, and modeling. Temporal scales of the research span hours (weather), years&lt;br/&gt;(growth, populations), successional cycles (stand-age reconstructions), and millennia (vegetation&lt;br/&gt;and climate reconstructions).&lt;br/&gt;We explore societal consequences by identifying past and potential future changes in&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem services that boreal forests provide both locally (e.g., subsistence resources) and&lt;br/&gt;globally (e.g., carbon sequestration). Involvement in LTER cross-site comparisons enables us to&lt;br/&gt;understand boreal processes in a broader context. To make this information available and useful&lt;br/&gt;to a broader community, we work closely with schools, community outreach programs, the&lt;br/&gt;broader scientific community, and resource managers through collaborations, outreach, and webbased&lt;br/&gt;data management. Information management emphasizes secure archival of the information&lt;br/&gt;we have collected, promotion of its use in synthesis, and development of web-based databases to&lt;br/&gt;facilitate its use by the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
