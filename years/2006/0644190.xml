<AbstractNarration>`The ideal vehicle for extensive aquatic monitoring is mobile underwater sensor network (M-UWSN). M-UWSN is significantly different from terrestrial sensor networks: (1) radio channels do not work well under water. They must be replaced by acoustic channels, which feature long propagation delays, low communication bandwidth and a high channel error rate; (2) while most ground sensors are static, underwater sensor nodes may move with water, as introduces passive mobility. Due to the complex environment properties and the unique characteristics of acoustic channels, M-UWSN demands new research at every level of the protocol suite. In this project, we investigate three key networking problems for M-UWSN: multiple access, multi-hop routing and reliable data transfer. For multiple access, we study a reservation-based approach for dense networks and an adaptive protocol for unevenly-distributed networks. For multi-hop routing, we design a scalable geo-routing protocol and improve its robustness by effectively handling routing "holes". For reliable data transfer, we explore both FEC (Forward-Error-Correction) coding and network coding approaches, aiming to enhance network robustness while reduce communication cost. The accomplishment of this research will enable and/or enhance a wide range of aquatic applications in scientific research and national security/defense. The results will include (1) a set of protocols and algorithms for the three networking problems; (2) integrated solutions and user guidelines for different aquatic applications; (3) a simulation platform and real testbeds. The research results will be incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate courses. Both the simulation platform and real testbeds will be accessible to the community.</AbstractNarration>
