<AbstractNarration>This award is for the acquisition of a High-Resolution Dual-Beam Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope to be housed in the university's Life Sciences Microscopy Facility. This new microscope provides unique imaging capabilities that will accelerate discovery in problems using hydrated and soft samples, by incorporating cryo techniques along with ion milling and electron beam imaging at high resolution. The ability to image under environmental conditions (ESEM) adds exciting capabilities for dynamic experimentation. Researchers will explore many applications such as (1) Imaging plant cell deformation on the surface and internal to various plant organs to deduce how the biophysical properties of their cell walls have been modified by specific mutations in cell wall-related genes, (2) Identifying and localizing specific elements to plant cellular compartments to shed light on the mechanism by which plant cells can sequester high concentrations of toxic elements, useful for phytoremediation, and (3) Imaging the interactions of nanomaterials with cellular structures to reveal the position of nanoprobes within the cell and their influence on intracellular functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application of this instrument to the teaching and outreach mission of  the university will be accomplished as follows: (1) Bringing the excitement of high technology and scientific imaging directly to the classroom, both on and off campus, through remote microscope control via internet interface, (2) Problem solving by advanced lab groups such as in Forensic Science, (3) Outreach to middle and high schools throughout Indiana (Science Bound Program &amp; school/departmental outreach), (4) Outreach to historically under-represented students in science through programs such as the Howard Hughes and MARC summer programs held annually at the university, (5) Enhancing existing research and teaching interactions with historic minority institutions to include "virtual" microscopy experiences, (6) Construction of teaching materials for all levels (with the assistance of the Envision Center), and (6) Collaborative research and teaching interactions with regional institutions.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
