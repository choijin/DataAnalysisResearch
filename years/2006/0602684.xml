<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials are typically characterized by their linear properties; for example, linear viscoelastic measurements are a powerful measure of structure-property relationships. However, many soft materials exhibit highly non-linear behavior which necessitates a fundamentally different way of investigating the behavior.  The non-equilibrium and non-linear properties of soft materials is often of particular importance in technological applications. Similarly, biological materials are also often dominated by non-equilibrium behavior due to the large number of chemical reactions that burn energy to sustain life.  This research will investigate non-linear and non-equilibrium behavior of important classes of materials, including biopolymer networks, gels of complex fluids and structured materials formed with microfluidic devices.  New methods to probe and describe these properties will be developed.  The work will be closely coupled to industrial collaborators, allowing students and post docs to gain valuable experience with technology and to directly contribute to the country's economic competitiveness.  The participants will include undergraduate and graduate students and post docs, helping to train the next generation of the country's scientists.  All participants will become part of a vibrant and interactive research community that has been established in the Boston area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A traditional means of characterizing a material is to measure its properties under quiescent conditions, where its response to a very small perturbation is determined.  This has proven to be a powerful principle of material science.  However, many materials exist under much more extreme conditions.  The goal of this research project is to develop qualitatively new methods to study materials under conditions that mimic their behavior in the real world, where they are subjected to very large perturbations.  For example, the stability and aging of technologically important materials will be investigated.  In addition, the mechanics of the protein networks that provide rigidity to living cells will be explored.  The work will be closely coupled to industrial collaborators, allowing students and post docs to gain valuable experience with technology and to directly contribute to the country's economic competitiveness.  The participants will include undergraduate and graduate students and post docs, helping to train the next generation of the country's scientists.  All participants will become part of a vibrant and interactive research community that has been established in the Boston area.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
