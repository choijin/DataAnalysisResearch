<AbstractNarration>Working in cooperation with the EarthScope education and outreach community, the pro-ject is researching, designing, and producing high production-quality interactive video ?chal-lenges? designed to engage and enlighten young people (primary target audience: middle school, ages 10?14) about EarthScope-related science, people, and projects. The interactive challenges are being developed for a generalized medium; the current effort includes testing for the effec-tiveness with the target audience of a wide range of media (from stand-alone kiosks to hand-held devices). Focus groups and on-site evaluations are being undertaken to measure and enhance the ability of the project to serve its learning goals, to wit: 1) Science: To make large numbers of young people more aware of basic geoscience concepts relevant to EarthScope, presented in an engaging and memorable way; 2) People: To present to young people the wide cross section of diverse jobs and talents within the EarthScope community; and 3) Projects: To raise awareness of the different components of EarthScope and the impact that they will have on local communities. The content to be created incorporates science education standards to enhance and support class-room work, and can become part of a meaningful visitor center, museum, or after-school experi-ence. The investigators are producing a single proof-of-concept EarthScope ?challenge,? with emphasis on front-end testing consisting of focus groups with students in the target population, in order to gather data on possible content and format for the challenges.</AbstractNarration>
