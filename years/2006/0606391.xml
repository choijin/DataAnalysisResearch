<AbstractNarration>      Technical Abstract.  In order to fully enable the use of advanced polymeric materials in applications such as polymeric light emitting diodes (PLEDs), photovoltaics applications, optical waveguides and polymeric semiconductor devices, new methods for applying the active polymeric materials in precisely defined regions and patterns are needed.  The use of imprint lithography, in combination with functional polymer brush synthesis, will be studied in order to create new patterned polymeric materials with useful optical and electronic properties.  We will create new surface active tethering groups that will facilitate the attachment of polymer chains to imprinted patterned polymer layers.  We will characterize the incorporation of these tethering groups into our imprinted surfaces by XPS, IR and UV spectroscopy.  We will initially examine the catalytic reactions that lead to the formation of polymeric brushes of two different systems, polyfluorenes and polythiophenes.  An important aspect of the project is to study the kinetics and dynamics of the growth of these new polycondensation brushes as they are distinctly different from previously studied polymer brushes made by radical polymerization routes.  We will gain an understanding of the architecture and morphology of these new polymer brush layers.  Test structures will be created in order to facilitate charcterization of the optical and electronic properties of these materials.  Finally, we will create and test functioning devices including PLEDs and polymeric transistors.  Execution of this research will enable the understanding of novel polymeric materials and patterning techniques enabling future developments in nanotechnology and advanced device applications.  The project will train graduate students in organic synthesis, polymer synthesis and device manufacture and characterization. Undergraduate students will also participate through an REU summer supplement, with mentoring by graduate students.  The PI is also heavily involved in educational opportunities for local underrepresented minority children and will use part of the research to engage the minds and imaginations of young (8-14) children through weekend workshops.  Graduate students in the group will be required to participate in these educational workshops.&lt;br/&gt;      Non-Technical Abstract.  In order to fully enable new devices such as polymeric light emitting diodes (PLEDs), photovoltaics applications, optical waveguides and polymeric semiconductor devices, new methods for applying the active polymeric materials in precisely defined regions and patterns are needed.  Our group has developed new patterning techniques within a field known as nanoimprint lithography.  We will study new patterned surfaces composed of semiconducting polymeric materials with useful optical and electronic properties.  A significant par of the research will be the development of chemistries that facilitate the attachment of polymer chains to imprinted patterned polymer layers.  We will synthesize new patterned surfaces and characterize these functional nanopatterned materials.  We will gain an understanding of the basic nature of these new polymer brush layers.  Test structures will be created in order to facilitate charcterization of the optical and electronic properties of these materials.  Finally, we will create and test functioning devices including PLEDs and polymeric transistors.  Execution of this research will enable the understanding of novel polymeric materials and patterning techniques enabling future developments in nanotechnology and advanced device applications.  The project will train graduate students and undergraduate researchers in organic synthesis, polymer synthesis and device manufacture and characterization.
