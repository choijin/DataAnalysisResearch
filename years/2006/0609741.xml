<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Proposal: CUAHSI/CLEANER Demonstration and Development of a Test-bed&lt;br/&gt;Digital Observatory for the Susquehanna River Basin and Chesapeake Bay&lt;br/&gt;Introduction: The proposed project will demonstrate the applicability and utility of a Environmental&lt;br/&gt;Digital Observatory (EDO) design whose components are currently being developed by the Hydrologic&lt;br/&gt;Information System (HIS) group of CUAHSI for use by both the CLEANER and CUAHSI communities.&lt;br/&gt;While the 4 components of the EDO system have been identified (Environmental Digital Library (EDL),&lt;br/&gt;Environmental Observations Database (EOD), Digital Environment-Shed (DES), Environmental Analysis&lt;br/&gt;System (EAS)), only some of the components are currently in a state to be deployed in a beta-testing&lt;br/&gt;mode, most notably the EDL and to some extent the DES. Because of the complexity of the system&lt;br/&gt;components it is impossible to produce a roll-out product that would meet all the expectations from the&lt;br/&gt;start. Hence, it is crucial that these components are put to a test in a test-bed environment to investigate&lt;br/&gt;how the components behave, what pieces are missing, what additional developments need to be carried&lt;br/&gt;out, and most importantly whether they are effective for the purpose they were designed. Because of the&lt;br/&gt;envisioned scope in funding and time as well as the availability and current state of the developments, this&lt;br/&gt;project will focus on the first of the components (the EDL), which constitutes the base layer upon which&lt;br/&gt;all of the other components rest.&lt;br/&gt;Objectives: The objectives are to: (1) test and demonstrate the usefulness of a EDL for inclusion in the&lt;br/&gt;EDO as applied to nutrient fluxes in both the Susquehanna River Basin (SRB) and Chesapeake Bay (CB)&lt;br/&gt;for which a data gap analysis will be performed (2) demonstrate the feasibility of using existing CI&lt;br/&gt;components (EDO from CUAHSI and CyberCollaboratory from CLEANER) to meet a merged and&lt;br/&gt;overlapping science agenda as demonstrated on the SRB/CB test-bed, and (3) further develop and extend&lt;br/&gt;existing components as well as provide feedback on the design and functionality of CI components to the&lt;br/&gt;technology partners at SDSC and NCSA.&lt;br/&gt;Methodology: To accomplish these objectives an instance of the EDL will be installed at Drexel&lt;br/&gt;University. Together with the project partners representing an upstream Hydrologic Observatory region&lt;br/&gt;and a downstream Environmental Observatory region, we will identify and collect as many nutrient data&lt;br/&gt;as is possible and currently available for these regions for inclusion in the EDL. While the population of&lt;br/&gt;the EDL in the first step will require substantial effort to further develop current CI components&lt;br/&gt;(appropriate metadata tags and tools for creating instantiations) we will conduct a data gap analysis in the&lt;br/&gt;upstream region for missing or insufficient data. The gap analysis will be carried out using a statistical&lt;br/&gt;modeling tool (SPARROW), which will yield predictions that can be compared to existing data sets. The&lt;br/&gt;quality or match of these comparisons will be an indicator for the overall quality of the data sets as far as&lt;br/&gt;their temporal and spatial coverage is concerned. This is an important step towards an improved&lt;br/&gt;knowledge on the fluxes, stores, and pathways of water as well as nutrients within the SRB and the&lt;br/&gt;receiving waters of the CB.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This project would be the first effort to investigate how hydrologists and&lt;br/&gt;environmental engineers can make use of the suite of technical support applications currently under&lt;br/&gt;development. This is a crucial step in further developing CI for the environmental and hydrology&lt;br/&gt;communities by providing feedback in a beta-testing mode. In addition, the use of the CyberCollaboratory&lt;br/&gt;prototype will allow the project team to test a collaboratory system while executing a research project as&lt;br/&gt;well as generate valuable information on how well the system can be used for the purpose of supporting&lt;br/&gt;observatory science and design. Both systems are IT cornerstones for a shared CI between and CUAHSI&lt;br/&gt;and CLEANER and as such must be evaluated before being released to the communities.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Besides the impact this project will have on the CI development for hydrologic and&lt;br/&gt;environmental engineering communities in identifying future research needs, it will also address the&lt;br/&gt;educational sector. One of the major goals of both communities is to bring water related data and tools&lt;br/&gt;into the class room as well to i) better train the future workforce on issues related to water, and ii) to&lt;br/&gt;expose them to aspects of information technology that could place future professionals at the interface of&lt;br/&gt;water and IT, an educational goal that has been identified by the NSF Blue Ribbon Advisory Panel on&lt;br/&gt;Cyberinfrastructure as being one of the most pressing educational needs of the future.</AbstractNarration>
