<AbstractNarration>This project is creating a regional partnership of educational institutions, industry, and government agencies that form a pipeline from community college to university to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) industry.  The target population is economically and/or educationally disadvantaged students in STEM fields.  The goals of the this project are to increase retention of students in STEM disciplines and to increase the number of students who: a) pursue STEM academic and career pathways b) graduate with B.S. degrees in STEM fields and c) participate in STEM industry internships/research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The institutions included in this collaboration are San Diego State University, San Diego City College, and Southwestern College.  The project is incorporating the Math, Engineering, Science,  Achievement (MESA) Program model at each partner campus. It is enhancing efforts to provide essential services that help students excel academically, develop leadership skills, and gain exposure to industry.  Team internships are being facilitated through this project to provide students with opportunities to increase their knowledge and to develop skills for academic and workplace success, and ultimately to become part of the economic development of the region. A "Guide to an Effective STEP" is being developed to disseminate the outcomes and effectiveness of the SPSD program to contribute to the national effort to increase student participation in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) Talent Expansion Program of San Diego (SPSD) is a student success initiative built on the best practices of the Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program and from grant funding by the National Science Foundation (0653234, 0653291, 0653277).  Forming an educational pipeline of STEM students, the SPSD Partner institutions include San Diego City College, Southwestern College, and San Diego State University.  Business leaders in California have sounded an alarm.  They cannot find the STEM Talent they need to stay competitive.  StudentsÆ lagging performance is a critical reason why.  In California, the nationÆs technology and innovation hub, only 10% of the stateÆs college degrees and certificates were earned in STEM fields in 2009.  By 2025, California will face a shortfall of one million college degrees.  80% (170) of the MESA participants at San Diego State University graduated with bachelor degrees in STEM during SPSDÆs six year run using the successful and cost-effective MESA program.  SPSD supported students through cluster groups for core academic courses, providing academic counseling, hands-on engineering and science competitions, professional development opportunities, scholarships, internships, and local industry engagement.  Overall, SPSD was successful in surpassing its goals of increasing the number, retention, and participation of undergraduate students, emphasizing historically underrepresented populations, that result in STEM bachelor degrees and/or STEM post-graduate studies.  SPSD and MESA provides a solution for CaliforniaÆs workforce needs and enables the United States to be globally competitive and diverse.
