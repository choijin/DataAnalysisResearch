<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and scale-up an industrially robust and low cost chemical mechanical smoothening&lt;br/&gt;(CMS) process to produce atomically polished gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon substrates for high power and high frequency applications. As GaN is mechanically hard and&lt;br/&gt;chemically inert, traditional surface polishing processes have resulted in significant&lt;br/&gt;surface damage which negatively affects the electrical performance. In contrast, the CMS&lt;br/&gt;process forms a soft layer on GaN surface which can be removed by nanoparticles. In the&lt;br/&gt;Phase II of this project, the company plans to further optimize and scale-up the CMS&lt;br/&gt;process. In conjunction with the compound semiconductor chip manufacturers and&lt;br/&gt;academic partners, the company's plan is to further validate the polishing technology by&lt;br/&gt;fabricating and testing the performance of high electron mobility transistors. The research&lt;br/&gt;team members are internationally recognized experts and are in an excellent position to&lt;br/&gt;execute the research plan and attain the project goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercialization of the proposed polishing technology is expected to significantly&lt;br/&gt;impact GaN based semiconductor technology used for high frequency, high power&lt;br/&gt;microwave devices in wireless mobile communication and radar defense systems. This&lt;br/&gt;process will accelerate commercialization of GaN on silicon technology by increasing&lt;br/&gt;yield and reducing manufacturing costs. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
