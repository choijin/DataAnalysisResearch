<AbstractNarration>The past few years have witnessed a growing number of large-scale&lt;br/&gt;networked systems. Most of these systems are built following an&lt;br/&gt;overlay approach, with each of them regularly and independently&lt;br/&gt;probing its environment to guide path selection algorithms, route&lt;br/&gt;around faulty links and replicate content for availability. As these&lt;br/&gt;systems grow in popularity, such an approach will result in an&lt;br/&gt;unsustainable degree of monitoring and restrict the variety, number&lt;br/&gt;and span of distributed services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thesis of this project is that a large fraction of&lt;br/&gt;globally-distributed systems can be built to ensure sustainable&lt;br/&gt;scalability by strategically reusing the view of the network gathered&lt;br/&gt;by long-running, ubiquitous services such as CDNs and P2P&lt;br/&gt;systems. This work defines and explores "3R" - a new approach to the&lt;br/&gt;design and implementation of distributed systems that focuses on&lt;br/&gt;minimizing aggregated control and administrative overhead by&lt;br/&gt;strategically reusing environment's views and recycling previously&lt;br/&gt;gathered measurements. In particular, we are designing efficient&lt;br/&gt;techniques for maintaining, accessing and reusing this information for&lt;br/&gt;building next-generation streaming multicast, content distribution and&lt;br/&gt;data sharing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work explores the tradeoffs in the recycling/reuse of&lt;br/&gt;environmental measurements, and their implication in&lt;br/&gt;distributed-system design. Ultimately, it will facilitate deployments&lt;br/&gt;of wide-area applications, benefiting society at large. The research&lt;br/&gt;agenda is complemented by a thorough education and outreach plan for&lt;br/&gt;strengthening experimental systems education and contributing to&lt;br/&gt;minority recruitment and retention.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
