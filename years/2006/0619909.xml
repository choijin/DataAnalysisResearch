<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) requests a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The instrument will have the following technical features: a PPMS base system with a 9 Tesla longitudinal magnet and power supply, PPMS EverCoolTM recondensing system, vibrating sample magnetometer, ac susceptibility/dc magnetization measurement option, horizontal sample rotator, ac transport property measurement system, and multi-functional probe. This state-of-the-art PPMS will be used for research into a broad range of scientific challenges in nanotechnology and material sciences, including detection of triplet superconductivity in Ferromagnet/Superconductor hybrid systems; development of nanostructured molecular or covalent superlattices and crystalline porous materials; study of dissipation mechanisms in superconducting YBa2Cu3O7 coated conductors; development of novel techniques for ultra-high resolution magnetic resonance microscopy; studies of magnetic properties on new complexes containing nitric oxide and transition metals. To promote research and teaching and maximize multi-user access, the PPMS will be located at Institute for Integrated Research in Materials, Environments and Society (IIRMES) at CSULB, the core analytical facility at California State University (CSU) system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PPMS is the only instrument commercially available that provides precise, interactive, and simultaneous control of the temperature (1.9 - 400 K) and magnetic field (up to t 9 T) in a wide range. Such capability enables researchers to study magnetic, electrical, superconducting, and many other physical properties of materials that are strongly temperature- and magnetic-field dependent. The research performed on the PPMS will offer new insights into the physical properties of a diverse range of natural and synthetic materials. PPMS will serve as a major instrument essential to, but currently unavailable for the successful completion of various research programs at CSULB. PPMS will also contribute greatly to outreach and education programs. As a part of IIRMES, PPMS will serve a large academic user base in an environment that actively encourages the shared use of the instruments. This will results in efficient peer exchange and collegial interaction and foster collaborative ventures in cross disciplinary research and teaching. CSU system is the largest educational establishment in the U.S. serving a student population of over 410,000 students. The requested PPMS will be the first instrument of its kind within the CSU system to enable research in variable temperature and magnetic field environments. Among many research programs benefiting from the new instrument will be programs leading to finding new functionalities in magnetic thin films, development of advanced and functional microporus materials, better understanding of coated conductors, and development of new magnetic sensing mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
