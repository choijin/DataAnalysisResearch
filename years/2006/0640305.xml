<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: SGER: Integrated Solutions for Ubiquitous Use of Electricty and Cyber Services&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Kezunovic, Mladen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: Texas A&amp;M University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will explore and define research areas for the future development of integrated solutions for ubiquitous use of electricity and cyber services. This study is focused on the cross section of several scientific areas, including microelectronics, nano and bio materials, renewable energy resources, energy efficiency, embedded information processing, information and energy security, and system sciences. Intellectual Merit. Electric energy and communication services lie at the core of the modern technology driven economy. A fundamental engineering challenge over the coming decades will be to invent new technology and system solutions that allow individuals ubiquitous access to electricity and cyber services. This study will explore the scientific issues that need to be pursued to obtain the solutions, with particularly emphasis on how the integration of the two services may offer tremendous benefits. The project will identify areas of research needs by querying experts in academia and industry on various aspects of integration of the electricity and cyber infrastructures and will outline the engineering issues for scalable electric energy sources, embedded information systems, hybrid communications, flexible electricity demand control, and versatile cyber systems, which are needed for the ubiquitous electricity and cyber service delivery. Broader Impact. This research is interdisciplinary and may impact diverse scientific communities giving rise to the potential for new collaboration. The goal of this proposed research area, ubiquitous access to energy and communications, also has tremendous importance for society as a whole in providing more robust infrastructures and in response to emergencies and other extreme events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
