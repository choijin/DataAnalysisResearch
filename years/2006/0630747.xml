<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to convene an EPSCoR 2020 Workshop on June 15-16, 2006, in Washington, DC, with the primary objective of identifying long-term goals and key strategies that will define NSF EPSCoR over the next 11-20 years.  The workshop provides a forum for participants, representing EPSCoR states and jurisdictions, to dialogue with national STEM leaders to evaluate and determine the impact of past investments and address research infrastructure activities that will position scientists and engineers in EPSCoR states to compete for emerging NSF programmatic areas. It is anticipated that the workshop will assist the Foundation in the creation of a new vision for NSF EPSCoR, as participants share diverse perspectives on EPSCoR's role in and contribution to the advancement of the science and technology enterprise, as well as facilitate NSF's efforts in enhancing the national research capacity of the country.</AbstractNarration>
