<AbstractNarration>A joint program of research in chiral liquid crystals will be carried out by investigators at the University of Colorado, Boulder, the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and the University of Stuttgart, Germany. The principal investigators at the University of Colorado have broad combined expertise in the characterization and modeling of liquid crystal materials. They collaborate in several research projects, including the multidisciplinary Liquid Crystal Materials Research Center (LCMRC), an NSF MRSEC. The proposed European partners maintain similar yet complementary programs of investigation of chiral liquid crystals, with support from the Swedish Science Foundation (SSF) and the German Research  Foundation (DFG) respectively. This Materials World Network project will develop and strengthen a program of intensive joint research begun in 1999, with Ph.D. student support from NSF for Chalmers/Colorado work begun in 2003.  NSF support will enable enhanced collaboration in an exciting area of forefront liquid crystal research, combining the complementary capabilities of the three groups in projects to pursue the fundamental physics and applications of a novel class of polar/chiral smectic liquid crystals as the principal overall theme.  While the three groups have been actively collaborating over the past several years, all with joint publications, the Network creates a uniquely powerful team for forefront research on chiral liquid crystals.  &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity derives from the technological importance of the proposed research, the broad range of fundamental scientific questions to be addressed, and the unique and complementary areas of expertise brought to bear through the joint efforts of the three groups.  The focus is on exotic chiral smectics: the "V-shaped switching" smectic C's with the most rapid analog liquid crystal electro-optic effects; the "deVries" materials exhibiting analog behavior via extended molecular tilt correlations in the smectic A phase; and the closely related "orthoconic" high-tilt antiferroelectrics.   The proposed research highlights fundamental studies of the relationships of these behaviors, investigations of novel liquid crystal systems with ramifications for a variety of areas in soft materials science.  The corresponding materials development will enable a variety of novel applications, including holographic data storage and chirality detection. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed activity in the areas of education and industrial outreach and human resource development will be substantial, augmenting and enhancing ongoing programs in Europe and Boulder.  Exchange visits of junior researchers and faculty will promote cultural diversity and the professional development of the participants.  The partner groups will share and adapt appropriate outreach materials, including modules for K-12 science enrichment classes. The liquid crystal materials to be investigated are promising candidates for applications in the areas of displays and optical beam steering. The Boulder group has a track record of substantive technology transfer including spin-off commercial ventures producing liquid crystal display products and scientific equipment.  Given the wide variety of potential applications of the proposed research, it is likely that this collaboration will engender technology transfer to the private sector both in the U.S. and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
