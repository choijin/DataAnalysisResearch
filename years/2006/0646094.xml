<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOME REPORT  Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center  "Science of Nanoscale Systems and their Device Applications"  Harvard University / MIT / UC Santa Barbara / Museum of Science, Boston  Goals of our Center's Research Program  Tools for Biology  - Develop tools for Biology based using soft lithography and microfluidics, including advanced biological sensors and actuators and the low-cost nanofabrication of nanoscale structures using soft lithography.   Nanoelectronics, Nanophotonics &amp; Quantum Information Processing  Build and characterize devices from nanoscale structures and understand them theoretically for applications in signal processing, computing, sensing, and quantum information processing.  Three overlapping Research Areas address these goals:   Research Area I: Tools for Integrated Nanobiology builds bridges between the physical sciences, biology, and medicine by developing new tools to manipulate and test biological cells and tissues, based on soft lithography, microfluidics, and semiconductor technology.  Research Area II: Nanoscale Building Blocks creates nanostructures with size-dependent properties including nanoparticles, nanowires and heterostructures, which serve as building blocks for nanoelectronics and nanophotonics as well as sensors for biological systems.   Research Area III: Imaging at the Nanoscale images electrons and photons in nanoscale structures and devices using custom cooled scanning probe microscopes, cooled scanning tunneling microscopes, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy.      Outcomes of our Center's Research Program - Examples are presented here:  Handheld NMR Biosensor - At Harvard, Donhee Ham created a handheld biosensor based on a single silicon integrated circuit (Fig. 2). The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal comes from clumping of magnetic nanoparticles when they are exposed to a target protein.  A conventional benchtop NMR system is large, heavy and expensive.  By designing a custom chip, Ham created a handheld system that is 1200 times lighter, yet has 150 times more mass sensitivity. This system is making a significant impact on the medical community, because it enables low-cost, portable NMR biosensors.  Band-Engineered Nanocrystal Barbells - The transformation of light into current requires as a first step, the rapid dissociation of electrons and holes so that they can be carried to opposite electrodes. At MIT, Moungi Bawendi's group designed and synthesized "nano-barbells" shown in Fig. 3 in which the electrons from absorbed photons are attracted to the CdSe bar and the holes are attracted to the CdTe bells, dissociating electron-hole pairs at the nanoscale.  Scanning Electron Transistor Imaging of Electron- and Hole-rich Regions in Graphene - Graphene is a remarkable new material that changes the rules for electronics. A graphene flake is only one atom thick and the electrons travel at a fixed speed like ultrarelativistic particles.  Using a highly sensitive scanning electron transistor microscope, Amir Yacoby at Harvard directly imaged charged electron and hole puddles in a graphene sheet, (Fig. 4). This microscope will be a very useful tool to understand the physics of future graphene devices.      Goals for our Center - Broader Impacts  Educate the Next Generation of Scientists &amp; Engineers &ndash; For the US at the forefront we need to draw in young students into careers in of Science and Technology.  Increase Diversity by recruiting a more diverse group of students, postdocs, and faculty members to our Center.  Develop Intrastructure for Nanoscale Science &amp; Engineering - Promote university investments in shared facilities in this field.  Commercialize Science and Engineering by creating new companies, new jobs and new products.  Outcomes of our Center - Broader Impacts  New Careers for Grad Students and Postdocs - Our Center has produced an outstanding, multidisciplinary group of young scientists and engineers who are ent...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
