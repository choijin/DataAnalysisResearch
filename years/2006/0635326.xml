    <AbstractNarration>The design of efficient, and low complexity, coding and decoding algorithms is a critical component in&lt;br/&gt;the optimization of wireless and wire-line networks. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of new&lt;br/&gt;powerful paradigms, e.g., belief propagation, as well as the revival of classical approaches, e.g., sequential&lt;br/&gt;decoding, for the design of decoding algorithms. This proposal seeks a deeper theoretical foundation for the&lt;br/&gt;design and analysis of efficient decoding algorithms, along with the associated code ensembles, by building&lt;br/&gt;on this recent progress.&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the proposed research is to unify under one framework the class of algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that exploit the power of local constraints, e.g., the linear programming or belief propagation decoders and&lt;br/&gt;generalization thereof, with the class of algorithms that optimize a global cost function, e.g., tree search&lt;br/&gt;decoders. The proposed research benefits from our preliminary results that establish interesting connections&lt;br/&gt;between different decoding schemes (as detailed in the sequel). Our results are expected to elucidate the&lt;br/&gt;properties of known algorithms and inspire the design of more powerful decoders. Our investigations&lt;br/&gt;will start with the traditional point-to-point scenario where the complexity of the model ranges from the&lt;br/&gt;simplified binary erasure channel to the challenging multi-path fading channel. In the latter case, our&lt;br/&gt;work will target a joint detection and decoding approach and consider, explicitly, the associated signal&lt;br/&gt;processing tasks, e.g., the preprocessing stage which will be defined rigorously in the sequel.&lt;br/&gt;Our research will then proceed to investigate three distinct categories of multi-user channels. The&lt;br/&gt;first thrust will focus on the outage-limited multiple access channel where efficient decoding algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff will be pursued. The same line of work will also&lt;br/&gt;seek code ensembles and decoding algorithms that achieve the capacity of the compound multiple access&lt;br/&gt;channel (CMAC), one of the few examples where the celebrated successive cancellation decoder fails to&lt;br/&gt;achieve capacity. The CMAC model captures the essential characteristics of delay-limited multiple access&lt;br/&gt;channels with limited transmitter channel state information. The study of the broadcast channel (i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;downlink) is our second research thrust where low complexity and high performance dirty paper codes&lt;br/&gt;and rateless codes will be constructed. Within this context, classical works on tree search source coding&lt;br/&gt;will be revisited in order to construct low complexity vector quantization stage for the dirty-paper coding&lt;br/&gt;scheme. The third research thrust will be devoted to cooperative channels. Here, our efforts will seek&lt;br/&gt;to characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the cooperative interference channel along with the&lt;br/&gt;associated optimal coding and decoding algorithms. This work will build on the intimate relationship&lt;br/&gt;between the CMAC and the interference channel. Finally, inspired by our recent work in the area, novel&lt;br/&gt;approaches for cooperative lattice coding and decoding algorithms will be unveiled.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the fundamental nature of the posed questions&lt;br/&gt;and the expected contributions to information and coding theories. New bridges between information&lt;br/&gt;theory, from one side, and optimization and algebraic number theories, from the other side, will be built.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, analytical tools, as well as efficient numerical methods, that aid in the design and analysis&lt;br/&gt;of decoding algorithms will be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs, with collective expertise in information theory, coding theory, wireless communications, and&lt;br/&gt;signal processing, form a qualified team for undertaking the research plan. This project builds on recent&lt;br/&gt;results from the PIs' ongoing collaboration. The proposed theoretical research is expected to have a broad&lt;br/&gt;impact on the information theory and signal processing communities. Furthermore, the anticipated results&lt;br/&gt;will contribute to the design of efficient encoding/decoding algorithms which percolate through many&lt;br/&gt;applications (please refer to the support letters from Texas Instruments and ST Microelectronics). On the&lt;br/&gt;educational front, graduate students at the two participating institutions will be heavily involved in the&lt;br/&gt;research activities.</AbstractNarration>
