<AbstractNarration>PI: Nadrian C. Seeman &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  New York University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0608889&lt;br/&gt;Title: NIRT: Active Nanostructures for Nucleic Directed Synthesis of Organic Functional Polymers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 05-610, category NIRT.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: The goal of this project is to build on the DNA nanotechnology developed by the Seeman laboratory over the last four years to chemically manufacture a DNA nanomachine capable of synthesizing polymers with desired optical, electrical, and stereochemical properties that are difficult or impossible to achieve with normal polymer synthesis techniques.  The aim is to develop and prototype the strategy to construct such polymers with a precision approaching that by which the ribosome constructs proteins.  This project would bring to bear underlying tools that have been developed recently by Seeman (NYU), Goddard (Caltech), Winfree (Caltech), and Canary (NYU) under previous NIRT and SGER projects.  They plan to use these tools to produce and demonstrate the artificial ribosome device.  To accomplish this they plan to:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Develop a translation device to convert a given sequence of monomers to polymers with precise length and sequence control (modifying the rotary device previously developed by Seeman)&lt;br/&gt;(2) Use transcriptional circuitry developed by Winfree to control the nature and sequence of the polymer synthesized and to provide polymers that reflect the history of the system.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Use multiscale first principles-based simulation tools developed by Goddard and Deng to design and optimize the polymer monomers and connections to achieve supramolecular active organic polymer structures with desired electronic or optical properties&lt;br/&gt;(4) Use novel organic synthesis techniques developed by Canary to build DNA-polymer subunit conjugates to add polymer subunits to nucleic acid backbones. This chemistry-prototyping system already responds to a continuous message.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They plan to first introduce a translocation step in the nanodevice so that inputting a new message to the device will result in a new polymer product.  The advantage of translocation (in contrast to the rotary device already developed by Seeman), is that longer products can be built without making larger devices.  Ultimately they expect to generate the message via the transcriptional circuitry developed in the Winfree laboratory, thereby building polymers as a consequence of logical circuitry and in response to cues from the surrounding medium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project attempts to develop a prototype DNA based machine capable of synthesizing organic polymers with the same flexibility and specificity displayed by the ribosome in synthesizing proteins.  This is a grand challenge which would stimulate a number of research efforts to enable this for broader ranges of organic compounds.  Nothing in the technology limits it to organic polymers.  The project builds on many years of development in the Seeman, Goddard, Winfree, and Canary labs all to be brought to bear on this problem.  The confluence of these disparate efforts would likely stimulate each of the research areas involved.  To provide a useful target for this technology, the PIs plan to develop novel one and two dimensional nonlinear optical (NLO) polymers with very large hyperpolarizabilities (susceptibilities).  Even more ambitious is the proposal to build a new type of nanostructure architecture based on assembling a 2D array of functional polymers (rather than the nanotubes or nanowires of other recent approaches).  They suggest that these can be used to put logic units at the nodes rather than simple switches.  This should stimulate many new ideas and proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The NYU and Caltech PIs have aggressively pursued the active incorporation of underrepresented groups within their research operations and they have participated in special outreach programs aimed at both high school and K6 students with an emphasis on underrepresented groups. They are strongly committed to continuing and escalating these efforts under the NIRT program.  For example, the Goddard group has played a vital role in Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) and Minorities in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (MSE) programs at Caltech.  NYU has involved many high school students in nanotechnology research and Seeman works closely with scientifically-oriented arts and entertainment groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research and Education Theme: Nanoscale Devices and System Architectures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
