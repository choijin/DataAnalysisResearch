<AbstractNarration>This grant will enable graduate students and postdoctoral associates, especially from underrepresented groups, to attend and participate in the 20th North American Conference on Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation, July 9-13, 2007, on the campus of Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI. These conferences have been held for the past forty years on an approximately two-year cycle.  Originally called the Rhizobium Conference, the current meetings are a forum for scientists to present results relating to rhizobial, algal, Frankia and animal nitrogen-fixing symbioses, which are important in nutrient relationships, especially in natural ecosystems. These symbioses are important models for understanding other mutualistic relationships.  These meetings attempt to keep costs as low as possible to encourage student participation.  Subject matter at the conference ranges from the most basic to very applied, with cutting edge molecular biology in one session, cutting edge ecology in another and the latest in farm methods in a third.  The size of the meeting, usually 140-200 scientists, means that participants across these "boundaries" actually interact. A web site to describe the meeting will be established (www.marquete.edu/NASNFC). Symbiotic nitrogen fixation has great agricultural importance providing limiting nitrogen at lower cost than fossil fuel-derived nitrogen and with lower environmental impact. With today's rising cost of fossil fuel, biological nitrogen fixation is even more relevant to agriculture. The goal of these meetings is to foster understanding and to generate new knowledge through collaboration. The focus on the involvement of young scientists is particularly important, building the scientific base for future advancement and discovery.</AbstractNarration>
