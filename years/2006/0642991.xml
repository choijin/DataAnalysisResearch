<AbstractNarration>CAREER: A multi-faceted investigation of the astromineralogy and evolution of dust &lt;br/&gt;around low- and intermediate mass evolved stars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST-0642991&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Angela K Speck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Speck will study the precise nature of dust grains around low- and &lt;br/&gt;intermediate-mass stars (LIMS) because (1) this is where the dust originates &lt;br/&gt;before being expelled into the interstellar medium (ISM) and participating in &lt;br/&gt;many other astrophysical processes, and thus knowing its initial states will &lt;br/&gt;allow for a more accurate prediction of its fate in and effect on the ISM and &lt;br/&gt;beyond and (2) the environment around most of these LIMS is relatively benign &lt;br/&gt;and thus has simplified chemistry, which facilitates the understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;processes in play. Dr. Speck will use a range of techniques including &lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy, imaging and modeling, incorporating new laboratory data and taking &lt;br/&gt;into account theoretical models and meteoritic studies to provide knowledge of &lt;br/&gt;the nature of dust forming around LIMS.  This study will also assess &lt;br/&gt;how dust formation changes with stellar evolution. In this way, the effect of &lt;br/&gt;chemistry and density on dust formation can be determined, allowing testing &lt;br/&gt;and refinement of existing models for dust formation and evolution and which &lt;br/&gt;can be applied to many astrophysical environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major problems in investigating circumstellar dust is that it &lt;br/&gt;incorporates so many apparently disparate aspects of the physical sciences &lt;br/&gt;(physics, astronomy, geology, and chemistry).  In order to provide a background &lt;br/&gt;and framework for such knowledge, Dr. Speck will introduce an &lt;br/&gt;upper level/graduate astrophysics course in cosmochemistry that will be open to &lt;br/&gt;students from other departments as well.  Dr. Speck's research is specifically &lt;br/&gt;designed to involve students at all levels (undergraduate, masters and doctoral) &lt;br/&gt;and therefore breaks down into modular chunks. In this way the research &lt;br/&gt;undertaken also allows for training of students at these various levels.  &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Speck will continue her effort to recruit and mentor female graduate &lt;br/&gt;students as well as students from other underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this NSF CAREER project was to improve our understanding of dust in space (cosmic dust) and its impact on the surrounding environment, while simultaneously training the next generation of scientists to be critical thinkers as well as excellent researchers, teachers and public outreachers.     Cosmic dust pertains to basic questions of galactic processes; dust needs to be well understood in its own right, if we are to understand its contribution to many aspects of astrophysics.
