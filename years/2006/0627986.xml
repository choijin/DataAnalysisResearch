<AbstractNarration>This investigation searches for evidence of the effectiveness of standards-based mathematics curriculum materials on postsecondary STEM achievement, course taking patterns and persistence compared to results from graduates who were exposed to other high school mathematics curricula.  Approximately 30 postsecondary institutions in Minnesota and 30,000 students representing over 325 high schools are sampled.  A retrospective cohort design and hierarchical linear modeling is used to quantify the longitudinal impact of curriculum type on postsecondary STEM performance.  Results will help educators, school districts, students, parents and academicians to make more informed decisions about appropriate mathematics curricula for their student population.</AbstractNarration>

Post, Professor, Mathematics Education,  Michael Harwell, Professor, Quantitative Methods     Awardee: University of Minnesota-Twin Cities  Award Number: DRL 0627986  Award Expires: 09/30/11  Program Officer Name: David B. Campbell  Program Officer Email Address: dcampbel@nsf.gov  Program Officer Phone Number: (703) 292-5093     Introduction:     In the early 1990Æs, after a long series of disappointing results on national and international mathematics achievement tests (i.e. TIMSS, NAEP, A Nation at Risk), with disappointing numbers of students pursuing four full years of high school mathematics, and disappointment with the number of US citizens who pursued a STEM major in college and subsequently entered STEM related careers, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the development of 13 complete mathematics programs at the elementary, middle grades and secondary level in a large scale attempt to improve the quality of the nationsÆ K-12 mathematics programs and ultimately to interest a wider variety of students to complete four years of college intending mathematics while in high school.     The Minnesota Mathematics Achievement Project (MNMAP) was a four-year program of research (2007-2011) that explored the relationship between high school mathematics curricula and college-level mathematics performance.  Specifically, MNMAP contrasted three secondary level NSF-funded curricula (Contemporary Mathematics in Context (Core+), Mathematics Modeling Our World (MMOW) and the Interactive Mathematics Project (IMP) with various commercially developed (CD) textbook programs (i.e.  Addison Wesley, Harcourt, Saxon etc.) and the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project (UCSMP), a program partially supported with NSF funds.  The first editions of the three NSF funded secondary curricula examined here were published for general use between 1997 and 1999.  Second editions of these programs were released for general use approximately ten years later.     Of most interest was the high school mathematics curricula used by students (NSF-funded or not).  The student level variables used in the analyses were: ACT scores, grades in high school mathematics (GPA), number of years of high school mathematics (3, 4 or 5), ethnicity, and gender.  The outcomes of most interest were studentsÆ college level mathematics achievement, persistence (# of courses completed), and course taking patterns over as many as eight semesters of college work.  This program of research whose data is based on college records and transcripts has to date conducted over a dozen studies that for the most part addressed progressively more complex questions about this relationship.  Each study has resulted in a formal research paper.  Seven of these papers have been published; the others are either in press or have been submitted for review.  Versions of each of these papers can be found on the project website early in 2012.  www.cehd.umn.edu/ci/mnmap     MNMAP developed a rich database with over 26,000 students from 466 high schools and thirty-two 4-year and twenty-two 2-year post-secondary institutions that differ in size, selectivity, and mission.  Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used in the various analyses.  The primary inferential tool was hierarchical linear modeling (HLM).  Due to the nature of the data collected, retrospective cohort designs were the primary paradigm employed.  Both cross- sectional and longitudinal studies were conducted.     It is our view that local schools and communities should be aware of these developments as they can affect the current and often vitriolic criticisms of NSF-funded curricula by anti-reform groups.  Criticisms incidentally that have largely been based on anecdotal remarks that have often been mistakenly ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
