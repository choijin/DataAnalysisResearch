<AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) will convene a committee of leading thinkers&lt;br/&gt;from such areas as technology, science, business, politics, and entertainment. They will create a&lt;br/&gt;ranked list of the grand challenges and opportunities for engineering facing those born at the&lt;br/&gt;dawn of this new century. This "blue-ribbon" committee will then look at engineering research&lt;br/&gt;and innovation either already being explored or which should be considered that might help&lt;br/&gt;address aspects of each challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Input from many sources will be considered, including the NAE membership and foreign&lt;br/&gt;associates, engineering societies worldwide, international Frontiers of Engineering attendees,&lt;br/&gt;engineering students, MacArthur grantees, Intel Science Search winners, NSF Young&lt;br/&gt;Investigator awardees, and the broader public. The committee will be a diverse, balanced, highprofile,&lt;br/&gt;international group with both technical expertise and vision. Key, and unique, to this&lt;br/&gt;project will be a focus on public outreach. Not only will public input be sought during the&lt;br/&gt;deliberative process, but results will be shared through a major event in Washington, D.C.,&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with one or more major media outlets, and a web site designed with students in&lt;br/&gt;mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of this project are: (1) to improve public understanding of how engineering can&lt;br/&gt;address current and emerging societal challenges; (2) to excite young people about their potential&lt;br/&gt;to contribute to the world's grand challenges through an engineering career; and (3) to uncover&lt;br/&gt;examples of engineering research opportunities related to the challenges.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Public outreach is a primary goal of this project. The public will be invited to provide input&lt;br/&gt;about grand challenges to society that engineering and technology might address in the future.&lt;br/&gt;By actively thinking about large-scale enduring challenges and how engineering and technology&lt;br/&gt;might meet them, the public will better understand the process of engineering and what issues&lt;br/&gt;engineers can address. Outcomes will show, in an engaging way, how engineering is helping&lt;br/&gt;people throughout the world. It will illustrate how even some of the most esoteric concepts may&lt;br/&gt;prove to have huge impacts on practical issues ranging from global politics to our own bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only will this project contribute to technological literacy by illustrating the impact future&lt;br/&gt;technologies may have on our lives, but it will provide a better understand of the engineering&lt;br/&gt;profession. It will show the process of developing new technologies and the trade-offs involved.&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage people of all ages in a discussion of technological choices, benefits,&lt;br/&gt;risks, and values. It will also give the public a clear picture of engineers' roles in society.&lt;br/&gt;By using high-profile people to generate specific challenges and opportunities, this project will&lt;br/&gt;excite young people about contributing to society something recent surveys have said they&lt;br/&gt;want to do. Girls, in particular, are interested in choosing careers that help people. This project&lt;br/&gt;will vividly illustrate how engineering can accomplish those goals.</AbstractNarration>
