<AbstractNarration>Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time produced by accelerating masses, first predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity in 1916. They are elusive messengers from the Universe, as they carry information from such catastrophic events as the collision of black holes, supernova explosions and the Big Bang, but they are extremely hard to measure. To date, we only have indirect proof of their existence, but their detection will provide a new way to listen to the Universe, and initiate a new era of gravitational wave astronomy.  The LIGO project has the ambitious goal to detect gravitational waves using three laser interferometers with km-scale baselines, two located in Hanford, WA and one in Livingston, LA.&lt;br/&gt;LIGO recently completed a 2-year run at design sensitivity, and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) is analyzing the data.  At the same time detector enhancements will double the distance of sources LIGO is sensitive to, in the current, initial configuration.&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation to this effort of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst LSC group. The group will be involved in the analysis of LIGO data, with particular attention to the signals from the coalescence of black holes and to the serendipitous discovery of unmodeled bursts of gravitational waves.  The project will also focus on the bridge from data analysis to detector characterization, using data analysis tools to provide astrophysical feedback for instrument commissioners and developing strategies to discriminate between gravitational wave candidates and spurious noise transients in the detector.&lt;br/&gt;This award promotes diversity, as it supports a new research group, founded by a junior female PI. Students will be part of exciting research at the frontiers of knowledge and the PI will participate in outreach activities centered on the theme of women and minorities in science.</AbstractNarration>
