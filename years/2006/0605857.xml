<AbstractNarration>Kondic&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0605857&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project centers on analyzing and understanding the&lt;br/&gt;nature of information propagation through dense granular systems. &lt;br/&gt;The properties of the signals are then used to deduce the basic&lt;br/&gt;physical mechanisms of the force and energy transmission.  These&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms have been the subject of considerable study lately&lt;br/&gt;because it is crucial to understand whether the forces between&lt;br/&gt;granular particles propagate in a manner that can be described&lt;br/&gt;under an elliptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic framework.  The&lt;br/&gt;starting point of this project is development of large scale&lt;br/&gt;discrete element simulations that are used to analyze response of&lt;br/&gt;dense granular systems to space- and time-dependent&lt;br/&gt;perturbations.  The results of the simulations are then employed&lt;br/&gt;to help formulate effective models for bridging the scales&lt;br/&gt;between micro (grain scale) and meso (hundreds or thousands of&lt;br/&gt;grains) descriptions of granular systems.  Both static and&lt;br/&gt;dynamic granular systems are considered, making it possible to&lt;br/&gt;analyze the interplay between granular dynamics and signal&lt;br/&gt;propagation.  This setup also allows for considering some&lt;br/&gt;important features of dense granular flows, such as the role of&lt;br/&gt;force anisotropy and underlying microstructure. The project is&lt;br/&gt;carried out in close collaboration with experimental work&lt;br/&gt;performed at Duke University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dense granular systems are one of the most challenging&lt;br/&gt;systems in the field of soft condensed matter, in particular&lt;br/&gt;because they are subject to jamming, and fall in between solid&lt;br/&gt;and liquid states of matter.  Analysis of signal propagation&lt;br/&gt;through these systems allows us to understand how granularity on&lt;br/&gt;a micro scale influences macroscale behavior.  The novel research&lt;br/&gt;techniques used here also can be applied to other soft condensed&lt;br/&gt;matter systems that experience jamming, such as emulsions,&lt;br/&gt;colloids, gels, and foams.  In addition, signal propagation&lt;br/&gt;through granular systems is of considerable importance in a&lt;br/&gt;number of practical problems including oil recovery,&lt;br/&gt;vibrofluidized beds, and some important humanitarian efforts,&lt;br/&gt;such as detection of land mines.  The project addresses basic&lt;br/&gt;issues in statics and dynamics of dense granular systems;&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these basic concepts allows for future progress&lt;br/&gt;in developing better models needed for numerous applications of&lt;br/&gt;granular materials.</AbstractNarration>
