<AbstractNarration>Imaging a Natural Experiment in Drainage Divide Migration&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - The objective of this proposal is to acquire and analyze highresolution&lt;br/&gt;digital topography data for an ~18km2 field site in the Colorado high plains&lt;br/&gt;that represents a natural experiment in scarp retreat and drainage divide migration.&lt;br/&gt;The site offers a unique opportunity to document landform development and test&lt;br/&gt;physically based landscape evolution theory under differential baselevel control. The&lt;br/&gt;larger importance is two-fold. First, drainage divide migration is a fundamental aspect&lt;br/&gt;of landscape response to tectonics, eustasy, and other forms of baselevel control.&lt;br/&gt;Second, testing physically based landscape evolution models requires natural&lt;br/&gt;experiments that involve a transient response to a known forcing factor, such as&lt;br/&gt;baselevel. High-resolution, research-grade laser altimetry data are essential to&lt;br/&gt;achieving these goals because standard USGS digital elevation data lack the necessary&lt;br/&gt;resolution and accuracy to document the topographic signatures of the governing&lt;br/&gt;processes, extract statistics for model-data comparison, and map incised surfaces. The&lt;br/&gt;project is timely because the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM)&lt;br/&gt;will launch a mission to acquire data from other sites in Colorado this summer. The&lt;br/&gt;cost of data will be significantly lower if the data for the study area are collected&lt;br/&gt;during NCALM's 2006 Colorado mission. The data will be analyzed to determine&lt;br/&gt;characteristic topographic signatures, including slope and curvature maps and&lt;br/&gt;frequency distributions, slope-area diagrams, area aggregation indices, and related&lt;br/&gt;metics. They will also be used to reconstruct the former extent of a series of incised&lt;br/&gt;valley fills and upland surfaces. These data, when combined with timing constraints&lt;br/&gt;on cut and fill events, will provide a unique method for testing landscape evolution&lt;br/&gt;models and their predictions about divide migration in response to differential&lt;br/&gt;baselevel lowering. Exploratory iterative forward modeling using the CHILD model&lt;br/&gt;will be used to identify process laws and parameter sets that can and cannot account&lt;br/&gt;for the observed topography and soil thickness. Success in this project is expected to&lt;br/&gt;seed a larger effort that will generate geochronology data, real-time process&lt;br/&gt;monitoring, and sediment-yield estimates, resulting in a comprehensive data set for&lt;br/&gt;use by the research community in testing other landform evolution models. Note that&lt;br/&gt;in addition to the budget requested in this proposal, funds are also requested for data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition by NCALM. If funded, the University of Florida will request a&lt;br/&gt;supplemental budget for these expenses.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - The broader impacts of this research fall into several categories.&lt;br/&gt;The high-resolution altimetry data will directly support the dissertation research of a&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, thus contributing to teaching, training,&lt;br/&gt;and learning. The project enhances infrastructure by providing the scientific&lt;br/&gt;community with altimetry data and associated information for a valuable research&lt;br/&gt;site; in addition to its geomorphic importance, the area encompasses a world-famous&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary section. Broad dissemination will be ensured&lt;br/&gt;not only through the usual routes of publications and conferences, but also by&lt;br/&gt;providing data and images to the Plains Conservation Center, a non-profit land&lt;br/&gt;conservation and public education organization that owns the site, and to the Denver&lt;br/&gt;Museum of Natural Science, which leads research on the K-T boundary section and&lt;br/&gt;has a strong track record in research-based public outreach related to the geology of&lt;br/&gt;the Denver Basin. Benefits to society include advances in our understanding of soil&lt;br/&gt;erosion, transport, and deposition, which is applicable to land management.</AbstractNarration>
