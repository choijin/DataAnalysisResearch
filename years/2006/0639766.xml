    <AbstractNarration>0639766&lt;br/&gt;Ritter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a consultant with expertise in science education who will be in charge of a detailed study on declining interest in science and technology studies among young people for the Organization for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OECD Global Science Forum (GSF) has undertaken over the last two years a study on the evolution of student interest for science and technology studies. This activity has been carried out by a working group composed of representatives from sixteen OECD countries and the European Commission. The goals of the activity were: (1) to analyze quantitative trends in students' choice for S&amp;T studies over recent years (and, in particular, to quantify the extent of any actual decline), (2) to identify the underlying factors that affect students' choices and (3) to explore solutions that can be implemented to influence such choices. With the help of a consultant, the GSF will assemble the full quantitative analysis of the statistical data gathered as well as extensive analysis of the causes of the decline in S&amp;T interest among young people as well as possible solutions and policy recommendations into a detailed OECD publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other contributors to this project include the Academy of Finland, the Germany Federal Ministry for Education and Research, the Ministry of Flanders (Belgium), and the Australian Department of Education, Science and Training.</AbstractNarration>
