<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0638669&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Richard Moore&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Linking Watershed Research and GK-12 Education with an Ecosystem Context&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GK-12 project from the Ohio State University will engage STEM graduate fellows, along with collaborating faculty and resource professionals, and students and teachers (from grades 3-5, 6-8, 10-12) including those from Amish schools, in the research on watershed science. The project will build on existing interdisciplinary research on the Sugar Creek Watershed in North East Ohio. The project will recruit 8 STEM fellows each year. These fellows will work with 8 teachers each year. The intellectual merit includes the exploration of watershed science as a model system for incorporating multiple disciplines, such as environmental science and rural sociology, into a holistic, constructivist, systemic educational approach to create a cooperative learning opportunity involving university researchers and K-12 teachers and students. The broader impacts include providing the opportunity to fellows and teachers to join other project members for a research visit to Japan to analyze firefly habitat remediation as related to stream ecology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This interdisciplinary atmosphere enhanced the FellowsÆ innovative and successful leadership. In addition, the FellowsÆ love of their subject matter and enthusiasm for scientific research stimulated interest and inspired their students to consider careers in the sciences and technology.  The Sugar Creek watershed continues to be a focus of ongoing research at OSU. The fellowship program is one of several training grants that operate there. Over the last five years in which this fellowship has been in operation at OSU, the participating academic departments and programs have supported the efforts of this educational program. The initial NSF project provided funding for five years.  Due to its success, additional funding was secured from the Graduate School and participating departments to continue the program at a funding rate of four graduate fellows for an additional three years.      Highlights from seven years of the fellowship program:   1. GK-12 Graduate Fellows  33 OSU GK-12 Graduate Fellows have participated in this program and engaged with over 4,400 K-12 students from the Sugar Creek watershed and surrounding communities. Graduate Fellows published over 30 articles in peer-reviewed national and international science journals. After their participation to the fellowship program, numerous Graduate Fellows acquired career paths involving teaching, or science education/communication. Graduate Fellows also participated in the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development CenterÆs (OARDCÆs) "Science of Agriculture" workshop every year. The aim of this workshop was to expose K-12 students to scientific research and give them an opportunity to experience an actual research facility. Over 1,000 public education and numerous home-schooled students from across North East Ohio, including the Sugar Creek watershed, have participated in this event each year.

Graduate Fellows developed and led environmental science learning activities presented at the "Family Farm Field Day". This event was a day-long agricultural fair organized by the local Amish community that attracts several thousand participants. Various learning activities were offered by the Fellows including aquatic macroinvertebrate identification using field microscopes. The activities attracted a total of more than 2,000 K-12 level children who were mainly Amish, many of whom might have had limited exposure to formal science education.      2.
