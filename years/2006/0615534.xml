<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to further characterize an Arabidopsis ABC transporter gene, AtWBC19, which is the first plant gene known to confer antibiotic resistance, and extend the investigation to its closest homologues.  AtWBC19 is a member of a plant-specific gene family that includes 8 Arabidopsis and 5 rice coorthologous genes; only the function of AtWBC19 is known.  Since functional divergence and specialization in gene families generally occur via adaptive evolution, we hypothesize that several members of this clade are involved in the detoxification of natural bioactive compounds. Moreover, the presence of conserved motifs among all transporters in the clade suggests common regulatory mechanisms as well as a common broad function. To test this hypothesis, delineate the significance of the conserved motifs, and assess the extent of function conservation among co-orthologous genes, site directed mutagenesis, and heterologous expression in yeast will be carried out using AtWBC19 as a model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the project provides two major opportunities to link research and teaching. First, the research project will be used to teach a course on transporters at Emory University.  This is not only new, but comes at a time when the departmental curriculum is being significantly revised towards a stronger emphasis on linking research to teaching; the study of transporters is a critical endeavor for students who wish to pursue many areas of biology in greater depth. Second, several initiatives will be implemented to attract and provide opportunities for students, specifically under-represented minorities, to engage in research.  Partnerships will be developed with institutions in the larger Atlanta metro area (i.e. Spellman College, Morehead College, Fort Valley State University) to recruit at least 4 students from underrepresented groups.  This goal is obtainable because a program, Summer Undergraduate Research Program at Emory (SURE), is already in place at Emory University, which facilitates the identification of suitable mentors/students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
