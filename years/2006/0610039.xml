<AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to  develop novel numerical methods in porous media.&lt;br/&gt;Initially the Darcy model is examined under the framework of a&lt;br/&gt;Petrov-Galerkin enriched method (PGEM). The method consists in&lt;br/&gt;enriching differently trial and test funtions. The test function&lt;br/&gt;enrichments resembles residual-free bubbles, with zero condition&lt;br/&gt;for the normal compoenent of the velocity. This allows for&lt;br/&gt;static condensation and computation of the enrichment for the&lt;br/&gt;trial function. It turns out that this enrichment is a variation&lt;br/&gt;of the Raviart-Thomas. This is eliminated at the element level,&lt;br/&gt;so that the computational formulation of the current method is&lt;br/&gt;in fact that of the original spaces span by continuous piecewise linears&lt;br/&gt;and piecewise constants. A detailed study for the P1/P0 element&lt;br/&gt;and other higher order elements will be pursued along with their&lt;br/&gt;error analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods developed in this work are key to simulate intricate&lt;br/&gt;large heterogeneuous domains which is a major challenge in porous&lt;br/&gt;media field, as in oil reservoir, contaminant transport and water&lt;br/&gt;resource problems, just to cite a few of them. The methods proposed herein&lt;br/&gt;contribute to decrease large scale computations since the matrices&lt;br/&gt;are no longer semi-definite. The methods are also competitive since&lt;br/&gt;the support of the unknows is equal to the original Galerkin method.&lt;br/&gt;In summary, we are pursuing more efficient methods that can overcome &lt;br/&gt;complex mixed methods which has dominated the field over many decades.&lt;br/&gt;The problems we are addressing have impact on environmental, energy&lt;br/&gt;and are of use to DOE.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
