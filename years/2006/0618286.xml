<AbstractNarration>The gene network: This project focuses on a gene network that regulates plant responses to&lt;br/&gt;cytokinin, a key hormonal regulator of plant growth and development. The initial steps in&lt;br/&gt;cytokinin signaling are mediated by a 'two-component' system that transmits information from&lt;br/&gt;membrane to nucleus. The two-component system makes use of histidine kinases that act as&lt;br/&gt;cytokinin receptors, histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins that transduce the initial&lt;br/&gt;signal, and response regulators that regulate the signal output. The transcriptional targets of this&lt;br/&gt;pathway as well as other outputs have yet to be determined. This project will delineate the&lt;br/&gt;network of genes and proteins regulated by two-component signaling elements of Arabidopsis.&lt;br/&gt;This two-component signaling network includes the transcription factors that control gene&lt;br/&gt;expression as well as interacting proteins that regulate other aspects of signal output.&lt;br/&gt;Project URL: http://www.bio.unc.edu/research/two-component/default.htm&lt;br/&gt;Functional characterization: Transcription factors will be characterized in terms of the genes that&lt;br/&gt;they regulate. Proteins will be characterized in terms of their protein-protein interactions within&lt;br/&gt;the signaling network. The physiological function of the network elements will be defined in&lt;br/&gt;terms of their role in regulating cytokinin responses as well as seed size, meristem function,&lt;br/&gt;vascular development, leaf and cotyledon morphology, metal ion homeostasis, and circadian&lt;br/&gt;rhythms.&lt;br/&gt;Sharing of results: Genomic information and tools generated will be made available to the&lt;br/&gt;research community through the web and through standard methods of publication in a timely&lt;br/&gt;fashion. Datasets of general interest, that are not made available through publication, will be&lt;br/&gt;deposited on the project web site within two years of their generation.&lt;br/&gt;Significance of work: These studies will define the circuitry by which the two-component gene&lt;br/&gt;network acts to alter plant growth and development. In addition, these studies will reveal&lt;br/&gt;connections between this pathway and other cellular networks. Determining how this integration&lt;br/&gt;is achieved will contribute to an understanding of signaling networks in plants and will serve as a&lt;br/&gt;model for examining other interactions within the plant cell. The techniques and tools developed&lt;br/&gt;during the course of these studies will assist gene studies in Arabidopsis and in other plant&lt;br/&gt;species.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Results from the project will benefit society through the understanding of a&lt;br/&gt;critical gene network that regulates multiple traits of agronomic importance. Elucidation of these&lt;br/&gt;roles will provide avenues to modify such agriculturally relevant traits such as senescence, plant&lt;br/&gt;transformation, grain yield and filling, and patterns of growth and development. The plant&lt;br/&gt;research community will benefit by the optimization of novel research techniques and the&lt;br/&gt;development of new community resources. The proposed research will enhance the&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure of research and education by providing hands-on training for undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers within the PIs' labs. In addition, the&lt;br/&gt;PIs will partner will local groups to assist in the creation and maintenance of programs aimed at&lt;br/&gt;fostering science education in grades K-12.</AbstractNarration>
