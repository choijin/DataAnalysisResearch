    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Prof. Veronica Bierbaum of the University of Colorado at Boulder and her postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will study the reactions of gas-phase ion species. In their multi-pronged studies, they will look at a variety of classes of reactions as well as at interesting chemical species. Some of the chemical species to be studied include metal anions and biogenic molecules of interest to atmospheric chemists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from Prof. Bierbaum's laboratory will be of interest to scientists, interested in understanding the energetics and stability of particular molecules. This data will be used by theorists to check the accuracy of computer models. In addition, the fundamental studies of molecular reactivity provides useful data for technologists and scientists interested in developing methods for detecting molecules in the process environments or in the natural environment. Besides the broader technological impact of the proposed work, Prof Bierbaum brings the excitement of chemistry to a wide age-range of Americans -- through her work with primary and secondary school teachers. Prof. Bierbaum will also personally work towards broadening participation in science by continuing to recruit and mentor a diverse research group in her own laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
