<AbstractNarration>Organizations of all sizes have been purchasing an increasing number&lt;br/&gt;of single-function computing appliances, such as firewalls, mail&lt;br/&gt;filters, Web caches, etc. With the increasing power of commodity&lt;br/&gt;processors and hardware, these appliances are often server-class PCs&lt;br/&gt;with the operating system and software pre-configured to match the&lt;br/&gt;hardware. While this approach provides some initial simplicity, its&lt;br/&gt;long-term problems can include a proliferation of machines that&lt;br/&gt;require individual OS updates, are harder to upgrade, and that cannot&lt;br/&gt;benefit from server consolidation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates operating system support for&lt;br/&gt;appliance-style server development without complete hardware&lt;br/&gt;isolation.  Some of the mechanisms investigated involve&lt;br/&gt;hardware-assisted virtual machines, "soft" virtual machines using OS&lt;br/&gt;context support, fine-grained resource isolation and accounting, and&lt;br/&gt;more explicit resource management interfaces. Such OS support reduces&lt;br/&gt;the resource consumption footprints of each server, and provides&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms to share common infrastructure across previously isolated&lt;br/&gt;appliances. As a result, developers still retain the benefit of&lt;br/&gt;pre-tuned OS and server configurations, without incurring the&lt;br/&gt;maintenance overheads for the shared portions of the appliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will produce operating systems modifications to aid&lt;br/&gt;consolidating server appliances. We will modify servers to use these&lt;br/&gt;features, to demonstrate that they can reduce their resource&lt;br/&gt;consumption, become more predictable, and also become easier to&lt;br/&gt;program in the process. We will release the modified operating system&lt;br/&gt;and demonstrate it with suitable servers that previously would have&lt;br/&gt;been run on separate hardware platforms. As processors become faster,&lt;br/&gt;and the number of cores increases, this research will simplify&lt;br/&gt;computing infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
