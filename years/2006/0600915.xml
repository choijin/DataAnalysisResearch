<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this proposal is the strong relationship that exists between &lt;br/&gt;the questions of how the geometry of a domain can be recovered from the &lt;br/&gt;regularity of its harmonic measure, and free boundary regularity problems. &lt;br/&gt;Remarkably the analogies become more apparent when examined under a &lt;br/&gt;geometric measure theory magnifying glass. The core of this proposal &lt;br/&gt;addresses the question of describing in detail the singular set of the &lt;br/&gt;free boundary in problems which are similar to the optimal design question &lt;br/&gt;described below. The PI and N. Wickramasekera propose to use tools from &lt;br/&gt;geometric measure theory, which have been very successful in similar &lt;br/&gt;situations in geometric analysis. They have remarked that Weiss' new &lt;br/&gt;monotonicity formulas yield similar information to the one provided by the &lt;br/&gt;monotonicity formulas for energy minimizing harmonic maps and area &lt;br/&gt;minimizing surfaces. The proposed program follows the schemes which have &lt;br/&gt;lead to the successful resolution of these 2 major problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-phase free boundary regularity problems arise naturally in physics, &lt;br/&gt;chemistry and engineering. In optimal design and optimal control problems &lt;br/&gt;within the context of electrochemical machining with threshold current, &lt;br/&gt;the surface between the anode and the electrolytic solution plays the role &lt;br/&gt;of the free boundary. In the symmetric plane flow model of jets with two &lt;br/&gt;fluids the outer jet is surrounded by air, so the flow region has two free &lt;br/&gt;boundaries: the boundary of the outer fluid and the boundary between the &lt;br/&gt;two fluids. The central problem of characterizing the regularity of the &lt;br/&gt;free boundary has been studied by many authors. Over the last 3 years the &lt;br/&gt;PI and C. Kenig have studied the case in which one has information about &lt;br/&gt;the ratio of the speeds of the two fluids at the free boundary. This &lt;br/&gt;question had not been addressed before. They found a global criteria which &lt;br/&gt;guarantees the regularity of the free boundary. One the themes of this &lt;br/&gt;proposal is the study of several free boundary regularity problems using &lt;br/&gt;these new tools. The proposed research provides a different outlet for &lt;br/&gt;geometric measure theory (GMT), a field of Mathematics that has &lt;br/&gt;contributed greatly to the development of the calculus of variations and &lt;br/&gt;geometric analysis. The success of the project would provide a road map &lt;br/&gt;for a new generation interested in applying GMT techniques to more &lt;br/&gt;concrete problems. An important feature of the proposed work is that, &lt;br/&gt;while some results have already been obtained, there is great potential &lt;br/&gt;for expansion. In particular, we expect the active participation of &lt;br/&gt;graduate students and junior mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
