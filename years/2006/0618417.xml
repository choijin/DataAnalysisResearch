<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pomona College will acquire new EDS microanalysis and nanometer pattern generation&lt;br/&gt;systems to enhance the electron microscope facility at Pomona College. These&lt;br/&gt;subsystems will be added to the college's field emission scanning electron microscope.&lt;br/&gt;The EDS system consists of an X-ray detector, a pulse processor, and an analyzer used&lt;br/&gt;for identification of elemental composition and mapping of specific elements with&lt;br/&gt;submicron resolution. The nanometer pattern generation system will allow the design and&lt;br/&gt;creation of arbitrary patterns in polymers with features smaller than 50 nm with&lt;br/&gt;placement accuracy less than 5 nm. We will upgrade the stage controller and In-Lens&lt;br/&gt;secondary electron detector as well. The primary research projects will include&lt;br/&gt;nanostructure fabrication and characterization, combinatorial methods for materials&lt;br/&gt;research and performance optimization, and the exceptional fossil deposits from the&lt;br/&gt;period of the 'Cambrian Explosion'. In addition to this, faculty colleagues from across&lt;br/&gt;the Claremont Colleges Consortium have expressed interest in adding these specific&lt;br/&gt;capabilities for research programs in Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, and&lt;br/&gt;Physics. We anticipate that curricular modifications of laboratory courses in Chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;Geology, and Physics will result in approximately half of all undergraduates enrolled at&lt;br/&gt;Pomona College being exposed to this instrumentation. Additionally, each year several&lt;br/&gt;programs bring large numbers of under-represented minority K-12 students and teachers&lt;br/&gt;to Pomona College. We will use this facility in outreach programs to inspire these&lt;br/&gt;students to consider a future in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lay Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large numbers of our undergraduate students are already experiencing the wonders of&lt;br/&gt;electron microscopy. This facility allows students to study carbon nanotubes,&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures of thin films, chemical sensors, chemical reactions, and crystal and rock&lt;br/&gt;structures formed in a variety of geologic processes. The advantages of this technique&lt;br/&gt;over traditional microscopy are a substantial improvement in both magnification and&lt;br/&gt;depth of focus in the images. Electron microscopes have played a key role in both the&lt;br/&gt;advances in modern electronics, biology, materials science, and the development of&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology. While our current microscope allows us to look at samples, the EDS&lt;br/&gt;system will allow us to identify the chemical elements in these samples. In other words,&lt;br/&gt;not only will we be able to image the samples, but we will also know what they are made&lt;br/&gt;from. The nanometer pattern generation system converts the electron microscope from a&lt;br/&gt;tool for taking pictures to one that can draw tiny patterns that can be turned into&lt;br/&gt;electronics, sensors, motors, tunnels, optical switches and filters. In this mode an&lt;br/&gt;electron beam is focused to a fine point and scanned by a computer in two dimensions to&lt;br/&gt;write the patterns. The patterns are written in a special polymer resist film that can then&lt;br/&gt;be developed to show the final patterns. These patterns can be transferred from the&lt;br/&gt;polymers to other materials by etching, plating, stamping, and many other techniques.</AbstractNarration>
