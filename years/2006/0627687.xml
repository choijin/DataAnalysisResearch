    <AbstractNarration>Software vulnerabilities have been the biggest culprit behind cyber&lt;br/&gt;attacks in the past several years. A handful of vulnerabilities, such as&lt;br/&gt;buffer overflows, format string, SQL injection, command injection,&lt;br/&gt;cross-site scripting, and directory traversals, have come to dominate,&lt;br/&gt;accounting for about 70% of the CVE vulnerabilities reported in the last&lt;br/&gt;two years. Although that these vulnerabilities are well understood and&lt;br/&gt;documented, their number continues to escalate from one year to the next.&lt;br/&gt;New vulnerabilities continue to be discovered in recently released&lt;br/&gt;software, as well as established software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will develop novel techniques for defending applications from known&lt;br/&gt;as well as unknown attacks, and for immunizing applications from future&lt;br/&gt;attack instances. The proposed approach can thus protect the integrity as&lt;br/&gt;well as the availability of vulnerable applications. A central component&lt;br/&gt;of the proposed approach is an efficient fine-grained dynamic taint&lt;br/&gt;analysis that tracks the flow of untrusted information through a&lt;br/&gt;vulnerable program. Both specification-based and anomaly-based attack&lt;br/&gt;detection techniques can be made highly versatile and accurate by using&lt;br/&gt;fine-grained taint, and can stop the wide range of attacks mentioned&lt;br/&gt;above. Taint analysis will also form the basis of an immunization&lt;br/&gt;technique that is based on learning input filters that characterize&lt;br/&gt;attack-bearing inputs, and selectively discarding such inputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work can address multi-billion dollar losses experienced due&lt;br/&gt;to cyber attacks, since it can stop most types of exploits before they&lt;br/&gt;cause damage. To maximize impact, the techniques developed in the project&lt;br/&gt;will be implemented into open-source software prototypes.</AbstractNarration>
