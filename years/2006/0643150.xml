<AbstractNarration>This CAREER proposal is focused on the relations between various gauge theories and&lt;br/&gt;string theory, i.e. gauge/string duality. The PI will use insights coming from and inspired&lt;br/&gt;by string theory to address long-standing problems in gauge theories with the eventual goal&lt;br/&gt;to solve QCD.&lt;br/&gt;The project is devoted to exploring the rich structures of Yang-Mills perturbation theory,&lt;br/&gt;integrable structures found in the AdS/CFT context, and relations between them. The&lt;br/&gt;first part of the proposal involves the study of nonperturbative Yang-Mills and AdS5 string&lt;br/&gt;theory with the aim to make theoretical predictions for the experimentaly observed spectrum&lt;br/&gt;of strongly interacting particles. The second part of the proposal is concerned with the&lt;br/&gt;application of methods inspired by twistor string theory to the calculation of perturbative&lt;br/&gt;QCD scattering amplitudes. Improvement in this area of QCD is especially urgent since&lt;br/&gt;QCD processes will be the dominant physics at the Large Hadron Collider experiment which&lt;br/&gt;is coming online in the near future.&lt;br/&gt;The research will be integrated into outreach activities at Brown University, including&lt;br/&gt;participation in the Women in Science and Engineering Program and delivery of public&lt;br/&gt;lectures at local schools and science museums. The educational activities will consist of&lt;br/&gt;developing new classes and establishing group meetings with graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My project is in the area of high energy theory.  The last few years have seen a revolution in our understanding of the mathematical structure of perturbative gauge and gravity theories and in our ability to do computations both for theoretical and phenomenological purposes. Remarkable results range from new precision predictions in quantum chromodynamics which are very important for understanding LHC data to the discovery of new miraculous structures in supersymmetric Yang-Mills and supergravity.  My research deepened our understanding of gauge and gravity theories by exploring these recently discovered hidden structures, in particular integrability, insights from twistor string theory and theory of motives, and using these rich structures as much as possible to aid practical calculations. These hidden structures not only help us calculate and make predictions for experimentally relevant processes but also lead to deeper understanding of fundamental properties of field and gravity theories.  Education and outreach were important parts of my proposal. I worked with several undergraduate students, developed new undergraduate course in Brown and participated in the several outreach programs for high school students as well as organized and participated in several Women in Physics events. I also co-organized several conferences and workshops in my research field.       Last Modified: 08/03/2012       Submitted by: Anastasia Volovich]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
