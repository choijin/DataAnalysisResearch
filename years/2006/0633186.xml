<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project is incorporating scanning probe microscopy (SPM) experiments&lt;br/&gt;into chemistry laboratory courses at the University of Illinois at Springfield (UIS) and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE), and is assessing the impact of the newly developed educational materials on student learning. Twin high resolution dynamic AFM/STM instruments are being integrated into the chemistry curriculum at both schools, and all of the PIs involved meet periodically, exchange ideas and resources, and bring undergraduate students from both institutions together to share experiences. Approximately 1100 science and engineering students each year are being introduced to scanning probe microscopy techniques as a result of this project. This population also includes future pharmacists, veterinarians, dentists, and physicians, all members of our diverse workforce that need a fundamental understanding of science. Student learning objectives include: 1) excitement and enthusiasm for science, 2) awareness of applications of scientific thinking, 3) understanding of surface chemistry, and 4) improved quantitative reasoning, problem solving, analysis, and synthesis of concepts. To address these objectives, implemented experiments increase in sophistication as students progress through the curriculum, and consist of typical types of scanning probe microscopy including STM, AFM, lateral force AFM, and dynamic mode AFM.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:   The activities integrate scanning probe microscopy into chemistry courses&lt;br/&gt;through the use of laboratory experiments that engage students in active learning. Existing&lt;br/&gt;laboratory experiments from a variety of sources are being adapted and implemented, with an emphasis on real life applications of SPM applied to all levels of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The modular nature of these educational tools enables educators to replace outdated activities with new ones without needing to revise all aspects of the curriculum, a situation that provides a reliable means of institutionalizing the teaching of scanning probe microscopy concepts to a broad cross-section of students. PIs at both institutions are involving undergraduate students in the development and implementation of the activities.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The project fosters interactions among science and engineering undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty who are involved in developing the learning resources. Since the activities are reaching large numbers of students, they have the potential to improve scientific and technological understanding in over one third of the undergraduate student population at SIUE and UIS. The interdisciplinary nature of scanning probe microscopy activities makes them powerful tools to demonstrate the link between discovery and societal benefits. Students from underrepresented groups and non-traditional students are included in the proposed education activities, and the experiments resulting from this project will be nationally disseminated through the web-based Nanoscale Video Lab Manual and Nanoworld Cineplex of Movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
