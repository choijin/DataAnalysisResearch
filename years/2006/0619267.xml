<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-D), a non-Ph.D. granting institution, will acquire a new AFM to build a comprehensive research and teaching program at the interface of physical and biological sciences. The present instrument offers full range of scanning probe (SPM) techniques ideal for research areas ranging from material science to polymer characterization. The liquid imaging package included in the instrument expands its applicability to biological research and the optional MFM mode of imaging will facilitate its application in the research involving magnetic materials. This instrument will be used to support several interdisciplinary research programs including (1) in situ synthesis of metal nanoparticles on monolayer templates, (2) vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays on metal and semiconductor surfaces to develop a new sensitive and rapid DNA-detection method, (3) nanostructures generated from self-assembly of diblock copolymers to create DNA/protein nanoarrays, (4) single molecule-based activity of metal binding protein like Metallothioneins (MTs) or metallothionein-like (MT-L) proteins in yeast, (5) research on spintronics and (6) dilute magnetic semiconductor materials. Development of such a program will lead to unique opportunities for undergraduates to participate in multidisciplinary research areas of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology and also promote the participation of under-represented minorities in biological and physical sciences. As an outreach program, the proposed instrument will provide an opportunity to develop new science activities/workshops to introduce the interdisciplinary aspect of biology and nanotechnology to high-school students in the Detroit metropolitan area, and will also create opportunities for them to actively participate in summer research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lay Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology is the use of novel and unusual properties, phenomena, and processes that occur when size is reduced to 0.1 to 100 nanometer (one nanometer is one billionth of a meter), and the advent of nanotechnology brings together physics, chemistry, material and biological sciences. It has already brought and further promises to bring new devices that will revolutionize many areas of our technology. Nanobiotechnology is an emerging area of science which connects nanotechnology to biological systems. An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), which is considered as the "eye of nanotechnology", is an integral part of this interdisciplinary area of science owing to its unique capability of direct observation and understanding of nanometer scale molecular structures present in chemical and biological systems. The AFM in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-D) will attract prospective students intending to work in the interdisciplinary research areas involving physical and biological sciences like nanotechnology/nanobiotechnology. In addition, this instrument will have a major impact on our plan to develop a number of courses involving nanotechnology and will further expand the opportunity of undergraduate student participation in faculty research programs. The AFM will also be of great support to the current outreach program of the department with local community colleges and to improve the K-12 science education of Detroit metropolitan area.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
