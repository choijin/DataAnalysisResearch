<AbstractNarration>AST-0607597&lt;br/&gt;de Oliveira-Costa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two of the most promising probes of cosmology are polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and three-dimensional tomographic maps reconstructing the 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen at high redshifts in the early Universe.  These measurements have the potential to constrain the nature of dark matter, dark energy, the early Universe, and the end of the cosmic dark ages.  However, these constraints will only be as good as our understanding of Galactic foreground contamination.  This project is a comprehensive study of polarized and unpolarized Galactic emission from 50 MHz to 500 GHz, combining available data with simulations.  This will be useful both for foreground-cleaning current measurements and for optimizing the design of future experiments.  Publicly available products will include improved foreground-cleaned unpolarized and polarized CMB maps, with well-quantified residuals, realistic 21cm foreground data cubes, cleaning algorithms and software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as strengthening the foundation for a vast array of theoretical and phenomenological work, this research will not only train students, but also afford ample opportunities for public talks and other educational outreach.  The origin, evolution and fate of the Universe continue to captivate the imagination of the general public.</AbstractNarration>
