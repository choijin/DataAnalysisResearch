<AbstractNarration>This award supports institutional planning at the Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC), with a focus on assessing and prioritizing infrastructure improvement needs for seawater pumping and bay access in support of HMSC's research, education, and outreach functions. The current seawater pumping system is antiquated and requires a great deal of maintenance and repair. In addition, the dock supporting the seawater pumps is beginning to fail, and will need to be repaired within the next five years. Existing research docks adjacent to the seawater pumping system are limited in capability, failing in terms of construction and current piling support, and lack the ability to support diverse research, education, and outreach requirements of a modern marine laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center serves approximately 150,000 community members/13,000 K-12 students/20-25 graduate students in residence and a high number of undergraduate students through courses each year. The planning and eventual renovations will support these end users. The education and training programs are extensive and include a REU site program and a teacher training program that has attracted teachers from over 10 different countries and 8 different states. Through its education center and outreach programs HMSC reaches 150,000 visitors and 13,000 school children annually.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
