<AbstractNarration>Processes of interaction of low-energy electrons with molecules play important role in&lt;br/&gt;gaseous, plasma, liquid and condensed-matter environments. Increased interest to&lt;br/&gt;these processes is stimulated by recent studies of their role in the physics of the upper&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere and in biological environments. Placing molecules in laser fields creates&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for control and manipulation of electron-molecule collision processes.&lt;br/&gt;Electron-molecule interactions in different environments present interest not only due to&lt;br/&gt;their importance in applications, but also because they demonstrate interesting physics&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;The present project proposes to study electron-molecule collision processes in gas&lt;br/&gt;phase, on surfaces, in condensed matter environment and in the presence of strong&lt;br/&gt;laser fields.&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the proposal deals with dissociative electron attachment to polyatomic&lt;br/&gt;molecules with the account of interaction between two resonances or interaction&lt;br/&gt;between several vibrational modes. The role of vibrational Feshbach resonances due to&lt;br/&gt;weakly-bound dipole-supported states in these systems will be further investigated. The&lt;br/&gt;second class of processes which will be studied is dissociative electron attachment to&lt;br/&gt;physisorbed molecules and molecules embedded in bulk medium. The theory of these&lt;br/&gt;processes taking into account the electron interaction with the environment will be&lt;br/&gt;further developed. Finally, the effects of laser field in electron-molecule interaction will&lt;br/&gt;be studied. The main focus will be on the above-threshold ionization and particularly its&lt;br/&gt;resonant enhancement which was recently discovered in atom ionization.</AbstractNarration>
