<AbstractNarration>Past research has established that being married is associated with superior mental and physical health relative to not being married. At the same time, little is currently known about what processes underlie these associations. Moreover, existing research has not established whether all marriages are beneficial to individuals' well-being. This longitudinal study of marriages addresses these issues. The study involves tracking 214 individuals in 107 marriages from just prior to each marriage through the end of the seventh year of their marriages. Its central focus is on patterns of giving and receiving benefits in marriage along with the antecedents and consequences of different patterns. Patterns comprising mutual responsiveness to one another's needs on a non-contingent basis are predicted to be associated with greater marital satisfaction and felt security as well as with superior mental and physical health. Adherence to other norms, equity, exchange, and self-interest, even if perceived to be fair, are predicted to be associated with poorer adjustment. Data show that most people initially endorse a norm of mutual responsiveness to needs as both ideal and as realistic for their marriage. However, many people are not able to maintain or follow such a norm over time, turning instead to exchange or equity norms which tend to be associated with poorer martial adjustment, a lower sense of security, and possibly poorer mental and physical health. The study will investigate possible antecedents of falling away from a norm of mutual responsiveness, including personality variables that people bring with them to marriages, outside stressors (e.g., job loss, birth of a first child), and poor adherence to the norm by one's spouse. This research will contribute to a base of scientific knowledge on close interpersonal relationships, and will lead to greater understanding of why some marriages succeed and others do not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
