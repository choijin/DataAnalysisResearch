<AbstractNarration>Buche, DMS-060608669&lt;br/&gt;Ghosh, DMS-0608634&lt;br/&gt;Pipiras, DMS-0608663&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators study the heavy traffic analysis in&lt;br/&gt;wireless systems under novel phenomena of long-range dependence&lt;br/&gt;and heavy tails.  These phenomena are characteristic of current&lt;br/&gt;wireless systems driven by data-intensive applications such as&lt;br/&gt;multimedia, WWW, and real-time interactions.  The heavy traffic&lt;br/&gt;approach is a powerful way to analyze queuing systems at near&lt;br/&gt;capacity, yielding complex, yet tractable limit models that&lt;br/&gt;retain the essential features of the actual queuing system.  But&lt;br/&gt;most of the existing literature on heavy traffic analysis,&lt;br/&gt;including wireless systems, is based on short-range dependent&lt;br/&gt;(Markovian-like) models and light tails.  In the case of heavy&lt;br/&gt;tails only, the focus is on extending the perturbed test function&lt;br/&gt;method, based on the martingale problem, for showing weak&lt;br/&gt;convergence to a queuing model expected to be driven by stable&lt;br/&gt;Levy motion.  When long-range dependence characteristics are also&lt;br/&gt;present, the focus is on developing a powerful alternative&lt;br/&gt;approach based on the Poisson random measure representation of&lt;br/&gt;traffic processes.  In this case, weak convergence to a queuing&lt;br/&gt;model driven by fractional Brownian motion is expected.  The&lt;br/&gt;power control problem associated with wireless systems is studied&lt;br/&gt;along with the convergence analysis to the limit queue model. &lt;br/&gt;This is done for given controls, as stochastic control analysis&lt;br/&gt;for stable Levy motion or fractional Brownian motion is currently&lt;br/&gt;undeveloped. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The focus of the project is on analyzing wireless systems&lt;br/&gt;characterized by high capacity applications such as multimedia. &lt;br/&gt;Such systems are ever more relevant with an increasing number of&lt;br/&gt;wireless users (personal and military) and their demand for&lt;br/&gt;data-intensive applications.  For example, military applications&lt;br/&gt;include the use of video in battlefield settings for conferencing&lt;br/&gt;and providing information to troops.  Personal applications&lt;br/&gt;include movies, real-time interactions, and WWW data.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, extensions of a developed approach, the heavy traffic&lt;br/&gt;method, are used in the analysis.  This approach supposes that&lt;br/&gt;the wireless system is near its capacity, which is the case in&lt;br/&gt;practice where applications make high demands on a limited&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth.  This assumption allows obtaining good models that&lt;br/&gt;retain the essential features of the actual system while being&lt;br/&gt;tractable.  The models are useful for obtaining an understanding&lt;br/&gt;of system characteristics that is needed for the design of an&lt;br/&gt;efficient wireless network.  Furthermore, obtaining these models&lt;br/&gt;is an important first step toward developing stochastic control&lt;br/&gt;methods for these emerging applications to optimize resource&lt;br/&gt;allocations (for example, power) to the queues for transmissions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
