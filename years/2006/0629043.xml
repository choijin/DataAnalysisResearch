    <AbstractNarration>A Gordon Research Conference on the Plant and Fungal Cytoskeleton will be held August 20-25, 2006 in Andover, New Hampshire. The cytoskeleton provides cells with their structure and functional organization, being essential for membrane traffic, organelle placement and segregation as well as mitosis, cytokinesis and cell polarity determination. Many advances in understanding of cytoskeleton function have resulted from studies in plants and fungi. This conference is the primary bi-annual and indispensable meeting for researchers in the cytoskeleton of these systems, and is attended by all the major research groups in this field. While this conference has traditionally been restricted to cytoskeletal organizations in fungi and plants, the organizers have broadened the content to reflect the realization that the cytoskeleton is regulated by signal transduction pathways and organizes membrane traffic. Thus, the intellectual theme is how the cytoskeleton contributes to the functional organization of fungal and plant cells. The impact of the conference is that it brings together the full breadth of scientists, from the intellectual leaders to the newest researchers, often resulting in collaborative projects. Speakers have been selected to reflect the diversity in the field, and use of modern technologies, and the availability of genomic sequences and recent advances in light microscopy. Invited speakers, 40% of whom are female, are from the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and across the breadth of the United States. Whenever possible, junior level investigators were selected to make presentations. Much of the external funding obtained to support the conference will be used to defray expenses of students and postdoctoral scientists.</AbstractNarration>
