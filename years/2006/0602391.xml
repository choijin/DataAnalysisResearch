<AbstractNarration>0602391&lt;br/&gt;Chatterjee, Samir&lt;br/&gt;Claremont Graduate University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A STUDENT FORUM PROMOTING SCIENCE OF DESIGN ISSUES AT THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH IN INFORMATIONS SYSTEMS &amp; TECHNOLOGY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for supporting a group of students, and specifically female students, who are encouraged to pursue science of design issues within the information systems discipline. This student forum will take place in conjunction with the 1st International Conference on Design Science in Information Systems and Technology (DESRIST 2006) being organized by Claremont Graduate University. This conference would be held Feb 24-25, 2006 at CGU. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The objective of the conference is twofold. We will create a forum for discussing novel solutions to emerging problems by bringing together researchers from different backgrounds, ranging from computer science, information systems, and software engineering to social ethnography designers, economists, and policy makers interested in the design paradigm. In addition, we will use this opportunity to reach out to female students at different levels in their education (high school and university students) with an interest in CS/IS related careers. We are asking for NSF funding to support students presenting at the conference and to enable a session orienting female students to pursue careers in IT and design science.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The conference in general and the student forum fills a void in our community to address several critical issues in the design of software and IT artifacts. This event will: Assemble leading researchers, thinkers and practitioners from different disciplines to better understand the issues around science of design. The students will engage in discussions and get an opportunity to network with researchers who will shape the next generation of software design. Address newer and better ways to create IT artifacts including scope, methods, algorithms, frameworks, techniques, etc. We also welcome a focus on different emerging areas of science where such designed artifacts can contribute greatly, ranging from nanotechnology to intelligent personal health records.  Widely publish the findings from the conference, including papers, panels, keynotes, posters through proceedings, and a book to be subsequently published after the conference.&lt;br/&gt;Make it an international event to understand the influence of different cultures and perspectives towards science of design.  Encourage participation from women in science and engineering. Also encourage undergraduate students to participate in the discussions. Several innovative tracks and panels to excite this underrepresented population have been created.</AbstractNarration>
