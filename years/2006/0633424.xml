<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences  (61)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds upon a prior project that involves partnerships between high school students and scientists to characterize genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant used widely as a genetic model in research. Scientists provide wild-type and mutant seeds and experimental know-how, and students design experiments to examine the effects of biotic stressors (e.g., drought, salinity, etc.) on the plants, thereby helping to determine the missing gene's function(s). Findings are shared via an online Lab Notebook (www.prep.biotech.vt.edu). The current project extends this concept to undergraduate education.  It involves faculty from two-year (Richard Bland College) and four-year colleges (the University of California at Davis, and Virginia Technical College).   Students are designing experiments to examine interactions between wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis and herbivores, investigating the interplay among genes, biochemicals, organisms, and populations. The module is being piloted in general biology, plant biology, and behavioral ecology courses, and revised based on student feedback and learning assessments, including pre/post-tests, surveys, instructor interviews, and a Views on Scientific Inquiry instrument (Bell et al, 2003). The module is being retested and disseminated via professional conferences and publication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual merit of the project is that it engages students in interdisciplinary inquiry, and then has them contribute to a large-scale ongoing research project. Data is being collected and analyzed to test two educational research related hypotheses: (A) Undergraduate students can learn interdisciplinary science concepts and the process of inquiry by designing and conducting experiments within their coursework, not just through research lab internships, to generate novel and informative data as part of an ongoing research effort, and (B) These learning experiences better prepare students to reap the benefits of research internships. The students' scientific findings are providing insight into the genetic underpinnings of plant-herbivore interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The modules are serving as an integrated mechanism for faculty to mentor undergraduate students in learning interdisciplinary biology and doing research within regular courses. Students who don't have research lab internship opportunities are experiencing the excitement of discovery and developing a sense of the group process of science using materials that are easy to maintain and inexpensive to acquire. The project is also broadening the use of mutant Arabidopsis lines created through Project 2010 (NSF 04-502).  It is catalyzing formation of partnerships among Project 2010 grantees, undergraduate instructors, and their students. The involvement of Richard Bland College, whose students are mostly first-generation college-bound and 20% African-American, helps ensure that the module is applicable in diverse educational settings. In addition, this experience is enhancing transfer students' credibility and competitiveness for additional undergraduate and graduate level research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
