<AbstractNarration>Astronomy (11) The goal of this project is to develop and to study the effectiveness of research-based science educational (RBSE) curricula in astronomy for entry-level undergraduate courses. The goals of RBSE curricula are threefold: (1) to teach that science is a process of discovery, not just a body of knowledge, (2) to increase positive attitudes towards science, and towards pursuing STEM careers, by giving students an opportunity to do authentic research, and (3) to develop important skills such as critical thinking, teamwork and goal-driven work skills that are important in any career path. The ultimate goal is to help instructors at other institutions, in astronomy and in other fields, to implement the developed curriculum, and to develop their own RBSE curriculum, either based upon their own research or from data archives such as the National Virtual Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activity&lt;br/&gt;RBSE is a method of instruction that models the processes of scientific inquiry and exploration used by scientists to discover new knowledge. It is "research-based" in the sense that it integrates scientific research with education. It brings the excitement of discovery into the classroom by getting students to actually do science, not just learn about it from lectures and activities far removed from the actual research process. Students participate in an authentic research project by completing observations on a research-class telescope, analyzing the data and interpreting their results. They collect and interpret information in response to their guided personal exploring and work together as collaborators in a cooperative rather than competitive environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RBSE is a natural integration of research and education because it teaches science as it is done. It incorporates several "best practice" teaching strategies which model scientific reasoning. These include focusing on an in-depth project, engaging in out-of class activities, using computers as a tool for data display and analysis, using student logs and concept maps for assessment, and using the Internet. This project is determining the most effective way to implement RBSE curricula in undergraduate classrooms. It is also assessing the student gains from participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the activity&lt;br/&gt;For many students, an introductory astronomy course represents their last formal exposure to science. RBSE gives students an opportunity to experience the rewards of research early enough to pursue science as a career. Even if students do not pursue STEM degrees, RBSE develops critical-thinking and teamwork skills that are necessary in any career, and it helps a large number of students understand the scientific process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 5,100 students at the University of Alaska Anchorage, Kenai Peninsula College, and Indiana University are participating in the project . The curriculum is being developed to be "off the shelf," such that other undergraduate instructors may use it. Workshops for about thirty instructors per year are held at the national AAPT and AAS meetings to introduce the RBSE pedagogy and developed curriculum, and to develop a national network of educators participating in RBSE.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flexible teaching modes such as RBSE engage the broad range of diverse, culturally derived orientations to learning. They are effective in allowing women and minorities, groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science, to find their voice and develop confidence in their ability to do science.</AbstractNarration>
