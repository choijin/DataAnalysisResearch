<AbstractNarration>AST-0618158&lt;br/&gt;Sarajedini&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Light with the Gran Telescopio Canarias Conference&lt;br/&gt;Miami, Florida, June 28th to 30th, 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting joins participants from the United States with scientists from Spain and Mexico in the hope of forming new scientific collaborations in preparation for imminent observations with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC).  Parallel workshops to be held after the main GTC conference will emphasize the capabilities of the CanariCam and GOYA instruments, and are crucial to forming groups that can obtain GTC open-use time, and thus significantly increase US access.  These instruments are being created by teams with strong international and US membership.  The meeting has two associated public talks, and will highlight the international, Spanish, and Mexican aspects of the GTC project, which should attract attention amongst the large Hispanic population in and around Miami.</AbstractNarration>
