<AbstractNarration>The PIs' research program in stochastic analysis, as part of NSF's&lt;br/&gt;efforts in Analysis, Modeling, and Computation of Stochastic Systems,&lt;br/&gt;ranges widely in probability theory and its applications to physical&lt;br/&gt;systems. It focuses on models in continuous space and time, with turbulent&lt;br/&gt;or otherwise chaotic behavior, and makes heavy use of infinite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;random objects, especially stochastic partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;(SPDEs) which feature white-noise behavior in time and various irregular&lt;br/&gt;spatial behaviors, as well as non-white-noise-based objects which fail to&lt;br/&gt;have the martingale or the Markov properties (e.g. fractional Brownian&lt;br/&gt;noise). Specific topics to be covered, with corresponding physical&lt;br/&gt;applications, are divided in three categories: (i) problems based on SPDEs&lt;br/&gt;and their probabilistic representations, including Feynman-Kac approaches,&lt;br/&gt;ranging from very basic questions of existence and uniqueness for highly&lt;br/&gt;irregular coefficients, to quantitative questions on the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;behavior of linear multiplicative stochastic heat equations including the&lt;br/&gt;Anderson model and directed polymers measures in Gaussian environments, to&lt;br/&gt;questions of diffusive behavior around random Gibbsian&lt;br/&gt;impurities/obstacles; (ii) specific physically motivated SPDEs:&lt;br/&gt;magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) in a turbulent environment, based on a&lt;br/&gt;Feynman-Kac formulation and its connection to products of random matrices;&lt;br/&gt;a framework for self-organized criticality unifying microscopic and&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic time scales; (iii) extensions of the Russo-Vallois theory of&lt;br/&gt;stochastic integration to general Gaussian and even highly non-Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;processes, with SPDE applications to a genealogical framework for&lt;br/&gt;connecting fractional Brownian motion to Kolmogorov operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The PIs' purpose for studying these topics is to come to a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of complex random ("stochastic") phenomena that change&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously in space and time. While many typically think of chaotic&lt;br/&gt;phenomena as being devoid of the possibility of predictable behavior, the&lt;br/&gt;PIs choice of complex models is designed to illustrate how specific&lt;br/&gt;inputs, no matter how random, invariably cause outputs which, while they&lt;br/&gt;may look very random on a short time scale, do show extremely predictable&lt;br/&gt;behavior in other scales of space and time, with important physical&lt;br/&gt;consequences. For instance, the MHD model should be capable of exhibiting&lt;br/&gt;the so-called "fast dynamo" effect, by which a magnetic fluid with low&lt;br/&gt;viscosity (the earth's oceans, or its atmosphere, or the sun), when&lt;br/&gt;subjected to a uniformly random energy input, will exhibit a magnetic&lt;br/&gt;intensity which grows at a specific exponentially rate; this effect could&lt;br/&gt;have applications to non-mechanical locomotion. Also of note is the model&lt;br/&gt;for self-organized criticality, which can help understand two-time-phased&lt;br/&gt;systems, such as avalanches: rather than being considered as events which&lt;br/&gt;occurs instantaneously when a threshold is reached, the model will take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of a heat-transfer setting reacting to a random environment in a&lt;br/&gt;short time scale. Many of the project's other models are also based on the&lt;br/&gt;idea that a random environment can have predictable effects, such as&lt;br/&gt;non-diffusive behavior for polymers or particles around random impurities&lt;br/&gt;or force fields. As mathematicians, the PIs are motivated by the beauty of&lt;br/&gt;the continuous-time continuous-space probabilistic tools needed to study&lt;br/&gt;these physical models, and remain true to their commitment to bridging the&lt;br/&gt;gap between theory and applications. Graduate students working with the&lt;br/&gt;PIs will take part in this project's fundamental aspects, and in&lt;br/&gt;investigating quantitative issues via calculations or numerical computer&lt;br/&gt;work. The PIs will encourage students from underrepresented groups to join&lt;br/&gt;their research program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
