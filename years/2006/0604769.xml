    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0604769&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Dusa McDuff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic manifolds all look alike at small scales, which means&lt;br/&gt;that they have many symplectomorphisms, that is, structure&lt;br/&gt;preserving self-mappings. These form very interesting groups,&lt;br/&gt;which one can try to understand from a topological/algebraic&lt;br/&gt;viewpoint as well as a geometric viewpoint. McDuff has been&lt;br/&gt;studying their structure for several years, and proposes to&lt;br/&gt;continue this work. One project is to extend her analysis (in&lt;br/&gt;previous joint work with Abreu) of the symplectomorphism group&lt;br/&gt;for rational/ruled manifolds of dimension four to similar&lt;br/&gt;manifolds in higher dimension. Many new problems arise here&lt;br/&gt;because the manifold is no longer fibered by pseudoholomorphic&lt;br/&gt;curves. She proposes to study the internal structure of&lt;br/&gt;symplectic manifolds (such as spaces of embedded symplectic balls&lt;br/&gt;or Lagrangian tori), to see how this is reflected in the&lt;br/&gt;structure of the group of symplectomorphisms. She also proposes&lt;br/&gt;a joint project with Hofer, which would develop a theory of&lt;br/&gt;branched manifolds that could be used in an equivariant version&lt;br/&gt;of the new polyfold theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to understand our physical world it is important to&lt;br/&gt;develop a variety of ways of measuring objects in space. The&lt;br/&gt;most familiar is the measurement of distances and angles, which&lt;br/&gt;leads to the usual notions of geometry. This proposal concerns a&lt;br/&gt;different kind of geometry, called symplectic geometry, that is&lt;br/&gt;based on measurements of two-dimensional objects. As first&lt;br/&gt;discovered by Hamilton over 150 years ago, many spaces of&lt;br/&gt;interest to physicists have this kind of structure. For example,&lt;br/&gt;it underlies the equations of motion of energy-conserving systems&lt;br/&gt;such as the planetary system, since here each position coordinate&lt;br/&gt;is paired with a momentum coordinate to form a basic&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional object. Symplectic geometry also has much&lt;br/&gt;relevance to modern theories of physics such as string theory and&lt;br/&gt;mirror symmetry. In recent years there has been a very important&lt;br/&gt;exchange of ideas between mathematics and physics that is largely&lt;br/&gt;expressed in symplectic terms. Hence it is very important to&lt;br/&gt;further our understanding of the fundamentals of symplectic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. This project will develop our basic knowledge in this&lt;br/&gt;area, concentrating particularly on understanding the properties&lt;br/&gt;of the group of motions that preserve this geometry. It will&lt;br/&gt;exploit the new invariants coming from physics (such as quantum&lt;br/&gt;cohomology and symplectic field theory) in order to understand&lt;br/&gt;the topological structure of these groups. Besides its&lt;br/&gt;theoretical interest, the new symplectic geometry has led to the&lt;br/&gt;development of better methods for computing Hamiltonian motions&lt;br/&gt;such as the orbit of a satellite.</AbstractNarration>
