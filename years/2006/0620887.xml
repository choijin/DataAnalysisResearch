<AbstractNarration>Tradeoffs and Idealization in Biological and Chemical Modeling&lt;br/&gt;Scientific models almost always contain idealizations. This raises a number of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;philosophical questions: Is idealization inevitable regardless of the amount&lt;br/&gt;of data and computational power at our disposal? Does idealization have any nonpragmatic&lt;br/&gt;value or justification? Will idealization persist as science progresses?&lt;br/&gt;Much of the recent philosophical literature correctly suggest that idealization has&lt;br/&gt;epistemic value and is likely to persist as science progress. This has been defended&lt;br/&gt;in different ways, including by demonstrating how idealized models can identify core&lt;br/&gt;causal phenomena. However, one important defense of idealization has not yet played&lt;br/&gt;a central role in philosophical discussions: the existence of tradeoffs. Modelers have&lt;br/&gt;multiple theoretical desiderata including precision, generality, and accuracy. Some&lt;br/&gt;desiderata cannot be simultaneously maximized because they constrain and trade off&lt;br/&gt;against one another. This necessitates the construction of multiple idealized models&lt;br/&gt;for a given phenomenon.  Intellectual Merit:  &lt;br/&gt;Tradeoffs and Idealization in Biological and Chemical Modeling will defend the existence&lt;br/&gt;of tradeoffs among the desiderata of models and modeling and argue that these&lt;br/&gt;tradeoffs are part of the explanation and justification of idealization's ubiquity. The&lt;br/&gt;analysis will focus on classic models of predation, competition, and molecular structure,&lt;br/&gt;as these exemplify theoretical practice in evolutionary ecology and quantum chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;This project can be divided into three components. The first part consists of identifying&lt;br/&gt;and characterizing the most important desiderata for theoretical modeling. Examining&lt;br/&gt;universal desiderata of models as well as specific properties of ecological and&lt;br/&gt;chemical models, this stage of research will generate a set of definitions that are both&lt;br/&gt;analytically rigorous and consistent with scientific practice. In the second part, tradeoffs&lt;br/&gt;and other constraints among these desiderata will be identified. This will consist of&lt;br/&gt;showing, by both mathematical and empirical means, that increasing the magnitude of&lt;br/&gt;some desiderata will necessarily affect the magnitude of others. This analysis will yield&lt;br/&gt;a list of the most important tradeoffs. Finally, these analyses will be used to argue that&lt;br/&gt;the existence of tradeoffs is part of the explanation and justification for idealization.&lt;br/&gt;This project is primarily a contribution to the scientific and philosophical literature&lt;br/&gt;about modeling and idealization. Broader Impacts:  It will also have a very direct impact on the debate&lt;br/&gt;between biologist Richard Levins and his critics over the existence of tradeoffs. While&lt;br/&gt;Levins has long maintained that simultaneously maximizing all theoretical desiderata&lt;br/&gt;was impossible, his lack of formal arguments for this thesis have left his insights vulnerable&lt;br/&gt;to critical attack. This project will yield arguments to defend Levins' position.&lt;br/&gt;Another wider impact concerns scientific pedagogy. Ideas from this project will&lt;br/&gt;be reformulated for use in secondary and higher education with the primary goal of&lt;br/&gt;making citizens more informed consumers of science, especially in fields such as climate&lt;br/&gt;science where critics prey on public misunderstanding of modeling and idealization.&lt;br/&gt;A secondary goal is to improve advanced textbook discussions of the justification for&lt;br/&gt;modeling and theorizing.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the arguments of this project may be useful in adjudicating disputes between&lt;br/&gt;different groups of theorists. Some theorists believe that idealization should&lt;br/&gt;ultimately be eliminated from their models; others believe that idealized models will&lt;br/&gt;always be important in scientific inquiry, despite their inaccuracies. Rational resolution&lt;br/&gt;of these disputes might be aided by fully accounting of the rationals for idealization,&lt;br/&gt;including the existence of tradeoffs.</AbstractNarration>
