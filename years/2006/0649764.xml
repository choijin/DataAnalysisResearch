<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Exposure to environmental factors such as viral infection, diet, toxic chemicals and ionizing radiation correlates with altered epigenetic processes in a variety of organisms.  Although such factors are implicated in the stably inherited, but inappropriate, expression states of target loci, how such factors affect the regulation of epigenetic processes is poorly understood.  The objective of this project is to elucidate how an agent that blocks DNA replication influences the formation of epigenetically inherited structures using silent chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model.  Hydroxyurea, a chemotherapeutic agent and an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, was recently shown to prevent a late step in the initial formation of epigenetically regulated silent chromatin at HMR in S. cerevisiae, suggesting that hydroxyurea alters gene expression distal from the site of damage in cis on neighboring regions of the same chromosome.  The identification of the mechanism by which hydroxyurea blocks silent chromatin formation will impact our understanding of how conditions that disrupt the cell cycle adversely influence the creation of epigenetically inherited chromatin.  In this study, the extent to which events during the hydroxyurea-dependent arrest contribute to this inhibitory signal will be determined by monitoring silencing in mutants that duplicate these events.  The source of this inhibitory signal will be identified by mapping analysis and the extent to which hydroxyurea affects histone modifications at HMR will also be determined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To support the scientific education of those beginning their careers in science, both undergraduate and graduate students will help conduct this research as partial fulfillment of their degree requirements.  These trainees will have the opportunity to share their findings through presentations at departmental, university-wide and national meetings as well as through publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Within the nucleus of the cell, DNA that makes up genes in chromosomes is tightly organized by cellular proteins. Together, histones and DNA make a structure called chromatin.  In addition, many different kinds of proteins will interact with this packaged DNA and the kinds of protein complexes formed at any given site on the chromosome will determine whether genes are expressed (turned "on") or silenced (turned "off").  One way of inactivating gene expression called epigenetic gene regulation, or silencing, is accomplished both by chemical modification of histones and by blanketing large regions of the chromatin with a thick coat of proteins.  Silent chromatin is maintained throughout the entire life of the cell, and, when the cell divides, is inherited by the next generation of cells.  Thus, epigenetic gene regulation is a powerful process that has the capacity to prevent gene expression of a silenced gene in all future cell generations and necessitates that cells tightly control if, when and where silencing complexes will occur.  Epigenetic gene regulation plays critical roles in biology by ensuring stable patterns of gene expression during normal growth and differentiation. Improper formation of epigenetic processes results in the wrong genes being turned on or off and, thus, can lead to developmental defects and other catastrophic disorders.   Using silencing in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, this research has identified how defects in several proteins involved in responding to DNA damage, replicating DNA and packaging that DNA into chromatin influence silencing. This research is amongst the first to link proteins that chemically modify histones to DNA replication in S. cerevisiae.  Significantly, this research explains how defects in replication proteins can perturb epigenetic processes by causing incorrect chemical modification patterns on histones across the chromosomes and how this, in turn, affects how and where structural proteins that are part of silent chromatin interact with the chromosome.  Several proteins that add or remove modifications are important for both repairing DNA damage and regulating silencing. These proteins serve as potential targets for environmental factors that adversely affect epigenetic processes or DNA damage responses in multiple organisms.  This NSF support provided an opportunity for 13 undergraduate students (ten female, four minority students) to gain "one-on-one" training and "hands on" research experience as well as advanced training for three graduate students in designing, conducting and overseeing scientific research.
