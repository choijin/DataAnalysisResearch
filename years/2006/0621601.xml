<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0621601&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Indonesian Throughflow is the low latitude conduit by which warm and fresh Pacific waters enter the Indian Ocean. The Throughflow is a highly significant component of the global ocean circulation and variability in this flow has been linked to the evolution of oceanic and coupled climate anomalies in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. While there has been much historical and ongoing studies and fieldwork devoted to the Throughflow, there has been little attention paid to the wind-driven Ekman contribution to the net transport.  Scaling arguments suggest that this wind-driven flow may contribute as much as 30% of the total transport in some regions during the southeast monsoon seasons. In this study, a scientist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography will work with an Indonesian meteorologist to determine a best estimate of the Ekman component of the mass, temperature and freshwater fluxes of the Throughflow. This will be one of the first comprehensive studies of the wind-driven surface transport in the region around Indonesia and will contribute to our overall knowledge of the region's circulation which will directly influence our understanding of our climate system.  As such, it has important societal implications. In addition, the wind-driven circulation affects upwelling and downwelling which influence nutrient fluxes and biological productivity in the area and thus has a direct impact on important fisheries. This has important economic implications for the developing nation of Indonesia. The study also includes a research collaboration with an Indonesian scientist which should strengthen scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
