    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research program continues exciting new activities we have developed during the last year of our previous grant period. The activities are of an experimental nature and consist of precision measurements of the intrinsic properties of the neutron, such as the search for its electric dipole moment (EDM), the correlation coefficients from the neutron -decay spectrum and the determination of the strength of the hadronic weak interaction. These measurements are part of a program in fundamental neutron science at the newly completed Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will train young scientists at the postdoctoral level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate students, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state university as a premier research institution. The advancement of the careers of women and ethnic minorities is an integral part of this process. Furthermore, the demand for state-of-the-art equipment utilizes the ASU's technical workforce and that of the society at large.</AbstractNarration>
