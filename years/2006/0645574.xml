<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will delineate structure-property relationships in stimuli-responsive polymer films through the following: 1) Seeking photo-cross-linkable copolymers that incorporate lower critical solution temperature (LCST) motifs and that enable the fast and simple fabrication of surface-attached networks; 2) Probing permutations of hydrophobic/hydrophilic groups in LCST motifs to draw vital connections between response characteristics and molecular interactions; 3) Exploiting the Hofmeister salt series to identify the mechanisms of volume-phase transitions; and 4) Designing amino acid sequences into the polymer films to facilitate control over volume-phase transitions. The PI's work, for the first time, will systematically explore relationships in confined LCST polymers to develop a predictive framework for the design of active surfaces. Second, this research will provide critical tests of LCST theory and will contribute new, novel insights into the molecular design of responsive motifs for controlled response logic. Knowledge gained during this effort will be immediately used to address important pipeline issues for enhancing students' interest in science and engineering through outreach to local high schools. Finally, the research will positively impact undergraduate education through its incorporation into a new undergraduate course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LCST polymers are a class of soft materials that can endow sensing and actuation capabilities to surfaces. This proposed effort will forge a blueprint for designing active surfaces that respond to an environmental stimulus in a predictable manner.  The outcomes promise a number of advances from inexpensive sensors to sample processing in microfluidic platforms to materials capable of digital computation. The research is connected to outreach programs at local high schools that will enhance and diversify curriculums in chemistry, and provide a mechanism for the research contained herein to reach a young and impressionable audience. Moreover, this research is carried out in collaboration with national laboratories that enable interdisciplinary relationships for the graduate students and enhanced opportunities after their doctoral work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed CAREER established a long-term program to design, construct, and study "intelligent" cross-linked polymer films. The research outcomes provided the groundwork to rationally design active surfaces with controlled response logic, and it enabled students with both the critical thinking skills and tools to become leaders in materials and interface engineering.   The experimental hypothesis was that the nature of the volume-phase transition depends both on the chemical constituency of the polymer and structural topology. Before this point, there were no studies heretofore that solidified this concept. To address this need, carefully designed polymer networks as model systems were constructed to probe relationships between intramolecular interactions, surface confinement and volume-phase behavior. This approach allowed us to delineate the fundamental relations that can be used as a predictor for structure-property relationships in surface-attached networks.   An equally important aspect included efforts to address education and outreach to undergraduates and high school students. Listed below are the research, education, and outreach objectives stated in the proposal  The research goals that we accomplished were the following:   (A) Synthesis of a series of photo-cross-linkable, responsive polymers to explore mechanisms of response logic, based on the following monomers: N-isopropylacrylamide, n-propylacrylamide, cyclo-propylacrylamide, and N-vinylisobutyramide. The monomer methacroyloxybenzophenone will be co-polymerized with each of these monomers to create a series of photo-cross-linkable polymers.    (B) Synthesis of a series of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N-(3-amino-propyl)methacrylamide) as a platform by which to add peptides via a modified solid phase synthesis technique.     (C) Experimental mapping of volume-transition behavior of the polymers in goals (1) and (2) using ellipsometry, neutron reflection, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to correlate molecular interphase behavior development of a blueprint for the rational design of active surfaces.  2. Education goals:  (A) The development of a course "Surface Science and Materials: Foundations and Frontiers." to address challenges graduates are expected to face in careers of the 21st century. A unique course will be offered hat translates research knowledge gained in my CAREER effort into a classroom environment. This class will be offered to upper level undergraduates and graduate students  (B) Research opportunities for undergraduates.   3. Outreach goals:  (A) Research opportunities for high school students, high school teachers and curriculum enhancement for high school chemistry in the state of Florida. I am currently working with two local high schools to provide students and teachers with research experience and to design laboratory experiments that can be transferred to high school chemistry classes.  (B) A diverse research group.  The key outcome of the research was to experimentally identify, for the first time, a molecular basis for the differences in an LCST polymer that experiences a first order volume phase transition and an LCST polymer that experiences a discontinuous phase transition.  We, for the first time, have shown that acrylamide-based LCST (Lower critical solution temperature) polymers with amide type structures can either have a zero or off-zero critical point in their cloud point curve. The reason for this difference stems from whether there is a concentration-dependent hydrogen-bonding environment around the amide group, is there a shift from one of type of hydrogen bonded structure to another hydrogen bonded structure with a change in polymer concentration. This distinction is important, for polymers that display this shift can undergo a strong, discontinuous transition, whereas those that do not have this shift can only undergo a continuous transition. Thus far, in our results, cross-linking (or degree of confinement) ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
