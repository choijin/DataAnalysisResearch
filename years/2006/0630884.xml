<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The College is establishing a scholarship program for academically talented, financially disadvantaged students in the Natural Sciences division. The project awards twenty scholarships per year for four years to students who have declared a major in biology, chemistry, physics, or environmental science technology. The objectives of the project are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Increase the participation of academically talented, financially disadvantaged students -- including those from underrepresented groups -- in postsecondary studies in natural sciences;&lt;br/&gt; 2) Provide support services that will enable scholars to persist through completion of an associate degree or transfer to a four-year institution;&lt;br/&gt; 3) Provide industry experiences to prepare scholars for careers in science-related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students receive substantial scholarships that allow them to reduce their loan package or work hours to pursue a full course load and a rigorous curriculum. The scholars are provided with a variety of support services and enrichment activities to increase academic success and build a cohort community. These include a science resource center, residence hall learning community, industry experiences, and opportunities to participate in research projects. Assistance with transfer to a four-year institution is emphasized since many science majors are pre-baccalaureate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Each scholar is assigned a faculty advisor/mentor who develops an individualized success plan with the student. The plan includes academic support and enrichment activities to meet the student's needs and increase the likelihood of his/her success. Modifications to the plan may be made as the student's progress is monitored. Scholars have the opportunity to participate in research projects at BCTC or the nearby University of Kentucky. The Nucleus Center, a science resource center, is a specialized resource for science students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The scholarship amounts are significantly higher than other scholarships offered at BCTC -- and have higher expectations of students. Recent studies have indicated that retention and graduation rates of low-income students are higher when they are enrolled full-time and work fewer hours. This project hopes to sustain these findings and further support the critical need for higher levels of financial aid. The inclusion of a residence hall learning community and "baccalaureate bridge" scholarships can show that the availability of these resources to community college students can impact their transfer rates. The role of community colleges as a pipeline for financially disadvantaged and students from underrepresented groups into science careers will be supported through higher retention and transfer rates achieved by this project.</AbstractNarration>
