<AbstractNarration>Phillips&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0630496&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleagues organize a conference&lt;br/&gt;with the Society for Natural Philosophy on the topic,&lt;br/&gt;"Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Materials."  The&lt;br/&gt;conference The conference program consists of four elements: the&lt;br/&gt;Truesdell lecture (a distinguished named lecture instituted by&lt;br/&gt;the Society), six lectures by senior researchers, three lectures&lt;br/&gt;given by recent Ph.D.s, and an open forum on future directions. &lt;br/&gt;The conference is widely advertised, specifically seeking&lt;br/&gt;graduate student attendance.  Participation of graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and young investigators is especially encouraged by devoting a&lt;br/&gt;large component of the budget to supporting their travel&lt;br/&gt;expenses.  The conference themes address mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;physical aspects of the interaction between thermal, electric,&lt;br/&gt;and mechanical properties in novel crystalline and soft matter&lt;br/&gt;systems.  The systems addressed include ferroelectric liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals and polycrystals, and elastomers.  Applications include&lt;br/&gt;electro-optical switches for video displays, actuators, sensors&lt;br/&gt;and miniature pumps designed to exploit electro-mechanical&lt;br/&gt;interactions.  These are important state-of-the-art applications&lt;br/&gt;that present significant mathematical challenges in their&lt;br/&gt;analyses.  The speakers are mathematicians and physicists who&lt;br/&gt;present their research on analysis, modeling, and simulations for&lt;br/&gt;these systems.  Several common themes are highlighted.  The&lt;br/&gt;natural setting for these systems is in the form of films,&lt;br/&gt;filaments, and thin strips.  One theme is the application of&lt;br/&gt;gamma-convergence and compactness techniques to capture&lt;br/&gt;lower-dimensional models.  These systems all have complex energy&lt;br/&gt;landscapes with many meta-stable states.  A second major theme is&lt;br/&gt;deterministic and stochastic investigations of dielectric and&lt;br/&gt;ferroelectric switching between such states.  A third theme is&lt;br/&gt;the investigation of flows in these materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Society for Natural Philosophy Conferences have a&lt;br/&gt;history of being cross-disciplinary endeavors and that spirit is&lt;br/&gt;central to this meeting.  The conference is advertised to the&lt;br/&gt;science community and the list of speakers includes physicists&lt;br/&gt;and engineers.  A goal of the conference is to expose students&lt;br/&gt;and young researchers to the challenges and open problems in this&lt;br/&gt;area.  This is accomplished by supporting the travel expenses for&lt;br/&gt;these people, having young researchers as speakers, and by&lt;br/&gt;holding a session on future directions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
