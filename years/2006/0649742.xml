<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Globalizing the perspectives and experiences of scientists and researchers early in their careers is critically important for their development as global leaders.  This program enables ten early career scientists (graduate and post-doctoral students, and young faculty) to attend the 10th European Ceramic Society (ECerS) in Berlin, Germany.  There they will present a scientific a paper to a predominately European audience. In addition they will learn of international opportunities for research collaboration (Humboldt Foundation), cutting edge research at the leading German institutes, and tour German companies.  They will also participate in organized social events with a European peer group during a tour of Dresden, Germany.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  The European Ceramic Society (ECerS) Conference provides an excellent forum for researchers, engineers and technologists from around the world to meet and discuss advanced ceramics.  This meeting complements the two other major meetings specializing in advanced ceramics: the American Ceramic Society annual meeting and the Pacific Rim, which is held every three years.  The ECerS meeting plans sessions on cutting edge research in materials modeling, nanoceramics, electronic ceramics, transparent ceramics, and biological applications of ceramics.  Cutting edge research will also be presented during visits to the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems (IKTS) in Dresden and the Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam.  Fellows will also be given the opportunity to stay an additional two weeks for research and study.  Participants will receive first hand experience about research approaches, facilities and perspectives that U.S. students are not normally exposed to during the course of their graduate education.  By introducing the attendees to such opportunities early stage in their scientific career, this project seeks to stimulate scientists to actively engage in the worldwide scientific network and encourage their life-long interactions and collaborations in the global materials community.  Interested participants should contact Gary Messing via e-mail before Jan. 12, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
