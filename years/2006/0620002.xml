<AbstractNarration>Project Summary &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is to argue for a new solution to the measurement&lt;br/&gt;problem (MP): a solution under the idealization of macroscopic limit (ML). MP is one of the main&lt;br/&gt;problems, if not the problem, at the foundations of physics. Because this is the last, and the most&lt;br/&gt;important, part of my multi-stage effort that in the past six or so years has produced works on the&lt;br/&gt;nature of idealization and approximation, of model-building, of thermodynamic limit, of phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions and critical phenomena, of laws of nature, and of classical and quantum spontaneous&lt;br/&gt;symmetry breaking (SSB), some of which are supported by a previous NSF grant (No. SES-&lt;br/&gt;9910889), its results, apart from their own merit, will validate and improve on results in those areas.&lt;br/&gt;This final project may be seen as a test and showcase of my previous contributions to philosophy of&lt;br/&gt;science. The difficulty of MP centers on an apparent contradiction between what theories&lt;br/&gt;hypothesize happens at the micro-level and what happens at the macro-level. All existing attempts to&lt;br/&gt;solve the problem make what seems to be an inescapable assumption that all systems involved are of&lt;br/&gt;finite number of degrees of freedom (or finite). But finite quantum systems harbor ineliminatable&lt;br/&gt;superpositional effects, just as all finite thermo-systems harbor fluctuations; and such effects seem to&lt;br/&gt;make a rigorous solution of MP impossible. I propose that we drop the assumption. There is a&lt;br/&gt;sound and rigorous mathematical way (the algebraic approach) to imagine, with properly taken limits,&lt;br/&gt;that the systems involved are of infinite number of degrees of freedom (or infinite). Moreover, SSB&lt;br/&gt;is only possible under ML, and it can be used to replace the notion of the 'collapse' of wave functions&lt;br/&gt;in the orthodox formulation. The broader impacts of this project are many-fold. Given its nature,&lt;br/&gt;this project will mainly produce research papers (and possibly a monograph) and lectures or talks to&lt;br/&gt;audiences of both experts and general public interested in philosophy and physics. Because the&lt;br/&gt;project tackles MP, the arguably single most important problems in the foundations of physics, the&lt;br/&gt;reverberation of its results is far-reaching. Historians of quantum physics and of the revolution of&lt;br/&gt;modern physics will find the spirit of the proposed solution closer to the views of the founders of&lt;br/&gt;quantum physics (Bohr et al and the Copenhagen school). Researchers interested in the symbiotic&lt;br/&gt;relationships between disciplines of science will find it interesting to see how a recalcitrant orthodox&lt;br/&gt;position in quantum physics -- the Hilbert-space approach -- is unseated (if I am right) by results in&lt;br/&gt;solid state physics; or how the 'foundation' of quantum physics is shaken by models in solid state (a&lt;br/&gt;much less fundamental and hence neglected area in foundational studies). A solution to MP that&lt;br/&gt;challenges the prevailing bias in the conception of quantum physics should open the door for new&lt;br/&gt;possibilities in the field, which should get the attention of theoretical physicists and mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;Every effort will be made to incorporate the results into my teaching, to give talks at the community&lt;br/&gt;college at Jacksonville and at nearby universities of north and central Florida, as well as at&lt;br/&gt;professional meetings and colloquia here and abroad.</AbstractNarration>
