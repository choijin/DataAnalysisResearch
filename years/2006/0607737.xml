<AbstractNarration>AWARD NO: AST-0607737&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael Skrutskie&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Virginia Main Campus&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Infrared Detection and Spectroscopy of Embedded&lt;br/&gt;Supernovae in Actively Star Forming Galaxies&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Massive stars are the likely energy sources powering starburst and interacting galaxies&lt;br/&gt;which therefore should be hosts to frequent supernova events. Yet, contrary to&lt;br/&gt;expectations, surveys for supernovae among such galaxies have established rates which&lt;br/&gt;are comparable to supernovae rates observed in more normal and/or isolated galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;However, the bulk of these surveys are also conducted at visible wavelengths where&lt;br/&gt;obscuration by dust associated with star formation and competition from nuclear flux&lt;br/&gt;may result in observers "missing" supernovae. Here a supernova search program will be&lt;br/&gt;implemented in the near infrared (Ks-band, 2.17 m) where the extinction by dust will be&lt;br/&gt;significantly reduced and the supernovae themselves will be brighter. The survey will be&lt;br/&gt;carried out at the University of Virginia's Fan Mountain Observatory using the 31-inch&lt;br/&gt;telescope and HAWAII-1 infrared camera (developed through an NSF Major Research&lt;br/&gt;Instrumentation grant). Fifty program galaxies, 30 with infrared luminosities in excess of 2&lt;br/&gt;x 1010LSun and within 32 Mpc, and 20 of the nearest galaxies more luminous than 1 x&lt;br/&gt;1010LSun, will be targeted and observed monthly for supernovae. Detected supernovae&lt;br/&gt;will be fed to the PAIRITEL automated 1.3-meter telescope at Mt. Hopkins, AZ for&lt;br/&gt;simultaneous J-, H-, and Ks-band imaging to determine light curves. Brighter supernovae&lt;br/&gt;will also trigger target-of-opportunity spectroscopic observations with the TripleSpec&lt;br/&gt;near-infrared spectrograph at the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope. The&lt;br/&gt;infrared spectra and light curves will allow the classification of the supernovae as a&lt;br/&gt;function of environment, which will in turn allow the progenitor populations to be&lt;br/&gt;characterized. The overall goals are a better estimate of the local supernovae rate and&lt;br/&gt;more extensive observations of spectroscopic signatures diagnostic of envelope structure&lt;br/&gt;and interaction with the surrounding medium.&lt;br/&gt;This work will support the training of a graduate student who will be responsible for the&lt;br/&gt;post-commissioning science program with TripleSpec using data from the imaging&lt;br/&gt;survey which the student will also lead. This student will be deeply integrated into the&lt;br/&gt;final assembly and testing of TripleSpec and its commissioning at the telescope.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates from the University of Virginia will take part in the acquisition of data at&lt;br/&gt;the Fan Mountain Observatory with hope of cultivating new instrumentalists in addition&lt;br/&gt;to astronomical observers.</AbstractNarration>
