<AbstractNarration>String theory has emerged as a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, i.e., a&lt;br/&gt;theory that encompasses both quantum mechanics and Einstein?s theory of general&lt;br/&gt;relativity. A remaining challenge is the identification of the appropriate set of background&lt;br/&gt;conditions relevant to the formation of our universe, i.e., compactifying the ten&lt;br/&gt;dimensional string theory (or eleven-dimensional M theory/supergravity) can lead to a very large number of (non-)supersymmetric four dimensional vacua. The projects outlined in this proposal address two important aspects of string compactifications. On one hand, the PI will study how in the context of flux&lt;br/&gt;compactifications one can find vacua which exhibit Standard Model like spectra. He will&lt;br/&gt;also use constraints from cosmology, such as the cosmic microwave background, to put&lt;br/&gt;restrictions on the inflationary type potentials obtained from string theory. The second&lt;br/&gt;approach will be made in studying black hole physics in terms of four- and&lt;br/&gt;five-dimensional BPS solutions. This will provide important&lt;br/&gt;information in trying to understand the black hole information puzzle. This proposal is&lt;br/&gt;very timely since, during the course of the next few years, the Large Hadron Collider&lt;br/&gt;(LHC) at CERN will start running, which will provide interesting information of what&lt;br/&gt;occurs beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, more accurate observations of the&lt;br/&gt;cosmic microwave background using the PLANCK satellite, will provide even tighter&lt;br/&gt;constraints on the possible&lt;br/&gt;inflationary scenarios arising in string theory.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project outlined in this proposal is two-fold: (1) facilitate the continuation&lt;br/&gt;and expansion of a research program in theoretical particle physics, with emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;string theory, at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), and (2) develop a strong&lt;br/&gt;outreach program taking the frontiers of particle physics into local high schools, that&lt;br/&gt;nurtures the excitement young people have for science in general, while promoting&lt;br/&gt;physics in particular. Results from the proposed work will be of interest to several&lt;br/&gt;sectors of the mathematics and physics community. Thus, this project will foster&lt;br/&gt;collaborations and&lt;br/&gt;intellectual exchange between UNH physicists and mathematicians and those from&lt;br/&gt;neighboring, as well as national and international, institutions. The program will&lt;br/&gt;capitalize on the existing infrastructure at the University of New Hampshire for&lt;br/&gt;interactions with high schools and bring cutting-edge science into local high schools.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PI will work with the NSF supported Partnerships for Research&lt;br/&gt;Opportunities to Benefit Education (PROBE)program to organize workshops at UNH for&lt;br/&gt;high school teachers, visit local high schools in order for both teachers and students to&lt;br/&gt;be able to answer questions, and allow interested high school students to visit UNH to&lt;br/&gt;learn about research in theoretical particle physics. The PI&lt;br/&gt;will also participate in a summer program for high school students at UNH, Project&lt;br/&gt;SMART,(Science and Mathematics Achievement through Research Training) and&lt;br/&gt;develop enrichment lectures and activities in Particle Physics and Cosmology for these&lt;br/&gt;high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
