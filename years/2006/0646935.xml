    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research program will advance the monitoring of copper plating baths, responding to the stated need to design, develop and prototype innovative sensors and systems for testing and characterization in both industrial and laboratory settings, for specific use as a process control device. This technology couples the theories of microfluidics and alternating current voltammetry for a powerful monitoring tool. The anticipated result of this research project is a marketable, commercially viable sensor with the capability to accurately and precisely measure concentrations of all components of the copper plating bath. In addition, application of the proposed method is anticipated to significantly reduce the waste generated by semiconductor and printed circuit board industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses the needs of the printed circuit board and semiconductor industries, which are important aspects of the US commercial economy and will play an increasing role in the US as well as world society. In addition to providing tight process control and therefore a better quality product, the proposed sensor is anticipated to be more environmentally friendly than current technologies due to the decrease in sample size and analysis time requirements, resulting in lower chemical and power consumption, an objective of the 2005 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.</AbstractNarration>
