<AbstractNarration>Evolution in Nature has yielded a vast array of biological materials that are involved in critical functions of life.  Bone, providing structure to our body, or spider silk, used for prey procurement, are examples of fascinating materials that have incredible elasticity and strength, mainly attributed to its structural formation that requires molecular precision. To date, scientists are still unable to create a number of these materials with similar properties as by Nature, primarily due to the lack of understanding of how particular arrangements of atoms and molecules give rise to their unique material properties.  This research program focuses on elucidating how building blocks at the nanoscale define material properties at the macroscale.  This will be achieved through utilizing large-scale atomistic modeling and bridging scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry and mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining knowledge from nanotechnology and biological sciences will enable the development of new materials, designed with molecular precision, that contribute towards efforts to understand, and with hope, to cure diseases that currently ail our society. The program provides support for undergraduate and graduate students, and funds development of novel educational concepts to teach students atomistic-based simulation techniques through internet resources.  This makes such advanced modeling methods available to a larger community of students and scientists, in particular those currently underrepresented in the academics.  The program offers outreach activities to high schools and to the general public in order to increase interest in careers in science.  Fostering the role of advanced computing in engineering plays an important role to ensure America's leadership in the forefront of technological and scientific research.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
