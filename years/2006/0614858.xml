<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested for partial support of the 65th Annual Meeting of the Society for Developmental Biology, to be held June 17-21, 2006, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. The Society has organized the major worldwide meeting in developmental biology for the past 67 years, missing only two during World War II. The meeting size has more than tripled over the last dozen years (from less than 300 in 1993 to just under 1,000 in 2005) and abstract submissions have done just as well (from less than 200 to almost 800).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be presenting their latest data, many yet to be published, contributing to advancement of knowledge in the field. As it has become a successful tradition, the scientific sessions in platform and poster formats encompass work on diverse organisms including plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. All the invited speakers listed in the preliminary program have accepted the invitation to tell us about some of their most exciting findings in the following areas:&lt;br/&gt;- Plenary Sessions: Genomics and Gene Networks, Evolution of Development, Pattern Formation in Development.&lt;br/&gt;- Concurrent Sessions: Development and Senescence, Novel Genetic Mechanisms in Development, Stem Cells in Animals and Plants, Cell-cell Signaling, Pathfinding and Beyond Model Organisms.&lt;br/&gt;About 24 additional speakers will be chosen from submitted abstracts for short talks in the concurrent sessions, allowing the inclusion of the latest results and providing an opportunity for junior investigators to address a large audience, as priority will be given to them. A Postdoctoral Symposium will take place for the first time at this meeting. It is run by postdoctoral fellows, and the invited speakers will be postdocs. Short talks will be selected from submitted abstracts and winners of postdoctoral presentations at the 2006 SDB regional meetings held before June.&lt;br/&gt;Another "first" at this meeting is a Boot Camp for New Faculty to be held on June 16, and 17. Members of the Professional Development and Education Committee organized this new event which will include sessions on Hands-on lab with model organisms, Course design, Mentoring and Lab management. SDB members who are new faculty (up to 5-years in the job) are invited to apply for a seat in this camp. Cool Career Choices in Life Sciences and Grant Writing Workshop complete the educational sessions, a serious commitment of the Society to training of future developmental biologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;Besides dissemination of new scientific findings in the field, meeting participants will have ample&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to discuss issues related to careers, grants and funding, and the various aspects of teaching developmental biology during the education sessions and the boot camp for new faculty. The new, dedicated postdoctoral symposium will offer a chance for these almost-independent young investigators to organize their own sessions, including review of abstracts and selection of the most appropriate ones for short talks - a glimpse into the peer review process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attendance is expected to be about 800 people and most of them will present their new data&lt;br/&gt;in the dedicated poster sessions each day. These social hours around the posters will provide a forum to bring together junior and senior investigators and to allow them to exchange ideas on science, education and the role of science in today's society. The common meals taken on campus will extend the discussion and networking opportunities for the participants. Travel awards will be available to bring underrepresented minorities, students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions, and Latin American faculty and students to attend the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
