<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators will further develop and use their recent  &lt;br/&gt;results in orbifold cohomology, orbifold K-theory and the orbifold Chern&lt;br/&gt;character. They will expand their work on the obstruction bundle to  &lt;br/&gt;include orbifold Gromov-Witten theory which will have implications not only for&lt;br/&gt;calculations, but also important theoretical significance. Secondly,  &lt;br/&gt;they will generalize their constructions of stringy and orbifold K-theory and&lt;br/&gt;cohomology from the case of a finite group to the case of a non-Abelian,&lt;br/&gt;infinite group with possibly infinite stabilizers. Third, they will  &lt;br/&gt;study invariants arising from their stringy and orbifold Chern characters.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, they will investigate the Chern classes and similar  &lt;br/&gt;structures in the stringy and orbifold settings.  Finally, they will examine the  &lt;br/&gt;relation of these invariants to their counterparts on various hyper-Kaehler and&lt;br/&gt;crepant resolutions of the underlying singular spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invariants of spaces are fundamental tools in topology and geometry.   &lt;br/&gt;The development of new invariants is of great importance to these fields,  &lt;br/&gt;as it provides new tools to identify and describe essential properties of  &lt;br/&gt;geometric and topological spaces.  Invariants also appear in theoretical physics&lt;br/&gt;as observables in topological quantum field theories, for example. In  &lt;br/&gt;many physical and mathematical settings, the spaces of greatest importance also have&lt;br/&gt;symmetries, and it is important to understand how those symmetries  &lt;br/&gt;interact with the geometric and topological properties of the space.   &lt;br/&gt;Recently, the PIs have developed new invariants of spaces with symmetries (stringy&lt;br/&gt;K-theory) and have also made important progress in describing  &lt;br/&gt;connections between their new invariants and previously known invariants, such as&lt;br/&gt;orbifold cohomology.  They have also used their newly developed tools to&lt;br/&gt;refine and simplify many aspects of those previously known  &lt;br/&gt;invariants.  With the support of this grant, the PIs will use their theory of stringy K- &lt;br/&gt;theory as well as their improvements on orbifold cohomology to study spaces  &lt;br/&gt;with symmetries.   They will also further develop these tools to extend their&lt;br/&gt;applicability to more types of spaces, including spaces with continuous&lt;br/&gt;symmetries, which are common throughout mathematics and physics.&lt;br/&gt;They will also develop new invariants of such spaces, including&lt;br/&gt;enhancements of well-known classical invariants such as Chern classes,&lt;br/&gt;but accounting for symmetries.  Such invariants are suggested by&lt;br/&gt;topological string theory and will provide powerful tools for  &lt;br/&gt;understanding these spaces.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
