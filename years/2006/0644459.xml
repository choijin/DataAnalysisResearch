<AbstractNarration>This proposal presents a research program for developing and evaluating dynamic policy models, adaptive composition approaches, and risk management strategies. The main&lt;br/&gt;thrust of his proposal is the development of proof theoretic reasoning and analysis algorithms to enable system integrators and end users to leverage diverse and heterogeneous Web services through local policy specifications. A primary focus of the work is web services workflow-related issues.  It has become increasingly difficult to build services-based systems that can effectively achieve distributed services composition and coordination in increasingly dynamic, uncertain and error-prone open system environments.  The research will develop one model which can  provide a means for specifying the interactive behavior of the underlying services to align their capabilities according to the requirements of their owners and consumers.  The policy enforced Web services composition can be an important conduit for information and event sharing in smart environments. The project will enable students at ASU to experiment with various aspects of information and Web services management, thereby increasing students' awareness of learning, computation, and research issues.  The Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing (CUBIC) at ASU will work closely with the PI and his development partner, Microchip Technology Inc, to test and disseminate prototype technologies, such as smart and aware environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Adaptive Composition: We developed of proof theoretic inference rules for the complete set of deontic capabilities in the policy model.  5. Language and Compiler development: We extended a previous version of SOL,a synchronous programming language for distributed web-based applications, by providing asynchronous service-invocation management functionalities, type systems for safe information down grading, and secure information flow.  6. Integration, evaluation: In collaboration with researchers from Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Louisiana State University we designed and developed a distributed run-time infrastructure, called Secure Infrastructure for Networked Systems (SINS).

We also created a suite of medical applications (automated therapeutic drug monitoring scenario and others) for testing and validation.  7. Educational Activities: Two PhD research assistants and two Masters students worked on the project. A distributed automated therapeutic drug monitoring system was designed and implemented using our SOL language and SINS architecture by a team of undergraduate senior computer science students as their Capstone Project.  8. Dissemination:   Research contributions resulted in five peer-reviewed conference publications, a book chapter and a journal publication. A web site (http://www.public.asu.edu/~hdavulcu/nsfcareer/) was published, and we made all project related research publications, and software components available online, with guidelines and sample applications.
