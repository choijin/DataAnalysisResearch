<AbstractNarration>Carrier-Assisted Routing in Mobile Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of handling node mobility in various mobile networks, two schools exist. The traditional connection-based model is built on the premise that the underlying network is connected, and views node mobility as undesirable. The mobility-assisted model considers mobility as a desirable feature, where routing is based on the store-carry-forward paradigm with random or controlled movement of mobile nodes. This research uses node mobility to enhance routing capability in a mobile network. A dual control planes model is presented, which includes the traditional S (stationary)-plane for routing among stationary nodes using connection-based message routing. In addition, a new control plane, M (mobile)-plane, is used for trajectory control of mobile nodes. The focus is on loosely controlled movement of mobile nodes to assist routing. The five goals of this work are the following: (1) Propose a generic framework for routing. (2) Offer flexible trajectory control of mobile nodes to balance several global objectives. (3) Explore the use of unicasting as a basic building block to support collective communication, including multicast, broadcast, anycast, gather, and gossip. (4) Extend the current model in the 2-D Euclidian space to the high-dimensional and non-Euclidian space. (5) Integrate different components in dual control planes and fine tune the system through an empirical study based on a set of well-defined quantitative performance&lt;br/&gt;metrics. This work is the first to integrate two schools of handling node mobility. The PI envisions that results generated from this research will provide guidelines for efficient routing in a wide range of applications, including the GENI project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
