    <AbstractNarration>Duke University is hosting a conference in memory of Professor Gerry DeSanctis, to be held March 3-5, 2006. The purpose of the conference is to present and discuss leading edge research that builds on and extends Professor DeSanctis's research in the areas of Group Decision Support Systems, Adaptive Structuration Theory, and Virtual Organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submissions will be double blind peer-reviewed to ensure that only the highly original and rigorous papers are selected for presentation at the conference. Publication plans include a special issue of The Journal of the Association for Information Systems. In addition to publication of the special issue, other papers from the conference that inform and advance the scholarship of Professor DeSanctis will be published in an edited volume. The conference will serve as an important venue for pushing the frontiers of these research areas forward, and for identifying where empirical and theoretical breakthroughs still need to be made. Funding from NSF will support travel for graduate students and junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>
