<AbstractNarration>The grail of next-generation wireless networks is providing real-time services for delay-sensitive applications.  Delay sensitive applications such as voice-over-IP, require that the wireless networks provide quality of service (QoS) guarantees, e.g., data rate, delay bound, and delay bound violation probability.  However, the unreliability of wireless channels makes it particularly challenging to design QoS provisioning mechanisms for wireless networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In wireless networking, the area of providing QoS assurance with an emphasis on delay constraints is usually called delay constrained wireless networking. This project is concerned about provisioning statistical delay guarantees.  The problem is challenging since both delay-bound violation (caused by queueing) and bit errors (due to channel noise) need to be addressed. To address this challenge, research is conducted in three aspects: 1) theoretic performance limits -- developing a joint coding and queueing approach to addressing the challenging issue of quantifying the probability of both physical-layer bit errors and link-layer delay bound violation, 2) algorithm design -- developing an observer-controller model and a joint estimation/control  approach to designing QoS provisioning mechanisms that explicitly provide statistical delay guarantees, and 3) experimentation -- developing a software-radio-based testbed, implementing and evaluating the algorithms over the testbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The joint coding and queueing approach will not only yield important principles in design methodologies for delay-constrained wireless networking, but also advance the union of information theory and queueing theory.  The research will have a big impact on supporting delay sensitive applications such as mobile TV.  The research findings will be disseminated through conferences and journals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The past ten years witnessed a rapid advance in wireless networking technologies and infrastructure.  Video and multimedia traffic, which dominates the mobile Internet,  demands advanced technologies to ensure network connectivity of high data rate and low delay.  To answer this call, in this project, the research team developed theories and technologies for delay sensitive applications such as voice-over-Internet, interactive video, mobile TV, and interactive gaming.  To accomplish the research objective, three aspects have been investigated: 1) From the theoretical perspective, the research team developed a joint coding and queueing approach to delay constrained wireless networking, will not only yield important principles in design methodologies for wireless networking, but also advance the union of information theory and queueing theory. 2) From the algorithm design perspective, the research team designed control mechanisms that provide assurance on low delay and high throughput. 3) From the implementation perspective, the research team developed testbeds for multimedia wireless communication.  The research is expected to have a significant impact on supporting delay sensitive applications such as mobile TV.  The research findings have been disseminated through conferences, journals, and invited seminars.  In the past six years, three PhD students were funded by the project.  Two of the funded PhD students are female.  All the three PhD students have graduated.  The REU supplements of the project supported seven undergraduate students in the past four years.  One of them is a minority student.  The undergraduate students obtained important hands-on experience, which is beneficial for their future career in science and engineering.  Most of the undegraduate students involved in the project went to the graduate school after receiving their bachelor degrees.
