<AbstractNarration>In 2001, SIPI received a five-year TCUP Implementation Grant to support the development of science, mathematics, engineering and technology education. SIPI proposed a comprehensive academic enhancement project, entitled 'Vision 21: Expanding STEM higher education for Native Americans in the 21st century', designed to build capacity among faculty and improve the school's science education infrastructure. Vision 21 Phase I resulted in SIPI being well positioned in three areas. First, we have a well-trained teaching faculty with a broad repertoire of instructional strategies. Second, we have a state of the art science education facility with well-equipped labs across the natural and physical sciences. Third, we have an established undergraduate research experience program with a proven record of enhancing student success. We propose to leverage this strong underpinning with our Phase II request, and have chosen two overarching themes, and 4 goals, which extend our reach beyond the basic capacity building of Phase I. In Phase II we will focus on:&lt;br/&gt;I. Access to higher education&lt;br/&gt;Goal 1 Improve outreach to area schools so as to help students move effectively from high school to SIPI, and on to high-demand STEM careers, through early assessment and better aligning secondary and postsecondary curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;Goal 2. Increase access of Native American college students to science and technology degrees through distance education.&lt;br/&gt;II. Best strategies to prepare students for future careers as technologists, scientists and engineers&lt;br/&gt;Goal 3. Improve curriculum and course offerings within STEM associate degree programs to prepare students to be successful at four-year institutions and/or to assume productive careers in the STEM workforce&lt;br/&gt;Goal 4. Increase student and faculty research capacity.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;SIPI is a national community college with students from over 100 tribes whose</AbstractNarration>
