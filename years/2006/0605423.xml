    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference on Correlated Electron Systems is a biannual conference that covers the most active research topics in the physics of strongly correlated electronic systems (CESs). These materials will be of great scientific and economic significance in the future - already high Tc superconductivity and collossal magneto-resistance (a magnetic field will induce large changes in a material's electrical resistance) as well as giant thermoelectric powers (a difference in temperature between two ends of a sample produces a large electric field) have been detected in CESs. The main objective of the conference planned for Summer 2006 is to promote contacts, coordination, and collaboration between researchers in the field of traditional CESs and those in fields such as ultra cold atoms and supersolids. These are all strongly correlated N-body quantum systems with many issues in common. The program contains numerous exciting new sessions in these areas. A further objective is to maintain the special qualities of a Gordon conference; a venue where the latest research results are presented by knowledgeable experts, and where ideas can be made accessible to students, postdocs and non-experts and discussed in depth. The informal atmosphere of a Gordon conference provides students with a unique opportunity to network with leading researchers as well as their peers. It is expected that approximately half of the participants will be graduate students who are close to finishing their degrees or postdoctoral researchers who are trying to identify new areas of enquiry for the next stage of their scientific careers. To strongly encourage the participation of students, postdocs and faculty from underrepresented groups, research advisors will be alerted to the availability of funds for this purpose.</AbstractNarration>
