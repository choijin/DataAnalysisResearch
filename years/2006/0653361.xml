<AbstractNarration>This proposal will explore how one can find a natural way to embed a period of&lt;br/&gt;cosmological inflation within recently proposed string theory compactification&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms. The first part of the research will consider a version of modular inflation&lt;br/&gt;called racetrack inflation developed by the PI and his collaborators. Modular inflation&lt;br/&gt;uses the potentials generated for the moduli fields that occur in string theory&lt;br/&gt;compactifications as the source of the negative pressure required for the inflationary&lt;br/&gt;period. In this picture the mechanism for reheating will be studied and the generation&lt;br/&gt;of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave background due to iso-curvature perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also investigate other typed of inflation that can occur in string theory&lt;br/&gt;compactifications. The second aspect of the proposal will be a detailed study of&lt;br/&gt;D-Brane inflation. In this picture the scalar field responsible for inflation parameterizes&lt;br/&gt;the position of a brane along the internal manifold. One possible consequence of this&lt;br/&gt;picture is that during inflation there is brane-antibrane annihilation which could lead to&lt;br/&gt;the production of cosmic strings which have observable cosmological effects.&lt;br/&gt;The broader implications of this proposal are that If string theory can be directly verified&lt;br/&gt;(or falsified) by measurement of cosmological parameters this would be very important.&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to create a web page for the general public explaining the main results of&lt;br/&gt;his work. He also intends to get involved with Physics Theory-Net and give lectures at&lt;br/&gt;local high schools.</AbstractNarration>
