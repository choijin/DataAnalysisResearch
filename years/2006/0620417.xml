    <AbstractNarration>Charles Darwin was born in 1809. The bicentenary of his birth will be celebrated at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Cambridge and elsewhere in 2009. I have been invited to spend 2006-2007&lt;br/&gt;at Christ's College, Cambridge (Darwin's alma mater) and at the Sedgwick Museum of&lt;br/&gt;Earth Sciences in Cambridge. My work in Cambridge would be directed towards the&lt;br/&gt;enhancement of scholarly and public understanding of Darwin's contributions to the earth&lt;br/&gt;sciences. The scholarly aspect of my work in 2006-2007 would involve a study of latenineteenth&lt;br/&gt;and twentieth century geology showing how Darwin's work became integrated&lt;br/&gt;with the work of other researchers. The results of this study would be presented as a&lt;br/&gt;paper to the Darwin 2009" conference in Cambridge to which I have been invited. To&lt;br/&gt;make Darwin's geological work more accessible to scholars and to the general public I&lt;br/&gt;would transcribe Darwin's geological specimen notebooks and arrange for them to be&lt;br/&gt;posted online. With others I would also work to organize an expedition to recreate&lt;br/&gt;Darwin's geological researches in the Galapagos Islands. In addition to these activities I&lt;br/&gt;would work with others to shape an exhibit on Darwin as a geologist for display at the&lt;br/&gt;Sedgwick Museum in 2009. Here I would hope to further cooperation among museums&lt;br/&gt;internationally in displaying materials relevant to the history of geology, emphasizing the&lt;br/&gt;public utility of such knowledge. This would include facilitating communication among&lt;br/&gt;historians of science, geologists, and museum curators in Cambridge and those in the&lt;br/&gt;United States.</AbstractNarration>
