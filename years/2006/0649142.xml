<AbstractNarration>EEC-0649142 &lt;br/&gt;Karen L. Butler-Purry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This renewal award for an REU Site at the Texas Engineering Experiment Station supports 10 undergraduate students each year for three years in a 10-week summer program. The objectives of the REU Site are: (1) to recruit 70% of the participants from off-campus;( 2) actively recruit underrepresented students and students with limited access to undergraduate research opportunities for participation; (3) open new research opportunities to students who have had little or no previous research experience, providing insights into research methodologies, self-discipline, team integration, and reporting and exchanging new knowledge; (4) provide information on benefits of attending graduate school, the application process, and encouraging students to attend graduate school in Electrical and Computer Engineering; and (5) provide community building opportunity among REU students, Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) graduate students, and faculty mentors, and (6) provide opportunities for REU students to present and publish with faculty mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will be facilitated by faculty who have personal contacts with minority serving institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as well as through student engineering organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Mexican American Engineers and Scientists (MAES), and the Society of Hispanic Engineers (SHPE).&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
