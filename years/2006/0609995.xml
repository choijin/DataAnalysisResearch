<AbstractNarration>A technical description of the project:&lt;br/&gt;Heavy (dense and viscous) oils are considered an alternative energy source&lt;br/&gt;because they constitute one of the largest reserves of&lt;br/&gt;previously unexploited fossil fuels on earth.&lt;br/&gt;The fraction of the original oils in&lt;br/&gt;place that can be recovered by solution gas drive&lt;br/&gt;decreases with increasing oil viscosity. For&lt;br/&gt;heavy oil reservoirs, the expected recovery factor&lt;br/&gt;(percentage of the oil in the reservoir that can be&lt;br/&gt;recovered) by solution gas drive is typically lower than 5%.&lt;br/&gt;However, a number of heavy oil reservoirs under&lt;br/&gt;solution gas drive show anomalous primary&lt;br/&gt;performance: low production gas-oil ratios,&lt;br/&gt;high oil production rates, and high oil recovery.&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate oil recovery can be as high as 20%&lt;br/&gt;in the primary performance of such heavy oil reservoirs.&lt;br/&gt;The oil samples at the wellhead produced from these&lt;br/&gt;reservoirs are in the form of oil-continuous foam,&lt;br/&gt;which has the appearance of chocolate mousse&lt;br/&gt;and contains a certain volume fraction of gas.&lt;br/&gt;The term "foamy oil" is often used to&lt;br/&gt;describe such oils. The flow behavior of&lt;br/&gt;foamy oils is very complex, and remains controversial&lt;br/&gt;and poorly understood. This project is directed toward&lt;br/&gt;experimental, theoretical, and numerical investigations&lt;br/&gt;of the flow behavior of foamy oils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A nontechnical description of the project:&lt;br/&gt;The world needs enormous new crude oil reserves.&lt;br/&gt;During the next several decades,&lt;br/&gt;there is not and there will not be an economical,&lt;br/&gt;abundant substitute for crude oil in the economies of industrial&lt;br/&gt;countries, even with the price of a barrel of oil over $70.&lt;br/&gt;Maintaining the supply needed to support these economies&lt;br/&gt;and enable them to grow means that&lt;br/&gt;significant additional crude reserves must be developed. The&lt;br/&gt;conventional (light and medium) oil resources discovered up to&lt;br/&gt;the end of 2002 will last at most 40 years&lt;br/&gt;at 2002's production rate. Thus additional development will&lt;br/&gt;be primarily in the form of the sole alternative: heavy crudes.&lt;br/&gt;Two crucial issues must be addressed before&lt;br/&gt;or during the design of any production project for these&lt;br/&gt;heavy oils: What is a suitable method for&lt;br/&gt;evaluating the foamy oil drive mechanism that plays a major role&lt;br/&gt;during such oil recovery, and what is a reasonable percentage of&lt;br/&gt;ultimate oil recovery for each project? Unfortunately,&lt;br/&gt;these two issues have not been fully addressed and are still&lt;br/&gt;not understood. The laboratory experiments, theoretical investigations,&lt;br/&gt;and numerical simulations proposed in this project&lt;br/&gt;will greatly improve our understanding of these issues.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
