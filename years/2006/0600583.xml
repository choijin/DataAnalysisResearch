<AbstractNarration>Title of the NSF Proposal: Mechanics of Damping in Nanostructured Materials&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, an integrated modeling and experimental approach is proposed to have a focused study on the damping properties of nanostructured materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and CNT reinforce polymer composites. Understanding the origin of damping due to the dramatic reduction in the length scale is essential for developing applications such as nanoscale sensors and actuators, nanocomposites, NEMS, and components for nanoelectronics. With the dramatic increase in the surface-to-volume ratio at the nanometer length scale, a critical aspect of the research is to study the effects of nanoscale surface and interface.  These effects become important as nanostructured materials are integrated with other materials or systems that are of different types and operate at different spatial and temporal scales. More specifically, a multiscale modeling and simulation approach will be developed for studying damping properties in CNT and CNT-based polymer composites; The modeling study will then be combined with an experimental program to explore various intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, such as structure, defect, temperature, humidity, and interface binding, that are critical for understanding the damping mechanism in CNT and CNT related composites. Finally, The research results obtained will be fully incorporated into an innovative educational program that targets at a wide range of audiences, including gradates, undergraduates, K-12 and underrepresented groups. Since the topic of this project is also of the key interest of both research communities and industries, the societal impact is expected through benefiting the nation's economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
