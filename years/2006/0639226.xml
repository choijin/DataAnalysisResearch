<AbstractNarration>Oömycetes, or water molds, comprise a diverse group of heterotrophic organisms that morphologically and physiologically resemble fungi.  Many oömycetes are saprophytic, especially in aquatic habitats.  More commonly though, oömycetes are destructive pathogens of plants and animals. The last five years have seen a rapid expansion in resources for oömycete genomics and a rapid growth in the number of researchers interested in oomycetes. This project will strengthen the strong culture of collaboration and communication within that community and facilitate the sharing of techniques and resources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central thrust of the program is to ensure that the transformation of the oömycete molecular genetics community into a genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular genetics community carries all the community research groups with it, including less well-funded groups that are disproportionately located at small minority-serving or primarily undergraduate-oriented institutions, or at institutions in nations with poorly developed research-funding infrastructures. Furthermore, the entry, participation and training of new investigators into the field of oömycete genomics, particularly junior faculty and faculty from institutions under-represented in the U.S. research infrastructure, will be promoted. The mechanisms to promote these goals include an annual workshop, training workshops, brief training internships focused on bioinformatics, a web site, and a resource center to maintain and distribute materials for the worldwide oömycete genomics community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
