<AbstractNarration>Hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations arise in many&lt;br/&gt;applications where wave propagation or transport phenomena are important.&lt;br/&gt;Often these equations and/or their solutions involve discontinuous&lt;br/&gt;functions, giving difficulties for standard finite-difference approaches&lt;br/&gt;to discretizing the differential equations.  In particular, nonlinear wave&lt;br/&gt;propagation problems often give rise to shock waves, discontinuities in&lt;br/&gt;the solution which can arise spontaneously even from smooth initial data.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is then to approximate a weak solution to the underlying integral&lt;br/&gt;conservation law.  Often the problem must be solved in a heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;medium where the material properties vary with space, often discontinously&lt;br/&gt;at sharp material interfaces.  This results in discontinuous coefficients&lt;br/&gt;or flux functions in the equations to be solved.  This proposal concerns&lt;br/&gt;the further development of multidimensional high-resolution&lt;br/&gt;finite volume methods for solving such problems, the development of&lt;br/&gt;software implementing these methods, and the application of these&lt;br/&gt;methods to particular problems.  The P.I. has previously developed&lt;br/&gt;a multidimensional "wave-propagation algorithm" that yields a very&lt;br/&gt;general framework for solving such problems, and has implemented this&lt;br/&gt;method in the CLAWPACK software.  These algorithms and the software&lt;br/&gt;will be further developed and brought to bear on a variety of problems.&lt;br/&gt;Some particular applications to be studied include: tsunami propagation&lt;br/&gt;and runup, pyroclastic flows arising from volcanic eruptions, the&lt;br/&gt;simulation of seismic waves, and elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;media, including shock wave propagation in tissue and bone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide range of practical problems arising in science and engineering are&lt;br/&gt;modeled using "hyperbolic differential equations" and have a very similar&lt;br/&gt;mathematical structure, allowing researchers in applied and computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics to make contributions that are widely applicable.  The goal&lt;br/&gt;of this work is to further develop methods and software for approximating&lt;br/&gt;the solutions to these equations.  These methods are implemented in the&lt;br/&gt;CLAWPACK software package written by the P.I. and co-workers, which&lt;br/&gt;is freely available on the web and allows students and researchers&lt;br/&gt;studying a wide range of phenomena to use state of the art methods for&lt;br/&gt;these mathematical problems.  This software has been downloaded by more&lt;br/&gt;than 5000 registered users over the past several years and applied to&lt;br/&gt;numerous scientific and engineering problems by the PI, his students, and&lt;br/&gt;other users.  Specific practical problems will also be studied, building on&lt;br/&gt;work already performed by the P.I. and students.  One project involves&lt;br/&gt;modeling the effects of tsunamis on coastal regions, both to aid in&lt;br/&gt;scientific studies of past tsunamis and as an aid to hazard mitigation&lt;br/&gt;and preparedness.  Other geophysical projects involve the study of flows&lt;br/&gt;arising from volcanic eruptions and the propagation of seismic waves in&lt;br/&gt;the earth following an earthquake or in oil exploration.  A project with&lt;br/&gt;biomedical applications is the study of shock waves propagating in tissue&lt;br/&gt;and bone, with potential application to the study of "shock wave therapy",&lt;br/&gt;in which ultrasonic shock waves are used to treat a variety of medical&lt;br/&gt;conditions including nonunions (broken bones that fail to heal), plantar&lt;br/&gt;fasciitis, and tendinitis.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
