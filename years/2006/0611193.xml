<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel method of preparing surfaces for medical applications that retain lubricant; the main applications are orthopedic in nature. This research uses lubricant retention features of engineered laser-textured surfaces to increase the film thickness in orthopedic implants. Previous researchers have shown the benefits of textured surfaces on friction and wear, but this usually consists of longitudinally ground surfaces. These do provide some tribological benefit compared to amorphous surfaces, but even more advantages can be gained by using ovoid bowls and specially optimized surface patterns. The proposed design uses Nd:YAG laser pulses to obtain lubricant reservoirs, increasing the load supported by synovial fluid and thereby decreasing wear. The pattern profile and packing will be optimized for biomechanical loadings encountered in walking, a new and valuable concept to produce the optimum surface for orthopedic implants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, this application  is focued on commercial applications associated with orthopedics, but a number of additional applications exist for this technology. In the medical field, textured surfaces could be used to help deploy implants such as stents or catheters, since adhesion is known to play a significant role in these applications. The approach of placing a texture through Nd:YAG lasers with optimum shape can be used to improve performance and extend the life of any dynamically loaded reciprocating tribological contact with an unsteady load. Examples of such applications include piston rings, piston main bearings, cams, and ratchets, especially for high performance applications where the cost of laser texturing can be justified.</AbstractNarration>
