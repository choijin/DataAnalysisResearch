<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who are majoring in biology (non-medical), chemistry, computer science, engineering, electrical engineering technology, environmental technology, earth systems and environmental science, mathematics, physics, and telecommunication technology to prepare them for careers in technology fields. Students are being recruited from mathematics and science courses at the college and from local high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  In addition to receiving financial support, S-STEM student/scholars and faculty participate in the Mathematics, Engineering, Technology, and Science (METS) Academy, modeled on the Science Academy and the Honors Program, in which each student is assigned a faculty mentor. The Academy sponsors talks, offers tutoring, provides students with information about research opportunities, and encourages them to enroll in the Research Enrichment Seminar. Students are directed to Career Services for workshops on interviewing and resume writing and to the Transfer Center as they approach graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The program is having a major impact on student retention and graduation. It builds on the highly successful CSEMS scholarship program, which supported 78 students and had a 91% retention rate. The success of the S-STEM program is being evaluated by the percentage of students who graduate and transfer to a STEM major at a four-year college or find employment in the technology area; increased enrollment in STEM fields; and the number of high school students who enroll in STEM programs at the college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
