<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) research project explores a novel locomotion mechanism for mobile robots which is inspired by the motility mechanisms of single celled organisms that use cytoplasmic streaming to generate pseudopods for locomotion. The Whole Skin Locomotion (WSL), as we call it, works by way of an elongated toroid which turns itself inside out in a single continuous motion, effectively generating the overall motion of the cytoplasmic streaming ectoplasmic tube in amoebae. Our preliminary experiments show that a robot using the WSL mechanism can easily squeeze between obstacles or under a collapsed ceiling and move forward using all of its contact surfaces for traction, or even squeeze itself through holes with diameters much smaller than its nominal width. This unique mobility makes WSL the ideal locomotion method for search-and-rescue robots that need to traverse over or under rubble, or for medical applications such as robotic endoscopes where a robot needs to maneuver itself into tight spaces. This research project combines fundamental analytical and experimental research towards the design and development of the novel WSL mechanism. This is achieved by; applying biological theories of amoeboid motility mechanisms to develop WSL actuation models; performing analysis for the mechanics of these models; conducting parametric studies for design including power efficiency and force transmission characteristics; building an experimental apparatus for validation; developing macro and micro scale novel actuators; and fabricating robot prototypes for demonstration and evaluation. The intellectual merits of the proposed activities lie in the development of an original concept of a new class of mechanism that generates an everting motion from the expanding and contracting motion of actuating rings to be used for a new type of biologically inspired locomotion strategy for mobile robots, and in promoting the concept of bio-inspiration in design. This novel mechanism will also enable smart materials such as electroactive polymers to be used in new ways, opening the door for new, creative and exciting areas such as "soft robotics."&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
