<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Antonios Armaou &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Pennsylvania State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0644519&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Optimal Operation and Control of Multiscale Process Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precise regulation of the microstructure of key industrial products, such as thin films with specific surface morphology and biological crystals with specific shape, is currently an important yet unresolved research problem with broad industrial implications.  Regulation of microscopic product properties within tight limits requires the development and implementation of computationally-efficient model-based optimal operation and control policies on the processes that make the specific product.  Fundamental mathematical models that link microscopic product properties to macroscopic process variables that can be automatically regulated are usually referred to as multiscale process systems and their solution has very high computational requirements.  Computationally-efficient techniques for calculating high-performance operation and control policies should utilize highly-accurate, yet computationally tractable approximations of multiscale process systems.  Motivated by this, the objective of this research is to resolve the fundamental issues associated with the development of computationally-efficient techniques for computing optimal operation and control policies for multiscale process systems which will allow setting product microstructure within certain stringent confidence limits.  To achieve this objective, a number of specific projects are planned including: a) development of computationally-efficient algorithms for optimization and optimal operation of multiscale process systems using a variety of microscopic/multiscale objectives, b) development of nonlinear, low-order, approximate models of multiscale process systems and construction of practically-implementable feedback control systems that can deal with the issues of nonlinearity, model uncertainty and constraints, c) application of the optimal operation and control methods to micro- electronics manufacturing processes (in particular, metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) of GaN thin films widely used for the production of green/blue lasers), and d) integration of the= research results into education.  In addition to computationally-efficient methods for optimal operation and control of multiscale systems, the research will provide fundamental insight into the nature of the optimization and control problems for multiscale process systems and address practical implementation issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a wide range of industrial processes and products that will benefit from the results of the&lt;br/&gt;research including microelectronics manufacturing/advanced materials processes such as vapor phase epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition and etching, where film microstructure is an important product quality variable.  To transfer the results and insight of the proposed research to the industrial sector and pursue future experimental implementation, the PI will also actively seek collaborations with industry and experimental faculty at Penn State.  Finally, a number of activities are planned to integrate the proposed research with education, including incorporation of research results in the advanced transport phenomena and control courses, undergraduate student participation in the research through the honors program, and the development of a&lt;br/&gt;LEGO Mindstorms laboratory to facilitate outreach to high-school and college students from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fundamental question: The objective of this research was to address fundamental issues associated with the development of computationally feasible algorithms and methods that compute optimal operation and control policies for complex process systems, exemplified by mutiscale and distributed systems.   From a theoretical and algorithmic perspective, outcomes of the project are the  (A) improved understanding of the issues that are associated to model reduction, system identification, optimization and control of multiscale, hybrid atomistic/continuous and distributed systems,  (B)  development of computationally efficient methodologies for the formulation of optimization problems,  (C)  derivation of systematic approaches for on-line system identification and controller design.     With respect to the broader chemical engineering and biomedical systems communities  A)   The developed algorithms have significantly improved out ability to identify process conditions that satisfy both process yield and product quality requirements in microelectronics and photovoltaics fabrication and catalytic processes.  Examples included  a layered heterostructure thin-film deposition process to determine the optimal conditions for the microscale goal of a smooth interface between the GaAs and AlAs layers.  optimization of GaN thin film uniformity during MOVPE via optimal switching of inlet gases supression and excitation of a microscopic description of CO catalytic oxidation processes using optimal inlet concentration profiles.    B)    Our research activities with biomedical focus have led to the development of  multiscale animal/subcellular  mathematical models that predict HIV progression and  directly link medication strategies to viral load and  a systematic approach to identify medication regimens that suppress HIV progression. a multiscale model describing tumor progression with biologically relevant vasculature remodeling has allowed for investigations on chemotherapy/radiotherapy synergism.   Dynamic optimization and Controller design of processes modeled by multiscale systems:  Precise regulation of the microstructure of key industrial products, such as thin films with specific surface morphology is an important industrial problem. Mathematical models that link (the microscopic) product properties to (the macroscopic) process design and control variables are referred to as multiscale process systems. The formulation and use of these models requires experience and computational resources that are usually unavailable to the broad community. We developed a methodology for the formulation and computational acceleration of optimization problems when the product quality is central to the process yield question. The methodology initially identifies a minimum set of "coarse" spatially invariant parameters that accurately describe the dominant behavior of the microscopic process under various operating conditions. Subsequently, it constructs low-order state-space models based on these coarse variables. This is achieved by combining order reduction techniques for the macroscopic conservation equations with adaptive tabulation of microscopic simulations. The multiscale process optimization problem can then be solved using standard search algorithms. Based on these models the control question was then answered by combining subspace system identification methods and a model predictive controller structure.     Controller design for of processes modeled by distributed parameter systems:  To successfully control the investigated processes we need to account for the interplay between transport and reaction, the complex geometry of the reactors, the complex chemistry of the process and the unavailability of accurate measurements. These complexities preclude us from using established control methodologies. We developed the adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition (APOD) method to circumvent a number of open issues of POD techniques associated with sens...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
