<AbstractNarration>Linette Watkins, Texas State University-San Marcos, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2006-2007 academic year.  Watkins' project will initiate and support a year-round undergraduate research community at San Antonio College (SAC), a two-year college with a strongly diverse student population. Projects will be developed by collaboration between SAC and Texas State faculty. Graduate students from Texas State will be trained to supervise undergraduate research at SAC as they complete their own research projects alongside the undergraduates. Research themes include determining the enzymatic mechanism of C-S bond cleavage, synthesizing and characterizing boron-containing polymers for specialty materials applications and synthesizing surface-modified clay platelets. The project seeks to strengthen the research infrastructure at the community college, increase two-year college students access to research experiences and increase the quality of interactions between the two campuses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.</AbstractNarration>
