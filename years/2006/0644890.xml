<AbstractNarration>National Science Foundation  - Division of Chemical &amp;Transport Systems  Particulate &amp; Multiphase Processes Program (1415)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0644890&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Green, David L.&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation:   University of Virginia Main Campus&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  CAREER: Connecting the Wetting and Rheological Behaviors of Polymer Grafted Nanoparticles in Polymer Melts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in grafting polymer brushes to nanoparticles surfaces permit the formulation of a wide range of advanced polymer nanocomposites in which the brush serves to prevent particle aggregation. Through recent NSF-supported research, the PI was one of the first to fundamentally connect the wetting of the brush to the uniform dispersion of nanoparticles for a model system of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-grafted silica nanospheres in PDMS melts. The PDMS-grafted nanoparticles in that study were formulated by an established "grafting to" method that entailed the covalent attachment of pre-formed polymer chains directly to the nanoparticle surface. The "grafting to" method enabled the study of the impact of low-to-moderate PDMS graft densities on nanoparticle&lt;br/&gt;Dispersion. The research will to employ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), a recently developed "grafting from" methodology, to construct polystyrene (PS) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) brushes monomer-by-monomer from the surface of monodisperse silica nanoparticles. The "grafting from" technique permits the synthesis of polymer brushes over a wider range of graft densities than the "grafting to" method. Ultimately, this set of experiments will produce systematic data that will permit quantification of the strength of attraction between nanoparticles as well as the relevant time- and length-scales that control the gelation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Broader impacts are three-fold. First, the calibration of self-consistent models to experimental data will permit the prediction of physical properties such as the interparticle spacing that could then be used to optimize a range of materials properties. Second, formulation of well-designed model systems will permit physicists, colloidal scientists, and rheologists to study and quantify gelation phenomena to facilitate comparisons of experimental data across of wide range of laboratories. Third, the proposed research provides an excellent medium for achieving the educational and outreach goal of exposing more students to a career in science and engineering. To this end, the PI will seek funds for a summer program to expose secondary school teachers to cutting-edge research in his lab, create demonstrations to introduce students to the fascinating properties of nanoparticles, and utilize the Research Experience for Undergraduates program to establish a pipeline of underrepresented students for engineering graduate study at the University of Virginia. By targeting these programs to specific geographic areas and populations, the PI hopes to increase the number of woman and minority PhDs in chemical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CAREER Award has enabled the Principle Investigator (PI) to take advantage of recent advances in the grafting polymer brushes to nanoparticles surfaces, permitting the formulation of a wide range of advanced polymer nanocomposites in which the graft polymer serves to control particle aggregation. Hence, the PI employed controlled radical polymerizations to construct polystyrene (PS) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) brushes monomer-by-monomer from the surface of monodisperse silica nanoparticles, facilitating the synthesis of polymer brushes over an extensive range of graft densities. The ability to formulate novel model systems, consisting of the PMMA- and PS-grafted silica nanoparticles in polymer melts, allowed the PI to probe the impact of graft density as well as the influence of brush/matrix segment interactions and particle size on the wetting of the brush and nanoparticle dispersion.     Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project was to further enhance the understanding into the mechanisms that control the dispersion of polymer-grafted nanoparticles into semidilute and concentrated polymer solutions and polymer melts. On the basis of nine papers published to date under this award, we showed for the first time that: 1) the wetting of the polymer brush controls nanoparticle dispersion in semidilute and concentrated polymer solutions, and that nanoparticle interactions can be predictably related to self-consistent mean field theory (Fig. 1); 2) the wetting of the polymer brush controls particle rheology in polymer melts in which the linear viscoelastic properties of the composite can be predicted from first principles with statistical mechanics (Fig. 2); and 3) when grafting polymers from nanoparticles with controlled radical polymerizations, the conformation of heteroatoms in the ligand layer dictates polymer attachment (Fig. 3).       Broader Impacts:  The research under the CAREER Award has produced three broader impacts.  First, the calibration of self-consistent models to experimental data permits the prediction of physical properties such as the interparticle spacing that can then be used to optimize a range of materials properties.  Second, the synthetic methods published by the PI currently enables physicists, colloidal scientists, and rheologists to formulate well-designed model systems to study and quantify dispersion phenomena and facilitate comparisons of experimental data across of wide range of laboratories. Third, the research provided an excellent medium for achieving the educational and outreach goals of the PI by exposing more students to a career in science and engineering.

The targeting these programs to specific geographic areas and populations led to the graduation of two female PhDs and two women with MS degrees from the research group of the PI.  Moreover, eight out of the 17 undergraduates in his laboratory have been women, of those, two were African-American, two were Hispanic, and two were Asian.  The REU program has also been used to fund an African-American male student who is currently enrolled at the university of the PI.
