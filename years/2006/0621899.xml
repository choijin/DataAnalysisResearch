<AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on self-integration of carbon-nanotube (CNT) sensors with functional integrated circuits (ICs). The objective of this research is to develop a process that will integrate the CNT sensors in functional ICs that already exist on the chip surfaces (such as amplifiers, A/D converters, signal processors, and CPUs). The proposed methodology has unique advantages over state-of-the-art methods in the growth of CNT sensors. The proposed process is a cold process because it will locally heat a nanoscale region. In addition, the CNT growth is self-aligned along the electrical field, connecting the electrodes so that the CNT sensors can be integrated into functional ICs. The proposed process is cost-effective because it is a self-aligned process, which meets the application needs required for future CNT-based sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been explored as basic building blocks of sensors for many applications, including biosensors, gas sensors, acoustic sensors, optical sensors, thermal sensors, strain sensors, mass sensors, electronic sensors, flow sensors, and pressure sensors. Compared with conventional sensors, CNT sensors have the advantages of high sensitivity, low power consumption, compactness, high yield and low cost. This research has the potential to revolutionize the efficiency, cost, and positioning accuracy of fabricating CNT-based sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Impacts are expected to be far reaching because sensors are used in many industries. Research results will be disseminated via a website and through conferences. One graduate student from an underrepresented group and two undergraduate students will be recruited to work on this project. Research results will be integrated into an existing senior undergraduate/graduate course and an animation kit showing the basic ideas on CNT sensor growth at the nanoscale and applications of CNT sensors will be developed and distributed to teachers and students at K-12 schools through annual public seminars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
