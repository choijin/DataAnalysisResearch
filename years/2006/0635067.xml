<AbstractNarration>Quality Education for Minorities Network will conduct a series of leadership development opportunities for a selection of highly qualified and experienced faculty at tribal colleges and universities or at Alaska native serving institutions of higher education.  The workshops will include nationally recognized leadership development experts, group discussions, and individual and group projects.  Fellows will develop an administrative project of their own choosing in consultation with the other fellows and the workshop organizers.  They will conduct these projects as "take home" assignments at their institutions, and will complete the projects within a year to report back to their colleagues at a series of two follow up workshops.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
