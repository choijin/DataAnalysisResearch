<AbstractNarration>0635457  &lt;br/&gt;Diebold&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:  This proposal is to support a U.S.-Egypt workshop and conference on photoacoustic and photothermal phenomena, to be held in Cairo, Egypt, January 2007.  The U.S. organizer is Gerald Diebold, Department of Chemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. The foreign organizers are Dr. Hassan Talaat, Department of Physics, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt and Dr. Sohair Negm, Faculty of Engineering, Benha University at Shoubra, Cairo, Egypt. Topics to be discussed include: nonlinear phenomena, inverse problems, imaging and microscopy, spectroscopy, determination of thermophysical properties, industrial applications and non-destructive testing, laser ultrasonics and ultrafast phenomena, electronic properties, thin films, biological applications, and applications in agriculture, food and the environment.  The workshop will include sessions to discuss the various avenues of collaboration, including access of Middle Eastern students to US institutions where photoacoustic and photothermal science is being investigated, identification of postdoctoral researchers and potential for visiting faculty in US laboratories, the linking of research groups in the US and the Middle East to jointly work on common problems.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits:   The conference will focus on cutting edge, front line research in the fields of photoacoustic and photothermal phenomena, and on the many current and expanding applications in various fields of technology. Speakers will be selected to present advances that have been made in the field.  The conference will provide US and M.E. researchers the opportunity to discuss projects that represent the latest developments in the field.  In most cases the research presented at the conference will of ongoing efforts, and will not have been yet published.  The discussions in the workshop will focus on new directions in future research. The workshop will build on the ideas presented in the talks and will identify research areas and details of mechanisms where M.E. scientists can collaborate with American scientists.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  Photoacoustic and photothermal science has had numerous practical applications of significant societal benefit in addition to the theory and fundamental science that has been uncovered. One particular application is medical imaging, where its contrast mechanism gives it a unique value among imaging modalities. In another application, the photoacoustic effect continues to serve as one of the most sensitive and practical methods for monitoring of trace toxic species in liquids and detection of trace pollutant gases in the atmosphere. Application of photoacoustic and photothermal effects has included the introduction of completely new technology for identification and characterization of semiconductors, for monitoring storage of food products, and for non destructive testing for flaws in high performance and sensitive components. The workshop will include women, minorities, junior scientists as well as graduate and undergraduate students from US institutions.  Conference proceedings will be published and made available to wide audience in the US and the Middle East. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
