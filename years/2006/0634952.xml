    <AbstractNarration>The research. The research topics in this proposal are: 1) Fundamentals for the wiretap channel:&lt;br/&gt;error control codes for reliability and security, 2) Opportunistic wireless physical-layer security, 3) Highly&lt;br/&gt;reliable and secure distributed data storage. In all areas the focus is not only on theory but on practical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to achieve the very high levels of security and reliability promised by information theory.&lt;br/&gt;The PI and collaborations: About half of the work in this proposal will be done with collaborators&lt;br/&gt;in Europe connected to the Georgia Tech Lorraine (GTL) campus in Metz, France where the PI was&lt;br/&gt;formerly Director of Research and currently Deputy Director. In March 2006, the PI and his colleagues, in&lt;br/&gt;partnership with the French Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), established a joint research&lt;br/&gt;center dedicated to international collaborations in secure networks and advanced materials, the first such&lt;br/&gt;center of its kind in France. This center hosts fifteen people and ten projects from four institutions. The&lt;br/&gt;wireless portion of this proposal will be done in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Porto (J.&lt;br/&gt;Barros) and Cambridge University (M. Rodrigues). The international component of our project creates&lt;br/&gt;opportunities and challenges. For example, the landscape for recruiting and educating graduate students&lt;br/&gt;today is characterized by i) decreases in the students applying to US universities, particularly from China&lt;br/&gt;and India, and ii) a lack of US students getting meaningful engineering educational and research experience&lt;br/&gt;outside the US. We believe this project, coupled with the GTL campus in France, can address some of&lt;br/&gt;these challenges and help create future engineers, educators and researchers with a more global perspective.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project has two dimensions: i) global connections with a pathway to&lt;br/&gt;commercialization of new wireless security concepts; and ii) new models for training graduate students&lt;br/&gt;across national boundaries. The students and faculty would participate in new and long-lasting international&lt;br/&gt;research and educational activities. These students will have a much more global perspective, have the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to interact on a long-term basis with European students and faculty, and the project would&lt;br/&gt;serve to identify (for companies, universities and government agencies) outstanding people with a global&lt;br/&gt;perspective. This model addresses the changing landscape and needs of student and faculty in the US and&lt;br/&gt;abroad.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in new approaches to physical layer communications, from both theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and practical perspectives. The notion of a highly secure and reliable physical layer has the potential to&lt;br/&gt;significantly change how people think of the physical layer. The error control codes in this work will have&lt;br/&gt;the dual roles of reliability and security, adding a new dimension to a subject that has been studied&lt;br/&gt;extensively for more than 60 years. We believe the research presented here will result in changes in how&lt;br/&gt;classical communication systems are perceived and used, and is the next natural step in higher&lt;br/&gt;performance, physical layer communication systems.</AbstractNarration>
