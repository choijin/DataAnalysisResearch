<AbstractNarration>Routing protocols enable a distributed set of nodes to determine the&lt;br/&gt;flow of data over important networks such as the Internet. As a&lt;br/&gt;result, ensuring that nodes throughout the network properly implement&lt;br/&gt;the routing-protocol is of paramount importance. The routing-protocols&lt;br/&gt;in these networks are distributed, and nodes operate independently,&lt;br/&gt;but must cooperate and "play by the rules" of the routing protocol&lt;br/&gt;if the network is to function correctly and efficiently. Routing&lt;br/&gt;protocols form the basis of what is called the "control plane" of a&lt;br/&gt;networking architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the control plane, and is seeking to further&lt;br/&gt;development of a methodology for measuring the inherent security of&lt;br/&gt;the control plane component of existing and future routing protocols.&lt;br/&gt;The overall approach has a significant theoretical component: general&lt;br/&gt;classes of routing protocols are identified and they are being&lt;br/&gt;analyzed for their ability to monitor themselves. The technique of&lt;br/&gt;Strong Detection is being used to reveal bounds on the kinds of errors&lt;br/&gt;that these classes of routing protocols can detect, thus identifying&lt;br/&gt;complexity classes of routing protocols in terms of their&lt;br/&gt;self-monitoring abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work in this project contributes to an entirely new way of&lt;br/&gt;evaluating the security level of a routing protocol.  Strong Detection&lt;br/&gt;is novel, not only in its ability to identify the existence of a&lt;br/&gt;control plane attack, but also in its ability to classify the&lt;br/&gt;robustness to attack of classes of routing protocols. The project will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the general area of routing security, which is necessary&lt;br/&gt;to protect our networking infrastructure from deliberate or accidental&lt;br/&gt;damage.</AbstractNarration>
