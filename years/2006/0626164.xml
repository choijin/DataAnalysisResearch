<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.:   CTS-0626164&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  EDWIN A. COWEN&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION:   CORNELL UNIVERSITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE EFFECT OF SUBMERGED AND EMERGENT, HIGHLY FLEXIBLE AND RIGID MACROPHYTE CANOPY PATCHES ON FLOW AND MASS TRANSPORT  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding to perform a series of carefully controlled experimental studies on the effects of aquatic macrophyte canopy patches on low-speed flows. The literature on the effects of terrestrial and aquatic vegetation on flow is becoming quite rich but there is a significant gap in the aquatic plant literature on the effects of heterogeneous canopies in low-speed flows and for the effects of highly flexible macrophtyes in general.  The investigators will collect a canonical experimental data set documenting the effects of highly flexible macrophyte canopies and heterogenous macrophyte patches on low-speed flow and mass transport. A secondary goal is to extend and investigate the ability of existing turbulence closure schemes to capture these effects. The experiments will be conducted using two species of live macrophytes. The macrophytes will be placed in patches of increasing complexity in the all glass test section of a wide open-channel flume. State of the art quantitative imaging techniques will be used to measure the turbulent velocity characteristics, including the directly calculated turbulent dissipation, as well as the transport and dispersion of fluorescent tracers.  Proposed modifications to turbulence closure models will be the starting point for investigating the ability of models to capture the turbulent kinetic energy budget. Competing numerical models of canopy flow that perform equally well in uniform aquatic canopies will be tested against this novel heterogeneous data set.  The collected data set will fill critical gaps in our understanding of aquatic plant-flow interaction. It is important to work with live plants, as field biologists monitor macrophyte communities using metrics that do not lend themselves to scaling with simulated plant model results. The tested turbulence closure models will allow the development of computational tools capable of forecasting transport in natural environments dominated by both highly flexible and heterogeneous plant canopy patches - environments such as lakes of all scales, salt marshes, estuaries and coastal embayments and terrestrial flows as well. The project will lead to an interdisciplinary Ph.D. for a talented female student who will work with the PI to develop laboratory experiences for an introductory fluid mechanics course and to host weeklong projects for a program targeting high-school women interested in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Accurate prediction of pollutant transport and dilution in surface waters (such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands) is key to balancing the protection of freshwater resources with the economic interests of industry and municipalities. The complexity of surface water flows (often turbulent and forced by highly variable winds, air temperatures, and tributary inflows of differing densities) makes accurate prediction a challenge. In the second half of the twentieth century, as scientists and engineers advanced our basic understanding of turbulent flows, computer models were developed to predict velocities, mixing, and resulting pollutant transport and fate in surface waters.  Today, computer models can account for the effects of inflows, winds, surface heating, complicated bed geometries, and temperature stratification on water velocities and turbulent mixing, but many frontiers remain.  One of these frontiers is flow through aquatic vegetation, which is ubiquitous in coastal and inland waters (e.g., Figure 1a,b).   The completed project produced a new computational model that predicts velocities, turbulent kinetic energy levels, and turbulent length scales, which are the most essential building blocks for predicting the spread of pollutants and nutrients in real aquatic vegetation.  Previously existing models did not incorporate the length scale of plant stems, predicting identical turbulence levels for a 1mm pond weed and a 1m tree trunk.  The new model incorporates the stem diameter. The new model was calibrated against a novel experimental data set, described in more detail below, from arrays of rigid cylinders having different diameters, and validated against an independent data set from submerged rigid cylinders and importantly, a new data set from live beds of Eurasian watermilfoil, an invasive species that is ubiquitous across the United States.  As mentioned above, extensive laboratory data sets were collected on both rigid cylinder arrays, a simple model for rigid aquatic vegetation (Figure 2a), and live highly flexible plant canopies (Figure 2b). Given the difficulties with the estimation of drag induced by vegetation, a quantity important to model development, a new approach, known as a drag plate, was developed to directly measure the drag from the canopy, by instrumenting a platform mounted flush with the flume's bed, visible in Figure 2, allowing the measurement of the drag as a function of the parameters of the plant canopy (number of stems per area, flow speed, plant type, etc), including a unique use of quantitative imaging for the determination of time-varying frontal area. The drag plate proved to be an accurate and dependable experimental device.

Strong gradients in the plant frontal area profile lead to a mixing layer around mid-depth, which has not been previously observed in emergent vegetation studies based on plant surrogates.  The developed model of flow through aquatic vegetation, tested on both the new data sets collected as part of this project and previous data sets of others, is more soundly based on the fundame...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
