<AbstractNarration>The general APS meeting, being held on April 20-25, 2006 in Dallas, offers graduate students whose work is represented by the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF) a unique opportunity to expand their physics horizons beyond their areas of specialization. Besides the opportunity to present their work to a broad audience of physicists, it also offers them the possibility to explore new areas of physics, particularly those that now touch the boundaries of particle physics such as astrophysics, nuclear physics and computational physics. For those that are advanced in their experimental or theoretical research it affords the opportunity to make contacts useful in securing their next positions, and to interact with their peers from across the country.   At the April 2006 APS meeting, students will be able to sample physics represented by the divisions of Astrophysics, Nuclear Physics, Particles and Fields, Physics of Beams, Plasma Physics, Computational Physics. In addition they will be able to partake in the activities in the Forums on Education, Physics and Society, International Affairs, the History of Physics and Graduate Student Affairs, as well as those of numerous topical groups.  Issues of particular interest to young physicists are being addressed by the YPP organization (Young Particle Physicists), which is usually represented at the APS meeting. A committee appointed by the chair of the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF) will make selection of about 30 students (in both experiment and theory). The size of the travel grants will be $300 for those attending and presenting results. The funds will be administered through Columbia University.</AbstractNarration>
