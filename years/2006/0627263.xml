<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for construction of a small (approximately 2500 sq.ft.) building at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) to be used for a number of field research and education-related activities.  Principal among these is the sorting and preparation of field samples prior to analysis. Soil, plant, insect, vertebrate, and aquatic samples would be sorted, processed and consolidated prior to analysis in analytical laboratories located about 2 Km. away in the main KBS academic building. In addition to this, the new building would also provide sample archive space and flexible classroom space for presentations to students, visiting environmental professionals, journalists and the public prior to visits to field research sites located within walking distance of the building. The structure will also be used to house computer and communications equipment for existing and new sensors to be deployed at an adjacent field site. KBS, which is the largest off-campus unit of Michigan State University, is one of a number of major field research stations in the U.S. that have had a long-term impact on ecological research and training. The Station has a significant record of research, education, and outreach in ecology and evolutionary biology, and is known as a premier field site for work in the successional plant communities, freshwater habitats, and agricultural landscapes that are typical of the upper U.S. Midwest. Research activity by resident and visiting researchers at KBS has grown over the past 15 years to the point that space resources are very stretched. The new building will enhance the ability of KBS to provide the best possible research, training, and outreach in ecology and evolutionary biology for resident and visiting researchers and students, while also providing a unique classroom/laboratory teaching facility for field-based classes, short-courses, workshops, and a major K-12 secondary science teacher trainingproject at KBS.</AbstractNarration>
