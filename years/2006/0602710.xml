<AbstractNarration>Through this project, the South Carolina  Advanced Technological Education Center of Excellence (SC ATE) is expanding teaching excellence in technician education by (a) providing a central, Web-based clearinghouse to increase participation in professional development in the ATE program and assist project personnel who deliver professional development; (b) expanding the number of educators using SC ATE strategies to increase the number of students in the advanced technological educational pipeline; and, (c) stimulating high school and community/technical college use of ATE curriculum models and best practices that attract students, reduce dropout rates, and positively impact technician education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: SC ATE models are based on educational research and focused on improving the success of pre-college and first-year college students in the educational pipeline leading to associate degrees in engineering technology and/or college transfer. The SC ATE curriculum model successfully integrates the study of physics, English/ communications, mathematics and technology in technician education. SC ATE work has been the subject of research university studies on topics such as development of effective curriculum, assessment of student learning, and exemplary teaching in undergraduate physics education. The SC ATE approach places emphasis on faculty development and content integration across disciplines. SC ATE innovations have proven effective in both high school and college programs where graduation rates, diversity, and employer satisfaction with graduates have all improved as a result of SC ATE-stimulated reform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: SC ATE curriculum models increase access to high-tech careers by improving success rates and retention as students finish high school and complete the first year of college study in engineering technology. SC ATE recruitment models increase participation and diversity in technician preparation programs. The Web site http://www.teachingtechnicians.org/ alerts more educators to the professional development opportunities provided by ATE projects. Technician educators benefit from sharing best practices in delivering professional development and participation in industry-provided, Web-delivered seminars. Twelve geographically and demographically diverse outreach and implementation partners expand the impact. Collaboration with the National Dropout Prevention Center broadens SC ATE Center outreach to high school educators, increase national and international publishing of SC ATE outcomes and best practices, and increase interactions among K-12 and two-year college educators who serve the nation's most diverse and at-risk students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
