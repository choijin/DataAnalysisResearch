<AbstractNarration>This project will examine how a part of the brain, called the prefrontal cortex, is&lt;br/&gt;involved in controlling behavior. The prefrontal cortex controls behavior much&lt;br/&gt;like a business executive controls a company. "Top-down" control signals are&lt;br/&gt;sent from the prefrontal cortex to lower brain areas, such as the motor cortex, to&lt;br/&gt;control when animals respond to external stimuli. These signals might convey&lt;br/&gt;information to the motor cortex about the expected timing of stimuli or might&lt;br/&gt;simply control the timing of motor action by sending a "go" signal to the motor&lt;br/&gt;cortex. To investigate this issue, recordings of neural activity will be made in&lt;br/&gt;the prefrontal and motor cortices as animals learn to time stimuli in a behavioral&lt;br/&gt;task. Anatomical methods will be used to determine if conversations between the&lt;br/&gt;prefrontal and motor cortices occur through a special part of the motor cortex,&lt;br/&gt;called the premotor cortex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This project will be one of the first to examine interactions between&lt;br/&gt;neurons in prefrontal and motor areas of the cerebral cortex by recording&lt;br/&gt;in the two areas simultaneously. This project is also unique in that interactions&lt;br/&gt;these areas are studied during learning. Finally, the project will be the first to resolve&lt;br/&gt;if the rodent premotor cortex receives information from the prefrontal cortex&lt;br/&gt;and thus might provide the first evidence that rodents have a cortical area that is&lt;br/&gt;analogous to the premotor cortex of higher animals, including human beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: All experimental protocols and procedures will be made available&lt;br/&gt;to the neuroscience community and the general public. A novel Linux distribution&lt;br/&gt;will be developed that contains programs needed to reproduce this research.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will support these efforts. Students in Yale's&lt;br/&gt;Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program will take part in&lt;br/&gt;the project and will be supervised by graduate students working in the PI's lab,&lt;br/&gt;who will acquire training that goes beyond normal graduate student research activities.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the PI has initiated a neuroscience program for young children&lt;br/&gt;through a local public library and is taking part in the Neuroscientist-Teacher&lt;br/&gt;Partner Program of the Society for Neuroscience. All materials from the library&lt;br/&gt;program and the PI's interactions with local teachers will be made available at&lt;br/&gt;http://spikelab.jbpierce.org.</AbstractNarration>
