<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on studying three cratonic regions using seismic body and surface waves.  The study areas include the Kaapvaal craton, the eastern part of the North America craton, and the Wyoming craton.  Regional seismic networks in these regions, such as the SASE array in southern Africa, the POLARIS network in southeastern Canada, and the USArray in Wyoming and Montana, provide abundant broadband seismic data for the studies.  The research components of the project are (1) to perform Rayleigh and Love wave inversions to determine 3-D shear-wave velocity, azimuthal anisotropy, and radial anisotropy structure in southern Africa, eastern North America, and the Wyoming craton, (2) to conduct forward modeling to determine endmember anisotropic models beneath southern Africa using shear-wave splitting and surface wave constraints, (3) to develop a joint inversion method for body and surface waves and apply it to the SASE and the POLARIS data sets.  High resolution seismic models constructed from this project will cast new light on properties of cratonic lithosphere and provide new insights into the dynamic process of continental cratons.  The inversion methods that are modified and developed in this project can be easily applied to seismic data from the USArray and other regional seismic arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another significant component of this CAREER development project is education.  The education activities include (1) offering a seismology workshop for students in the Physical Geology class each semester at the University of Houston, (2) developing a new seminar course and a website about continental cratons, (3) developing web-based modules about inversion and surface wave concepts, and (4) installing a seismograph on campus.  These activities will introduce earthquake seismology to a broad audience, help to recruit geophysics students, enhance the teaching and learning environment in geophysics at UH, and provide the community with a new web source about continental cratons.  The educational products will be made available online so that they can be widely used in the earth science community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The rocks on the continents can be several billion years old while the rocks beneath the oceans are less than 200 million years old.  How the old continents have survived through long geological times without being completely destroyed by a series of hotspots and continental rifting activities is a key question to be addressed in this project.  The research focused in three areas that contain ancient continent blocks, including southern Africa, the Grenville province in the Great Lakes region, and the Wyoming province in the northwestern United States.   Elastic waves generated by earthquakes and recorded by seismometers in the study areas are used to image seismic shear-wave velocities in the earthÆs interior to 200-300 km depths.  Seismic wave velocities are controlled by rocksÆ properties and can indicate the thermal, chemical, and mechanical status of the rocks.  Like the CT images of human bodies, the 3-D images from this study illustrate the structure in the earthÆs outmost layer, the crust and mantle lithosphere.  In southern Africa, the old continental core is generally characterized by high shear-wave velocity, indicating a cold temperature and high mechanical strength.  Relatively low velocity areas at the depths of 100 to 140 km correlate with the localities of rocks erupted at 65-104 million years ago, suggesting the strong continental block can be thermally and chemically disturbed at a local scale.  In the lower Great Lakes region in northeastern U.S. and southeast Canada, a high-velocity lid to ~150 km depth is imaged beneath most of the studied Grenville Province. One low-velocity anomaly of -4% appears at a failed rift in the northeast above 100 km depth, coinciding with the Great Meteor hotspot track and the high seismicity band, which can be interpreted as high temperature and high iron and/or volatile content related to the hotspot activity.  In the Wyoming region, the Yellowstone hotspot is imaged as a significant low-velocity anomaly while the velocity in the old Wyoming lithosphere is similar to the global average, not as high as found in southern Africa and the lower Great Lakes region. The old Wyoming lithosphere has probably been warmed up by the Yellowstone hotspot.  In addition, a low-velocity anomaly is imaged in the east of the province, which is separated from the hotspot by a high-velocity band.  The variation of low-high-low velocity in the area could be associated with the hot-cold-hot materials produced by small-scale, mantle convection.   These studies all evidence that the long-live continental lithosphere can be destroyed on a local or regional scale due to its interaction with the hotspot activities.
