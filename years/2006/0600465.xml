<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for a continuing program of research at the interface of string theory, supergravity and quantum field theories. Applications to cosmology and to strongly coupled QCD-like field theories, the basis of hadron structure and interactions, will also be pursued. The PI is an acknowlrdged leader in the field, with important results to his credit; an example is one of the first explicit calculations of correlators in the AdS/CFT correspondence. His postdoctoral fellow has done seminal technical work in string theory, and is one of the promising members of his generation.</AbstractNarration>
