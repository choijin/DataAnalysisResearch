<AbstractNarration>Sauer&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0639300&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Computational mathematics plays a critical role in the&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure of modern science.  To foster the development of&lt;br/&gt;computational and mathematical science skills,  in this CSUMS&lt;br/&gt;project the investigator and his colleagues establish an ongoing&lt;br/&gt;program of undergraduate research at George Mason University. &lt;br/&gt;The program involves selected talented undergraduates in several&lt;br/&gt;overlapping research opportunities that share a reliance on&lt;br/&gt;computational mathematics.  Undergraduate mathematics majors work&lt;br/&gt;with established professors on timely problems of computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics with immediate applications in materials science,&lt;br/&gt;astronomy, space weather, dynamical systems modeling, biophysics,&lt;br/&gt;neuroscience, financial mathematics, statistics, and fluid&lt;br/&gt;dynamics.  The five co-investigators on the project, from the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Department of&lt;br/&gt;Computational and Data Sciences, are joined by 20 other&lt;br/&gt;professors with experience in mentoring high-school and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students.  Each CSUMS cohort works together in a&lt;br/&gt;central knowledge core class, to rotate from year to year, and&lt;br/&gt;shortly thereafter specializes to one of several particular&lt;br/&gt;research projects related to the core.  Students are supervised&lt;br/&gt;by tenured/tenure track faculty and produce a poster and a&lt;br/&gt;written thesis describing their research by the end of the year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project addresses the important need to inspire and&lt;br/&gt;educate the next generation of computational scientists.  Due to&lt;br/&gt;the heavy reliance of contemporary science on computational&lt;br/&gt;modeling, experts in computational mathematics will be necessary&lt;br/&gt;for the advancement of science in the U.S.  This project assists&lt;br/&gt;in the creation of well-trained computational mathematicians by&lt;br/&gt;involving today's mathematics majors in significant applied&lt;br/&gt;research at the undergraduate level.  Research experiences make&lt;br/&gt;them more likely to succeed at the graduate level, in the&lt;br/&gt;completion of advanced degrees in computational areas.  The CSUMS&lt;br/&gt;program at George Mason University exposes the student to&lt;br/&gt;interesting, computationally accessible research problems in&lt;br/&gt;critical competitiveness areas, including materials science,&lt;br/&gt;computational fluid dynamics, financial mathematics, and several&lt;br/&gt;other areas in the biological and physical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the program educates students about the value of&lt;br/&gt;computational skills while they are still formulating their&lt;br/&gt;career directions.  The project is supported by the MPS Division&lt;br/&gt;of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;Activities, and the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
