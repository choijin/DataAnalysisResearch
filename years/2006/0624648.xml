<AbstractNarration>0624648&lt;br/&gt;Spiegelman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;26th International Conference on Mathematical Geophysics: Request&lt;br/&gt;for student travel support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marc Spiegelman (LDEO/Columbia), David Yuen (U. Minn) and Peter Fox (NCAR)&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to help support travel and meeting costs for students and&lt;br/&gt;early career scientists at U.S. institutions to the 26th International Conference on Mathematical&lt;br/&gt;Geophysics Coupling in Earth Systems: Solids, Fluids, Life to be held in&lt;br/&gt;June 4 - 8, 2006 near Tiberias, Israel on the Sea of Galilee. The conference website is&lt;br/&gt;http://www.weizmann.ac.il/conferences/CMG2006/.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits This conference brings together Earth scientists from across the disciplines&lt;br/&gt;with physicists, applied mathematicians, and computational scientists to discuss&lt;br/&gt;advances in mathematical and computational techniques for understanding properties and&lt;br/&gt;processes in the earth. This years meeting emphasizes understanding coupled systems&lt;br/&gt;such as coupled convective systems (ocean-atmosphere, mantle-lithosphere), coupled fluidsolid&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, interactions between the biosphere and geosphere, and in particular, interactions&lt;br/&gt;between humans and the earth through natural hazards. Many, if not all, of&lt;br/&gt;these problems require techniques for investigating, multi-scale, multi-physics problems&lt;br/&gt;and the meeting will emphasize both analytical and advanced computational methods for&lt;br/&gt;such problems. This meeting provides a single multi-disciplinary forum for the exchange&lt;br/&gt;of ideas and techniques across the disciplinary boundaries in the Earth Sciences. Funds&lt;br/&gt;are requested to support travel costs for 20 students, post-docs and early career scientists&lt;br/&gt;which is approximately half the number attending past meetings.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts This meeting is highly interdisciplinary and international in nature and&lt;br/&gt;provides an important opportunity for U.S. students and early-career scientists from across&lt;br/&gt;the earth sciences and applied mathematics to interact with senior scientists in a small informal&lt;br/&gt;setting. This year there will also be an increased emphasis on mathematical aspects&lt;br/&gt;of natural hazards in an attempt to understand how to merge fundamental knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;earth processes with risk management and societal needs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
