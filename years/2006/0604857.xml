<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0604857&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Ralf Spatzier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed lies at the interface of dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;and differential geometry.  Its principal goal is the&lt;br/&gt;investigation of the dynamical and geometric structures of&lt;br/&gt;"higher rank" systems.  Such systems appear naturally in&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems, geometry and even other seemingly quite&lt;br/&gt;differnt areas such as number theory.  The investigator will&lt;br/&gt;study rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and&lt;br/&gt;semisimple Lie groups and their lattices with the ultimate goal&lt;br/&gt;of classifying such systems under suitable geometric or dynamical&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses.  In particular, he will study higher rank hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;abelian actions, and actions by semisimple groups and their&lt;br/&gt;lattices preserving affine and geometric structures.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator will also investigate rigidity properties of actions&lt;br/&gt;of discrete groups in rank one semisimple Lie groups.  In&lt;br/&gt;addition, he will analyze Riemannian manifolds (especially higher&lt;br/&gt;rank ones) and their geodesic flows.  Geometric, dynamical and&lt;br/&gt;group theoretic tools will be used in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively young fields&lt;br/&gt;that investigate the evolution of a physical or mathematical&lt;br/&gt;system over time (e.g. turbulence in a fluid flow).  New ideas&lt;br/&gt;and concepts from dynamics such as chaos and fractals have&lt;br/&gt;changed our perception of the world fundamentally.  Dynamics and&lt;br/&gt;ergodic theory provide the mathematical tools and analysis for&lt;br/&gt;these investigations.  Dynamical systems have had a major impact&lt;br/&gt;on the sciences and engineering.  Symbolic dynamics for instance&lt;br/&gt;has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for&lt;br/&gt;computer science.  Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used&lt;br/&gt;as far afield as cell biology and meteorology.  Geometry is one&lt;br/&gt;of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally studies&lt;br/&gt;curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their&lt;br/&gt;shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now&lt;br/&gt;studied for its close ties with physics and other sciences and&lt;br/&gt;applied areas (computer vision e.g.) as well as internal&lt;br/&gt;aesthetic reasons.  Geometry and dynamics are closely related as&lt;br/&gt;some important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and&lt;br/&gt;geometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems.  One&lt;br/&gt;main goal of this project studies when two dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;commute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes&lt;br/&gt;brought on by the other.  Important examples of such systems&lt;br/&gt;arise from geometry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
