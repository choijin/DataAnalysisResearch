<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) project is to demonstrate a novel nanotube-array based lithography for deposition of molecules and polymers. Conical nanotubes embedded in a polymer matrix will be used as nanopens for the deposition of molecules onto flat surfaces. The deposition of molecules can be easily controlled by the sign and magnitude of the applied potential between an electrode in the nanotubes and an electrode immersed in a bath on the surface. Unlike some passive deposition systems such as AFM-based deposition of molecules, this deposition is an active deposition system because it can control the deposition of molecules and polymers by modulation of applied electric field. Many hundreds to thousands of nanotubes in a polymer matrix can be easily prepared; therefore, it is possible to produce massively parallel nanopens inexpensively in the laboratory without use of a clean room. With this method, it is also possible to deposit nanoparticles (including semi-conducting quantum dots, polymeric, metallic and magnetic particles) on various substrates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main advantage of this system over existing technologies is the combination of rapid, inexpensive and massively-parallel controlled deposition of molecules and nanoparticles on surfaces.  This work involves the research and training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students.  The work provides an excellent environment for students to conduct interdisciplinary research in the nanoscience field.  The students will learn a wide range of new scientific concepts and techniques that will help them prepare for careers after graduation.  By its nature, the combined research and education initiatives of this project will help the US to maintain its lead in hi-tech materials processing and manufacturing and will have significant impact in areas including material science and engineering, electronics, alternative energy sources, biology and medicine.</AbstractNarration>
