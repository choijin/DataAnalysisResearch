    <AbstractNarration>Stein's method is a remarkable and largely unexplored&lt;br/&gt; technique for proving approximation and limit theorems in&lt;br/&gt; probability, and the investigator hopes to develop versions of&lt;br/&gt; it which can be used to solve problems of interest to&lt;br/&gt; researchers in algebra, probability, and statistics. More&lt;br/&gt; precisely, there are five specific problems of interest the&lt;br/&gt; investigator would like to solve. The first problem is to use&lt;br/&gt; Stein's method to prove approximations to the Tracy-Widom&lt;br/&gt; distribution (whose merit lies in its applications to random&lt;br/&gt; matrix theory, tiling problems, percolation, queuing theory,&lt;br/&gt; and much else). The second problem is to continue the&lt;br/&gt; investigator's work on Stein's method and the spectrum of&lt;br/&gt; random walks. The third problem is to use Stein's method to&lt;br/&gt; prove approximations to the semicircle distribution (the free&lt;br/&gt; probability analog of the normal distribution). The fourth&lt;br/&gt; problem is to use Stein's method to bound convergence rates of&lt;br/&gt; Markov chains, building on ideas of Diaconis. The fifth problem is&lt;br/&gt; to prove chi-squared approximation for contingency tables with&lt;br/&gt; fixed row and column sums, which would be quite valuable because&lt;br/&gt; such approximations are frequently used in statistical work even&lt;br/&gt; though their accuracy is poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In making decisions of public policy, it is important&lt;br/&gt; that one draws correct conclusions from the data available. A&lt;br/&gt; drawback to many of the statistical methods applied today is that&lt;br/&gt; the accuracy of the conclusions is unclear. As one example, in&lt;br/&gt; determining whether there is gender bias in the promotion of&lt;br/&gt; employees, it is common to use a statistical test called the&lt;br/&gt; chi-squared test. As a second example, work on DNA sequences of&lt;br/&gt; interest to biotechnology and health uses Poisson approximations&lt;br/&gt; from probability theory. As a third example, in physics and&lt;br/&gt; chemistry one uses Markov chain methods to test theoretical&lt;br/&gt; models. These methods are routinely applied so it is important to&lt;br/&gt; quantify their validity. A remarkable technique, introduced by Charles&lt;br/&gt; Stein at Stanford, offers hope of better quantifying the accuracy&lt;br/&gt; of such procedures. Stein's method has proven successful in&lt;br/&gt; applications to DNA sequencing, but the technique is largely&lt;br/&gt; unexplored. The investigator plans to extend the scope and&lt;br/&gt; applicability of this method. As a final goal, the investigator&lt;br/&gt; plans to study the use of Stein's method in Markov chain theory,&lt;br/&gt; which as mentioned above, is crucial to drawing reliable&lt;br/&gt; conclusions from computer simulations.</AbstractNarration>
