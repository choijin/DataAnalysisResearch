<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight undergraduate students will be provided with an enjoyable and productive research experience in the area of experimental field biology over a 10-week period in May through July. Research activities will be centered at Sam Houston State University's 100-ha field station, the Center for Biological Field Studies (CBFS). The CBFS is adjacent to the Sam Houston National Forest and is located 11 km from campus.  The station represents several habitats of east Texas and is traversed by Harmon and Wynne Creeks. Students will live in modern, apartment-style dormitories, on the Sam Houston State University campus. Students will gain confidence in their abilities as scientists through planning, conducting and being responsible for their own research project. There will be many opportunities to interact with faculty, graduate students and other REU students through weekly seminars, field trips and social gatherings. Weekly seminars will include information on how to conduct research and discussions of important issues in science. Students will work closely with faculty mentors that specialize in field biology and will have their choice of research projects from among a variety of disciplines in ecology and evolutionary biology. Students will present their research in oral, poster and manuscript forms. This presentation experience will provide students with the encouragement and confidence to present their research findings at conferences and to publish research findings with their mentors. The program is particularly oriented toward recruiting students from traditionally underrepresented groups in science as well as students from institutions without research opportunities. The goal is to foster an interest and enthusiasm for pursuing graduate studies in biology and careers in research.
