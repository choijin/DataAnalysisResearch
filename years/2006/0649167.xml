    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Institute for Biomolecular Sciences (IBiS) at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse (UW-L) will host 10 students in a 10-week REU program. Students who are currently sophomores or juniors from groups underrepresented in science or from small colleges or two-year colleges are particularly encouraged to apply. A distinctive feature of the IBiS REU will be the opportunity to work side-by-side with faculty who not only run vibrant research programs but are also committed to excellence in undergraduate teaching. Students will become part of UW-L's IBiS program which unites faculty and students from the departments of Biology, Chemistry and Microbiology. Students will have opportunities to learn and apply approaches in many fields including biochemistry, bioinformatics, cell biology, classical and molecular genetics, advanced microscopy, molecular modeling, and synthetic organic chemistry. Students will develop and conduct an independent research project in collaboration with their faculty mentor. In addition to this immersion in lab research, students will participate in weekly hands-on workshops designed to develop their abilities as a scientist. In these workshops, students will explore issues in research ethics, improve skills in data analysis and presentation, learn how to read primary literature, and develop skills in scientific communication including writing, oral presentations, and poster presentations. Other sessions will focus on choosing and gaining admission to graduate school and careers in biomolecular science. Participants will receive a stipend, campus housing, and a campus meal plan. The beautiful setting of UW-L in the 7 Rivers Region will provide ample opportunities to build camaraderie through social events.
