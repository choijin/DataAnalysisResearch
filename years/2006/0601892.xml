<AbstractNarration>Technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many solids are heterogeneous on the half to one nanometer scale and are composed of disparate building blocks, layers, or frameworks containing pores or channels.  Zeolites and mesoporous materials represent one such group and many others feature a strongly bonded or geometrically continuous "host" confining "guest" species. This project addresses the common energetic features of such confinement in unconventional frameworks containing Germanium, Phosphorous, and transition metals in clathrates such as silica clathrasils and Zintl-type intermetallic semiconductors. The materials have applications as catalysts, ion exchangers, thermoelectrics, and optical materials. They are important in the environmental transport of heavy metals and radionuclides. The unique Thermochemistry Facility welcomes collaborations and is active in educating students and postdoctoral scholars in applying thermodynamics to their own work.  Calorimetry will provide the core of special topics courses, often with a hands-on component. The PI will host an international conference on high temperature materials chemistry. The research group is diverse in gender and ethnic, cultural and scientific background, and the PI is a role model as a successful senior woman scientist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many solids are composed of disparate building blocks, layers, or frameworks containing chemically reactive pores or channels.  They feature a strongly bonded or geometrically continuous "host" confining "guest" species. By measuring the stability of these materials through advanced calorimetric techniques which measure the heat effects associated with structural and chemical changes in the solids, this project will advance both fundamental knowledge and applications of these materials. The materials have applications as catalysts, ion exchangers, thermoelectrics, and optical materials, and they are important in the environmental transport of heavy metals and radionuclides.
