<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0604874&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Aleksey Zinger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of Gromov-Witten invariants plays a prominent role in&lt;br/&gt;symplectic topology, enumerative algebraic geometry, and string&lt;br/&gt;theory.  Via Gromov-Witten theory, string theorists have made&lt;br/&gt;completely unexpected predictions concerning counts of complex&lt;br/&gt;(holomorphic) curves in algebraic manifolds. Some of these&lt;br/&gt;predictions have been verified mathematically, but most have&lt;br/&gt;not. Many connections between Gromov-Witten theory and&lt;br/&gt;enumerative geometry have been discovered independently of string&lt;br/&gt;theory as well. However, many others remain to be found. The most&lt;br/&gt;fundamental object in the Gromov-Witten theory is the moduli&lt;br/&gt;space of (pseudo-) holomorphic maps.  The PI has developed an&lt;br/&gt;approach for studying its local structure using analytic&lt;br/&gt;techniques of symplectic topology and a separate topological&lt;br/&gt;approach for recovering global information from the local data.&lt;br/&gt;Combined together, the two approaches have led to a variety of&lt;br/&gt;results, in enumerative geometry and in symplectic topology, for&lt;br/&gt;counts of curves of low genus, primarily zero and one. Among them&lt;br/&gt;is a geometric relation between genus-one invariants of a&lt;br/&gt;complete intersection and those of the ambient projective&lt;br/&gt;space. One objective of this project is to verify the&lt;br/&gt;long-standing mirror symmetry conjecture for counts of genus-one&lt;br/&gt;curves in the quintic threefold, using this geometric&lt;br/&gt;relation. Another objective is to apply the results to counting&lt;br/&gt;genus-one curves in projective varieties.  However, the primary&lt;br/&gt;objective is to extend the detailed description of the moduli&lt;br/&gt;space of genus-one maps already obtained to higher-genus cases,&lt;br/&gt;especially genus two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is potentially far&lt;br/&gt;ranging. Its aim is to advance the fundamental understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the Gromov-Witten theory, which in turn should lead to new&lt;br/&gt;applications in symplectic topology and enumerative&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Furthermore, it should open a way for testing a number&lt;br/&gt;of mathematical predictions of string theory. If some of these&lt;br/&gt;predictions were shown to fail, string theory would require at&lt;br/&gt;least some modification, perhaps with implications for&lt;br/&gt;understanding physical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
