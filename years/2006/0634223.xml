<AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) Program entitled, "NUE: Nanomaterials Education for Engineering and Science Majors at the City College of New York," at City College of New York (CCNY) under the direction of Dr. Ilona Kretzschmar, aims to enhance the nanotechnology and nanomaterials education for undergraduate students at the CCNY through the development of a Nanotech Module, Nanotech Nuggets, and a nanomaterials course sequence with modular structure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposed curriculum initiative lies in the increase of nanoscience and nanotechnology education at CCNY.  The modular and interdisciplinary structure of the proposal is the first of its kind for CCNY, and its flexible structure is more amendable to its incorporation into a variety of diverse curricula. The two course sequence in nanomaterials will provide the basis for the development of an interdisciplinary "Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Concentration" at CCNY and possibly at the City University of New York wide level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal is that it also serves as an opportunity to bring together researchers interested in nanotechnology across the campus from the School of Engineering and the Division of Science and creates a collaborative atmosphere.  Further, CCNY serves a very diverse student body and the availability of the proposed nanomaterials course will expose the student body to nanotechnology.  An education in nanotechnology will put CCNY students at the frontiers of science and engineering, preparing them for graduate as well as industrial careers in many moder research areas.  Inclusion and collaboration with CCNY scientifc partners will alert industry to its highly qualified and diverse pool of students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) Program Solicitation (NSF 06-538), and is being co-funded by the Directorate for   for Engineering:   Division of  Chemical and Transport Systems (CTS) and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).</AbstractNarration>
