<AbstractNarration>This award supports an aerogeophysical study of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM), a Texas-sized mountain range buried beneath the ice sheets of East Antarctica. The project would perform a combined gravity, magnetics, and radar study to achieve a range of goals including: advancing our understanding of the origin and evolution of the polar ice sheets and subglacial lakes; defining the crustal architecture of East Antarctica, a key question in the earth's history; and locating the oldest ice in East Antarctica, which may ultimately help find ancient climate records. Virtually unexplored, the GSM represents the largest unstudied area of crustal uplift on earth. As well, the region is the starting point for growth of the Antarctic ice sheets. &lt;br/&gt;Because of these outstanding questions, the GSM has been identified by the international Antarctic science community as a research focus for the International Polar Year (2007-2009). In addition to this study, NSF is also supporting a seismological survey of the GSM under award number 0537371. Major international partners in the project include Germany, China, Australia, and the United Kingdom. For more information see IPY Project #67 at IPY.org. In terms of broader impacts, this project also supports postdoctoral and graduate student research, and various forms of outreach including a focus on groups underrepresented in the earth sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An International Polar Year (IPY) program to conduct an aerogeophysical survey of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains hidden under the central East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) was conducted during December 2008 and January 2009.  Part of the aerogeophysical survey was conducted from a Twin-Otter aircraft equipped with a Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) design Multi-Channel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder (MCoRDS)  ice penetrating radar.  Survey flights collected data along approximately 50,000 line-kilometers within the Gamburtsev Mountain province, generating ~ 12Tb of raw radar data.  These raw radar data were processed by CReSIS to generate data products that have provided the first comprehensive view of the Gamburtsev Mountains buried deep below the EAIS. These data products include ice sheet thickness over the mountains, internal layering within the ice sheet, and subglacial topography that shows the Gamburtsev Mountains to be a north-south trending mountain range dissected by a complex network of valleys.  Also discovered are several subglacial lakes. The ice-penetrating radar data products generated have helped enable the key discoveries made by this project, including: explaining the role of topography in the nucleation of continental ice sheets; understanding how tectonic processes control the formation, distribution, and stability of subglacial lakes; and identifying potential locations where the oldest Antarctic ice might be found.
