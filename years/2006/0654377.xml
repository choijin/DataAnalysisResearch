<AbstractNarration>One of the most vexing challenges of the 21st century is curbing the loss of biodiversity. All too often, however, disconnects between scientific disciplines, conservation institutions, and practical implementation hinder effective biodiversity conservation. This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program in Applied Biodiversity Science (ABS) at Texas A&amp;M University will achieve integration between biodiversity research and on-the-ground conservation. Three pillars support the program: 1) integrated research in social and biological sciences; 2) cross-disciplinary research and collaboration with conservation institutions and actors in the field; and 3) application of conservation theory to practice. Research teams of faculty mentors and students, in collaboration with international partners, will develop complementary dissertations related to two research themes: A) Ecological Functions and Biodiversity; and B) Communities and Governance. Research will be conducted in four regions in the Western Hemisphere: 1) USA and Mexico (transboundary); 2) Mesoamerica; 3) Western Amazon; and 4) Gran Chaco. The ABS-IGERT team consists of 20 professors from ten departments in five colleges, with an extensive network of international collaborators and former students working in conservation in each of the four study regions. Points of integration in the learning path include new courses in Applied Biodiversity Science, an Amazon Field School, Cross-cultural Leadership Training, and required internships at national and international institutions practicing biodiversity conservation. Complementary dissertation research will enable students to work together within and across study regions, collating theory and results to generate practical solutions to complex conservation problems. Graduates will be prepared to face the multidimensional challenges of global biodiversity loss and will emerge qualified to assume directorships and academic appointments. By producing scientists equipped to confront transboundary issues and the international biodiversity crisis, significant benefits will accrue to academic, NGO, and government agencies. The ABS-IGERT will lead to greater involvement of underrepresented groups in Applied Biodiversity Sciences; help build local capacity in the U.S.A. and Latin America; and directly contribute to biodiversity conservation. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

A total of 453 peer-reviewed publications, seven books, 47 book chapters, and 27 conference publications.      In addition to these specific outcomes, this project has resulted in broader impacts to science and society including:  * Greater involvement of underrepresented groups in Applied Biodiversity Sciences;  * Capacity-building of local counterpart scientists and institutions in host countries;  * More effective communication between biodiversity scientists and conservation practitioners;  * Long-term benefits for biodiversity conservation in the U.S.A. and Latin America.
