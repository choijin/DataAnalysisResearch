<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive approach to risk adjusted robust control,&lt;br/&gt;starting with the use of experimental data to obtain and validate a plant description and ending with a closed&lt;br/&gt;loop system that has a prescribed risk of violating the performance specifications. Its conceptual backbone&lt;br/&gt;is a combination of operator theoretic and stochastic tools that emphasizes both computational complexity&lt;br/&gt;and practicality of the results.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The conventional robust control framework developed in the past two decades has&lt;br/&gt;proved to be very successful in addressing robustness and performance issues in systems subject to unstructured&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty. This is also true, to a lesser extent, in the case of structured uncertainty, provided&lt;br/&gt;that the number of uncertainty blocks is small and the plant under consideration has moderate size, with the&lt;br/&gt;limiting factor here being the computational and scaling properties of the resulting optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;An additional limitation stems from the fact that these approaches take a worst case approach both to stability&lt;br/&gt;and performance. While a very strong case can be made for the former, in many cases an equally&lt;br/&gt;strong case can be made against the use of a worst case approach to performance, since it can lead to overly&lt;br/&gt;conservative systems. This proposal is motivated by the possibility (substantiated by the co PIs preliminary&lt;br/&gt;work) of addressing these issues through the use of a risk adjusted approach, where the designer is willing&lt;br/&gt;to trade off a preassigned risk of violating a performance specification in return for a reduction, often&lt;br/&gt;substantial, in both the complexity of the resulting controller and its conservatism. Advantages offered by&lt;br/&gt;the proposed framework over currently available techniques include the abilities to:&lt;br/&gt;a.- Systematically synthesize low complexity, practically implementable robust systems.&lt;br/&gt;b.- Lead to tractable problems, and in cases where the underlying problem is intrinsically hard, to&lt;br/&gt;provide for computationally tractable relaxations with risk adjusted certificates. Examples of these&lt;br/&gt;cases include model (in)validation under arbitrary uncertainty structures and fixer order controller&lt;br/&gt;synthesis, both beyond the ability of hitherto available methods.&lt;br/&gt;c.- Indicate the intrinsic limits of performance of the plant, making unavoidable design tradeoffs clear&lt;br/&gt;and allowing the control engineer to explicitly make these tradeoffs, without trial and error iterations,&lt;br/&gt;gracefully degrading performance when some of the requirements cannot be met.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In addition to advancing the current state of the art in control theory, the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will bring closer to being practical several technologies currently at the proof of concept stage. Examples&lt;br/&gt;of these include active vision applications to aware environments and communication networks with improved&lt;br/&gt;robustness and quality of service characteristics. Arguably one of the critical factors preventing the&lt;br/&gt;deployment of these technologies beyond controlled lab environments is the lack of robustness of the resulting&lt;br/&gt;systems. Addressing this fragility is beyond the ability of currently available robust control techniques&lt;br/&gt;due to their poor computational and scaling properties.&lt;br/&gt;Educational Impact: In addition to benefiting graduate education, we plan to incorporate results from this&lt;br/&gt;research in an undergraduate introductory robust control course, that will expose students at an earlier stage&lt;br/&gt;to the issues of robustness and computational complexity. Typically this is done at the graduate level, and&lt;br/&gt;thus undergraduate students are unaware of these ideas, although it could be argued that they are some of&lt;br/&gt;most powerful and better developed assets that our community has, with a potential that extend beyond&lt;br/&gt;pure control. Risk adjusted ideas provide an ideal vehicle to accomplish this initial exposure, eliminating&lt;br/&gt;the need to wait until students build the background in functional analysis required to tackle graduate level&lt;br/&gt;robust control courses.</AbstractNarration>
