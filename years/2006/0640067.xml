    <AbstractNarration>PI: Yu, Jaehyuk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: IOB-0640067&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Regulation of Asexual Development in Aspergillus &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large number of fungi (molds) produce spores as the main means of survival and propagation. In pathogenic fungi, these spores are also the primary agent for infection of plants, animals and humans. Despite the significant impact of fungal spores in everyday life, the mechanisms underlying the initiation and the completion of spore formation are largely unknown. To better understand the regulation of spore formation two genetic screens were carried out employing the model filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans and two key genes controlling sporulation were identified. Characterization of these genes revealed that the beginning and the end of asexual spore formation require balanced activities of various positive and negative regulators. The genetically programmed instruction for the regulation of spore formation may explain how a fungus governs vegetative growth and reproduction appropriately. In this project, genetic, molecular biological, genomic and biochemical studies will be carried out to further investigate the roles of these crucial regulatory genes and to better understand the mechanisms underlying formation and maturation of fungal spores. Results of this project will advance the understanding of the mechanisms controlling the novel and poorly understood asexual development in fungi. The project's broader impacts include using the model fungus A. nidulans as an effective and accessible system for teaching basic and difficult genetic concepts. In addition, understanding the mechanisms controlling spore formation in the model fungus will potentially lead to the development of new tools for controlling beneficial or detrimental activities of other industrially, medically or agriculturally important fungi.</AbstractNarration>
