    <AbstractNarration>The New York Academy of Sciences will present a two-day symposium, Teaching Evolution and the Nature of Science. This gathering will provide an unprecedented opportunity for exchange, networking, and future collaborations among leading scientists, high school science teachers, college faculty who teach science classes or train future science teachers, and state and local officials who are responsible for education policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will address the nature of scientific inquiry, the teaching of evolution as fundamental to modern biology, the difficulties currently encountered in this enterprise, and the scientific underpinnings that could provide support to counter the current challenges to evolutionary theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium was conceived as a means to discuss the state of knowledge in evolutionary science and to address the challenges posed by challengers of evolutionary theory to science education. Topics include: What is the evidence for evolution? How does understanding evolution play a role in comprehending modern biology? What are the responsibilities of our science educators and those who create scientific curricula?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will take place in New York. After the conference web sites will be established to provide information for science teachers around the country and to continue to support science education.</AbstractNarration>
