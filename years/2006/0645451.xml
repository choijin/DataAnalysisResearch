<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;To realize the promise of nanostructured materials for applications in information technology, medicine and energy, an atomic-level understanding of nanostructure properties is needed. This Faculty Early Career program focuses on nanoscience research, education and outreach at Ohio State University. Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to study metal nanoclusters and molecular wires which are potentially future building blocks for nanoscale devices. These microscopes have unique capabilities suitable for studying nanostructure properties as their size, shape, and local environment are varied on the atomic scale. This research is integrated with educational and outreach activities at Ohio State which target underrepresented undergraduates, high school students and the public. Classroom lectures, research demonstrations and outreach presentations are delivered to remote locations using web-based Access Grid videoconferencing tools. These efforts will improve participation and training of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;To realize the promise of nanostructured materials for applications in information technology, medicine and energy, an atomic-level understanding of nanostructure properties is needed. Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to study how quantum size effects, atomic structure and coupling to the local environment influence the electronic and optical properties of metal nanoclusters. These influences are systematically studied with atomic-resolution imaging, tunneling/optical spectroscopy and atom/molecule manipulation. Metal nanoclusters form atomically-precise contacts for studies of current flow through single molecules. This research is integrated with educational and outreach activities at Ohio State which target underrepresented undergraduates, high school students and the general public. Classroom lectures, research demonstrations and outreach presentations are delivered to remote locations using web-based Access Grid videoconferencing tools. These efforts will improve participation and training of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
