<AbstractNarration>The 2006 Gordon Research Conference is being held September 3-8, 2006 at Big Sky, Montana. The theme of this conference is the relationships between rock deformation processes and the spatial and temporal patterns that result. Presentations and poster sessions are examining: 1) the temporal aspects of rock deformation; 2) refined understanding of the ways processes and scales couple during deformation, leading to complex rheological behavior; and 3) improved characterization and interpretation of natural systems. Emphasis will be placed on exploring new directions for research. Participants include specialists in rock mechanics, earthquake mechanics, tectonics, petrology, and structural geology reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of the conference theme. The program includes significant time for participation by all conference participants to debate current problems and future research directions. The principal goal of this conference is not so much to assess or present what has already been accomplished, but rather to look towards the future and open up new research directions. The conference format is designed to involve established leaders, both men and women, in a range of disciplines, in discussion with all participants, and to inspire the postdoctoral scientists and graduate students who will carry the field forward.</AbstractNarration>
