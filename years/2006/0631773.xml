<AbstractNarration>This project consists of three interventions. The primary intervention will be the development of a GRITS "Traveling Roadshow" and companion website with supporting materials about gender bias, careers in STEM and best practices in STEM education. The second objective is to include a new focus on how science is done which will highlight women and minority scientists from Tennessee, the work that they do, and why they choose the science career path. Finally, the project will provide educators and parents in east and west Tennessee with assistance, knowledge, and materials on how to encourage middle and high school girls to explore STEM careers by planning and hosting a regional Expanding Your Horizons Conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT-- GRITS will advance knowledge and understanding on issues of STEM education and career opportunities for middle school and high school girls throughout Tennessee. GRITS will provide parents, teachers, and guidance counselors with new insights on how to encourage their daughters in STEM classes and careers.  Teachers will be given information on how to incorporate best practices in STEM in their classroom, reaching both girls and boys. This project brings together a GRITS "community" that will explore creative concepts to disseminate information about STEM careers in Tennessee where many girls do not attend college or even graduate from high school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT-- GRITS promotes a greater understanding of STEM careers for girls and women as well as supports teaching, training and learning about opportunities in STEM education and careers. Girls in urban areas as well as in rural Tennessee and in Appalachia will be encouraged to participate in GRITS. This project will build a community of Girls Raised in Tennessee Science. The GRITS community will grow even further through regional EYH conferences. A major impact will be the enhancement of scientific and technological understanding among the participants, including teachers.</AbstractNarration>
