<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal consists of two main sections.  The first section deals&lt;br/&gt;with coarse geometry and geometric group theory. The PI (together with&lt;br/&gt;D. Fisher and K. Whyte) has recently developed a new technique,&lt;br/&gt;"coarse differentiation", which can be viewed as a sort of&lt;br/&gt;differentiability substitute for quasi-isometries. Of course,&lt;br/&gt;conventional derivatives do not make sense for such maps, since they&lt;br/&gt;are not even defined on small scales; instead we must go to larger and&lt;br/&gt;larger scales. Using this technique, we were able to resolve three&lt;br/&gt;longstanding open problems in the field, namely proving the&lt;br/&gt;quasi-isometric rigidity of the three-dimensional solvable group Sol,&lt;br/&gt;exhibiting a transitive graph which is not quasi-isometric to any&lt;br/&gt;Cayley graph, and showing that the two state and the three state&lt;br/&gt;lamplighter groups are not quasi-isometric. We list some other&lt;br/&gt;potential applications of the method, many of which are to problems&lt;br/&gt;which seemed completely out of reach a year ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second section concerns the interrelated analytic study of&lt;br/&gt;billiards in rational polygons, moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic&lt;br/&gt;differentials, and the dynamics of the SL(2,R) action on these moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces. The PI also proposes to study related questions about the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of these spaces, such as their volumes and their SL(2,R)&lt;br/&gt;invariant submanifolds. In particular, the PI has found by numerical&lt;br/&gt;experiment some polygons which seem to have competely unexpected&lt;br/&gt;properties, and proposes to study them further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the coarse geometry in the the first part of the proposal has&lt;br/&gt;unexpected connections to computer science, in particular the&lt;br/&gt;existence of efficient algorithms for finding ways to disconnect a&lt;br/&gt;graph by cutting as few edges as possible. In fact, one of our&lt;br/&gt;proposed problems is taken from this field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rational billiard, which is the main subject of study in the&lt;br/&gt;second part of the proposal is important in particular for the&lt;br/&gt;following reason: Some natural phenomena are "chaotic"&lt;br/&gt;(i.e. unpredictable). These are often studied by statistical&lt;br/&gt;methods. Others are "integrable" (i.e. predictable and regular). Other&lt;br/&gt;phenomena fit somewhere in between. The polygonal billiard is one of&lt;br/&gt;the simplest known models of intermediate behavior. As such it has&lt;br/&gt;been studied extensively in physics as well, in particular in&lt;br/&gt;connection to "quantum chaos".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
