<AbstractNarration>SES-0623233&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ulla Larson&lt;br/&gt;Co PI: Megan Klein&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Maryland-College Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tanzania, seven percent of the adult population is HIV positive.  Trust and commitment play a complex but critical role in AID prevention.  These are likely prerequisites for long-term fidelity. Of the ABC's of AIDS prevention, abstain, be faithful, use condoms, fidelity remains relatively under-researched. For HIV prevention to better address couples, the role of trust and commitment must be better understood. Through collaboration with Population Services International (PSI), this research aims to improve the understanding of the role of trust and commitment in AIDS prevention for a key target group: individuals aged 15 to 24. Prior to PSI's annual household-based survey in Tanzania, in-depth interviews will be conducted to explore local understandings of how individuals develop trust in and commitment to their partners and how trust and commitment affect condom use and fidelity. The household-based survey will provide the empirical basis for quantifying the relationship between trust, commitment, and AIDS prevention. After the survey, a second round of in-depth interviews will clarify the relationships found in the survey data. The broader impacts of this research is that it contributes to our understanding of the role of trust and commitment in producing positive health outcomes, in particular AIDS prevention planning.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
