<AbstractNarration>This research project is grounded in an approach designed from over 20 years of&lt;br/&gt;research on Cognitively Guided Instruction (Carpenter, Fennema, Franke, Levi, &amp;&lt;br/&gt;Empson, 1999). In addition, we will leverage recent work on formative assessment based&lt;br/&gt;on the same cognitive model that drives (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998a). The formative&lt;br/&gt;assessment based on the work of Black and Wiliam along with CGI are two of the only&lt;br/&gt;programs of research to link professional development to teacher learning to student&lt;br/&gt;learning (Black &amp; William, 2004; Wilson &amp; Berne, 1999). We also leverage multilevel&lt;br/&gt;theory to understand how these programs can effect change on teacher knowledge,&lt;br/&gt;classroom practice, and student learning. Rather than understanding one level, this project&lt;br/&gt;looks to understand how professional development influences the complex interactions&lt;br/&gt;within classrooms and schools that produce important learning gains in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in a high need inner city school district that will&lt;br/&gt;serve as a national model for the evaluation of professional development in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;education. The project will also inform efforts to understand the instructional practices&lt;br/&gt;that promote substantive learning in mathematics for Latino students and English&lt;br/&gt;language learners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project is grounded in an approach designed from over 20 years of research on Cognitively Guided Instruction (Carpenter, Fennema, Franke, Levi, &amp; Empson, 1999), which is intended to empower teachers with an understanding of the nuances of childrenÃ†s mathematical thinking. Specifically this project studied how professional development influences the complex interactions within classrooms and schools that produce important learning gains in mathematics as a result of teacher professional development.  What learning gains are produced for under-represented students in whole number and algebraic thinking and more broadly strands 1, 3 and 5 of the Arizona State Standards?  For whole number arithmetic, students in grades K-2 increased significantly in their performance (between .63 and .89 standard deviations). However, we saw considerable variability by classroom in these results (from .2 to 1.4 standard deviation differences). Regarding broader mathematical skills, the effect sizes varied from .16 to .37.  What learning gains are produced in teacher content knowledge for teaching mathematics?  Much like student gains teacher gains in mathematical knowledge for teaching were small but were also stable over time (ranging from 0.18-0.29). Differences between classes were small ranging from 10%-15%. Instead, variation among students within classrooms was extremely, corroborating research showing that students range widely in development in mathematics at any one time.   In what ways to teachers change their classroom practices in line with both the Arizona State standards (2003) and the standards set out by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1989/2000)?  Teacher practices changed over time becoming more student-focused. This is somewhat confounding by years of PD for those who stayed in the school system, the instructional support of the graduate research assistants in their classes. As importantly, we found in our quantitative study that there was an interaction effect between teacher classroom management capacity and their capacity to support studentsÃ† mathematical development. Our data strongly suggest that teachersÃ† mathematical knowledge for teaching was only partially utilized during their planning process, the delivery of mathematics instruction, and subsequent reflection. Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching was utilized differently by teachers with high student gains than those with low student gains.  How are the learning gains for teachers related to student gains?   Results showed that overall teaching practice did not change weekly although teachersÃ† emotional support for their students improved over time. Furthermore, a statistically significant relationship between teacher knowledge and teaching practice was not found. Lastly, English Language Learners have significantly lower initial status in mathematics achievement than non-ELLs, and their growth rate was slower than native speakers.
