<AbstractNarration>The coupling of ions and neutrals in the auroral thermosphere, during both active and quite auroral conditions is studied using three Fabry-Perot interferometers and the AMISR incoherent scatter radar.  Three components (zonal, meridional, and vertical) of the thermospheric neutral wind are isolated in a mesoscale cell approximately 50km - 75km in size, within the AMISR coverage pattern.  The goal is to quantify the mesoscale response to joule heating in the auroral thermosphere, and to evaluate ion-neutral coupling in the vicinity of auroral arcs.  The measurements also provide the divergence and vorticity of the neutral wind.  The physics-based Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GTIM) is applied with enhanced spatial resolution and measurement constraint to evaluate the importance of various forcing functions, including Lorentz drag, particle precipitation energy deposition, and Joule heating.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Above about 60 miles in the sky, the air becomes so thin that it cannot support lift of an airplane.  Indeed, the highest airplanes (like SpaceShipOne and the X-15) travelled to just about 60 miles or so.  Most people consider this the start of space.  The international space station (ISS) orbits at around 200 miles in the air.  It is still inside the atmosphere, though.  The ISS has to be raised in orbit every once in a while because atmospheric drag causes it to slow down a bit and it loses altitude.  Just like in the troposphere, there are fronts in the upper atmosphere.  The pressure goes up and down.  In the thermosphere (i.e., the upper atmosphere where satellites orbit), we talk about density, but it is quite similar to pressure.  In the upper atmosphere, the weather is actually strongly controlled by the aurora - when there is a lot of aurora, the density goes up.  When there is not very much aurora, the density goes down.  We, as scientists try to model the response of the thermosphere to the aurora.  It is quite difficult because the aurora is very complex - it has arcs that only a few miles across, but it stretches for well over 1000 miles.  Most of the models that we use have very large grid cells, so they can't capture what the aurora is doing on small scales.  This causes us no end of problems.  The grant that I received from the National Science Foundation was aimed at looking at how the wind in the upper atmosphere responds to the aurora.  This is important because the wind blows around the density.  So, if we want to understand the density and how satellites are slowed down by the atmosphere, we need to better understand the wind.  This grant allowed us to use a large weather model to look at how rapid changes in the aurora caused large winds to develop.   We learned some surprising things in this grant, such as - when you run the models with higher and higher resolution and are able to capture more of the aurora, the amount of energy going into the atmosphere increased, but the temperature did not increase by as much.  We learned that what happens is that as you add more energy at small scales, the temperature goes up a little bit, but the wind starts to blow much harder.  So, instead of thermal energy of the atmosphere, the energy of the aurora goes into kinetic energy of the wind.  That was very unexpected.  With the completion of this grant, we will better be able to tell how the aurora affects the temperature and winds in the upper atmosphere.
