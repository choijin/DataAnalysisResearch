<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0626690&lt;br/&gt;PI: Tilman Wolf&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;br/&gt;Title: NeTS-FIND: Service-Centric End-to-end Abstractions in Network Architectures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next-generation network architectures are governed by the need for flexibility. Heterogeneous end-systems, novel communication abstractions, and security and manageability challenges require networks to provide a broad range of services that go beyond the simple store-and-forward capabilities of today's Internet. This project introduces new abstractions for information transfer and data services in the network to overcome the constraints of current network design. The explicit separation of communication and processing allows the composition of a variety of information transfer patterns that expand the capabilities of the network to meet its next-generation challenges. The goal is to develop communication abstractions based on the transfer of information rather than the process of sending data. Handling data representation, transfer, and storage of information is performed by services implemented on routers. The objectives and expected results of this project are: first, we develop and prototype suitable abstractions that meet the needs of next-generation network architectures; second, we explore how services can be specified by end-systems, mapped to resources inside the network, and controlled during their operation; third, we apply the proposed abstractions to explore novel networking paradigms that go beyond store-and-forward networking. We also seek to integrate the ideas developed in this project with other efforts to develop a next-generation Internet and thus enhance the overall impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
