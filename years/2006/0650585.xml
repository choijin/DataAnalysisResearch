    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research is to develop an integrated micro-electromechanical systems&lt;br/&gt;(MEMS)-based miniature microphone system for directional sensing of sound based on a&lt;br/&gt;biological model. The design follows that used by the Ormia ochracea fly. This fly employs a&lt;br/&gt;unique coupled mechanical bar system operating at the critical damping to extract the direction&lt;br/&gt;of sound. The Ormia ochracea fly has ears separated by only about 500um yet has remarkable&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity to direction of sound. The separation of the fly's ears is too small for it to sense the&lt;br/&gt;direction of a sound source if it uses traditional human techniques such as the difference in&lt;br/&gt;arrival times or the amplitudes of sound at each ear. The fly's unique ear structure helps to&lt;br/&gt;magnify the difference in amplitude as well as phase of the sound wave.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed MEMS device uses two flapping wings which are textured to achieve critical&lt;br/&gt;damping to mimic the fly's ear system. An initial finite element simulation shows the proposed&lt;br/&gt;design replicates the directional sound response of the fly's biological system. The&lt;br/&gt;displacement of the membrane due to typical sound pressure is on the scale of nanometers and&lt;br/&gt;requires a highly sensitive position measurement approach to determine the amplitude. Such a&lt;br/&gt;position sensitivity can be achieved by optical means using two diffraction gratings at the edges&lt;br/&gt;of the wings. A diffractive interferometer using fixed and moving gratings can provide subnanometer&lt;br/&gt;displacement sensitivity. By placing the gratings at the outer edges of the&lt;br/&gt;membrane, a maximum displacement can be achieved. This translates into angular resolution&lt;br/&gt;of the direction of sound to about 1-2 degrees. The proposed tasks include the design,&lt;br/&gt;fabrication and characterization of the sensor performance.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The proposed research provides an opportunity to combine the advances in&lt;br/&gt;MEMS technology with unique functionalities of biological systems to develop a novel sound&lt;br/&gt;sensor. The findings of the research will enable us to understand how the fly's hearing system&lt;br/&gt;achieves such a remarkable directional sensitivity and to fabricate an electromechanical&lt;br/&gt;equivalents. A set of such sensors can be used for pinpointing explosions by monitoring the&lt;br/&gt;direction of sound which can be deployed using micro air vehicles. In addition, a network of&lt;br/&gt;these sensors can be used for unattended movement monitoring. Other applications of such&lt;br/&gt;sensors include use in low noise hearing aids. The principal investigators and research staff&lt;br/&gt;have extensive experience in MEMS design, fabrication and testing. The Naval Postgraduate&lt;br/&gt;School has state-of-the-art MEMS design facilities as well as an anechoic chamber with&lt;br/&gt;experienced staff for acoustic testing.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This research will accomplish two goals. First, it will significantly expand&lt;br/&gt;current knowledge on the inner workings of the Ormia ochracea fly's unique hearing system and&lt;br/&gt;on the design and fabrication of electromechanical equivalent for applications involving&lt;br/&gt;pinpointing sources of sound. Second, the graduate students participating in this investigation&lt;br/&gt;will gain valuable knowledge and experience in this multidisciplinary area of research. The&lt;br/&gt;Naval Postgraduate School also provides research opportunities for promising local high school&lt;br/&gt;students. Current plans are to include high school students in the research, where possible, in&lt;br/&gt;order to enhance their skills in mathematics and science and to encourage them to pursue&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, science, and engineering in higher education. The findings of the research will be&lt;br/&gt;published in scholarly journals and conferences.</AbstractNarration>
