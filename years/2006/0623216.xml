<AbstractNarration>This award funds an International Research Experience for Students project focused on mercury-related environmental issues in South Africa. The regional and global redistribution of mercury (Hg) from anthropogenically-derived sources, and its subsequent conversion to methylmercury, has impacted wildlife populations worldwide and has resulted in human health concerns. There is little knowledge of Hg and methylmercury distribution within South Africa, where the impacts could be large due to its industrialization, heavy reliance on coal for large-scale energy production, and extensive residential use of coal. This project is therefore designed to examine these phenomena and to enable US students to participate in a large-scale research project and to develop related individual projects, thus furthering their research and education experience. Four students will visit South Africa in each of three years, working in study areas in the greater Cape Town and the industrialized Gauteng/Mapumalanga regions to measure mercury concentration and speciation in air, water, soils, and biota. The US team of students and faculty will collaborate with Drs. Joy Leaner at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Dr. Andrew Crouch at Stellenbosch Univeristy and Roseanne Diab at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will provide a unique opportunity for young scientists to be involved in a global environmental problem while fostering links with scientists in a rapidly developing African nation. The study will facilitate the transfer of knowledge and expertise and enhance collaborations between scientists in both countries, but with a strong focus on the education and mentoring of young US scientists, especially women and minority students. The work will provide the backbone of the students' undergraduate and graduate research theses, and will be published in the peer-reviewed literature and made available through the web and other mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
