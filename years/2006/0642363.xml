<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: The objective of the project is to better understand the role of grain boundary character on dynamic recrystallization, both locally and globally. This goal will be achieved through a combination of experiments and computer simulations. By using both approaches, the experimental work will provide input to the computer models, while the simulations will be used to better understand the experimentally observed behavior and to suggest future experimental designs. The experimental approach will rely on the use of high temperature mechanical testing and electron backscatter diffraction, which can map grain orientations and grain boundary misorientations over large areas of the sample. The first set of experiments will investigate how the nucleation of dynamically recrystallized grains at a triple junction depends on several factors including the stacking fault energy of the material, the character of the boundaries that comprise the triple junction, and the geometry of the triple junction. In the second set of experiments grain boundary engineering processing techniques will be used to create samples with varying fractions of low-energy twin boundaries. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) experiments will then be performed to determine the effect of increasing the fraction of twin boundaries on DRX, especially with regard to the flow stress, peak strain and kinetics of recrystallization. The experimental work will focus on nickel, nickel-based superalloys, and stainless steel alloys, as components made from these materials often undergo hot working during processing during which the microstructural evolution is determined by DRX. The computer simulations will complement the experimental work and be used to better understand the experimental observations. An object-oriented finite element code called OOF will be used to study the stress concentration that arises at triple junctions as a function of crystallographic and geometric conditions and which plays a role in the nucleation of recrystallized grains at these points in the microstructure. Monte Carlo simulations will be used to study the effects of changing the fraction of twin boundaries on the kinetics and flow behavior in DRX. NON-TECHNICAL: The work is to be carried out at Boise State University, which is located in the Treasure Valley, nationally recognized as a high tech and entrepreneurial center. The PI is in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at Boise State University, which currently offers bachelors and masters degrees, with a Ph.D. program planned for 2008. The research program of the PI will play a critical role in the success of the MSE program, which offers a high quality education to students in Idaho, many of whom are first-generation college students. Education and outreach plans involve the development of web-based reusable learning objects as a novel approach to disseminating the results of the research to a broad audience. These stand-alone, electronic lessons will be available online and can be used independently by high school or college teachers or integrated into existing courses. In addition, the topic of dynamic recrystallization and the experimental capabilities developed here will be included in the PI's undergraduate course, Mechanical Behavior of Materials. Finally, the PI will continue to recruit and mentor a diverse group of students. In order to recruit women and under-represented minorities, the PI will continue to participate in programs such as the Women in Technical Careers lunch series at local high schools, e-Girls, a summer program for high school girls, and the Miranda Adelante Workshop for Hispanic high school students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to investigate the processing-structure-properties relationship in metals during a phenomenon known as dynamic recrystallization (DRX).  When certain metals &ndash; including copper, nickel, and some stainless steels &ndash; undergo deformation at high temperatures, their structures are dynamically evolving in ways that change how the ongoing deformation occurs.  The combination of applied load and high temperature makes the evolution more complicated because each factor alone would reverse the changes to the material brought on by the other.  Dynamic recrystallization can occur during hot working of metals in processes such as hot rolling, extrusion, or forging.  Due to the industrial importance of these methods, it is important to understand how the initial structure of the material affects the resulting deformation behavior.   The main variable that we sought to change through processing was the distribution of grain boundary types.  Within a crystalline material, different regions (or "grains") have different atomic alignments.  Where two grains meet (a "grain boundary"), there is often a lot of a lot of disorder at the atomic level.  As the atomic spacing and arrangements arenÆt in the most favored condition, the internal energy of the material is higher than it otherwise would be.  It is possible, however, for the alignment of the two grains to be such that the grain boundaryÆs atomic configuration has a much better fit; these grain boundaries are called "special" and have lower energies compared to "general" boundaries.  In the present project, we used thermomechanical processing to produce materials with varying populations of special boundaries and then evaluated the high temperature deformation behavior in light of the grain boundary distribution.   In both experiments and computer simulations, we found that the initial special boundary fraction changes the overall deformation behavior of the material.  When there is a higher initial population of special boundaries, the onset of DRX is delayed.  In other words, more deformation is required to achieve the same number of nucleated strain-free grains.  In this way, increasing the special boundary fraction is similar to increasing the overall grain size.  As nucleation is most likely to occur along general boundaries, both increasing the special boundary fraction and increasing the grain size act to reduce the number of available nucleation sites.  We have also been able to identify the likelihood of nuclei forming along certain grain boundary types and at different grain boundary junctions.  In materials processing techniques which rely on DRX to reduce the overall flow stress of a material, it would be beneficial, therefore, to minimize the fraction of special boundaries present.   Over the life of the project, three graduate students and nine undergraduate students contributed to the work.  Of the undergraduate students, four were women.  The undergraduate students were afforded particularly unique opportunities to conduct research, where they were leading much of the experimental work and developing extraordinary technical skills along the way.  Six of the undergraduates involved spent more than two years working on the project (four spent more than three years); they developed the processing techniques used, learned how to test the strength of materials at high temperatures, and developed the routines for characterizing and analyzing the materials after testing.  Of the three graduate students involved, two are currently working as engineers in Boise-area technology companies.  Of the nine undergraduate students, two have gone on to earn M.S. degrees and are now employed, two more are working toward Ph.D. degrees in materials science (at Georgia Tech and Washington State University), three are working in materials engineering positions, and the final two will graduate in May 2014.   The impacts of the project have extended beyond the s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
