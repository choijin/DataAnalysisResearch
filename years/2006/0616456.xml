<AbstractNarration>Public Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0616456&lt;br/&gt;A NSF-Workshop on Cyber-based Combustion Science&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Arnaud Trouve, University of Maryland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this workshop is in the area of cyberinfrastructure, defined herein as a set of base technologies for computation, storage, communication, and data processing services. The cyberinfrastructure has become a reality in recent years; its development has already impacted many, if not all, scientific fields; and there is a growing consensus that future progress in computer and network technologies, combined with the dissemination of these technologies on a global scale, will lead to further revolutionary changes in scientific methods and organizations. Mindful of this new world of possibilities, NSF is actively promoting the development of a nationwide strategy to build a cyberinfrastructure in support of 21st century scientific discovery and engineering innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this wider ongoing effort, a 1.5-day workshop will be held to bring together the U.S. combustion science community to meet the following objectives: (1) have combustion scientists participate in the development of a nation-wide strategy to build a cyberinfrastructure; (2) identify specific cyberinfrastructure capabilities and needs in support of combustion science and combustion engineering education; (3) develop a community-wide vision for combustion science, that is consistent with, building upon, and embracing the revolutionary changes in methods and organizations that will accompany the new cyberinfrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take place on April 19-20, 2006, at NSF headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. Participants will include representatives of the combustion science community from academia, national laboratories, government agencies, and industry.  The workshop will consist of a mix of invited talks and breakout group discussion sessions. Three breakout sessions, possibly emphasizing the following themes, are planned: (1) sub-community-specific, cyber-based combustion science applications (i.e. high-performance computing, chemical libraries, sensor-driven modeling, etc); (2) community-wide, cyber-based combustion science applications (i.e. web-enabled collaboratories); and (3) cyber-based combustion education (i.e. curriculum and work force opportunities and needs for academia, government and industry, in a cyber-based environment).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the workshop will be in the articulation of a community-wide vision for a new combustion science and education strategy empowered by the emerging cyberinfrastructure.  This vision will include a list of recommendations to NSF to facilitate the adaptation of combustion science to the new cyber-induced transformations in scientific methods and organizations. Deliverables include a website and a final report.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
