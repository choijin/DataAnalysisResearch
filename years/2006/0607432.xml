<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this research is a better understanding of the nature of the Galactic&lt;br/&gt;microquasar SS 433 - an object which possesses many of the characteristics of a quasar&lt;br/&gt;such as a hot disk, a strong disk wind, evidence for a compact object, and relativistic jets.&lt;br/&gt;However, because it is a Galactic object, it is closer and is not obscured by a galaxy of&lt;br/&gt;material surrounding it, thereby providing an opportunity to explore important but poorly&lt;br/&gt;understood physics. Specific goals here are to identify the nature of the compact object in&lt;br/&gt;SS 433 (is it a neutron star or black hole?), to examine the structure and origin of the&lt;br/&gt;relativistic jets, and to accurately assess the system's evolutionary state. This will be&lt;br/&gt;accomplished through a multiwavelength campaign using simultaneous radio imaging&lt;br/&gt;and optical plus x-ray spectroscopy to study the disk and jet in SS 433. Through this, the&lt;br/&gt;motion of the relativistic jet will be followed, the time and distance scale of jet&lt;br/&gt;fragmentation determined, the disappearance of optical jet lines monitored, and the true&lt;br/&gt;space velocities of the jets will be found. In addition, optical spectroscopy will be used to&lt;br/&gt;study the jet, mass donor star, and the compact object. It is expected that the mass of the&lt;br/&gt;donor star will be conclusively determined as well as its evolutionary state. Finally, the&lt;br/&gt;observations should also provide the mass of the compact object thereby revealing&lt;br/&gt;whether it is a black hole or a neutron star.&lt;br/&gt;Through this award, the research infrastructure at Valparaiso will be improved in part by&lt;br/&gt;creating new student research opportunities. Participating students will serve as research&lt;br/&gt;assistants during ten weeks each summer and will be trained in aspects of astronomical&lt;br/&gt;data acquisition, reduction, and analysis. They will have the opportunity to present their&lt;br/&gt;results at national conferences and to co-author referred journal articles. Dr. Hillwig's&lt;br/&gt;work in SS 433 has also been featured in many popular articles and he will continue to&lt;br/&gt;pursue public dissemination of the results in the press and through public talks.</AbstractNarration>
