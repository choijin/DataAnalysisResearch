<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The objective of this research is detailed study of the electrical properties of nonlinear carbon nanotube (CNT) structures, such as nanojunctions and nanocoils, for developing new types of nanoelectronic components including electrical switches, logic elements, frequency mixers, and nanoscale inductors. The approach incorporates: (1) controlled synthesis of CNT morphologies such as Y-junctions and nanohelices through chemical vapor deposition processes, (2) structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, (3) investigation of growth mechanisms and defects, (4) study of the nanoscale electrical conduction mechanisms &amp; device modeling, (5) layout of electrical and optoelectronic circuits, and (6) exploring the limits of device operation through high frequency measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The proposed research into novel CNT structures may well usher in a new nanoelectronics technology through the use of new physical pronciples and the development of new classes of devices.  Unique electrical properties have been predicted for nonlinear CNT structures, based on asymmetry at the junction regions, and portend a new generation of nanoelectronics. In preliminary measurements, novel inverting/switching behavior in three-terminal Y-junctions, and nanoscale inductive behavior in the nanocoils/helices was observed which forms the foundation for the work   It could result into many new applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact would be: (a) the fabrication of nanoscale devices with the advantages of low power consumption, radiation hardness, and reduced heat dissipation over conventional silicon based technologies, relevant to civilian and military applications, and (b) outreach to the community in terms of conveying the excitement of novel science and device paradigms, through freshman seminars and new courses, along with undergraduate and graduate student mentoring. By working with Preuss High School, a student and teacher exchange program will be developed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
