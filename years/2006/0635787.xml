<AbstractNarration>While summertime convective precipitation significantly contributes to the total growing season rainfall, it ranks among the least known components in the hydrologic budget of mid-latitude temperate regions. This uncertainty stems from its high space-time variability and its sensitivity to the interplay between complex eco-physiological, hydrologic, and turbulent transport mechanisms at land-atmosphere interface. To progress on the description of convective rainfall fields, both prognostic and diagnostic measures of the interrelationship between convective rainfall and land-surface forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H1) Prognostic: For given synoptic conditions, the integrated time history of surface water and energy fluxes, which is related to soil/vegetation characteristics, controls the timing and onset of summertime convective precipitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H2) Diagnostic: The subsequent space-time development of convective precipitation activity, while inherently related to the internal meteorological dynamics acting at several scales, is partly controlled by a limited set of scales that can be fingerprinted from land-surface heterogeneity. This 'fingerprinting' can be statistically derived by analyzing the joint probability distributions of spatial precipitation and few land surface characteristics (e.g., topographic and land-cover indices) for different soil moisture antecedent conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These two hypotheses are addressed by evaluating the land-surface processes that trigger convective rainfall using low-dimensional dynamical models of the atmospheric boundary layer. The space-time structure of the convective storms is analyzed in relation to soil moisture, topography, and land cover using mutual information measures in both space and wavelet domains. The North Carolina Piedmont area is selected as a case study because of its frequent convective rainfall patterns, its summertime hydro-climatic regime, its resemblance to large parts of the Southeastern U.S. in trends of urban and agricultural land-use change, and its economic importance as the primary timberland producer in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: While current stochastic hydrologic models directly address the inherent unpredictability of rainfall formation and evolution by employing highly sophisticated space-time random processes, there exists a 'deficit' in their physical formulation. On the other hand, convective precipitation models used in meteorology are primarily based on fundamental and mechanistic approaches but are routinely confronted with numerous limitations in the description of dynamically important processes at their sub-grid scale such as cloud microphysics, closure models for complex turbulent fluctuations, and approximate description of land-surface processes. The proposed approach will bridge this basic knowledge gap by offering an objective statistical characterization of the surface forcing on convective precipitation and providing benchmark measures for both hydrologic models and regional meteorological predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The proposed work will diagnose the impact of land use change on triggers of convective precipitation and its contribution to overall summertime precipitation for assessment of water resources, drought risk, and timberland viability.  The proposal will train a graduate student in problems lying at the interface between hydrology, meteorology, eco-physiology, and information theory.</AbstractNarration>
