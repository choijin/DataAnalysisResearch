<AbstractNarration>Two Colleges of California Polytechnic State University, Engineering and Science &amp; Mathematics, are collaborating to allow academically talented undergraduate and graduate students to benefit from a project-based, interdisciplinary learning curriculum as part of Cal Poly's Honors Program. A total of 88 scholarships are being awarded to honors students with financial need who are majoring in S-STEM programs. Cal Poly, with the largest graduating class of engineering baccalaureate degrees in the Western US, is a highly ranked, severely over-subscribed public school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the project's primary objectives is to increase the numbers and accelerate the rate of students graduating with engineering, math and science degrees. These scholarships make it possible for financially needy students to remain in college and explore academically relevant special projects and studies. A key element of this program is the interdisciplinary nature of the team-based projects that serve to motivate and encourage students to excel in their S-STEM fields. Three separate offices on campus are providing significant support for the assessment and evaluation of the project activities. Program methodology and results are being described in papers and presentations at academic forums. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits of this program go beyond the financial support provided to the 88 scholarship recipients. Many more S-STEM students benefit directly and indirectly from the continuation of projects, industry ties established through these projects, and mentoring from scholarship awardees. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
