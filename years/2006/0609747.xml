    <AbstractNarration>In this project the PI develops algorithms and software to&lt;br/&gt;facilitate the removal of Gibbs oscillations from the approximation&lt;br/&gt;of discontinuous data by high order approximation methods such as&lt;br/&gt;pseudospectral and radial basis function methods. Current&lt;br/&gt;postprocessing techniques are somewhat successful in one dimension.&lt;br/&gt;However, the most powerful methods require that the exact location&lt;br/&gt;of the discontinuities (edges) be pinpointed and that function&lt;br/&gt;dependent parameters be specified in each piecewise smooth region.&lt;br/&gt;One focus of the work is in developing Edge Detection free (EDF)&lt;br/&gt;postprocessing methods. The EDF methods are easily extended to&lt;br/&gt;multiple dimensions and in some case to irregularly shaped domains.&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is a "black box" postprocessing algorithm. A&lt;br/&gt;second focus of the work is in software development. A Matlab&lt;br/&gt;toolbox which implements both classical and modern postprocessing&lt;br/&gt;methods will be developed. The software will include a user friendly&lt;br/&gt;graphical user interface facilitating use by the wider community.&lt;br/&gt;The software will be used on benchmark problems to provide&lt;br/&gt;illustration of the methods for both the specialist and&lt;br/&gt;nonspecialist and to stimulate further research. The software is&lt;br/&gt;designed to make it relatively easy for students to learn about the&lt;br/&gt;methods and for researchers to apply them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most accurate methods available to numerically approximate&lt;br/&gt;the equations that govern natural phenomena, postprocessing methods&lt;br/&gt;are vital. This is because many phenomena in nature are inherently&lt;br/&gt;discontinuous, and numerical methods do not perform well when the&lt;br/&gt;solution to the governing equations are discontinuous. The&lt;br/&gt;discontinuities result in the methods producing solutions with&lt;br/&gt;nonphysical oscillations that do not truly represent the phenomena&lt;br/&gt;being modeled. Areas for which postprocessing methods are important&lt;br/&gt;include: gas dynamics, weather forecasting, earthquake and tsunami&lt;br/&gt;prediction, astrophysical modeling, multiphase fluid flow, the flow&lt;br/&gt;of glaciers, the propagation of waves in elastic solids, the&lt;br/&gt;separation of chemical species, aerodynamics, detonation waves,&lt;br/&gt;acoustics, etc.</AbstractNarration>
