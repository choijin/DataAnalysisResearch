<AbstractNarration>The assembly of the ribosome, a complex macromolecular machine consisting of at least 54 proteins and 3 RNA molecules in bacteria, is a poorly understood process in all cells. GTPases have critical roles in ribosome biogenesis in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, yet their molecular functions are not well characterized. The overall objective of the research project outlined in the career development plan is to elucidate how an essential GTPase, RbgA, participates in the biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit in Bacillus subtilis. RbgA is widely conserved in most bacteria and eukaryotes and therefore the results obtained regarding RbgA function will be applicable to ribosome biogenesis in many systems. The plethora of genetic tools, the ability to reconstitute bacterial ribosome biogenesis in vitro, and the fact that Gram positive bacteria utilize alternative pathways in the synthesis and biogenesis of the ribosome make B. subtilis an ideal system to study RbgA function. A model in which RbgA facilitates the final maturation of a 45S intermediate into a mature 50S subunit by regulating the insertion of ribosomal protein L16 has been developed. To test this working model and the hypothesis that RbgA serves as a factor with dual functions in ribosome assembly and subunit coupling the following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Structural and functional characterization of a novel large ribosomal subunit intermediate. 2. In vitro and in vivo analysis of the function of RbgA in ribosome biogenesis. The intellectual merit of this research is a better understanding of how non-ribosomal factors influence ribosome biogenesis in vivo. As part of the educational component of the career development plan a hands-on undergraduate laboratory course highlighting the use of various genomic technologies is being developed. This course will supplement an existing undergraduate lecture and bioinformatics course already being taught by Dr. Britton. The broader impacts of this research project are: 1. The preparation of undergraduates for graduate school or jobs in biotechnology by giving them a solid foundation in genomics, 2. The integration of current research projects into the undergraduate laboratory course, 3. The training of undergraduates and graduate students in the laboratory, and 4. Elucidating how ribosomes are formed in vivo, a process important for bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic cells.</AbstractNarration>

The main function of ribosomes, which are found in all cells, is to convert messenger RNA into proteins.  How these complex structures are assembled in vivo is not understood and emerging evidence suggests that ribosome assembly plays critical roles in development, growth, and when not functioning properly can lead to disease.  We have studied the role of an essential protein, named RbgA, in the assembly of ribosomes in bacteria.  Since RbgA is conserved from bacteria to man, the studies in bacteria will have implications for ribosome assembly in all forms of life.  The intellectual merit of this work lies in the fact that we have, for the first time, probed the structure and function of a ribosome subunit intermediate that is on pathway to become a functional subunit.  Key findings include the fact that key functional parts of the large ribosomal subunits remain inactive until very late in the assembly process and the novel use of quantitative mass spectrometry to probe ribosome biogenesis in vivo.  The data suggest that RbgA controls the insertion of a key ribosomal protein, L16, which results in a large conformational change in the maturing ribosome.  The structure of the immature large subunit intermediate and mature large subunit are shown in the attached figure.    The broader impacts during the award period are two-fold.  First, two genomics courses were developed during the award period.  Both of the classes incorporated real-time research projects into the classroom.   In Microbial Genomics 433 students participated in the annotation of a number of newly sequenced micriobal genomes as well as annotating scientific literature on genes and proteins into the UniProt database.  In the Advanced Microbial Genomics 434 laboratory, students were able to use emerging genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing and DNA microarrays to probe gene function and microbial community structure.  For their final project they were asked to pose their own research question and use one or more of the genomic technologies in class to answer this question.  Students then orally presented their work at a research forum at the end of the course.  I found that students initally are challenged by having to come up with their own questions but that in the end they really have a sense of accomplishment after executing the work and presenting the results.  Even if the experiment turns out to be unsuccessful.  My experience with these courses as part of the CAREER award has strengthened my resolve to keep primary research questions in the classroom and to challenge students to come up with their own ideas.  This type of hands on experience is critical for training the next generation of scientists.  Second, two PhD students and a postdoctoral associate were trained during this award.  All three are planning on continuing their careers in academic science.         Last Modified: 08/14/2013       Submitted by: Robert A Britton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
