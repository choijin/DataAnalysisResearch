<AbstractNarration>Design determines how a system is decomposed into a logical collection of modules.  Modular structure enables both division of labor and division of knowledge, which determine how independently developers can work.  Good design can also lower the cost of entry for a new developer, and simplify maintenance and evolutionary activities.  For open source projects, whose life-blood is voluntary labor, design can affect the ability of a project to attract and retain new developers.  These effects are longitudinal (over time), systemic (both over artifact and social structure), and nondeterministic.  Open source systems inherently expose comprehensive, time-series narratives of artifact evolution, social structure, and artifact quality.  The longitudinal effects of design, therefore, are observable in open source projects.  In this project, the PI will conduct an interdisciplinary study of the longitudinal (long-term) effects of design in a range of different open source projects.  He will gather data, analyze it, and test hypotheses in order to shed light on issues such as, how the design of the artifact influenced the structure and activities of the project team, as well as the final product.  Previous research suggests that design impacts, over time, both the qualities of the product, the social structure used in its construction, and even the appeal of the endeavor to volunteers.  The study of these effects involves analysis of a large and varied collection of time-series data, and the use of models and theories from a variety of disciplines, some outside of software engineering, which the PI and his interdisciplinary team are well equipped to handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Open source and commercial software systems have an enormous impact on the economy and society.  An improved understanding of the social processes underlying open source systems could help improve software engineering practice, and lead to faster, easier development of better software systems, in both open source and commercial settings.  The PI will apply his findings in practice, not just in his regular classrooms, but also through the establishment of a new initiative in partnership with a local high school intended to excite minority and female students about becoming more involved in software development, and in particular in open source communities.</AbstractNarration>
