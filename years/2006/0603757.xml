<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to realize the participation of Purdue University Calumet's particle physics program in collider experiments, using close-by Fermilab as a base. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is a particle physicist recently appointed to the faculty at Purdue University/Calumet, Indiana. The Department of Chemistry &amp; Physics at Purdue University Calumet provides baccalaureate degrees in chemistry and physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She has been working on the D0 and CMS experiments. An ambitious education/outreach program would form a key component of these research efforts at Calumet. This program would involve undergraduate students from several disciplines, engineers, science teachers and high school students in this research at the cutting edge of technology and frontiers of science. In this ambitious research program, students will participate in discoveries of new elementary particles and the fundamental forces of nature, as well as participate in the state-of-the art silicon technology in particle detection, combined with equally sophisticated readout electronics. Innovative techniques of radiation hard technology will enhance the life span of detectors used in outer space research and improve bio-sensing miniature devices for medical applications. Further, by training students in advanced computing techniques and their use in scientific discoveries, she will be able to disseminate the appreciation for the state-of-the-art machinery of modern science and promote the transfer of the acquired knowledge to the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
