<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Yinlun Huang and Helen Lou &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Wayne State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0647113&lt;br/&gt;Title: First International Symposium on Sustainable Chemical Product and Process Engineering, Guangzhou, China, 2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The production of fine and commodity chemicals and their utilization in making consumer products are critical in today's society.  Facing tremendous pressures due to economic globalization, global warming, natural resource depletion, etc., the chemical and allied industries are exploring various mechanisms for industrial sustainability.  To address these issues, the First International Symposium on Sustainable Chemical Product and Process Engineering will be held at South China University of Technology, in Guangzhou, China, Sept. 25-28, 2007.  This symposium will also include a workshop focusing on catalyzing international collaborations in sustainable chemical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the symposium is reflected in its objectives: (i) to share knowledge for achieving genuine economic, environmental and social sustainability, (ii) to assess state-of-the-art green chemical product and process engineering, and (iii) to bridge the gap between research and development, strengthening the linkage between academia and industry. The workshop will provide a forum for (i) discussing research directions for the chemical and allied industries to move towards sustainability and educational approaches for the integration of industrial sustainability into the chemical engineering curriculum, and (ii) exploring opportunities for international collaboration between U.S. researchers/educators and those in Asia and Europe and other continents in these technical areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project will be twofold: (i) to facilitate US researchers/educators to exchange knowledge with colleagues in Asian countries, and (ii) to help the US delegates identify international collaboration opportunities in the research and education of sustainable chemical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
