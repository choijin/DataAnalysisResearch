<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of young scientists in a FASEB Summer Research Conference entitled "Mechanisms in Plant Development" to be held August 5-9th, 2006 in Saxtons River, VT. This conference, held every other year for the past twenty years, is the only regularly held meeting devoted specifically to the topic of plant development and as such serves as an important forum for exchange of information and ideas in this field. The unique scientific focus of this conference and its small size (~100 participants) will facilitate the distillation of new themes and principles emerging from recent work in the plant development field, as well as fostering new acquaintances and collaborations between participants with shared interests. Participants will include principal investigators, postdocs, and Ph.D. students. The conference program includes eight sessions, each devoted to a topic of broad significance. Invited speakers were chosen based also on the high quality and interest value of their ongoing research. In addition, speaker choices were made to create a balance between male and female speakers, between U.S. and international scientists, and between junior, intermediate and senior investigators. By including in the program daily poster sessions and 10-12 short talks by meeting participants (chosen based on their submitted abstracts), the meeting will provide opportunities for all participants to present their work to an international audience. The meeting schedule will also allow ample time for informal discussions among participants. This unique conference will provide participants with a current overview of a fundamental and rapidly moving area of plant biology, and is expected to generate new directions for future research. Participation in this meeting by early career investigators, Ph.D. students and postdocs will help advance the careers of these individuals.</AbstractNarration>
