<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0604735&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Michael T. Anderson, Claude R. LeBrun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working both jointly and independently, Anderson and LeBrun plan&lt;br/&gt;to study a cluster of related geometric structures on&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional manifolds. Their research program focuses on&lt;br/&gt;relationships linking geometry to topological structures,&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, and theoretical physics. Jointly, Anderson&lt;br/&gt;and LeBrun plan to study the existence and moduli of canonical&lt;br/&gt;metrics on 4-manifolds, with an emphasis on the Kahler case.&lt;br/&gt;Anderson will also investigate problems concerning asympotically&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic Einstein metrics, the AdS/CFT correspondence, and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical aspects of general relativity. LeBrun will also&lt;br/&gt;study the curvature of 4-manifolds, Seiberg-Witten theory,&lt;br/&gt;extremal Kahler metrics, and the twistor geometry of holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;disks.  The proposed work is expected to have a significant&lt;br/&gt;broader impact on two different fronts. On one hand, it will&lt;br/&gt;promote further interactions between researchers in differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry and those in topology, in algebraic geometry and,&lt;br/&gt;especially, in theoretical physics.  The project also has a&lt;br/&gt;significant educational impact at the graduate level, in that&lt;br/&gt;Anderson and LeBrun oversee a large number of graduate students&lt;br/&gt;who are working on problems closely tied to the research&lt;br/&gt;proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relations between mathematics and theoretical physics are at&lt;br/&gt;the forefront of research in both disciplines, leading on both&lt;br/&gt;sides to remarkable new insights and developments. Much of the&lt;br/&gt;planned research activity takes its inspiration from current&lt;br/&gt;attempts to bridge the gulf between Einstein's theory of&lt;br/&gt;space-time geometry and gravitation (General Relativity), and the&lt;br/&gt;quantum field theories that are currently understood to govern&lt;br/&gt;the other fundamental forces of nature. Some of the research has&lt;br/&gt;to do with the problem of describing all possible geometries of&lt;br/&gt;4-dimensional universes governed by Einstein's gravitational&lt;br/&gt;equations.  One of the toolsto be used involves use of the&lt;br/&gt;Seiberg-Witten equations, which originated in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;short-range nuclear interactions, but nonetheless turn out to&lt;br/&gt;play a major role in our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;large-scalestructure of many 4-dimensional universes. Other&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the planned research are closely linked to&lt;br/&gt;developments in string theory, which is arguably the most&lt;br/&gt;promising and exciting avenue of research in theoretical physics,&lt;br/&gt;and which has had a profound and multi-faceted impact on recent&lt;br/&gt;progress in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
