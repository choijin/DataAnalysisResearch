<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to conduct research on quasirandom analogues of&lt;br/&gt;discrete random systems, both as tools for simulation problems&lt;br/&gt;and as objects of study in their own right.  Quasirandom simulation&lt;br/&gt;schemes often are just as fast as random simulations schemes, and &lt;br/&gt;when applied to estimation problems typically give smaller error.  &lt;br/&gt;The PI's research will study such schemes, and will explore new ways &lt;br/&gt;of removing the ``noise'' from random systems while retaining key &lt;br/&gt;features of their average-case behavior, building on earlier work &lt;br/&gt;by the PI, Lionel Levine, Yuval Peres, Josh Cooper, and Joel Spencer, &lt;br/&gt;among others.  The resulting non-random systems exhibit startling &lt;br/&gt;symmetry and unexpected structure that call out for explanation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current technology depends heavily on simulation, and many existing&lt;br/&gt;methods of simulation make use of randomness, whether or not the&lt;br/&gt;system being simulated has a random element to it.  This ``Monte&lt;br/&gt;Carlo Method'' has had huge success in the past century.  My work&lt;br/&gt;will explore the notion that in many cases, what makes Monte Carlo&lt;br/&gt;work is not randomness per se but certain regularities that are &lt;br/&gt;consequences of randomness.  By bringing these regularities to&lt;br/&gt;the fore and jettisoning randomness itself, one should be able to&lt;br/&gt;devise general methods of simulation that are more accurate.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
