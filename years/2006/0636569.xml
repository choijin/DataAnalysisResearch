    <AbstractNarration>ECS-0636569&lt;br/&gt;H. Pishro-Nik, University of Massachusetts Amherst &lt;br/&gt;ECS-0636463&lt;br/&gt;A. Adibi, GA Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Georgia Institute of Technology propose an optimal hybrid free space optical/radio frequency point-to-point communication system that simultaneously achieves maximum availability and maximum efficiency. The concept behind the proposed communication algorithms and architectures is cooperation between the two heterogeneous channels. At the heart of the proposed hybrid system is a hybrid-channel coding scheme that makes it possible to maintain a high data throughput, even under extreme atmospheric conditions. The code nearly achieves the highest theoretically possible rates and obviates the need for switching between two different links or networks (i.e., wireless and optical). Such communication system provides a unique solution when a high throughput with an extremely low outage probability is crucial. The research includes three strongly coupled components: 1. Analysis, design, and implementation of a new rate-adaptive coding mechanism to optimally use the parallel channels; 2. Design and implementation of a receiver using a Si-photodiode and including a dual-channel clock and data recovery mechanism based on hybrid-channel coding; 3. Design and implementation of hologram-based low-cost fast-adaptation rate adaptive optics for the optical link. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The hybrid-channel codes developed in this research can be used in other applications where data is communicated over several heterogeneous channels, such as hybrid fiber/radio frequency in nuclear plants. The hardware will be useful in communication systems and also for medical imagery. Hybrid communication system is a viable solution to the last-mile connectivity problem. Disaster recovery and providing low-cost high-speed Internet access to rural areas are among its major benefits to society. The proposed multidisciplinary research provides an excellent opportunity to expose graduate students to the multifaceted problems of a hybrid communication system. Students will solve challenging theoretical problems in the areas of coding, integrated circuits, and optics and they will be trained to use sophisticated design and experimentation tools. Undergraduate students will be involved in implementing prototypes using commercially available hardware and software.</AbstractNarration>
