<AbstractNarration>The  goal  of this  project is  to help  users ask complicated&lt;br/&gt;questions   over  unstructured   text  and   get  as   results  a&lt;br/&gt;concrete  answer and  not simply  pointers  to more  data, as  is&lt;br/&gt;currently   the   practice  with   general  search  engines.  The&lt;br/&gt;research  examines how  to  execute  efficiently complex  queries&lt;br/&gt;over  multiple web  sources and  how to  estimate the  quality of&lt;br/&gt;the   returned   results.  The  research  also  examines  how  to&lt;br/&gt;execute  queries over  subjective,  sentiment  data by  examining&lt;br/&gt;the   economic  context   in  which   the  stated   opinions  are&lt;br/&gt;evaluated.  The  experimental  research  is  strongly  linked  to&lt;br/&gt;the educational  goals   of  the   project that  include,  among&lt;br/&gt;others,   modernization  of   the  undergraduate   curriculum  on&lt;br/&gt;databases   to   include  the   latest  trends  in  database  and&lt;br/&gt;information  systems and the introduction of a graduate course on&lt;br/&gt;the  transformative  role of  search technologies in business and&lt;br/&gt;society.  The  results of this project will give the power&lt;br/&gt;and  tools  to the  users to  quickly process  the vast amount of&lt;br/&gt;available  data  on the  web and  get back  answers (and not more&lt;br/&gt;documents  or  data to process).  The systems built as&lt;br/&gt;part  of this project, together with the related data sets, will&lt;br/&gt;be  available  on the project website (http://text-centric-db.stern.nyu.edu/),  &lt;br/&gt;allowing everyone to evaluate complex queries over web data&lt;br/&gt;and build novel applications on top of the built infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
