<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  &lt;br/&gt;In the Fall of 2005, the College introduced a new program, a chemistry major with a forensic science concentration.  The expected outcomes for educating undergraduates in this program include an updated inquiry-based academic curriculum with an emphasis on improved analytical and critical thinking skills, as well as a greater exposure to and understanding of procedures and instrumentation in forensic laboratories. The ultimate goals of the College are to offer a bachelor's degree that is accredited by the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and to create a well-equipped learning environment that integrates research with education. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The forensic science program begins by incorporating basic chemistry skills, and then integrates a concentration on analytical problem solving skills through hands-on training on instruments found in forensic and other chemical laboratories. This project includes integrating the use of an Agilent 5975 inert GC/MS system fitted with a programmable pyrolyzer throughout the teaching curriculum and into the research opportunities. Due to the inquiry-based nature of the forensics concentration, the program enhances any chemistry degree, and it better prepares students for entry into a graduate program or a profession.  The course Forensic Science Laboratory Techniques has been designed as an inquiry-based course where students are required to use available instrumentation to solve hypothetical cases. Students then are encouraged to further their academic and professional skills by becoming involved in a Forensic Science Internship at SLED. Students may enroll in three applied chemistry courses, Laboratory Development, where they design and test sample laboratory experiments, Investigative Chemistry, where they actively engage in design, investigation, analysis, and report of research in chemistry, and Research in Chemistry, where they become involved in a research project.  The chemistry faculty are working in conjunction with the State Law Enforcement Division (SLED), the chief law enforcement agency in South Carolina, to continue development of a curriculum that includes forensic science professionals providing presentations to share their most recent field experiences. SLED has agreed to provide current field knowledge, guest lecturers on specialized topics, and on-site internships for students.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;A 2004 search for baccalaureate-level forensic science programs revealed that there was no four-year undergraduate college within a 500 mile radius of South Carolina offering a major, minor or concentration in forensic science. Newberry College became the first college in the area to offer a chemistry major with forensic science concentration.  Currently, Newberry College enrollment is composed of approximately 32% minority and 33% first generation college students. The program outcomes will be broadly disseminated though professional meetings, peer-reviewed publications, publication in the College's magazine and Web site, and through faculty emails to fellow educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
