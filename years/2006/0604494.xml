<AbstractNarration>Large scale topology of metric spaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   The project is dedicated to the  large scale geometry and topology, &lt;br/&gt;a relatively new interdisciplinary subject which studies very large &lt;br/&gt;scale properties of a space. It is opposite to the classical topology &lt;br/&gt;which is a science of small scales, since it is based on the notion &lt;br/&gt;of a continuous transformation which is local by the definition. The project&lt;br/&gt;is devoted to the large scale counterparts of the following&lt;br/&gt;classic topics of topology: Dimension Theory, Cohomology Theory, Theory &lt;br/&gt;of Embeddings. Among the research problems selected for the project are:&lt;br/&gt;The quest for a large scale analog of Morita theorem that states that&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic dimension increases by one after crossing the space with the reals;&lt;br/&gt;the quest for the asymptotic analog of Alexandroff theorem connecting&lt;br/&gt;cohomological approach to dimension to geometric one; and a problem &lt;br/&gt;of quasi-isometric embedding of discrete groups into the product of trees.&lt;br/&gt;One of the main goals of the project is potential &lt;br/&gt;applications to the Novikov Higher Signature Conjecture and some &lt;br/&gt;other related conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;   The classical topology has the century long history and now it &lt;br/&gt;is substantially developed in all directions. Its long and painful &lt;br/&gt;birth  at the end of 19th and beginning of 20th centuries was inspired and &lt;br/&gt;pushed by the progress in natural sciences and mathematics, in particular &lt;br/&gt;in analysis. By the end of the 20th century in many areas&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics the necessity appeared for a discipline which would be&lt;br/&gt;similar to topology and which describe  behavior of the large scale world.&lt;br/&gt;Such a discipline started to hatch in a last decade or so.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is a further push for rising of such a science.&lt;br/&gt;There are already many connections between the asymptotic topology &lt;br/&gt;and applied disciplines. Thus, a part of this project is&lt;br/&gt;the study of the connection between large scale embeddings into the product of &lt;br/&gt;trees and aperiodic tilings and hence the quasi-crystals.&lt;br/&gt;Another connection is to the computer science. It turns out that&lt;br/&gt;the asymptotic infinite dimensionality&lt;br/&gt;of certain sequence of graphs would give the foundation for PRA&lt;br/&gt;("product replacement algorithm") which is a noncomutative version of Gauss&lt;br/&gt;elimination algorithm. It is known that PRA works well in all instances but&lt;br/&gt;still it lacks a rigorous mathematical justification.&lt;br/&gt;Developing  of the asymptotic dimension theory up to the task &lt;br/&gt;is the heart of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
