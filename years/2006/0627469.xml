<AbstractNarration>Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is expected to be the key enabling force in the emerging Service Web. The focus of this research project is a core issue in SOC and deals with trust management for Web services.  The specific aim of this project is to develop novel techniques for defining, ascertaining, and managing the reputation of Web services as a key mechanism for implementing trust in delivering services.  In this regard, a Peer-to-Peer approach is used to assess the reputation of a-priori unknown Web services. This approach relies on reputation metrics to efficiently select and compose services from a dynamic set of autonomous and disparate Web services. The approach uses local ontologies (communities) as a shared space for exchanging reputation information. A reputation evaluation metrics is incorporated into the Quality of Web Service to rate, change, and monitor the reputation of simple and composed Web services.  The credibility of raters and potential malicious ratings are factored in to ensure accurate reputation assessment.  Establishing a trusted environment for Web service interactions will facilitate and invigorate the deployment of applications such as E-commerce (e.g., B2B applications), E-government (e.g., social services), and E-science (e.g., Grid computing).  Results from this research will be applied to an on-going e-government project that provides efficient and customized Web-based services to senior citizens.  Research and coursework students are trained in this project through their involvement in short and longer term projects.  The research  results will be disseminated via the project Web site (www.eceg.cs.vt.edu/WS-reputation).</AbstractNarration>
