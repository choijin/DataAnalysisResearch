<AbstractNarration>"DinoMap" provides intensive professional development for 7th and 8th grade math and science teachers from northeastern Montana, an area that includes the Fort Peck Indian Reservation.  The project focuses on the application of geospatial technologies, including global positioning systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing, to understanding the rich fossil record of the Northern Plains, a subject of great scientific, economic and cultural significance in the region.  Over three years, University of Montana staff will provide 60 teachers with technology-embedded content instruction in paleontology through a series of four winter workshops.  Participating teachers subsequently use the instructional materials in their classrooms to demonstrate concepts of measurement, algebra, and geometry, and to introduce concepts of scientific modeling, including descriptive, process, statistical, and conceptual models.  Teachers also participate in a two-week summer institute at the Fort Peck Field Station of Paleontology where they develop various hands-on learning activities for their students.  Approximately 120 students are expected to participate in the summer institute, where they will reinforce concepts learned in class through hands-on use of geospatial technologies and, in doing so, learn about key geological and biological processes.  Students participate in authentic paleontological research, contributing to the development of a geodatabase, and becoming producers rather than merely consumers of new information.  Students also meet professionals who use geospatial technologies that relate to specific community and tribal issues and concerns.  A career video series highlighting young geospatial professionals, including women and minorities in particular, is being produced for wide dissemination though the internet, conferences and various training programs.  Together with its partners, Explore Digital Education, Inc. and Fort Peck Paleontology, Inc., The University of Montana provides on-going technical assistance, instructional design support, student internships and on-line learning activities through an on-line education forum.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
