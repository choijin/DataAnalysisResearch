<AbstractNarration>0651716&lt;br/&gt;Bellamkonda&lt;br/&gt;Technological advancements in protective gear and associated technologies have succeeded in saving lives. However, there has been a resultant increase in limb amputations in both military and civilian populations. While the design of prosthetics to serve this population has improved significantly, there remains a critical gap in the ability to control prosthetic limbs in a natural, biomimetic manner by directly interfacing them to the nervous system. Attempts to integrate electrodes with the nervous system have failed to meet a number of criteria necessary to create a highly functional interface -- they lack specificity of signal, high enough number of channels of information, or are too invasive to achieve sufficient contacts with the regenerating nerve. The design and implementation of a seamless, bi-directional nerve-electrode interface between a surviving nerve stump and external electronics would represent a significant advance. This proposal will develop an innovative, regenerative electrode for peripheral nerves (REPiN) using a novel design that will generate a high-channel bi-directional interface, between peripheral nerves and external electronics. The research approach outlined in this application is enabled by the recent discovery in the PI's laboratory that oriented polymeric nanofibers stimulate Schwann cell migration along the nanofibers, facilitating fiber guided neurite extension and regeneration of across long nerve gaps. The proposed approach is to embed thin-film electrodes within oriented polymeric nanofiber films, present the nanofiber films to a peripheral nerve stump in a tubular prosthesis, facilitating the regenerating nerves to interface with external electronics. By embedding thin film electrodes onto nanofiber based scaffolds/films, it is possible to essentially 'bring' the regenerating axons to the electrodes in a controlled fashion. Two specific aims have been identified to accomplish this goal.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
