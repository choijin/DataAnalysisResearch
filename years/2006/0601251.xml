<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0601251&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Cameron McA. Gordon, Alan W. Reid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a workshop on 3-dimensional topology that will be held at&lt;br/&gt;the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, UK, in&lt;br/&gt;March, 2006. Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, which has guided&lt;br/&gt;research in 3-dimensional topology for almost three decades, has now&lt;br/&gt;been established, and consequently there is a need to set out a program&lt;br/&gt;for future research in the subject. This is the objective of the&lt;br/&gt;workshop. The program will be centered around five series of three&lt;br/&gt;1-hour lectures, given by Jeff Brock, Dave Gabai, Marc Lackenby, Peter&lt;br/&gt;Ozsvath, and Peter Shalen. There will also be nine additional invited&lt;br/&gt;1-hour talks by other leading researchers. Among the recent important&lt;br/&gt;developments in 3-dimensional topology that will be discussed, with a&lt;br/&gt;view to illuminating the theory of 3-manifolds beyond Geometrization,&lt;br/&gt;are: the proofs of the Tameness and Ending Lamination Conjectures,&lt;br/&gt;Heegaard Floer homology theory, various approaches to the virtual Haken&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, and the connection between 3-dimensional topology and the&lt;br/&gt;theory of word hyperbolic groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional topology is a large and active subject within the general&lt;br/&gt;field of pure mathematics. Its goal is the study of all possible&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional "spaces", and of the various objects that can be situated&lt;br/&gt;in them, such as knots. Over the last 30 years or so this subject has&lt;br/&gt;seen many exciting developments, revealing connections to many other&lt;br/&gt;branches of mathematics as well as quantum physics and (in the case of&lt;br/&gt;knots) even to the behavior of DNA. The guiding light of the subject&lt;br/&gt;during this period has been the Geometrization Conjecture, put forward&lt;br/&gt;William Thurston in the mid 1970's, which asserts that hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, the non-euclidean geometry discovered by Lobachevsky in the&lt;br/&gt;19th century, plays a key role in the description of these 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces. This conjecture was recently proved by Grisha Perelman. It seems&lt;br/&gt;timely, then, to take stock of the subject, identifying the major&lt;br/&gt;problems that remain and indicating potential techniques and directions&lt;br/&gt;for future work. The core of the program will be five series of three&lt;br/&gt;1-hour lectures, given by five internationally renowned experts in the&lt;br/&gt;subject. It is expected that this will make the workshop especially&lt;br/&gt;useful to young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference web site is&lt;br/&gt;http://www.icms.org.uk/meetings/2006/3-manifolds/index.html.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
