<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop proof-of-concept, Web- or CD-delivered Virtual Reality (VR) simulations that incorporate lifelike virtual tutors, capable of demonstrating and performing science experiments and communicating in written or spoken English or sign language, for Grades 5-8 curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides an opportunity to broaden participation of under-represented groups in authentic learning experiences, through the use of lifelike virtual tutor avatars. Originally conceived as a means to explain concepts visually and with sign language to deaf students with low English skills, these virtual tutors will benefit a broader range of learners who are otherwise isolated by language or reading barriers, or by lack of access to laboratory equipment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project we developed Web- or CD-delivered Virtual Reality (VR) simulations that incorporate lifelike virtual tutors, capable of demonstrating and performing science experiments and communicating in written or spoken English or sign language, into two of TERCÆs Science-athon online challenges for Grades 5-8: Marble Roll and Catching Sunshine. This research built on Vcom3DÆs and TERCÆs use of avatars for communication of scientific concepts to Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students. It also extended the role of the virtual tutors from being communication aids to being mentors, participants, and/or interpreters who support all students in developing standards-based abilities of scientific inquiry and understanding of fundamental concepts of physics. Research included:  developing fully functional VR simulations that challenge students to solve a problem and integrate the publication, comparison and analysis of their data; evaluating the simulationsÆ effectiveness in supporting all studentsÆ understanding of standards-based science content and process and attitude toward it, including those with special needs;   refining the Authoring Tools and run-time software so that they could be used by other groups wanting to develop accessible authentic learning applications economically.   Under Phase IIB supplemental funding, we extended the software to be compatible with mobile computing devices, including smart phones and AppleÆs iPod/iPhone/iTouch.  This mobile version was used to create Sign 4 Me, an app that translates whole sentences from English to sign language.  This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project provides an opportunity to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in authentic learning experiences, through the use of lifelike "virtual tutor" avatars.  Originally conceived as a means to explain concepts visually and with sign language to Deaf students with low English skills, the partners have shown that these virtual tutors benefit a broader range of learners who are otherwise isolated by language or reading barriers, or by lack of access to laboratory equipment.  The Virtual Tutor provides constant attention to studentÆs actions and ideas, using verbal and visual modes of communication appropriate for that student - a benefit rarely realized in most classroom settings and one that advances scientific discovery and understanding and promotes lifelong learning. Additionally, learning with a VR simulation dramatically increases access to age-appropriate standards-based learning for students in classrooms without laboratories, in hospitals, and for those with mobility disorders or special learning needs.
