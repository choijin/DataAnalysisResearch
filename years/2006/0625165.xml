<AbstractNarration>Allen University is a private, liberal arts, historically black university located in Columbia, South Carolina.  The HBCU-UP project, Enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics at Allen University (ESTEM-AU) will 1) revise course contents and integrate technology into STEM curricula and instruction; 2) develop undergraduate research program and improve critical transition activities for recruitment and retention and 3) broaden and strengthen the research program for faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve its goals, the ESTEM-AU project will institute a variety of course modifications in mathematics, chemistry, biology and physics.  Among the approaches that will be utilized are 1) an Integrated Instructional Delivery System in freshman and sophomore level courses which include multimedia electronic lecture notes, tutorials, online testing and online assignments; and 2) Discvery Learning Approaches.  Equipment and professional development activities will strengthen the integration of technology into STEM instruction and curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allen University will develop activities to increase the involvement of undergraduate students in research during the academic year and summer months.  The summer internships will rely on collaboration with major research institutions.  In addition, they seek to increase the preparation of incoming freshman students through a summer bridge program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty will be supported in their ESTEM-AU efforts through professional development workshops, faculty exchanges, and collaboration with visiting scientists and research institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Enhancing Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering at Allen University (ESTEM-AU)                    The goal of this project is to enhance the quality of STEM programs at Allen University and increase the number of STEM graduates from our programs, who will enter graduate school and the workforce.  Before the implementation of this grant, the 2005 enrollment in the STEM areas at Allen University stood at 29 students. Our numbers this fall exceed 200 students with declared majors in the STEM areas. This increase in recruitment is a result of the commitment to community outreach. This outreach focused on students, counselors and teachers in local school districts. Crucial to our success was the ability to provide financial assistance to students.             Our revised program offerings place a greater focus on laboratory research and students are participating in more faculty led research projects. Faculty facilitated a lecture series with local and national presenters, and participated in professional development workshops which strengthened their classroom pedagogy and technological capacity.           The ensuing upgrades to update campus technology and our increased partnerships have also contributed to our success.  Through our updated laboratories and with the assistance of our partnerships, students are equipped with strong scientific knowledge and research skills.  These relationships have resulted in Memorandums of Understandings which provided additional opportunities for students to work with leaders and researchers in the STEM areas. This increase in internships for underrepresented students at these research institutions bodes well for our students and for the stakeholders in the community and nationwide.         NSF funding provided has allowed the college; to increase the enrollment numbers of our STEM majors; improve its technology; and provide professional development to faculty to enhance classroom pedagogy.
