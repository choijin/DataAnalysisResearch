<AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to NSF 05-1788, category unsolicited. The objective of this research is to develop new manufacturing approaches for the fabrication of devices and systems that are increasingly smaller in size and richer in materials complexity. The approach is to develop strategies for the co-assembly of chemically synthesized nanoparticles on surfaces that will lead to the formation of complex arrangements with specific electro-optical properties. Substrates with chemical and topographical modulation will guide the positions and spacings of the particles. Both arrays of monodisperse particles, and arrays consisting of two different types of particles, will be studied. Two devices will be studied in particular as testbeds for this research: plasmon wire structures and photovoltaic structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal benefits of this work will include the development of new approaches to nanomanufacturing, combined with a range of broader activities. These include the development of publically-accessible college undergraduate and graduate courses on nanomaterials and nanotechnology, laboratory modules on nano-manufacturing for undergraduate and graduate students, and modules on self-assembly for high school students. Two graduate students and several undergraduate students will be trained in nanoscale science, technology and manufacturing, as well as a visiting scientist from HP Laboratories. Outreach to minorities will be accomplished through summer research experiences for students at a local Community College, and outreach to industry through a close collaboration with HP and the development of links to other companies as the project progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
