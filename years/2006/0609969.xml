<AbstractNarration>Earthquakes are the result of rapid movement of crustal&lt;br/&gt;blocks on faults, which are marked by a narrow fault zone&lt;br/&gt;(FZ) with a width of several hundred meters.  Most&lt;br/&gt;earthquake rupture models, including the asperity and&lt;br/&gt;stick-slip paradigms, suggest that FZ structure (geometrical&lt;br/&gt;and material properties) controls earthquake rupture&lt;br/&gt;initiation, propagation, and termination.  However,&lt;br/&gt;determining FZ structure at seismogenic depths where&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes nucleate and the majority of slip occurs has&lt;br/&gt;been shown to be extremely difficult.  In this project,&lt;br/&gt;seismologists at Saint Louis University use high-frequency&lt;br/&gt;body-wave waveforms from aftershocks near the FZ to&lt;br/&gt;determine fine-scale.  Waveform characteristics&lt;br/&gt;enables them to design a new strategy in which the FZ width&lt;br/&gt;and velocities are determined separately, thus eliminating&lt;br/&gt;the trade-off between the two.  Furthermore, by using FZ&lt;br/&gt;reflected waves, they can pinpoint the locations in the FZ&lt;br/&gt;where they have obtained FZ width and velocity parameters.&lt;br/&gt;This gives them a unprecedented high depth resolution of FZ&lt;br/&gt;structure.  In addition, they are able to relocate&lt;br/&gt;aftershocks with an accuracy of a few tens of meters&lt;br/&gt;relative to the FZ boundaries.  They plan to apply the&lt;br/&gt;method to data sets of various fault zones in California,&lt;br/&gt;including the Landers, Hector Mine, San Jacinto, and San&lt;br/&gt;Andreas Fault at Parkfield to determine FZ parameters&lt;br/&gt;(strike, width, velocity and density drops, and Q) and&lt;br/&gt;possible temporary variations.&lt;br/&gt;  Broader Impacts:  The information obtained is crucial&lt;br/&gt;to developing models of the earthquake source.  Experience&lt;br/&gt;gained in this study will help design future FZ seismic&lt;br/&gt;experiments and the methodologies developed can be easily&lt;br/&gt;applied to other regions and data sets, such as those from&lt;br/&gt;the on-going USArray.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
