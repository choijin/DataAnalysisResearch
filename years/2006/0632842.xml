<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is creating new introductory and advanced electromagnetics courses that are increasing the inclusiveness and appeal of this subject to a diverse student body and providing a better match with the current demands of the industry, academia, and society.  The new paradigm introduces real-world engineering problems and encourages students to seek solutions by learning the underlying principles and techniques of applied electromagnetic theory.  In supporting this approach, the investigator is creating a series of coherent simulation instructional modules called test benches that illustrate most of the important topics in electromagnetic theory.  These test benches contain enough structure to motivate the student to experiment and supply intuitive knowledge, and yet they are deliberately incomplete and require student input to produce better results.  Project evaluation efforts, which are led by an existing multi-university evaluation and assessment center, include expert panel reviews, analysis of student products, and surveys on student attitudes.  The materials, including the simulation and animation software, are being posted on the University's website and project results are being presented at professional conferences, some serving the electromagnetic community and others the engineering education community.  The broader impacts are focused on the dissemination of the material.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
