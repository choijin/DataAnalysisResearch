    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECS-0638542&lt;br/&gt;M. Yasin A. Raja&lt;br/&gt;Univ. of North Carolina at Charlotte&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal describes plans to organize a three-day long International Symposium on 'high-capacity optical networks and enabling technologies' High-capacity Optical Networking Symposium (HONET) 2006. It focuses on a very timely theme Optical Internet. There are several advanced sessions that tie well into the theme that contributes to the next generation Internet technologies. HONET 2006 builds on success of past two international symposia and aims to strengthen further the collaborations among US national and international professionals (Pakistan and South Asia). While the theme of HONET aligns well with GENI (NSF Initiative) it also will provide opportunity to establish international linkage and strong collaborations for cutting-edge R&amp;D. It will bring together, academic and industry professionals for technical innovations. It also will serve as launching platform for exploring international opportunities for US commercial sector and conform to the global vision and outreach of NSF for higher education and cutting-edge research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Review of advanced optical networks and enabling technologies as applied to high-speed Internet for research and education. Establish new and strengthen existing collaborations among US and other participant countries scientists, engineers and entrepreneurial professionals. Advance further the collaborative interaction at all levels among institutions and the international counterpart such as National University of Science &amp; Technology (NUST), LUMS, and COMSATS Institute of IT (Pakistan) etc. Provide avenues to share research results among professionals from educational institutions (senior, junior faculty and graduate students of both gender and diversity) and experts from commercial sector and their international counterparts from participating North American and South Asian countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the planned event will be both global as well as regional, since it is collocated with 'Optics in South East 2006' (an annual regional OSA &amp; SPIE conference). In particular, the evolution towards high-speed optical access and networks security will support increased research and development at educational institutions and use of digital libraries for mass education. It will also streamline and accelerate collaborations among national and international professionals (US scientists, engineers, and graduate students) as well as South Asian professionals. The workshop will also collaborate with another NSF effort in NC, the Science House on Centennial Campus at NCSU and in particular the Photonics Leader program, which is fully sponsored by NSF. The Science House works in partnership with K-12 teachers to emphasize the use of hands-on learning activities in mathematics and science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Funding of this project is made by the Division of Electrical and Communication Systems and the Office of International Science and Engineering."</AbstractNarration>
