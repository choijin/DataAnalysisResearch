<AbstractNarration>The importance of uncertainty analysis and stochastic modeling&lt;br/&gt;has received increasing amount of attention in recent years,&lt;br/&gt;especially from the Computational Mathematics society.&lt;br/&gt;Extensive research efforts have been devoted to uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;quantification and stochastic computations, and novel numerical &lt;br/&gt;methods have been developed to efficiently deal with large and &lt;br/&gt;complex systems with uncertainty. Although these methods have been &lt;br/&gt;demonstrated to be highly effective in predicting the behavior of &lt;br/&gt;complex stochastic systems, the design industry has not taken full &lt;br/&gt;advantage of these developments, and the design procedures in many &lt;br/&gt;disciplines remain almost exclusively deterministic. The research &lt;br/&gt;objective of this proposal is to develop new mathematical and &lt;br/&gt;numerical methods for multidisciplinary design problems with &lt;br/&gt;uncertain inputs, with an emphasis on the efficiency and accuracy&lt;br/&gt;of the new methods so that they are applicable to large-scale, &lt;br/&gt;realistic engineering applications. This objective will be attained &lt;br/&gt;through three major efforts: (1) employing rigorous mathematical &lt;br/&gt;theory to form a unified framework that allows one to conduct &lt;br/&gt;systematical analysis and error estimates; (2) employing the &lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art stochastic algorithms to construct a set of high &lt;br/&gt;performance design algorithms for two major classes of &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty-based design: robust design and reliability design;&lt;br/&gt;and (3) extending the new methods to large-scale complex systems&lt;br/&gt;and developing fast and parallel solvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantifying uncertainty is of paramount importance in almost all &lt;br/&gt;aspects of science and engineering. It is of particular significance &lt;br/&gt;in modern-day strategic planning and risk management where decisions &lt;br/&gt;are made in a constantly changing landscape with many unknown &lt;br/&gt;factors. Examples such as epidemic control, aircraft optimization &lt;br/&gt;under extreme conditions, optimal response following natural &lt;br/&gt;disasters, etc, are abundant. Such problems are essentially design &lt;br/&gt;and optimization in a complex and multidisciplinary environment, &lt;br/&gt;with substantial uncertainty interacting in a highly nonlinear fashion &lt;br/&gt;in the systems and parameters. While simulation based design tools &lt;br/&gt;continue to be advanced at rapid rates, little attention has been &lt;br/&gt;paid to incorporation of state-of-the-art mathematical techniques &lt;br/&gt;in stochastic analysis and uncertainty quantification. The traditional &lt;br/&gt;approaches, e.g., those by using safety factors to accommodate &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty in a gross manner, are becoming increasingly obsolete and &lt;br/&gt;often result in overly conservative decisions. This project is valuable &lt;br/&gt;for its multi-disciplinary influence, its fundamental contribution to &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty-based design problems, and more importantly, its high &lt;br/&gt;performance stochastic design algorithms the provide better and sharper &lt;br/&gt;analysis for decision makers. The project will unite a collection of &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty-based design techniques scattered over various engineering &lt;br/&gt;applications with the cutting-edge stochastic computation framework.&lt;br/&gt;It is a true synergy of Computational Mathematics tools and practical&lt;br/&gt;demands, and can be extended to a large class of design and optimization&lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
