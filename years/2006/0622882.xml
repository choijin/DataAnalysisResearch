<AbstractNarration>Objectives: The objectives for this project include reducing the achievement gap between the&lt;br/&gt;performance of students with learning disabilities and their non-disabled peers in math;&lt;br/&gt;enhancing the math preparation of individuals with LD to enter postsecondary institutions to&lt;br/&gt;pursue programs and degrees in math, science, engineering, and technology; and the national&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of instructional resources in the form of lessons and online tutorials aligned with&lt;br/&gt;curriculum standards that have been validated to improve the achievement of students with LD .&lt;br/&gt;This proposal builds from a major internally funded project identified as the Blending&lt;br/&gt;Assessment with Instruction Program (BAIP) that is comprised of two validated interventions in&lt;br/&gt;the form of lessons for teachers to employ in their instruction and online tutorials for&lt;br/&gt;independent use by students with LD. Both interventions are aligned with curriculum standards&lt;br/&gt;in math. The research initiative is designed to investigate the effects of the lessons and the&lt;br/&gt;tutorials on the achievement of students with LD in math.&lt;br/&gt;Significance and Intellectual Merit of Research: National Center for Educational Outcomes&lt;br/&gt;reported in 2004 that not only were students with LD performing below all students across the&lt;br/&gt;country, but also that the gap actually grew significantly larger as students got older (Thurlow &amp;&lt;br/&gt;Wiley, 2004). Research has found that students with LD typically function two to four grades&lt;br/&gt;below expectancy across the mathematics curriculum (Parmar &amp; Cawley, 1997). Many students&lt;br/&gt;with LD perform poorly on assessments that are tied to state standards (Thurlow, Albus,&lt;br/&gt;Spicuzza, &amp; Thompson, 1998). Thurlow et al determined that only 34% of students with LD&lt;br/&gt;passed a state test on basic math skills, versus 83% of their non-disabled peers. This is of&lt;br/&gt;serious concern given that students with LD are held to increasingly higher standards and will&lt;br/&gt;need higher-level math and reasoning skills to meet the demands of high school and beyond. In&lt;br/&gt;less than 20 years, one in every four jobs will require technical skills (Tarlin, 1997, as cited in&lt;br/&gt;Jarrett, 1998), and many careers require a strong basis in math. If students do not experience a&lt;br/&gt;standards-based curriculum at an early age, they will be disadvantaged when being assessed&lt;br/&gt;via a standards-based assessment as required by NCLB. To focus only on postsecondary&lt;br/&gt;interventions to increase the presence of persons with LD in math, science and technology&lt;br/&gt;careers fails to recognize what research demonstrates as the contributor to the underrepresentation&lt;br/&gt;of persons with LD in the math, science and technology fields.&lt;br/&gt;Research Strategy: We propose to research the effects of BAIP in aligning local curricula with&lt;br/&gt;national curriculum standards and statewide assessments as a model for improving the &lt;br/&gt;performance of students with LD. The lessons and tutorials are developed for grades 3, 4, 5, 6,&lt;br/&gt;7, 8, and 10 in compliance with NCLB. Two distinct empirical approaches are planned. First,&lt;br/&gt;lesson tests will be directly tied to content. These tests will be piloted to assure their validity and&lt;br/&gt;reliability. Once quality tests are available, they will be administered prior to and following&lt;br/&gt;lesson use with targeted students. In concurrence with this "experimental group" testing, we will&lt;br/&gt;pre and post test other comparable students with the same measures. As we will not be able to&lt;br/&gt;control for group equivalence due to the absence of randomization to intervention, and also&lt;br/&gt;considering that the pre and post test measures will not be equivalent, analysis of covariance&lt;br/&gt;procedures will be used to control "pre-lesson" instructional group differences. This method will&lt;br/&gt;be used within schools and as numbers of participants increase will carry out more robust&lt;br/&gt;empirical studies relying on hierarchical linear modeling. Thus in six months we will quasiexperimentally&lt;br/&gt;research the impact on learning of the lessons. Finally, student item score&lt;br/&gt;results will be evaluated descriptively to guide us regarding needed lesson changes.&lt;br/&gt;Comparisons will be made across students with LD who experience (a) the lessons taught by&lt;br/&gt;teachers, (b) tutorials, (c) lessons and (d) tutorials with disability and non-disabled peers.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Implications of Proposed Research: The vast majority of students with LD receive&lt;br/&gt;their math instruction in the general education classroom. Thus, the project has the potential to&lt;br/&gt;benefit all teachers and, ultimately, all students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
