<AbstractNarration>The goal of this three-year, comprehensive ITEST project is to prepare diverse middle- and high-school students for careers in information technologies (IT) by engaging them in designing inquiry-based science activities that use computational models and real-time data acquisition and analysis.  The project provides 126 hours of lab-based, credit-bearing activities for 90 teachers and support for classroom implementation.  Participants meet for two weeks in the summer of 2007, twice face-to-face plus online during the academic year, and again the following summer for one week. The program is offered at three sites, each supporting 30 participants:  Desert Sands, CA; Olathe, KS; and Boston, MA.  The three sites were selected to give the project a national reach by including geographic and ethnic diversity from the start.  The schools participated in the development of the project and intend to continue and expand it post-funding.  Additional dissemination efforts, including a project website and publication in the Concord Consortium's biannual newsletter, will reach many more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participating teachers learn basic electronics, programming and design skills that will enable their students to install, configure and use a wide range of sensors for measuring experiments with computers.  They also learn to teach students to use, modify and create computational models.  The team designing these activities provides a nationally recognized leadership in the use of probes and computational models in education.  The skills teachers learn in this program enhance science teaching while giving students a solid foundation for IT-based careers in computer hardware and software engineering.  The project will make its materials widely available to students, teachers and professional development trainers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
