<AbstractNarration>Herbert and Lawrence Proposal Abstract 0623487&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to improve our understanding of how conditions in the high latitude oceans of both hemispheres changed over the course of the Earth's last major climate revolution from 2-4 million years ago (Ma).  During this period, the northern hemisphere became glaciated, and large amplitude climate cycles began that continue to the present.  The PI's propose to reconstruct time series (average sampling resolution of 3 ka) of past ocean surface temperature and biological activity from a number of deep sea sites in the N and S hemispheres with continuous sediment coverage across the 2-4 Myr time interval.  State-of-the-art organic geochemical analyses of alkenone biomolecules will be utilized together with stable isotope measurements on benthic foraminifera to provide accurate dating of the samples.  This project will test hypotheses that 1) temperature variability at the high latitudes grew substantially from 4 to 3 Ma and that glaciation was a late response (rather than a primary driver) to earlier shifts in the climate system; 2) the pattern of high latitude ocean cooling was more or less symmetrical in the two hemispheres, suggesting that declining greenhouse gas levels played a major role in the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation and 3) biological productivity shifted at approximately the same time in both hemispheres, indicating a major change in the planetary wind fields at high latitudes, and a major reorganization of the ocean carbon "pump" as northern hemisphere ice ages intensified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project will include educational/outreach activities and the dissemination of a large and unique data set to the paleoclimatic/climatology community.  This project will support undergraduate participation and will contribute to graduate and post-doctoral training and development.  Research data will be posted on the NGDC Paleoclimate web site.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to examine ocean surface changes in high latitude regions across the last major climate transition in Earth history. This transition occurred over the last 5 million years, during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. The scientific community is interested in this time period because it allows us to examine how the climate system behaves in both warm and cold climate states, and because the early part of the Pliocene epoch has been used as a potential analog for future climate warming as a result of human-induced changes in the composition of EarthÃ†s atmosphere. Part of our motivation for the work we conducted in association with this grant was to try to understand how and why the early Pliocene climate differed from our present climate state, so that we have a better sense of what might await human societies in the future.     Our work shows that high latitudes in both hemispheres cooled significantly during this transition in contrast to more modest changes previously observed in low latitude regions during the Plio-Pleistocene. During the Pliocene warm climate state, the temperature gradient between equatorial and high latitude regions was reduced in comparison with the modern conditions. These findings illustrate the sensitivity of high latitude regions to climate change. Moreover, our data sets also indicate that the response to this climate transition was regionally heterogeneous: the rate of change of climate in the Northern Hemisphere versus the Southern Hemisphere and even among different regions within the same hemisphere was not the same.     Funding from this grant has also enabled us to examine Plio-Pleistocene changes in an important element of the global carbon cycle, marine productivity (the production of organic compounds, plant tissue, by marine phytoplankton). New datasets generated in association with this grant were critical to developing a synthesis of new and previously collected records of past productivity.

We can now discriminate among previously proposed mechanisms for major changes observed in high latitude productivity across the Plio-Pleistocene, and we have proposed a new conceptual model to explain broad scale change in marine productivity during this transition.     The long-term records of surface ocean conditions generated by this study, when examined in conjunction with other existing climate data sets, are consistent with a change in atmospheric composition, likely a decrease in carbon dioxide concentrations, playing an important role in the transition from the warm early Pliocene period to the colder and more variable states that followed.
