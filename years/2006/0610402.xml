<AbstractNarration>The Tenure System in Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Roli Varma&lt;br/&gt;University of New Mexico&lt;br/&gt;This proposal studies the importance of the tenure system in engineering in institutions of higher&lt;br/&gt;education. The tenure system distinguishes the academy from other forms of professional work.&lt;br/&gt;However, the rapid reduction of tenure-track positions and the rise of part-time and non-tenure&lt;br/&gt;track positions has reduced the importance of the tenure system. Most importantly, the tenure&lt;br/&gt;system has become a controversial subject that passionately divides scholars between those who&lt;br/&gt;argue for maintaining the system and those who argue for eliminating it. The proposal focuses on&lt;br/&gt;engineering because it makes an interesting case study of the technical system and human values.&lt;br/&gt;This is primarily a qualitative study based on in-depth interviews with 15+ subjects. This&lt;br/&gt;sample includes 10-12 engineering faculty who are tenured and on tenure-track, female and&lt;br/&gt;minority faculty, and faculty who are in their terminal year from one public university and one&lt;br/&gt;private university. The sample of tenured and on tenure-track faculty will be drawn randomly&lt;br/&gt;where as the sample of female and minority faculty and the faculty in their terminal year will be&lt;br/&gt;selected via snowball sampling method.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Engineering is one of the best disciplines in which to illuminate the underlying roles of the&lt;br/&gt;tenure system that go beyond the traditional justification of academic freedom. Engineering, as a&lt;br/&gt;technical field, is unlikely to investigate those problems that result in deep-rooted prejudice and&lt;br/&gt;intense emotional reaction for which tenure has been justified. Yet engineering design is a&lt;br/&gt;decision-making process in which technical knowledge is applied to convert resources into a&lt;br/&gt;socially required product. Engineering design implies some understanding of the structure of&lt;br/&gt;society, social organizations, work environment, peoples safety, and protection of the&lt;br/&gt;environment. Furthermore, engineering deals with technologies that have profoundly&lt;br/&gt;transformed society since World War II. Most importantly, engineering faculty increasingly&lt;br/&gt;collaborate with industry which undermines the traditional notion of academic autonomy. In&lt;br/&gt;other words, engineering is not really value neutral as proclaimed. An investigation into&lt;br/&gt;whether engineering faculty involved in social and political questions relevant to the university&lt;br/&gt;face challenges during the tenure process, whether the engineering faculty with industry s links&lt;br/&gt;have a competitive edge in securing tenure, and whether women and minorities face additional&lt;br/&gt;hardship in tenure promotion in engineering, will show the underlying relationship between&lt;br/&gt;technical and social systems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This is a pilot study; findings from this study will result in a full proposal to the NSF on August&lt;br/&gt;1, 2006. In probing the importance of tenure to academic personnel, it is likely to illuminate&lt;br/&gt;structures of status and opportunity in academia. It will also show the ways in which the&lt;br/&gt;supposed political neutrality of engineering is constructed despite patently social and political&lt;br/&gt;views held by engineering faculty. It will provide data for social scientists concerned with social&lt;br/&gt;equity. This project also has great potential to contribute to undergraduate teaching; the findings&lt;br/&gt;can be incorporated in future teaching. It is especially important because engineering students are&lt;br/&gt;in great need of understanding the social and political dimensions of their own curricular and&lt;br/&gt;disciplinary worlds.</AbstractNarration>
