<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support Dr. Charles Trombold and David Browman will study the local effects of late Epiclassic political and environmental disintegration on the northern Mesoamerican frontier between ca. AD 800-1100. Excavations focus on changes in community organization within a large hinterland site, Bosque Encantado (MV-206) and nearby agricultural terraces located in close proximity to the large ceremonial center of La Quemada in the present Mexican state of Zacatecas. This center and its hinterland are important because within a relatively short period of time La Quemada devolved from a key civic/ ceremonial center with large regional sustaining population and elaborate monumental architecture to a ruined shell with an ephemeral dispersed population. Some scholars suggest that this was part of a much larger abandonment of nearly 100,000 km2 by full-time agriculturalists in northern Mexico that ultimately resulted in the fall of Tula around AD 1180. Taking advantage of this unique prehistoric frontier situation, the objective is to determine the range of social responses ultimately tied to the failure of La Quemada as a complex political entity and the associated processes of local level demographic change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excavations at the site of Bosque Encantado take place within the context of two architecturally and culturally defined levels of community organization that best reflect change and continuity over time. These include macro-level plaza compounds and the households that compose them. Plaza compounds are spatially discrete residence/ activity areas that are the largest socially defined architectural entities aside from the site itself. They include rooms, public and special purpose architecture and activity areas  most closely associated with any given sunken plaza. Focus on households, the constituent units within these compounds, can indicate rate of abandonment, precursor stress adaptations and occupational continuity. Placing these studies in the context of community organization is the most effective way to approach a variety of scales and hierarchical levels including the individual household, household clusters, plaza compounds and ultimately the community as a whole. &lt;br/&gt;Study of the nearby agricultural terraces is integral to the overall goals by providing a wider background of demographic responses to economic or political fragility. This helps to distinguish and evaluate the relative importance of variables that may have played a role in abandonment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research ultimately deals with a single question that has current political and nearly universal implications: What are the effects and adaptive responses of a failing complex polity on its constituent population at the local level? Historically no less than at present there has been intense interests by scholars and governments on the reasons and social effects of political/ economic disintegration. On a fundamental level, however, the broadest impact of this research is integration of current research, teaching, and reciprocal foreign collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
