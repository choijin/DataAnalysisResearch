<AbstractNarration>The Norfolk State University (NSU) HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project will implement an assessment and evaluation process (AEP) designed to enhance student learning, application of diverse assessment strategies, and continuous improvement. The Targeted Infusion Project will accelerate the full implementation of the NSU AEP which is one component required by ABET for accreditation.  ABET is the sole accrediting agency for engineering programs in the United States.  According to ABET, assessment and evaluation are the most problematic areas for programs seeking accreditation. This project will implement a recently proposed general model for outcome assessment developed at the University of Pittsburg. The Besterfield-Sacre model outlines characteristic performance behaviors for each of the ABET a-k outcomes, and the model further classifies the performance behaviors according to the Bloom Learning Taxonomy, a developmental model for student learning. NSU has adopted this model in the design of its assessment and evaluation plan, and this project will help to extend the initially constructed general performance criteria toward a set of discipline-specific criteria that maintains relevance to the ABET a-k outcomes and that is classified by the Bloom taxonomy. To our knowledge, this effort would be the first study of this nature for electronics and optical engineering programs.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norfolk State remains the only HBCU with an Optical Engineering program, and upon accreditation, the NSU program will be one of only three in the nation (University of Arizona and University of Alabama-Huntsville, have been accredited by ABET).  Norfolk State will likely produce fifteen engineering graduates in its first graduating class. It is projected that by 2010, more than double that number will graduate annually. Hence, NSU has the potential and the opportunity to become a top producer of African-American engineers in the nation.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
