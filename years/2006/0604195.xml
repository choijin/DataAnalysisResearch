<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0604195&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Robert L. Bryant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bryant will apply techniques of exterior differential systems and&lt;br/&gt;differential invariants to problems of current interest in&lt;br/&gt;geometry, economics, and physics.  In soliton flows, two problems&lt;br/&gt;will be studied: Characterizing the complete Ricci solitons in&lt;br/&gt;terms of extra equations that they must satisfy, such as having&lt;br/&gt;higher multiplicity of eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor or its&lt;br/&gt;(symmetrized) covariant derivatives and exploring a flow for&lt;br/&gt;CR-nondegenerate hypersurfaces in complex manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;trivialized canonical bundle.  In minimal submanifolds, Bryant&lt;br/&gt;will work on constructing and understanding calibrated&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds in Riemannian manifolds of special holonomy.  In&lt;br/&gt;almost-complex geometry, Bryant will develop a theory of almost&lt;br/&gt;complex 6-manifolds by studying the functionals on the space of&lt;br/&gt;almost complex structures on a given 6-manifold and the&lt;br/&gt;`quasi-integrable' class of almost complex structures, which has&lt;br/&gt;many of the good bundle-theoretic properties of the integrable&lt;br/&gt;case but is considerably more flexible.  It has a good theory of&lt;br/&gt;Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections, at least locally, and one may&lt;br/&gt;hope to define, study, and apply the associated moduli spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Bryant will also study the minimizing properties of&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-holomorphic curves in almost complex manifolds.  In&lt;br/&gt;Finsler geometry, Bryant will develop the theory of Finsler&lt;br/&gt;manifolds with constant flag curvature, constructing new&lt;br/&gt;examples, understanding the properties of their geodesic flows,&lt;br/&gt;and pursuing relations with twistor theory and exotic holonomy.&lt;br/&gt;In smaller projects, Bryant will continue to study the problem of&lt;br/&gt;Hessian representability of metrics and its close relations with&lt;br/&gt;integrable systems and will also begin developing and&lt;br/&gt;generalizing the convex Darboux theory introduced by Ekeland and&lt;br/&gt;Nirenberg for applications to econometric models.  (The methods&lt;br/&gt;of exterior differential systems are particularly suited to this&lt;br/&gt;latter problem and Bryant expects some interesting interaction&lt;br/&gt;with econometricians along the way.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bryant will continue to develop geometric approaches to problems&lt;br/&gt;arising in analysis, physics, economics, and biology.  Many of&lt;br/&gt;the important advances in the use of mathematics in the sciences&lt;br/&gt;have depended on developing a geometric understanding of those&lt;br/&gt;problems, i.e., an understanding that focusses on intrinsic&lt;br/&gt;aspects that are not tied to arbitrarily chosen coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;(The most famous example of this is Einstein's general theory of&lt;br/&gt;relativity, which he found by re-interpreting gravitation as&lt;br/&gt;`curvature of space', rather than as a force whose complicated&lt;br/&gt;expression in observer coordinates was largely irrelevant.  More&lt;br/&gt;recently, the development of string theory and M-theory has also&lt;br/&gt;resulted in geometric formulations of physics.)  Geometric&lt;br/&gt;formulations often lead to degeneracies in the mathematics that&lt;br/&gt;can be treated by differential systems and their invariants&lt;br/&gt;(nonstandard tools that Bryant and his coworkers are&lt;br/&gt;systematically developing), and Bryant is exploring applications&lt;br/&gt;of these ideas to new areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
