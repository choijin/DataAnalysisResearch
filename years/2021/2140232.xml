<AbstractNarration>One of the most longstanding questions in ecology is the degree to which food availability and predation determine the identity and abundance of animals in ecological communities. When food resources are transferred into ecosystems it is especially difficult to determine the effect of predation on local prey species abundance. Predator abundance may increase, leading to decreased local prey density, or predators may specialize on imported resources and have little effect on local prey density. In the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil jaguars specialize on imported aquatic prey and have the most picivorous diet of any terrestrial obligate carnivore. Moreover, in this unusual Pantanal food web jaguars, the apex predator, are by far the most abundant terrestrial mammal species. However, it is unclear if the low density of large herbivores is due to low available food resources (bottom-up control) or predation especially by the abundant jaguars (top-down control). Catastrophic wildfires in September 2020 removed canopy vegetation from about 30% of the Pantanal and about 50% of the PI’s previously established study sites at Taiama, a protected area in the Pantanal. Canopy removal stimulates a flush of nutritious early seral vegetation. By comparing mammalian herbivore abundance in burned and unburned areas, and before and after the fire, the PI will be able to determine if this food web is controlled by top-down or bottom-up forces. This project lies at the heart of the land-use/climate change nexus in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, the world's largest soy and bovine beef exporter. Understanding the dynamics of this system is critical as fires in the Pantanal are widely predicted to become more frequent and increasingly severe due to both climate change and large-scale cropland encroachment. In addition, this work will contribute to the education of a graduate student and further an ongoing collaboration between US and Brazilian scientists.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The PIs will use a before–after-control–impact (BACI) design to ask whether (1) jaguars specializing on aquatic prey have reduced predation pressure on terrestrial species, or (2) whether aquatic subsidies to jaguars lead to increased predation that suppresses mammalian herbivore populations. Comparison of 4-years of pre-fire data to post-fire data (before-after impact), as well as unburnt and burnt areas (control-impact) within the reserve, will allow the PI to determine if the food web in which the jaguar is the apex carnivore is mediated by top-down or bottom-up forces. The PIs will quantify vegetation regeneration, terrestrial and aquatic prey species abundance, and jaguar density and diet for one year starting in September 2021 (one year after the fires). Fast regenerative growth is typical in this region making the timing of the proposed study critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
