<AbstractNarration>The concept of a hot carrier solar cell has long been considered an exciting prospect for the &lt;br/&gt;realization of ultra-high efficiency solar cells with the ability to convert more of the sun’s energy &lt;br/&gt;to useful power. Hot carriers are photogenerated when photons with energy well above the &lt;br/&gt;threshold (or band gap) for absorption in the semiconductor used to produce the solar cell are &lt;br/&gt;absorbed. For most materials, the hot carriers then rapidly interact with the material to generate &lt;br/&gt;heat. This parasitic thermal energy cannot be converted to useful power and is therefore a major &lt;br/&gt;loss process in commercial solar cells. To date, the solar cells used terrestrially are limited to power &lt;br/&gt;conversion efficiencies of ~ 30%. If “hot” photogenerated charge carriers were harnessed prior to &lt;br/&gt;generating heat, the conversation efficiency of a solar cell has been predicted to exceed 60%. This &lt;br/&gt;would significantly reduce system costs and increase the global impact of photovoltaic technology,&lt;br/&gt;therefore contributing significantly to sustainable and clean energy sources. This research also &lt;br/&gt;creates the potential for a new generation of solar cell technologies, generating new devices and &lt;br/&gt;consumer products, as well as having significant implications for future sources of energy. &lt;br/&gt; Extracting hot carriers is, however, extremely challenging, and requires significant innovation &lt;br/&gt;and the development of novel systems and architectures that effectively decouple heat generation &lt;br/&gt;processes. One possible avenue to achieve this goal is via valley photovoltaics, a protocol recently &lt;br/&gt;developed by the PI to store the high energy hot carriers through a natural process observed in high &lt;br/&gt;mobility transistors in which hot carriers transfer to so-called satellite valleys in the structure of &lt;br/&gt;the solar cell absorber. This process slows heat generation and provides the opportunity to remove &lt;br/&gt;these carriers before they lose energy and create heat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this success, there are several important fundamental processes to understand before a &lt;br/&gt;practical valley photovoltaic solar cell can be realized. In particular although the transfer and &lt;br/&gt;storage of hot carriers to the satellite valleys and therefore reduced heat loss has been demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;– the ability to remove the carriers and provide useful voltage and current remains problematic due &lt;br/&gt;to parasitic barriers to carrier extraction in the proof-of-principle devices developed to date. In this&lt;br/&gt;program a comprehensive investigation of III-V heterostructures is proposed encompassing &lt;br/&gt;material growth, optical spectroscopy, and device physics such as to deliver a practical hot carrier &lt;br/&gt;solar cell. The proposed research will take the important new results demonstrated by the PI to&lt;br/&gt;systematically optimize the device design and operation of a hot carrier solar cell based on, or &lt;br/&gt;enhanced by, intervalley scattering. Specifically, material systems and solar cell structures that &lt;br/&gt;enhance hot carrier extraction will require novel barrier/selective-contact layers with specific &lt;br/&gt;properties. Furthermore, novel architectures will be necessary that not only scatter high energy &lt;br/&gt;photocarriers but also sustain large internal electric fields at the operating point of the solar cell,&lt;br/&gt;so photogenerated carriers at lower energies can also be harnessed further improving the efficiency &lt;br/&gt;of the device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The applied and fundamental nature of this work exposes the graduate and undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;students involved in this program to a diverse research activity. This will enable them to develop &lt;br/&gt;considerable practical skills while exposing them to the process of materials development and&lt;br/&gt;technology transfer, an experience unique in graduate research and of significant value to their &lt;br/&gt;future careers. The program also provides research opportunities for minority students, including &lt;br/&gt;summer research in the group of the PI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
