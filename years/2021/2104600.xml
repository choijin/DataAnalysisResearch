<AbstractNarration>This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. A.R. Siders at the University of Delaware, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist to investigate coastal adaptation pathways in the United States. Sustainable development along the United States’ coast is challenging for several reasons, including continual weathering and climatic shocks. These risks are expected to be exacerbated due to climate change. There are currently a wide range of coastal adaptation responses being employed across the United States. The purpose of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the variation in adaptation responses that directly impact households, how these responses were chosen, and also to determine whether the most vulnerable members of communities are benefiting from these responses. The knowledge gained from this research offers the ability to identify gaps in adaptation, track progress, and aid in future decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to generate novel techniques combining diagnostics, historical pathways, and spatial statistics to evaluate adaptation pathways that have led to the current levels and distribution of adaptation in the United States. This research specifically investigates national, state, and local policies (e.g. zoning restrictions) and infrastructure (e.g. seawalls) that can directly influence households’ adaptation decisions, with three coastal communities in the United States serving as case studies. This research is split into four phases, starting with a short prepping period (Phase 1). Phase 2 utilizes a diagnostic approach to generate a status assessment of coastal adaptation in the three communities through the collection of information on adaptation measures employed, socio-demographics, drivers, and characteristics of the built environment. Phase 3 employs a historical pathways analysis to produce a historical narrative and timeline for each community to highlight path dependencies and critical junctures. Finally, Phase 4 assesses coastal adaptation and equity by mapping adaptation measures versus demographic data. By combining these methods, this research has the potential to enhance contextual knowledge that can lead to an improvement in modeling abilities, and therein, enhance decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
