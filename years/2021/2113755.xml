<AbstractNarration>Makerspaces are physical locations that include equipment and tools to allow its users to create and invent prototypes, develop ideas into models, and collaborate to design new products and solutions.  The presence of makerspaces has increased substantially over the last 5 years and are now commonly integrated into undergraduate engineering preparation programs.  The increased attention makerspaces are receiving in the STEM disciplines, and particularly within engineering education, provides justification for examining the influence of these spaces on undergraduate student development into professionals.  There is wide speculation that access to and interactions within makerspaces enhance engineering students' undergraduate learning experiences by exposing the students to activities that enhance their development as engineers.  Yet there is a lack of data supporting the notion that engineering students' involvement in university affiliated makerspace experiences and activities positively influences their professional development.  This project is conducting six case studies of university engineering education makerspace programs to determine the influence of makerspaces on the professional formation of undergraduate engineering students and the use and impact of makerspaces on faculty members.  Building upon the case studies, the project will develop and disseminate a national survey to engineering education students and faculty members working in makerspace-affiliated engineering education programs.  The project will increase our understanding of how makerspaces influence students' professional identity development, motivation, expertise, and propensity for persistence.  Data gathered from this project will document the sustainability and scalability of makerspaces in engineering education programs through examination of undergraduate engineering education students, faculty, programs, and institutions.  Finally, the work informs new lines of research regarding makerspaces in postsecondary professional engineering preparation programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using six two-year long case studies and a nationwide survey, this project is examining the influence of makerspace integration into undergraduate engineering programs.  The project uses interviews, observations, focus groups and artifact analysis (e.g. course syllabi) to longitudinally study 6 makerspace-affiliated engineering education programs.  The project focuses on faculty members' and students' interactions with makerspaces and the impact the makerspaces are having on the development of students' professional identities, motivation, achievement, and persistence.  Case study data is being examined using content analysis applying both a priori and inductive coding approaches.  Case study analysis will inform the development of surveys for a nationwide assessment of makerspace-affiliated university engineering preparation programs.  The research project will inform new lines of inquiry about the formation of engineers and will provide those promoting makerspaces in engineering education programs with data to inform their development and support of their programs.  Results will be shared though host webinars and other virtual outlets.  In addition, via STEM-Central.net, the information is being shared with the larger STEM community and the American Association of Colleges and Universities about models of leadership and organizational structures in makerspaces that can improve the development of engineering students' professional identities.  Furthermore, in collaboration with the Cooperative Extension program at each of the investigators' home institutions, teaching and informative briefs will be disseminated to K-16 STEM teachers and communities through conferences such as the National Science Teacher Association, American Education Research Association, American Society of Engineering Education, and STEMTech. Overall, this work could influence makerspace leaders, engineering faculty members, undergraduate engineering students, and researchers and policymakers interested in makerspaces and STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
