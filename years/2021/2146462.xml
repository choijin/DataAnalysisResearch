<AbstractNarration>Aviation and aerospace cybersecurity is of critical importance to the Nation. As a key component of the overall U.S. transportation infrastructure, it protects people and contributes to American prosperity and leadership. This project promotes workforce development in this vital sector by building on undergraduate and graduate cybersecurity programs at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), where both ERAU campuses (Daytona Beach, FL and Prescott, AZ) have a history of collaborative education and research activities within the aviation and aerospace cybersecurity domain. Known locally as "Cyber Eagles," the project will advance the collaboration ecosystem across education programs and research centers to prepare students for productive cybersecurity careers and leadership roles in federal and state agencies. The program will recruit diverse scholars and create a supportive environment through effective mentorship, a well-developed curriculum, student involvement activities, and research experiences. These project components will help establish a pathway that enables students to participate in an environment where they can excel and enter a rewarding career in government aviation and aerospace administration agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop a high-skilled workforce to cover the Nation’s needs in the area of aviation and aerospace cybersecurity, focusing on the safety-criticality aspects of airborne systems and the protection of associated hardware and software assets. The project will fund 20 scholarships to students over a five-year period. Student scholars will benefit from the strong ties that ERAU has with Federal and state aviation and transportation administration agencies and the aviation and aerospace industry. Scholars will have the opportunity to meet and learn from top cybersecurity engineers and managers from government and industry through aviation and aerospace-themed projects, events, and symposia hosted by ERAU. Furthermore, the project will take advantage of on-site expertise at ERAU in all computation and communication services related to flight operations, including airborne hardware and software, avionics equipment, and network and communication data links among aircraft, ground stations, radar systems, and satellite systems. This expertise places the scholarship students in a unique position to contribute to cybersecurity protection during the design, development, and operation stages of systems specific for the aviation and aerospace domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the CyberCorps® Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a Federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
