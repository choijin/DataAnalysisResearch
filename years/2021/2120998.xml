<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by improving students’ data literacy in environmental science through the creation and evaluation of a minor in environmental technology and data literacy at St. Joseph’s College of Maine, a small, private, liberal arts college. The addition of this minor is expected to improve students’ understanding and use of technology and data for the purpose of solving problems in environmental science. Environmental scientists need to have the ability to collect, analyze, and interpret large data sets to help make informed decisions related to ecosystems. Active learning techniques have been shown to be effective in engaging students in courses and helping students learn important concepts and skills. This project will build on partnerships with public- and private-sector institutions to aid in the development of a curriculum in environmental data literacy skills at the undergraduate level that will be taught using active learning techniques. The impact of the new curriculum on student learning will be assessed by investigating changes in students' data literacy skill competencies and self-efficacy. This minor can serve as a model for other undergraduate institutions, which could help increase the number of students with the data literacy skills that are needed in the environmental science workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to (1) develop courses to improve students’ data literacy skills and (2) provide students with field experiences and research opportunities in a community-based learning format so that students can practice their skills. This project will develop four new courses including Environmental Sensors and Networking, Statistics of Large Data Sets, Interpretation and Application of Environmental Data, and Technical Communication for Environmental Science. An existing capstone course will be modified to focus on integrative environmental data literacy skills using research projects from regional public and private institutions. The project will address two research questions: (1) How does an environmental technology and data literacy minor affect data literacy skill competencies and self-efficacy? (2) How do data literacy and self-efficacy correlate to completion of the minor and post-graduation environmental science related employment or postgraduate education? The study will use a mixed methods approach that will include assessing student learning using a pre- and post-inventory of data literacy skills and assessing self-efficacy using a self-efficacy survey instrument and focus groups. Project results will be disseminated through conference posters, publications, and the creation and implementation of a workshop. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
