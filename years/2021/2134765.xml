<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to use augmented reality (AR) to activate rich and measurable STEM experiences such as engineering design projects for any child anywhere in the world. The market for AR globally and specifically in education is projected to reach over $200 B and $60 B respectively by 2025 by growing at 40% annually.Next Generation Science Standards support the premise that students should be learning the skills of science and engineering by engaging in work like that of scientists and engineers. According to the US STEM 2026 report, core competencies from effective STEM education will be demanded in nearly all job sectors and positions. The proposed technology integrates augmented reality and embedded data collection and analysis for real-time assessment for STEM projects in a classroom environment. By measuring both processes and outcomes, this project can better nurture growth mindsets. The proposed features will reinforce these key pedagogical approaches to promote STEM learning and prepare students with essential STEM career readiness skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to integrate augmented reality into the engineering design process while nurturing higher-level skills essential for workforce success and measuring key learning processes and skills. The data collection, storage, reproduction, analyses and algorithm development, while founded in research, remain sources of technical risk in the field of educational augmented reality. The proposed system encourages students to acknowledge and reflect on their emotions and takes an integrated approach to measuring students social and emotional learning (SEL) during collaborative activities. The research will determine how and to what extent do these activities support elementary students to: 1) develop design thinking and collaborative practices; 2) improve social and emotional skills in collaborative settings; and 3) impact studentsâ€™ content knowledge, interest and self-efficacy in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
