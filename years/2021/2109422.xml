<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow proposes to understand how cells move throughout the developing embryo body to reach the right destination at the right time. This research will use model organisms to understand how these cells function, as this process is conserved across species. The specific cells that will be examined are those that form the head and facial features, as any minor disruptions in this process can lead to a variety of birth defects, including cleft lip. By understanding how these cells move and function in a model organism, the research can potentially contribute to the understanding and development of novel therapies for these birth defects humans. In addition, this project will broaden the participation of under-represented groups in biology by providing the opportunity for them to receive scientific, professional, and personal support through a novel on-campus student and postdoc organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neural crest (NC) cell development is a highly dynamic process that is controlled by a tightly regulated gene regulatory network (GRN) which drives the expression of several transcription factors that drive cell fate, migration, and differentiation. SOX9 and SNAI2 function in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, followed by SOX10 which mediates NC cell migration. The genes that code for these NC transcription factors are expressed during NC development, but little is known about the conserved roles of SNAI2, SOX9, and SOX10 in regulating the expression of each other nor how they specifically control expression of relevant cadherin proteins in the NC cell population. Therefore, this research proposes to determine how three of the most highly expressed NC cell specifiers (SNAI2, SOX9, and SOX10) drive NC specification and regulate NC adhesion in two complementary amniote models, Gallus gallus (chicken) and Coturnix japonica (quail). Aim 1 will define the spatiotemporal localization of SNAI2, SOX9, and SOX10 proteins during NC development and identify the effects of SOX9, SOX10, and SNAI2 functional perturbations and their consequences on cadherin proteins in vivo. Aim 2 will determine the binding partners of SOX9, SOX10 and SNAI2 in chick and quail and characterize SNAI2, SOX9, and SOX10 protein domain functions. This project will contribute to training of the fellow in the following areas: scientific writing, technical skills, mentoring, and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
