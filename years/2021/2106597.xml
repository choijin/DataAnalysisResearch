<AbstractNarration>Materials research and development is empowering novel technologies and enabling competitive energy solutions, which are essential for a sustainable future. In particular, research on materials is contributing to efforts in clean energy generation, energy storage, and carbon sequestration. The proposed work is centered around a strong international collaboration with Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ) scientists, allowing for innovative research based on both experimental and computational studies of materials for sustainable energy technologies. The research will combine advanced synthesis and characterization techniques with novel mechanical testing and simulations. This proposed research will deliver an exceptional international research experience to the participating students guided by three main objectives: (1) to introduce an international research environment to graduate and undergraduate U.S. science and engineering students; (2) to broaden the participation and dissemination of global research; (3) to enhance U.S.-based research and innovation for materials in energy and sustainability through international collaborations. Through recruitment efforts, underrepresented students from the University of Southern California (USC) and from minority serving partner institutions will be encouraged to apply and participate in the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IRES Track I: U.S.-Germany Research Experience for Students on Materials for Energy and Sustainability at USC and FZJ in Germany prepares both graduates and undergraduates, particularly underrepresented science and engineering students, for global research. The project focus is on materials for energy technologies within the framework of climate and environmental protection. The overarching goal is the development of novel engineered materials with enhanced properties and behaviors to empower efficient and sustainable energy solutions. Design-processing-property relationships of materials for high temperature applications, electrochemical storage, and clean energy generation are particularly important in the context of global climate and environmental protection. A long-term scientific goal of this proposal is the development and optimization of new materials for efficient energy technologies. The research theme of the program “Materials for Energy and Sustainability” is strengthened by the collaboration with two elite Institutes at FZJ: “Institute of Energy and Climate Research” and “Institute for Advanced Simulation.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
