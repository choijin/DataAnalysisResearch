<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by continuing to improve and scale Industry 4.0 curricula and expand training sites to grow the nation’s future-ready workforce. The project seeks to address two fundamental issues. One is the need for replicable and scalable Industry 4.0 curricula that can be continuously updated to keep pace with rapid innovations in target industries. Two is the need to strengthen and coordinate partnerships with industry to increase work-based learning and workforce supply. The potential benefits of the project are: customizable curricula that are equity-informed and scalable; a progressively diverse pipeline of skilled workers; and expanded opportunities for upskilling the current workforce to increase their retention in high-demand Industry 4.0 jobs. The project will create and extend synergistic activities that address gaps in post-secondary education, educator preparation, and regional and statewide workforce needs. Several objectives frame the project's efforts. First is to expand career pathways in Industry 4.0 by translating research and evidence-based projects to the development and implementation of technician education and educator preparation. Second is to continuously improve and align career pathways to Industry 4.0 so technicians have the real time, state-of-the industry tools required to successfully complete career preparation and be work ready. And finally, to formalize a model site that has the potential to scale collaborations and support other community college partners within the state or nationwide, and also to engage career training centers, manufacturing sector partnerships, and Manufacturing USA initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of the project includes development of industry-aligned curricular and training resources that will expand access to technological education in advanced manufacturing, educator professional development activities, and creation of an advanced compendium of open-access, peer-authenticated resources for STEM and Industry 4.0 educators. Products will be developed in formats that allow for online and virtual delivery and rapid dissemination to students, educators, workforce training professionals, and employers.  The project will result in benefits to students by accelerating progress toward industry-validated credentials. The project will also benefit educators and industry by facilitating and expanding academic-industry partnerships to build and strengthen connections across Ohio’s advanced manufacturing supply chain. The project will achieve broader impact by leveraging opportunities to scale and disseminate through the Ohio TechNet consortium of community colleges and universities, and it will utilize methods and approaches that enhance equitable access and engagement for underrepresented women and minorities. This expanded collaboration has the potential to lead to a future automation network among Ohio’s institutions of higher education and post-secondary career-technical centers that could engage more deeply with employers seeking an Industry 4.0-skilled and “future-ready” workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
