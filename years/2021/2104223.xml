<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to use recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning to enhance public health challenges in nursing homes. Fever, as a non-specific measure of infection, is commonly observed in a broad range of diseases and pandemics. The proposed AI-powered assessment system will create an effective, non-intrusive tool for empowering nursing home facilities and clinics to combat the spread of contagious diseases and future pandemics, all the while providing a higher health resiliency for our communities. The proposed technology creates a real-time health surveillance system that also may be adopted and customized to a wide range of public health applications that require continuous, non-intrusive health monitoring with predictive analytics and proactive decision making. The proposed research has significant opportunities both in the public and private sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a monitoring system to mitigate the risk and control the spread of epidemic viruses through real-time artificial intelligence, multi-sensor fusion, and video data analytics. In contrast to existing approaches that have a narrow focus with limited intelligence capabilities, the proposed technology offers a holistic solution to enable scalable, reliable symptom assessment and contact tracing from a distance with strict personal privacy measures ensured. By utilizing both red green blue (RGB) and thermal cameras (off-the-shelf products), it may be possible to provide a more precise system that is capable of monitoring several health indicators simultaneously; e.g., body temperature, respiratory rate, coughing, and sneezing while taking a non-intrusive approach. The proposed device is equipped with an AI-enabled contact tracing system for reducing the spread of viruses by identifying the potentially infected individuals at the early stage. For privacy-aware contact tracing, the plan is to leverage previously developed technology for real-time privacy built-in human pose estimation, re-identification, trajectory analysis, and activity recognition. The technology creates lightweight, end-to-end execution of real-time computer vision based on RGB cameras, with the ability to perform at a high frame rate on embedded and edge devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
