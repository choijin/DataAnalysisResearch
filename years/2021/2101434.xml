<AbstractNarration>This research project focuses on questions within arithmetic geometry. As the name suggests, this research area sits at the interface of two fields: arithmetic (the study of whole numbers and fractions); and geometry (the study of curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional shapes). These distinct areas are brought together through the study of solutions to polynomial equations, that is, the study of varieties. A guiding philosophy of arithmetic geometry is that "geometry controls arithmetic," in other words, that the geometric properties of a variety (those that can be studied in terms of the complex numbers) influence the arithmetic behavior of the variety. The broad goals of this project are to better understand the influence of geometry on two arithmetic properties: rationality over the ground field, and the existence of isolated points. The research involves several projects for students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project concerns a systematic study of an arithmetic measure of the failure of k-rationality, focusing on geometrically rational threefolds that have a conic bundle structure or that have a fibration into high degree del Pezzo surfaces. These two types of varieties together cover a large swath of all geometrically rational threefolds. In another direction, the project aims to gather more information on isolated points on curves. The aims in this direction are twofold: 1) determine whether the Bombieri-Lang conjecture and the torsion conjecture imply that the number of isolated points on a curve is bounded depending solely on its genus, and 2) compute all isolated points on a collection of modular curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
