<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021,&lt;br/&gt;Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes,&lt;br/&gt;Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that&lt;br/&gt;will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The fellow will conduct research&lt;br/&gt;focusing on polygenic traits, which are defined as the physical characteristics, or phenotypes, of&lt;br/&gt;an organism that are influenced by many genes located throughout an individual’s genome.&lt;br/&gt;Examples of polygenic traits include numerous human diseases and the resilience of coral reefs&lt;br/&gt;to global climate change. The fellow will conduct experiments to understand: (1) how genetic&lt;br/&gt;differences between individuals give rise to differences in the physical expression of polygenic&lt;br/&gt;traits and (2) how polygenic traits evolve in natural populations. Through this, the fellow largely&lt;br/&gt;aims to lend insight into the extent to which genetic information can be used to accurately predict&lt;br/&gt;an individual’s phenotype. Throughout the duration of this fellowship, the fellow will engage in&lt;br/&gt;outreach efforts that specifically aim to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To resolve the genetic basis and evolutionary dynamics of polygenic traits, the fellow&lt;br/&gt;will study populations of Drosophila melanogaster as they rapidly evolve in response to seasonal&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations in the environment. This system provides a lens to directly observe evolution and&lt;br/&gt;selection, both on individual genes and specific polygenic traits throughout the course of&lt;br/&gt;adaptation. This work will focus on three polygenic traits in D. melanogaster with demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;ecological relevance in natural populations. The first aim of the fellow’s research will involve&lt;br/&gt;mapping the genetic basis of each trait as it rapidly evolves between seasons. Through this, the&lt;br/&gt;fellow aims to determine whether the genotype-to-phenotype map is stable during evolution, or&lt;br/&gt;whether the genetic basis of polygenic traits is altered by the evolutionary process. The second&lt;br/&gt;aim will leverage these results, in combination with 7 years of existing data, to explore the extent to&lt;br/&gt;which those genetic polymorphisms that underpin the phenotypic variation of a polygenic trait&lt;br/&gt;are the same as those that respond to natural selection and drive the evolution of the trait through&lt;br/&gt;time. The fellow will further gain extensive formal and informal training in preparation for a&lt;br/&gt;career of academic research and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
