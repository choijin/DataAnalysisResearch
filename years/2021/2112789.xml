<AbstractNarration>This award supports the research activities of Professor Joshua Berger at Colorado State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bulk of matter we have observed in the Universe is dark and has so far only been seen by its gravitational pull on visible particles. Detecting and determining the nature of dark matter are among the highest priority goals of particle physics in the coming years.  While dedicated experiments have been built to look for some dark matter candidates, recent efforts have demonstrated that even experiments not expressly built to look for dark matter can make important contributions to the hunt for these elusive particles.  The bulk of Professor Berger’s research aims to develop models and predictions of dark matter that can be seen at experiments designed to study other phenomena such as neutrinos and atoms, creating valuable synergy with other areas of physics.  Research into the nature of dark matter thus contributes to the national interest by promoting progress in answering fundamental scientific questions as to the nature of the universe and its basic building blocks.  This project will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Berger plans to train students and post-doctoral scientists in advanced physics research methods, as well as in state-of-the-art computing techniques. He will also present the results of his research in both public and scientific presentations, and incorporate aspects of his research in the curricula for courses he teaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In technical terms, this research encompasses searches for dark sector particles at current and future neutrino and atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics experiments.  This research also involves studying alternate cosmological histories to develop new mechanisms for baryogenesis. Ongoing and upcoming neutrino experiments such as the accelerator-based Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) experiments and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be able to detect dark matter and long-lived dark states produced in collisions of their very intense proton beams with a target. Large volume experiments such as the DUNE far detector can also be sensitive to astrophysical dark matter interacting in the detector. Professor Berger will explore hidden sector models such as Higgs Portal models leading to dark sector particles produced in the beams at these experiments. He will further explore dark matter models such as boosted dark matter and macroscopic dark matter which lead to dark matter from astrophysical sources interacting in neutrino detectors. He will develop new simulation tools needed to investigate these models and propose new search strategies to ensure that interesting signals are not missed. His work will also encompass a collaboration with an AMO experimentalist, Professor Samuel Brewer at Colorado State University, to develop searches for dark matter in high-precision atomic measurements performed in Professor Brewer’s lab.  Finally, he will study the properties of a possible phase of the early universe in which the weak force becomes strongly coupled, leading to the possibility of a new mechanism for baryogenesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
