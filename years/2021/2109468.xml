<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Life history strategies are defined as the pattern of survival and reproduction for a species, and are informed by important factors such as growth, reproduction, and maintenance. Life history strategies can be fast (early reproduction and short lifespan) to slow (late reproduction and long lifespan), and everything in between. The costs and benefits of fast or slow life histories depend on environmental conditions. Constant and resource rich environments favor fast life histories. In contrast, in environments where resource availability fluctuates, slow life histories are favored. Since environmental variability is increasing with global climate change, life history could help protect species and ecosystems from negative consequences or population declines. To enable predictions about the potential for species to adapt and persist in new environments, this research will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that underpin life history evolution. To broaden participation of underrepresented groups in academia the fellow will develop and facilitate workshops on inclusive mentorship and leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will leverage a model system with a life history polymorphism, the wing-dimorphic variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps. A bulk segregant analysis will identify genetic variants underlying wing-morphology and timing of reproduction in long- and short-wing cricket morphs that trade-off between flight-capability and reproduction. This will test the hypothesis that genes regulating developmental switches and rates of physiological processes control the timing of major life history events and set the pace of life. The fellow will also develop a Gillespie eco-evolutionary model (GEM) for the evolution of wing dimorphism. The model will determine how genetic-and-environmental interactions alter the fitness costs and benefits of alternative life history strategies, enabling predictions about the evolutionary trajectory of life history polymorphisms. To broaden participation, the fellow will prepare graduate students to mentor undergraduate students from low-income, first generation, and minority backgrounds by facilitating inclusive mentorship training workshops. Additionally, leadership workshops will provide the fellow and other postdocs training in leadership strategies that can be applied to foster more collaborative, inclusive, and equitable laboratory and research environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
