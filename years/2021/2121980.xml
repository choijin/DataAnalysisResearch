<AbstractNarration>Colorado State University will tackle the significant nation-wide problem of inequity among faculty members in Science, Technology, Math and Engineering (STEM) disciplines. Specifically, this project aims to improve equity in recruitment, retention and promotion, with a focus on gender equity that recognizes the other types of cultural, ethnic, physical, and economic backgrounds people have. The work thus targets improved diversity in STEM disciplines. This problem is important because more diverse workforces are more effective at solving problems, and in a more just society, university faculty composition would reflect availability of doctoral graduates without bias. This problem has not already been solved because inequities are complex and embedded into the history of US society and academia. It is not intractable, however, and through carefully executing projects, Colorado State aims to improve equity across the STEM faculty. To address inequities, the project team aims to adapt a number of evidence-based best practices to particular situations at Colorado State. The project targets four major changes. 1) A revised approach to recruiting new faculty. 2) Improved unit climates through training allies to intervene when they notice inequities. 3) Improved performance review processes with training and support for review committees. 4) Enhanced leadership through education in equity who are both empowered to and accountable for making change. The expected outcomes of the project activities are improved climate and culture for all, and improved recruitment and retention leading to greater equity and diversity in STEM units across campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of ADVANCE Adaptation: CSU STEPS for Gender Equity: Advancing Structures through Evidence-based Practices for Gender Equity is to transform university and unit structures and culture to improve climate and gender equity on STEM faculties, with an intersectional focus on women with identities that historically have been marginalized. The specific aims are as follows: 1) enhance recruitment, 2) improve retention through training Promotion and Tenure Committees, creating a cadre of equity-minded Allies, and collecting qualitative data to understand departures and retentions, and 3) support and train unit leaders in equity efforts. Thus, the scope of the project encompasses equity across all phases of faculty careers and on into leadership. The research methods include quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluate success in providing participants with new skills, in improving department climate, and in retention outcomes. Expected results include an increase in equitable recruitment and retention, improved climate, and a better understanding of the specific barriers faculty face. The project aims to contribute to research literature in organizational change and equity. Outcomes and findings will be disseminated at conferences, in academic publications, and in articles and talks for broad audiences. The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE "Adaptation" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institution of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
