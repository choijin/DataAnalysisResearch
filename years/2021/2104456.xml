<AbstractNarration>This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Brian Codding at the University of Utah, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the environmental and social drivers of prehistoric conflict in the North American southwest. This project will help to develop an archaeological research program to evaluate the multivariate drivers of conflict. Developing formal quantitative models will allow archaeologists to engage with conflict research on a broad social science frontier. This research will develop and test general hypotheses that can explain variability in prehistoric conflict and produce a large high-resolution dataset that can be accessed by future researchers. Further, the project will contribute to southwestern archaeology by investigating conflict in a region that has been systematically understudied and improving data quality for the largest southwestern archaeological database.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate change, political instability, and demographic pressure are all factors responsible for promoting conflict in the modern world. It is less clear whether these phenomena drove violent behavior during human prehistory and the degree to which these variables promote conflict over centuries or millennia. This project will address these issues by (1) developing computational tools to measure variation in prehistoric conflict and storing the resulting data on a centralized online platform, (2) developing general models that bridge individual motivations with macro-scale patterns to evaluate the drivers of conflict, and (3) testing model predictions using an archaeological case study. This project will help to develop an archaeological research program to evaluate the multivariate drivers of intergroup violence. Developing formal quantitative models will allow archaeologists to engage with conflict research on a broad social science frontier. This project will train graduate and undergraduate students in the generation of large quantitative databases and the methods used to test research hypotheses. It will also train one postdoctoral fellow in spatial modeling, which will aid in his pursuit of a tenure-track position in scientific archaeology. This project will also work with the University of Utah Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program to recruit students who are underrepresented in STEM and train them in archaeological, osteological, and statistical methods, as well as introducing them to the prehistory of the project area. The project will work with the American Indian Resource Center to recruit American Indian students to work on the project. This is particularly important as the project area is adjacent to the Navajo Nation. Project results will be distributed to the public through interactive web applications hosted on the project web site and public presentations at the Natural History Museum of Utah, which is visited by over 45,000 K-12 students and educators annually, many of whom travel from rural, Tribal, and refugee communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
