<AbstractNarration>Cyber infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI) are core components of smart manufacturing in South Carolina (SC), West Virginia (WV), and the United States. To drive radical transformation of industry, factories must securely expand beyond their physical boundaries. These Future Factories (FF) consume and create interdisciplinary knowledge along with the ability to forge innovative technological transformations. This project introduces a novel future cyber-manufacturing paradigm – the Factory-to-Factory (F2F) network framework. Geared towards automation, F2F networks require interoperability of stakeholders and efficient understanding systems for data, information, and knowledge. This collaboration between academia – led by the University of South Carolina and West Virginia University - and industry will produce advanced smart manufacturing technologies and an educated upskilled workforce in SC and WV. Furthermore, it will create a blueprint model for future manufacturing technologies that can be integrated with a F2F network to increase small-scale and industrial manufacturing capabilities across the US. To expand our workforce infrastructure, we will establish a lifelong learning pipeline for smart manufacturing ranging from K-12 education, higher education, to professional development support for scholars and industrial professionals. Particularly, we will create online learning resources and STEM-oriented smart manufacturing summer programs for K-12 students and provide internships for college and graduate students through our industrial partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will adapt, enhance, and integrate informational technologies (IT) and operational technologies (OT) such as real-time secured sensing, high performance computing, wireless communications, and AI, to support process optimization among distributed smart manufacturing systems for F2F. Convergence and true progress can only be achieved by fusing expert knowledge of manufacturing processes with newly emerged hardware and software technologies. The project focuses on manufacturing knowledge stemming from: (1) autonomous feature extraction and recognition from product ‘manufacturing DNAs’ as a novel manufacturing knowledge representation among distributed systems, (2) architecture of interactive cyber spaces that combines cross-platform simulation results within product lifecycles, (3) data-driven control theories during process monitoring leading to rapid autonomous decision-making in replacement of manual input/output modules, and (4) robust business models and operations research (information service-oriented) concerning autonomous Key Performance Indicator (KPI) decomposition among distributed sub-systems and rapid feedback control loops. This will build a foundation for real-time production information sharing and control platforms and facilitate manufacturing knowledge generation and utilization among networked systems to address manufacturing management challenges. Furthermore, it enables human interventions and interoperations in the development and decision-making process of these highly collaborative networked smart manufacturing systems. This project will showcase several novel cyber manufacturing implementations and establish a roadmap towards a universal digital F2F standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
