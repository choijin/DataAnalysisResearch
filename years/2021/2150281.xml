<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The global pandemic and dwindling computer chip manufacturing here in the United States has impacted the production of chips. This has national security and economic implications that could impact US citizens’ livelihood. There is bipartisan support through pending legislation to bring back and reinvigorate computer chip manufacturing here in the United States to ensure a global competitive advantage and further enhance national security. To keep pace with this growth, an increase in a diverse, innovative, and globally competitive workforce is a necessity. Meanwhile, there has always been a need to increase the representation of underserved groups in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Therefore, this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Texas at Dallas will establish an engaging exploration into the research methods for the evaluation and fundamental understanding of electronic materials and devices for use in energy, electronics, nanotechnology and sensing/detecting. Ten undergraduate Fellows will engage in an immersive 10-week summer research program focused on technologically relevant materials and analytical techniques for future innovations that will spark the next generation of talent for the high-tech industry. The program will also provide exposure to and guidance on graduate education, research methods, and research careers. This REU program will serve the state and surrounding region through undergraduate research opportunities to first-generation, underrepresented minorities and women scholars that attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) in Texas and surrounding states, and DFW community colleges. The desire is for these students to pursue graduate studies and careers in advanced computer chip manufacturing and technology fields as the US works to re-establish this critical area in America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site at the University of Texas at Dallas will establish engaging fundamental research exploration in modeling, fabrication, and characterization of materials and devices. This research has implications on materials understanding for use in neuromorphic, nanophotonic, optoelectronic, ferroelectric, perovskites, carbon nanotubes, and quantum transport at the nanoscale for use in energy, electronics, nanotechnology, microfluidics, low-temperature device fabrication, and sensing/detecting fields. Ten undergraduate Fellows will engage in an immersive 10-week summer research program that will spark the next generation of talent for the high-tech industry. This Program includes: material from the PI’s undergraduate research methods course (e.g., research fundamentals, design of experiments, publishing, etc.), preparing for and applying to graduate school, specific training for the Fellow’s summer research, informal research seminars from faculty and outside experts, visits to local high tech industries, and seminars on ethics.   This REU program will serve the state and surrounding region through undergraduate research opportunities to first-generation, underrepresented minorities and women scholars that attend HBCUs, MSIs in Texas and surrounding states, and Dallas Fort Worth community colleges. The desire is for these students to pursue graduate studies and careers in advanced semiconductor manufacturing and technology fields as the US works to re-establish this critical area in America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
