<AbstractNarration>This award supports the NSF-CBMS conference "Interface of Mathematical Biology and Linear Algebra" to be held at the University of Central Florida, during May 23-27, 2022. The 5-day conference will feature three principal speakers who will co-deliver 10 main lectures. Professor Pauline van den Driessche, who has pioneered many advancements at the interface of mathematical biology and linear algebra in the past 40 years, will deliver 4 of these main lectures. Expertise and further insight on linear algebra and mathematical biology will be provided by two sets of 3 lectures, delivered by Professor Stephen Kirkland and Professor Mark Lewis, respectively. These 10 lectures will highlight the most cutting-edge research at the intersection of these two branches of mathematical research, and promote the development of new tools and techniques in linear algebra and practical applications in mathematical biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference is at the cutting-edge research at the interface of mathematical biology and linear algebra, two long-time interacting mathematical fields, which have witnessed significant new advances at a higher level. Specifically, recent advances of new algebraic theories and novel applications of classic matrix results have helped resolve many challenges in mathematical biology, while biologically-driven research problems have attracted an increasing number of researchers in the field of linear algebra. The conference will bring together both groups of researchers who have been working on biologically-driven algebraic problems and/or algebraically-forced biological applications, provide a unique platform to communicate the recent advances in their fields, strengthen the existing and initiate new collaborations across the two branches, and, most importantly, showcase the interface of mathematical biology and linear algebra for early-career researchers and graduate students. Further information about the conference will be available at the website: https://sciences.ucf.edu/math/cbms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
