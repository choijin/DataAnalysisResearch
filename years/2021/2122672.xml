<AbstractNarration>Broadening access to computing is a priority for the nation as the skills and knowledge related to computer science are increasingly needed across various sectors of the economy. However, without a more systematic effort towards developing inclusive computing education, particularly as early as the K-8 grades, many students will be left out of the opportunities created by these jobs. Of particular interest in this project are students for whom English is not their first language. Research has shown these students learn best when their multilingual fluency is supported in the classroom. Integrating computing with math and science instruction and developing teaching practices that allow students to move between languages will demonstrate how all learners, regardless of their proficiency with the English language, can become successful at computing, math, and science. This research project is designed to help teachers build their own competence in teaching computing and provide structural supports for these new teaching practices, while also evaluating the impact of a hybrid computing curriculum for multilingual students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, researchers will partner with teachers to co-design a math and science curriculum that integrates computing and supports hybrid language practices and draws on students’ lived experience. The project includes support for a Professional Learning Community for grade 6 teachers so they can collaborate and reflect on the developing pedagogy. The project team will work in 20 classrooms, reaching 350-400 students from an underserved and underrepresented community. The project is designed to (1) build capacity for teachers with limited experience teaching computing, (2) identify ways to support students’ hybrid learning practices in an integrated curriculum, (3) understand the trajectory of teaching with this approach, and (4) document how these activities impact student learning and support the development of STEM identities for multilingual learners. The project includes three research questions: (1) How do teachers as co-designers find opportunities to integrate computing into their math and science curriculum and support hybrid language practices? (2) How do teachers refine their pedagogical practices over the course of 2 years through reflection on key moments from their own and their colleagues’ teaching? (3) How does an integrated CT-MS approach that leverages hybrid language practices support student learning about computing, math and science and the development of their STEM identity? The data collection and analysis will use video of classrooms, artifacts of teachers’ planning, surveys and interviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded through the CS for All: Research and RPPs program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
