<AbstractNarration>The very fast and dynamic ocean biological carbon pump (OBCP) plays a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle and in setting concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Photosynthetic organisms that  that fuel the OCBP live and die on a week to week basis, and the resulting sinking (or export) of organic and inorganic carbon particles from the surface layer and consumption losses of these particles in deeper waters are similarly variable. Simply stated, the OCBP is poorly understood due to dependence on short- term, and seasonally and spatially limited ship observations; thus model estimates of its strength and future trajectory are highly uncertain. To address this gap, the investigators will engineer and sea-test two robotic Lagrangian Ocean Carbon Observer (OCO) floats capable of 8 month to multi-year missions, yet able to resolve flux processes on hourly to daily time scales and relay data in real time via satellite telemetry while operating anywhere in the ocean. The development of the OCO enables the identification of specific pathways and controls on the vertical transfer of particulate organic and inorganic carbon (POC and PIC) from the surface ocean to subsurface waters. The project logically follows on from the investigator’s development and successful deployment of robotic Lagrangian Carbon Explorer (CE) and Carbon Flux Explorer (CFE) floats, which measure optically POC and PIC concentration and flux variability to depths of 1000 m. A unique capability of the CFE is that it is able to measure the sinking flux of carbon carried by different sizes and classes of particles. The project will merge CFE and CE capabilities to create the OCO. The team will contribute to the development of a STEM workforce by engaging UC Berkeley undergraduates and one graduate student in all phases (development, laboratory, seagoing, and interpretive) of the project and in the class room. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, CFEs and two new Ocean Carbon Observers (OCOs) that simultaneously measure both particle flux and concentration profiles will be constructed and test-deployed at sea in January 2023. During the times that these autonomous instruments drift at target depths within the upper kilometer (interrupted by transit to the surface for location and real time bidirectional telemetry), they will autonomously quantify the inherent optical properties and size distributions of sinking material captured. Bishop et al. (2016; Biogeosciences 13, 3019-3129, doi:10.5194/bg-13-3109) describe CFE capabilities and methodology for rendering raw OSR imagery to rigorously defined inherent optical measures of particle loading -- attenuance and cross-polarized photon yield. Bourne et al. (2019; Biogeosciences, 16, 1249-1264; doi:10.5194/bg-16-1249-2019) show that attenuance is strongly correlated (r^2 &gt; 0.86) with POC and PN sampled at 150 m by sampler-equipped CFEs “(CFE-Cal floats)” over a broad range of particle flux and particle size distributions. Planned further deployment of the CFE-Cal floats to sample sinking material to depths of at least 500 m will enable validation of our calibration of the attenuance proxy and to enable a first calibration of the PIC optical flux proxy. Bourne et al. (2021; Biogeosciences, 18, 3053–3086, doi:10.5194/bg-18-3053-2021) demonstrate the unique capability of CFEs to resolve and quantify the vertical flux carried by different particle size classes in the mesopelagic; furthermore, they describe prototype algorithms that will lead to flux size-distribution analysis in real time on the CFEs. The project will enable fully autonomous long-term deployments of CFE and OCO systems in the global ocean. The involvement a commercial float vendor (MRV Systems) and sensor manufacturer (Seabird Scientific) may lead to a commercialization pathway for the OCO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
