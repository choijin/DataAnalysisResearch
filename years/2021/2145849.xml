<AbstractNarration>Many bacteria use a nanosyringe on their surface to inject proteins into host cells to facilitate infection.&lt;br/&gt;These injected proteins, called effectors, are normally folded into specific three-dimensional structures&lt;br/&gt;required to carry out their functions. However, they need to be mechanically unfolded by the syringe&lt;br/&gt;machinery to be secreted through the needle and into the host where they refold to their normal structure.&lt;br/&gt;To facilitate their secretion, effector proteins are easy to unfold mechanically—they are mechanically&lt;br/&gt;labile—whereas proteins that are mechanically robust cannot be secreted. However, what makes proteins&lt;br/&gt;mechanically labile or robust is poorly understood. This project addresses this knowledge gap. A carefully&lt;br/&gt;chosen set of model proteins and state of the art experimental and computational tools will be used to&lt;br/&gt;elucidate what makes a protein secretable by bacterial nanosyringes. This will define a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;bacterial infection mechanism and may also allow future engineering of the system to inject proteins of&lt;br/&gt;interest into host cells. More generally, the project will advance the field by helping define the rules for&lt;br/&gt;protein mechanical stability. The combination of biophysical and computational approaches provides an&lt;br/&gt;outstanding cross-training opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students in the physical and&lt;br/&gt;biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How protein mechanical stability is encoded—how unfolding by mechanical force is modulated by&lt;br/&gt;sequence and structure—is poorly understood. This project addresses this knowledge gap by examining&lt;br/&gt;proteins secreted by the bacterial Type III Secretion System (TTSS), called effectors, as model systems.&lt;br/&gt;The TTSS mechanically unfolds and secretes its effectors while other proteins stall in the secretion&lt;br/&gt;apparatus. The PI’s team discovered that TTSS effectors are mechanically labile compared to their noneffector&lt;br/&gt;homologs. In this project, they explore the hypothesis that effectors have evolved to be&lt;br/&gt;mechanically labile, so they can be unfolded by a weak TTSS unfoldase, explaining their extreme sequence&lt;br/&gt;divergence from their non-effector homologs. The system provides a naturally occurring model to&lt;br/&gt;understand how mechanical stability is modulated by sequence. The collaborative approach combines: (i)&lt;br/&gt;a high-precision single molecule assay to determine mechanical properties of TTSS effectors and their noneffector&lt;br/&gt;homologs; (ii) steered molecular dynamics simulations to provide a theoretical model of the&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of differential mechanical stability within a conserved fold; and (iii) live-cell imaging to test&lt;br/&gt;the effect of different mechanical stabilities in TTSS secretion. This provides a comprehensive, quantitative,&lt;br/&gt;and physiologically validated model for how mechanical stability is encoded and it impact on TTSS&lt;br/&gt;secretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is funded by the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate of Biological Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
