<AbstractNarration>In recent years, conservation scientists have recognized the importance of partnerships with stakeholders outside of academe to innovate and realize measurable conservation outcomes.  Knowledge partnerships represent a form of knowledge production that can advance public value outcomes. While public value is an important concept in science and innovation policy research and management, there is little research on how partnerships between institutions can deliver public value, especially in conservation science. We propose to study how and when the supply of and demand for conservation knowledge are linked.  In particular, we seek to examine, 1) What are the mechanisms by which the demand for knowledge informs the production and supply of science in conservation?; 2) What role do knowledge partnerships play in linking the supply of and demand for conservation knowledge, and what effect does the design of these partnerships have on their ability to deliver public value?; and 3) How can research projects and knowledge partnerships be designed to avoid public value failures, improve the connection between the production and use of science, and thus increase the public value of scientific activity?  Our proposed research builds on our recent work on determinants of the supply of public value outcomes in conservation science. By analyzing experiences of knowledge users and the possibilities inherent in knowledge partnerships as a distinct organizational form, we aim to understand the organizational configurations best suited for facilitating demand-driven conservation science. Our proposed research will provide a model and tools for achieving and enhancing public value outcomes in conservation science and related fields. The identification of indicators of public value success is directly translatable and adaptable to governmental, private and non-profit organizations. This research will provide guidelines on how to design knowledge partnerships for public value and will offer new models of institutional partnerships to address complex social and ecological aspects of biodiversity conservation, thus enabling solutions that are relevant, culturally sensitive, economically viable and nimble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed research will provide an evidence-based approach for maximizing public value outcomes in the production of conservation science. Realizing public value outcomes in research entails structuring scientific research collaborations to meet established knowledge needs rather than producing knowledge for which there is no demand.  Public value outcomes in research also entails structuring institutions to provide incentives for public value outcomes; and structuring and scaling research programs and collaborations for impact based upon approaches documented to have the best potential for success. In examining the communication and translation processes that link knowledge users to knowledge producers, we will focus specifically on those who often have not been included in these processes. With public value creation as the guiding principle, we will uncover lessons for the design of research projects, partnerships and knowledge-producing organizations. We will produce a framework for understanding how the processes of scientific research can be transformed to be more inclusive of stakeholders and improve the connection between the production and use of science, thus increasing the public value of scientific activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
