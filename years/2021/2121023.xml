<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by improving academic performance and understanding for undergraduate college students in organic chemistry. Understanding and learning from chemical structure representations is an important part of learning chemistry concepts and how to apply them. For many students, visualizing 3D structures of molecules to develop an understanding of complex organic chemical reactions can be challenging. Previous work has shown that 3D graphics for physical representations can have a positive impact on student achievement. This project will develop and assess interactive visualization software that will provide physically accurate 3D animations of organic and organometallic reactions to improve student learning. It is expected that students who use this application will be more engaged in learning, develop a deeper understanding of chemical reactions, and improve their spatial reasoning skills. The project will assess the impact of the application on instructor motivation, students’ spatial reasoning skills, and students’ understanding of chemical reactions based on quantitative and qualitative data from interviews, focus groups, tests, and quizzes. The application will be made freely available to the public through online stores and information on the use of the application will be disseminated to the chemical education community thorough online videos, social media, and professional conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to improve student learning of organic chemical reactions using an interactive animation application that can be used by instructors in teaching organic chemistry as well as students. The animations will be based on physically correct quantum-mechanical calculations to produce molecular dynamics simulations that represent reaction pathway trajectories. A smartphone application that displays the animations will be developed in an iterative manner using instructor feedback, student feedback, and literature data. Focus groups, surveys, and think-alouds will be used to support the iterative development process. The qualitative data that is elicited will be analyzed using NVivo to obtain insights on instructor and student perceptions of the application. To assess the effectiveness of the application, student success on designed quizzes will be compared for control and treatment groups of students. The quiz questions will probe 3D elements of organic chemistry. To determine the impact of the application on students’ spatial reasoning skills, the Purdue Visualization of Rotation Test (PVRT) will be administered to students involved in the study at the end of their organic chemistry course. Student performance on this test will be compared for those who used the application versus those who did not use it. Statistical analysis of this quantitative data will be used to determine differences in student performance. Project results will be disseminated to the chemical education community via publication and regular presentations at scientific meetings. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
