<AbstractNarration>Relational algebra (RA) forms a basis of primitive operations such as join, projection, aggregation, and selection that transform one or more input relations (i.e., database tables) into an output relation. It can be used to implement algorithms in graph analytics, deductive databases, program analysis, satisfiability, constraint solving, and machine learning. High-performance RA has the potential to extract vast untapped parallelism from critical applications. Despite this great expressive power, investigation of RA within the HPC community has been limited and significant advances are needed to scale RA on next-generation HPC systems. This work will advance the state of art by developing novel algorithms for massively parallel relational algebra on exascale HPC systems such as the Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). In the context of heterogeneous systems (i.e., those using multiple distinct compute paradigms in concert, like Aurora), this work will address key scaling concerns including workload decomposition, load balancing, communication, and I/O. This work will establish foundations for long-term collaboration with ANL towards the development of foundational theory, practical implementations, and rigorous evaluations of parallel RA. The project will support a graduate student from an underrepresented minority and lay groundwork for a high-impact dissertation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owing to increasing inter-network data-movement costs and power constraints, exascale systems are increasingly shifting toward heterogeneous computing environments, with CPUs being coupled with coprocessors such as GPUs. Aurora Supercomputer at Argonne national lab is an example of a leadership-class heterogeneous system; every Aurora node is equipped with multiple GPU co-processors. This work will lead to the development of parallel algorithms for RA, in the context of Aurora specifically and heterogeneous systems more broadly, over three key phases: (1) development of core RA algorithms for multi-GPU nodes; (2) extending these algorithms to supercomputers with many nodes, like Aurora; (3) extending the whole compute process to include scalable parallel IO. First, phase (1) will require investigating three technical approaches for the RA itself, extending them to multi-GPU nodes: (i) radix-hash, (ii) sort-merge, and (iii) nested-loop. Second, in phase (2) the work will investigate inter-node balancing of RA primitives and techniques to minimize data movement across multi-node systems. Finally, in phase (3) a customized parallel IO system and storage model will be developed that will take into account the deepening memory hierarchy available on modern supercomputers. These innovations across three phases will be evaluated using the ALCF supercomputer Aurora, using three application domains: graph mining, static program analysis, and deductive databases for scientific simulations. With exascale insight, this research is poised to create a new generation of applications based on relational algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
