<AbstractNarration>How organisms’ external characteristics or traits are encoded in their genomes and how they change over time represent important and largely unanswered biological questions. This project will address these questions by studying the metabolisms and genomes of the more than 1,000 known species of budding yeasts and their evolution. Some of these yeast species are important opportunistic pathogens, while others are of great industrial relevance as producers of foods, beverages, medicines, and biofuels. This project will span multiple scales of biological organization (from molecules to cells, species, and beyond) and ~400 million years of evolution to yield fundamental insights into how traits are encoded in genomes, how new functions evolve, and how the relationship between traits and genomes itself evolves. The project will support the Wild YEAST and Computational Genomics Programs, two established and highly successful educational and training programs that immerse early-stage undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, in authentic, discovery-driven research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using draft genomes for nearly all known budding yeast species and state-of-the-art genome-editing tools that are broadly active in diverse species, this project will predict the connection of every metabolic gene in every yeast species’ genome to its function(s), as well as examine the evolution of every known metabolic gene, pathway, and trait across the budding yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. Through genome-scale evolutionary analyses and targeted functional experiments on key representative taxa spanning budding yeast genomic and metabolic diversity, this project will functionally characterize how between-taxa variation at the level of genotypes gives rise to variation at the level of phenotypes. In particular, the project will chart how variation at the level of DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites sequentially transforms genetic variation into biochemical functions and physiological traits with an emphasis on functionally characterizing gaps and correcting discrepancies in the predicted Genotype-Phenotype Map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Evolutionary Processes program in the Division of Environmental Biology and the Genetic Mechanisms program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences of the Directorate for Biological Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
