<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports experimental research on a special type of superconductivity called odd-parity superconductivity. Odd-parity superconductivity is an extremely rare and unusual phase of matter that is highly interesting from a fundamental science perspective. There are limited known real examples of this phase in nature, however, finding new materials that are odd-parity superconductors is crucial for progress in the field. Perhaps the most exciting prospect of odd-parity superconductivity is the possibility of finding a topological superconducting phase. Such a phase is predicted to have applications in future quantum information technologies. Positive results of this project will confirm longstanding theoretical ideas and may have far-reaching consequences for quantum technology development. Just as the advent of the computer age is strongly tied to the harnessing of silicon to build transistor circuitry, the development of quantum computers will require a robust material platform that can overcome quantum decoherence. Odd-parity superconductors may be the key to achieving this goal. This project integrates research with education and outreach. It provides for mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and includes science outreach in the local community, with a special emphasis on broadening the participation of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project experimentally tests the hypothesis that odd-parity superconductivity is likely to emerge in proximity to fluctuations of a coexistent polar order parameter. This hypothesis is motivated by recent theoretical work showing enhanced odd-parity Cooper pairing in materials with both strong spin-orbit coupling and fluctuating inversion symmetry breaking order. Intrinsic odd-parity superconducting phases like this are important because they comprise one of the few known routes to realizing topological superconductivity, which has potential applications in quantum information science and the quest to build a quantum computer. To achieve these goals, this project involves developing novel experimental tools to establish the existence of spontaneous proximate polar phases in native superconductors, suppress the polar order parameter to enhance quantum critical fluctuations, and study the effects of the polar fluctuations on the superconducting pairing symmetry. Ultimately, this project will yield ways to reliably detect and characterize odd-parity superconducting phases that emerge in proximity to coexistent polar phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
