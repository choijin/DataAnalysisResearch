<AbstractNarration>Part I:&lt;br/&gt;The ongoing Artificial Intelligence revolution is possible due to progresses in two distinct areas. The first is the development of novel algorithms in machine learning paradigms such as Reinforcement Learning, that overcome long-standing challenges; the second is the breakthroughs in cloud computing infrastructure based on large data centers that enables one to collect, store and process large amounts of data very easily and at a short notice. In spite of tremendous success stories in both these areas, fundamental trade-offs and optimal performance is not understand and theory lags far behind practice. In spite of seeming to be very distinct problems, both Reinforcement Learning and Cloud computing can be studied using stochastic recursions. The goal of this CAREER project is to take a unified theoretical viewpoint of both these seemingly distinct areas first developing a general theory of stochastic recursions, and then to use it to study both Reinforcement Learning and Cloud computing. In particular, we will use the theory to develop novel learning algorithms with provably optimal sample complexity across various paradigms such as off-policy learning and actor-critic framework. The theory of stochastic recursions as well as the novel learning algorithms will also be used to develop optimal scheduling algorithms for cloud computing data centers that minimize the tail of delay experienced by the users. &lt;br/&gt;The novel algorithms developed during the course of this project will be implemented through collaborations with partners in industry as well as at Georgia Tech’s internal cloud. A Jupyter based open source RL simulation platform will be developed, and the novel algorithms developed during the course of this project will be included in this platform. The platform is used not only in dissemination of the outcome of this project, but also for undergraduate research projects, course projects for a new course on Reinforcement learning, and for STEM outreach activities to K-12 education. In addition to dissemination of research results through conferences and journal publications, we will develop a novel special topics course, and bring out a monograph on the unified Lyapunov framework for stochastic recursions. In addition, training of graduate and undergraduate students forms a core part of the project with special emphasis on mentoring future faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2: &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is organized into three interdependent thrusts. &lt;br/&gt;Thrust I builds a Lyapunov theory of stochastic recursions, where we obtain finite-time mean square error and exponential tail bounds, as well as characterize the steady-state limiting distribution for a broad class of stochastic recursions. This thrust forms the foundation for the next two thrusts.&lt;br/&gt;Thrust II studies the finite-time mean-square bounds, tail probability bounds (aka PAC bounds), sample complexity, and steady-state behavior of RL algorithms under three paradigms, viz., off-policy RL, two time-scale policy space algorithms (such as actor-critic) and average reward RL, and develops novel, fast, RL algorithms with near optimal sample efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;Thrust-III studies scheduling problems in data center networks, with the goal of minimizing mean delay and delay tails. Using the Lyapunov theory from Thrust I, we develop novel low complexity algorithms with provable guarantees on steady-state delay in the heavy-traffic asymptotic regime. With these as initial policies, we will deploy RL algorithms from Thrust II to learn new scheduling policies that are optimal even in the preasymptotic regime, which is of practical interest. All the proposed algorithms will be evaluated using real world traffic traces through our collaborations with industry partners. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work, and the PI’s ongoing industry collaborations have potential for significant societal impact by making RL and cloud computing more efficient. The proposed Lyapunov theory for Stochastic Recursions is applicable in many other disciplines. And so, the PI will disseminate it widely through a special topics course, a monograph, and tutorials, in addition to conference and journal publications. &lt;br/&gt;The project integrates research with educational activities at every level. A Jupyter based RL simulation platform and a library of notebooks that we will build, will serve as an extensive pedagogical resource for these activities. The PI will continue his ongoing involvement in undergraduate research through the REU program and the VIP program at Georgia Tech. In order to fulfill a growing demand, the PI will develop a new interdisciplinary undergraduate level RL course and extensively use the RL simulation platform. To promote STEM activities, the PI will take part in outreach activities to local high schools working with an academic professional in ISyE and will mentor high school teachers through the GIFT program. To support Ph.D. students interested in academic career, the PI runs a future faculty mentorship program. The PI is committed to broadening participation, and currently advises a female Hispanic student, and has advised several URM undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
