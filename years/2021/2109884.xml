<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This work examines how reproductive state affect the way in which the brain processes auditory signals important for social decision making. Animal communication signals comprise a large number of sound elements which change rapidly over time. How these auditory elements change in one animal can significantly influence how another animal responds to that animal’s behavior. This project will generate a greater understanding of how hormones modify the way neurons integrate sounds in order to drive animal choice, and, ultimately, social behavior. The Fellow will also broaden participation through resource development and outreach to individuals with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frog species are acoustic specialists that use these signals to make decisions important for their survival. In particular, Cope’s grey treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) communicates in large choruses, where females exploit spectral variation, temporal patterning, and spatial cues to differentiate between species and make mating choices. This project tests the hypothesis that hormones modulate this behavioral response by regulating neuronal activity in the torus semicircularis (TS, midbrain area homologous to the inferior colliculus), a region important for sensory integration. This work will employ a series of electrophysiological experiments to investigate the sensory processing of neurons in the TS. First, this project will examine the mechanisms of acoustic integration over time in females as they listen to male signals. Second, the project will examine the acute effects of estrogen on such acoustic integration, with the prediction that estrogen treatment will result in state-dependent modulations of neuronal responses that will drive female mating decisions. A major component of this work is creating opportunities for scientific learning and creativity for students with disabilities in addition to developing tools to enhance their experience in STEM labs. This fellowship will allow Dr. Rodriguez-Santiago to fulfill her postdoctoral training and career development goals while broadening the participation and inclusion of students with disabilities in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
