<AbstractNarration>Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. Accordingly, Virginia Union University seeks to enhance the educational experience of its undergraduate Biology majors so that they persist in the major while building a strong culture of research within the department.  The project involves the establishment of a Zebrafish Core Facility, the implementation of new Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) in critical undergraduate Biology courses, and the engagement of undergraduate students as peer educators/mentors in those courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central to the entire project is the establishment of the Zebrafish Core Facility.   The Core Facility will include an Aquaneering eRack with zebrafish breeding tanks, seven (7) imaging stations (each with a stereomicroscope, camera, and computer for image capturing &amp; processing), and a research-grade fluorescence stereomicroscope that will be used for whole-mount metabolite tracing, immunocyto-chemistry, and in-situ hybridization.  It will support the new CURES in two undergraduate Biology courses at Virginia Union University: a required Cell Biology course for Biology sophomores, and an “Independent Research” elective for Biology juniors and seniors.  CUREs will be supported with the expertise of the institution’s research faculty in addressing topics ranging from the regulation of pH in the central nervous system, the teratogenic influence of environmental contaminants, the use of metalorganic frameworks in drug delivery, and lipoprotein-mediated transport of lipids, using zebrafish as a model system.   The project includes a plan to engage three undergraduate students as peer educators/mentors annually.  In addition to participating in the CUREs, those students will benefit from summer research experiences, and professional development activities that will support their designated roles as peer educators/mentors.  Ultimately, the project promises to increase research activity of both faculty and students in the Department of Biology, thereby enhancing the quality of student preparation for entry into the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
