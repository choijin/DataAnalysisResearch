<AbstractNarration>How animals may respond to climate change is a central and controversial issue in ecology. This project will examine how antlers shed by caribou in northern Alaska can reveal how much females have changed the location of where they give birth (their “calving grounds”) as climate has shifted over decades and centuries. This is made possible by the simple facts that females grow antlers every year and shed them within days of giving birth and that the shed antlers do not break down.  Lasting for centuries, they can be found, collected and analyzed to reveal when they were shed. The researcher will link that information with separate records of climate at the time each female gave birth. The antlers can also reveal patterns of migration. The key point is that this simple approach allows one to measure the influence of climate across time scales that match those of natural climate cycles. Complicated models with many assumptions are unnecessary. This work benefits society by providing data to help manage caribou populations. The researcher will foster communication between scientists, managers, and policy makers in the USA and Canada. Finally, the project will support outreach and training activities for school-aged students in a village of the Gwich'in Indigenous Nation near the Arctic Refuge, as well as primary school, college, and graduate students in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses shed female caribou antlers sampled from the Coastal Plain calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou Herd (Arctic Refuge) to identify how the geographic distribution of calving grounds has changed through time. The central hypothesis is that variability in reproductively-tied landscape use (i.e., calving grounds) is strongly influenced by climate. For each antler, date-of-shed will be estimated using a combination of radiocarbon dating and time-calibrated states of bone decay. Changes in the geographic distribution of calving grounds across decadal- to centennial-timescales will be paired with records of the Arctic Oscillation to test the roles of climate on migratory fidelity and to evaluate impacts of current climate trajectories on future long-distance (caribou) migration. The aims of this research are to (1) establish a whole-antler model for determining sex of unknown caribou antlers, (2) establish the stages and rates of arctic bone weathering, and (3) quantify the climatic influences on the geographic variability of caribou calving grounds.  More broadly, this work will highlight bone accumulations as sources of decadal- to centennial-scale data on population biology -- a resource with potential to dramatically expand the timescales with which many aspects of population and community ecology are studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
