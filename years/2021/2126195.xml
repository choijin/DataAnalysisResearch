<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a web-based application to help women manage Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women and leads to higher risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, infertility, and cancer. Women with PCOS are using on average 5 to 6 separate apps to manage their symptoms. Many of these apps are not based upon research. Women with PCOS note frustration, confusion and exhaustion trying to determine the right diet and the right way to manage their health problems. Many do not have access to a specialist or even a local health care provider with knowledge of PCOS. The goal is to educate women with PCOS about their unique nutritional and metabolic needs and to offer “one place” for women with PCOS to go for evidence-based advice from experts in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a web-based application for the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).  Research has shown that PCOS patients may control and mitigate their symptoms by managing their diet. The unique feature of this diet is that it is not based on counting caloric intakes, rather it is based on eliminating certain elements from the diet. The technology is based on a prospective clinical trial leading to an average weight loss of 19 pounds in 8 weeks without counting calories, carbs or fats. In addition, participants showed a 50% reduction in fasting insulin and a significant reduction in total testosterone as well. The goals of the proposed technology are to provide evidence-based education about PCOS directly to patients, and to relieve some of the burden on health care providers who care for these patients.  The goal is to provide education and treatment based on 10 years of research conducted by nutritional and medical experts for the management of PCOS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
