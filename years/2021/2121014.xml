<AbstractNarration>Since the 1990s, scientists and global health experts have been concerned about the impact of environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on the health of animals, humans, and the ecosystem. The recognition of endocrine disruption is due to the work of Theo Colborn (1927-2014). In 1988, Colborn, an Associate of the World Wildlife Fund working with Canadian biologists, first identified developmental and reproductive disorders in fauna exposed to environmental toxins in the Great Lakes basin. In 1991, she organized a conference of biologists and biomedical scientists to review the data, resulting in release of the Wingspread Consensus Statement, which concluded that a "large number of man-made chemicals released into the environment … have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system of animals, including humans." This heralded the birth of endocrine disruption science. In 1996, Colborn and two colleagues published the popular book, "Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening our Intelligence and Survival? A Scientific Detective Story," translated into sixteen languages. Following in Rachel Carson's footsteps, Colborn aimed to inform the public about the danger of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the environment, food, personal care and manufactured products, which can interfere with normal endocrine system functioning. Mimicking or blocking hormones that regulate normal developmental processes, EDCs are associated with such problems as reduced sperm quality and fertility, abnormalities in sex organs, early puberty, certain cancers, learning disabilities, diabetes, obesity, and more. This best-selling book prompted government regulatory agencies in the US and abroad to investigate endocrine disruption, but progress to date has been slow. Up to her death in 2014, Colborn worked tirelessly as a research scientist, policy expert, and activist advocating on behalf of the public to urge precautionary action to reduce environmental EDCs. This project traces the history of endocrine disruption science and policy in a biography highlighting Colborn’s extraordinary scientific career. The book and associated websites will contribute to STS scholarship and educate the public about the continuing problems posed by endocrine disrupting chemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on extensive primary and secondary sources (including Colborn‘s archive and oral histories by colleagues and others), this project addresses several core issues within STS literature and contemporary science and society: (1) The changing role of women and gender in science after the advent of second wave feminism, illustrated by the new field of endocrine disruption and the formation of transdisciplinary research groups; (2) The challenge EDCs pose to the US regulatory process—based on traditional toxicological methods and standards, but confronted by chemicals with low dose effects dependent on time of exposure—as contrasted with the approaches EDCs taken by the EU and Japan; and (3) The use of biography to educate a new generation about the complex issues of endocrine disruption (especially PFAS contamination) by narrating a life in science dedicated to ensuring individual health and the future of humanity, and yet recognizing the importance of developing safe industrial practices that promote the national and global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
