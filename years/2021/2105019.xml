<AbstractNarration>The project addresses directly the heart of algebraic topology: computing invariants like numbers, groups, and rings to understand spaces. The goal of algebraic topology is to systematically build a connection between algebraic objects like numbers and geometric objects like spaces. This connection allows a two-way flow of information, with algebraic invariants distinguishing spaces and topological methods informing algebraic problems. Starting from foundational work of Quillen, algebraic and algebraic geometry data like formal groups gives rise to new invariants for spaces with striking properties. This project combines this classical thread with much more recent developments coming from equivariant algebraic topology. "Equivariant algebraic topology" remembers a collection of symmetries inherent in a space as part of the data, systematically grouping spaces with the same symmetries, and the numbers and invariants produced must reflect this. This extra structure provides more nuanced computations, giving more information about how the classically described invariants change under symmetries. Equivariant algebraic topology has experienced a renaissance recently due to the solution by the PI, Hopkins, and Ravenel to the Kervaire Invariant One problem, one of the oldest outstanding problems in algebraic topology. The solution introduced a host of new constructions and techniques that have striking ramifications in classical and equivariant algebraic topology, and this project focuses on unpacking some of these new constructions, exploring their ramifications in classically studied computations, and describing what they mean for algebraic topology in general. Many of the projects focus on diversity in STEM. Building on the PI's prior First Year seminar on Women in Math, the PI will create a diversity-driven class, combining mathematical content and pedagogy with discussions of representation and inclusion in mathematics. At the same time, the PI intends to create more opportunities for students who do not see themselves as "math people" to connect with algebra and geometry concepts using UCLA's "Maker Spaces" to have students design and build concrete models. The PI will continue conference organizing, especially conferences focusing on making space for early career mathematicians and for advanced undergraduates, using these as a way to connect students with the ideas and researchers in stable homotopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using newly developed tools in equivariant stable homotopy, the PI will study the slice spectral sequences for certain chromatically meaningful quotients of hyperreal spectra. These are closely connected to the classical approaches to studying K(n)-local phenomena using the Hopkins--Miller higher real K-theory spectra, and at the prime 2, computations here subsume all previously known higher real K-theory computations. The project focuses mainly on concrete computations (both of chromatically meaningful quotients of hyperreal bordism and of more traditional objects like the dual Steenrod algebra), while also studying more abstract questions of what kinds of multiplicative structures we can see. Finally, an application of all of this machinery to the classical questions of orientability of vector bundles is explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
