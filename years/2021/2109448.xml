<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Environmental change is happening faster than most species can adapt. Since behavioral responses are one of the most immediate reactions an animal can have toward changes in their environment, behavioral missteps can be especially harmful for the survival of many species. Evolutionary traps are a common type of behavioral pitfall, which happens when animals make decisions based on outdated or misleading information. However, the study of evolutionary traps is missing a critical aspect of most animalsâ€™ lives by ignoring the social setting in which species experience potential traps. This research will address this knowledge gap by studying how differences in both individual social behavior and social group composition influences whether animals fall for traps, and how this could lead to the rapid evolution of social traits. While the use of fruit flies in the lab enables rigorous examination of behavior and genetics, this research will have widespread implications because the dynamics studied are common across the animal kingdom. In addition, this project will support activities intended to increase the participation and retention of students and researchers from diverse backgrounds in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use a population of Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, with known genetic variation in social behaviors. Fruit flies encounter a common evolutionary trap in human-dominated landscapes: the apple cider vinegar trap. The first aim of the project is to quantify genetic variation in individual attraction to social cues associated with traps. The second aim is to measure the role of indirect genetic effects and emergent group traits on attraction to traps using group behavioral assays and social network analysis. Lastly, the third aim is to identify how traps could cause the evolution of social behaviors and other correlated traits using an artificial evolution experiment paired with RNA-sequencing to identify changes in gene expression. This project has great potential to add to the fields of evolutionary traps and social behavior by integrating the latest advances in behavioral research tools (i.e., state-of-the-art tracking software, social network theory) with quantitative genetics and genomics (i.e., next-generation sequencing), and providing training in these practices to the fellow. In addition, the fellow will establish a postdoctoral peer mentorship group, develop outreach materials with the Society for Conservation Biology and the Rice University Office of STEM Engagement, and mentor undergraduate researchers developing their own independent projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
