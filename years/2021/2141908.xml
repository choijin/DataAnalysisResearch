<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by implementing evidence-based teaching practices using course based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). Students learn most effectively by doing rather than merely watching and listening. At the undergraduate level in sciences, this translates into learning science by doing science. It is well-known that undergraduates have improved outcomes in performance, persistence, and progress when they engage in hands-on research; that is, doing what scientists in any field do. These improved outcomes could be particularly valuable for students from minoritized groups and first-generation college students. At the same time, access to research experiences as undergraduates in the form of traditional apprenticeship-based laboratory research has historically favored majority-group students. CUREs have been shown to provide some of the same benefits as traditional research experiences, but at a much broader scale, at lower cost, and with shorter time commitments. This project will provide broad access to learning-by-doing in biochemistry research by lowering barriers to implementing CUREs.  The project intends to assess participation in a previously developed biochemistry CURE, the Biochemistry Authentic Science Inquiry Laboratory (BASIL). The project will engage with faculty at institutions whose students will most benefit from increased access to research experiences, with a focus on Minority-Serving Institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BASIL CURE is fully implemented on ten campuses. More than 25 other campuses are exploring and/or using parts of the curriculum through prior work. The project will add 50 more campuses to the project over the next 5 years through a series of recruiting and training workshops and through a well-designed mentoring program. The project will focus on Minority-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, and Community Colleges. The goal of the project is to investigate the processes by which CUREs are adopted, implemented, and sustained with three specific aims: Aim 1. Identify the supports for and barriers to CURE implementation and sustainability across institution types; Aim 2. Characterize the relationship between institutional context and variations in CURE implementation across institution types; and Aim 3. Facilitate implementation and sustainability in diverse contexts through faculty development. The project will collect data from participating faculty by administering and collecting (a) pre-engagement surveys, (b) implementation plans, (c) implementation surveys, and (d) semi-structured interviews.  The project will partner with other established CURE communities in the field to assess the process of CURE implementation for any barriers such as impacts of cost, institutional support, or faculty workload.  The project will also assess the sustainability of the CURE strategy across participating campuses based on demographics, size, location, and other factors.  As a result of this implementation and assessment process, the project seeks to contribute to strengthening the diverse workforce in sciences, technology, and medicine. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
