<AbstractNarration>This project is conducting a reconnaissance of the nearest stars to the Sun, to a distance of about 80 light years.  The team is focused on the long-term behavior of the smallest stars, known as red dwarfs. Although these are the smallest true stars, the red dwarfs are the largest in number, accounting for more than three-quarters of all stars.  It is important to understand how the red dwarfs compare to the Sun in temperature, size, how active they are, and whether or not they are orbited by other stars or planets.  This project will investigate what types of companions orbit these most common stars in the Galaxy and how the light from these stars changes over timescales of weeks to decades.  This investigation will provide insight into the environments of the planets around such stars. The project also provides training for a diverse group of students in the techniques of astrometric observations and in managing data dissemination resources for the astronomical community, the media, and the wider public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cornerstone of the RECONS (REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars) effort is an observing program using a CCD camera at the SMARTS 0.9m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, that has been underway since 1999.  Observations, now extending for more than twenty years, are being made on a target sample of about five hundred of the nearest red dwarfs to discover and characterize the orbital architectures of stellar, brown dwarf, and Jovian planetary companions on Solar System scales.  Additionally, monitoring of the photometric variability of the same stars permits characterization of changes over medium (rotation), and long (spot cycle) timescales.  Such variability is linked to magnetic activity in the star.  Such investigations are important as the answers provide insight into the environments experienced by orbiting planets around the most common stars in the Galaxy.  The project also provides opportunities for young astronomers to learn astrometric and photometric techniques, as well as  hands-on observing experience. Access to the SMARTS/0.9-meter telescope for this long term project and for the astronomical community will be maintained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
