<AbstractNarration>Non-technical summary&lt;br/&gt;With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and the Condensed Matter Physics Program in the Division of Materials Research, atoms arranged in unusual architectures such as one-dimensional (1D) spiral or zig-zag chains or two-dimensional (2D) planes are synthesized using chemical methods. Prof. Manson studies the resulting crystals by a variety of measurement techniques to assess their magnetic properties and collaborates with theorists to aid their understanding of these properties or develop new theories as appropriate. Because he uses different metal atoms with varying numbers of electrons during the synthesis new magnetic phases emerge, including skyrmions. A skyrmion can be likened to a vortex of electrons with precise alignments that depend on several factors, factors that Prof. Manson and his team study to learn more about. This is the first time this phenomenon is produced in molecular materials. Such materials have the potential to revolutionize existing technologies, including spintronics and data storage. Through this project the principal investigator provides a diverse and inclusive group of undergraduate researchers with ample opportunities to participate in experiments; meet and interact with collaborators; assist in data analysis and prepare manuscripts for publication; help shape future research directions; and present their results at conferences and workshops.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical summary&lt;br/&gt;With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and the Condensed Matter Physics Program in the Division of Materials Research, Prof. Manson examines the excitations in 1D chains and 2D layers that feature staggered/alternating and chiral topologies as well as those that generally lack inversion centers. Key to this is the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which principal investigator Manson posits it a tunable parameter. This tunability is expected to lead to great opportunity to discover novel phases including skyrmion candidates, a phenomenon not yet realized in molecular systems. These materials are synthesized as crystals in protic or aprotic solvents using combinations of paramagnetic transition metal ions and carefully chosen anions and organic ligands. These crystals are subjected to detailed experimental study complemented by theory to aid our understanding of the underlying physics. It is anticipated that these concepts are transferable and relevant to the single-molecule magnets and strongly-correlated electron communities. Additionally, the project brings together a wide-ranging materials design and discovery effort as well as numerous characterization methods to foster national and international collaboration, coalescing the resources of the best facilities, equipment, and expertise available in the field, as well as provide unique opportunities for undergraduate research, training and education. At the core is an all-inclusive research team focused on sample preparation, optical characterization and X-ray structure determinations. EWU students have ample opportunities to participate in experiments; meet and interact with collaborators; assist in data analysis and prepare manuscripts for publication; help shape future research directions; and present their results at conferences and workshops. For this project Prof. Manson has established a diverse undergraduate research group that consists mostly of women, a group largely underrepresented in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
