<AbstractNarration>Thin coatings and two-dimensional reinforcing sheets are key elements of modern composite materials. They are used for prevention of damage, increase in durability, and enhancement in performance of components and structures in aerospace, automotive, biomedical, and many other industries that are of particular importance to the US economy. For example, the use of graphene nanoplatelets or polymer nano coatings in ceramics or metals produces lightweight composites with superior mechanical strength that are indispensable for fabrication of portable electronic devices, medical implants, and solar cells. Despite remarkable progress made in the last decade, however, accurate predictive modeling of materials with thin and ultrathin layers remains a challenging task. This award supports research that will deliver an efficient theoretical and computational framework that will potentially facilitate simulation-based design and optimization of composite material systems and significantly enhance the accuracy of their analysis. In addition, the project will support efforts to attract and inspire students to pursue research in simulation-based engineering and train graduate and undergraduate students in the cross-disciplinary areas of composite mechanics, surface science, and computational methods. It will also leverage institutional programs to support education and outreach to students at all levels, with special focus on women and low-income students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in surface chemistry and related technological developments enable the design and creation of composite materials with unprecedented mechanical properties. Of particular interest are composites with thin coatings or two-dimensional reinforcements. The objective of this research is to develop novel methodologies to model the coatings and/or reinforcements through interfaces of zero thickness and specially designed jump conditions. The research approach will consist of formulating novel higher-order interface models, developing new classification of interface morphologies, and establishing their connections with lower-dimensional plate and shell theories. The interface models will be integrated into new finite element and boundary element formulations characterized by high-regularity basis functions. Lastly, these implementations will be validated with the help of experimental data available from collaborators on real-world problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
