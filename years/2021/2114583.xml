<AbstractNarration>This project will convene a series of workshops, beginning in fiscal year 2021, to develop a vision for a new national data infrastructure for the social and behavioral sciences.  The existing data infrastructure relies heavily upon statistics collected in surveys and censuses, yet the long-standing survey paradigm is under threat with declining participation rates. There are, however, many other sources of data that increasingly are available, including administrative data from states and local governments, public and private institutions, and businesses. Additional sources of data include 'big data' from the internet, connected devices, and sensors. This project will conduct three interrelated workshops on issues related to the development of a new national data infrastructure. A short consensus report will be written at the conclusion of each workshop. An improved data infrastructure is needed to address pressing social problems. Data and statistics from the federal government and academic researchers, including unemployment rates, crime rates, and people's perceptions of their society, provide the foundation for policymakers, businesses, and individuals to make informed decisions regarding the economy, society, and their lives. An improved national data infrastructure would provide many societal benefits, including improved decision making and more informed public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for a new data infrastructure has been widely acknowledged as national governments around the world recognize the strategic importance of data. The barriers, challenges, and issues for a new data infrastructure are complex and will require innovative approaches, methods, and tools. It also will require the support and trust of multiple actors, including the public, academia; federal, state, and local governments, and the private sector. The workshops will address these issues by focusing on three specific areas and questions. The first workshop will focus on delineating the scope, components, and key characteristics of a 21st century data infrastructure, including topics such as governance, the technical skills needed, and data sharing. The second workshop will focus on identifying the technology, tools, and capabilities needed for data access, sharing, use, and analysis, while protecting privacy and confidentiality. The third workshop will explore the implications of using multiple data sources for major survey programs, including linking data to survey responses to make surveys less burdensome and more efficient. Following each workshop, the organizing committee will discuss the key themes and their conclusions, which will be summarized in a targeted consensus report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
