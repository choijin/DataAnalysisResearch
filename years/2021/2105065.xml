<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;Co-amorphous molecular glasses are a new class of materials that are composed of two or more types of different small molecules. Combining two or more of these types of molecules into extended solid-state materials leads to co-amorphous molecular glasses that have better properties than the individual component systems.  By investigating how parameters such as molecular size, shape, flexibility, and chemical interaction sites impact the properties of glasses made from binary mixtures of different types of molecules, researchers at North Carolina State University provide a fundamental understanding of co-amorphous molecular glasses. These insights and novel materials have the potential to advance the use of co-amorphous molecular glasses in pharmaceutics, energetics, agrichemicals, and personal care products.  Advantages of using co-amorphous molecular glasses include, for example for pharmaceutics, high bioavailability and high stability during storage.  The project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, also includes training of two graduate students and undergraduate researchers in cutting-edge research in glass chemistry and physics, thermal analysis, and rheology.  Additionally, as part of this award, Profs. Simon and McKenna organize a one-week-long soft materials camp for junior high school students. It is called "Exploring Materials and Recycling" and leverages the longstanding summer engineering camp program developed and managed by The Engineering Place (TEP) of the North Carolina State University College of Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;This research, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, focuses on a wide range of binary co-amorphous molecular glasses in order to develop a framework for the rational design of new glassy solids with improved properties.  The role of molecular size, shape, and flexibility on co-amorphous glass formation, as well as the importance of the strength of and mismatches in specific interactions, are examined by calorimetry, rheology, and spectroscopy for glasses created by combinations of pharmaceutical materials, mock energetics, and small molecule additives or excipients. Major unanswered questions in the field of co-amorphous molecular glasses are addressed, including how dynamic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties, including the glass transition temperature (Tg), crystallization rates, and glass stability, are interrelated and influenced by molecular structure and interactions.  In addition, thermodynamic activity coefficient models are used to relate the molecular interactions and the synergistic increases in Tg that are often observed in co-amorphous glasses.  The stability of the co-amorphous glass against crystallization is modeled and characterized in the framework of the time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram using extensions of classical models of nucleation and growth kinetics.  The importance of the work is in providing fundamental new knowledge for the nascent field of molecular glass engineering that is anticipated to facilitate the rational design of new glassy solids that can be engineered on demand for a given function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
