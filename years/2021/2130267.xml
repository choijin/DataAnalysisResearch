<AbstractNarration>This project will contribute to the preparation of a well-educated workforce in STEM fields by providing financial, academic, social, and career support to a diverse cohort of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need at Shepherd University. The project will apply and strengthen evidence-based student support programs that improve the educational success of a diverse community of 52 students (total of 126 scholarships) majoring in a degree program offered by the Department of Computer Sciences, Mathematics, and Engineering (CME): Data Analytics, Mathematics, Computer Information Sciences, Computer Information Technology, Computer Engineering, or Engineering Science. The project will assess the effectiveness of these student supports on retention and graduation rates of scholars, many of whom are anticipated to be first generation, female, and transfer students. The program will identify and eliminate barriers, leading to improved retention of the targeted population of students in STEM.  Scholars will receive support from faculty and peers and have the opportunity to participate in academic, social, and professional activities that will allow them to accentuate their strengths and explore a number of future options. Further, the program will enhance Shepherd’s regional alliance with business, industry, and government agencies while improving connections with local high schools and community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has four specific objectives: (1) increase enrollment and retention of CME majors, (2) improve four-year graduation rate of CME majors, (3) increase the proportion of graduating S-STEM scholars who find employment, or continue to graduate studies, in their field within six months of graduation, and (4) enhance student support programs. The program will recruit students by enhancing marketing activities with high schools and community colleges, and through a variety of student clubs and competitions. Scholars will be selected through a competitive application process, supported by removing the financial and other barriers that can impede scholars’ progress towards timely completion of their degrees. The selected students will participate in summer bridge programs, internships, research opportunities, career development services, S-STEM seminars, and interactions with local industry representatives. Student support programs such as faculty and peer mentoring, cohort-building experiences, seminars and tutorials, counseling, and learning communities will allow the project to address scholars’ individual needs with thought and care. Shepherd University will gather critical evidence as found in the current literature to better understand essential elements for student success. Furthermore, mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches will be employed to extend the research base regarding what is known about the impact of several student support initiatives and programs on the success of STEM students. The project’s models and findings will be disseminated through websites, social media, publications, and conference presentations aimed at higher education communities interested in improving their preparation of undergraduate STEM students. This project is funded by NSF’s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
