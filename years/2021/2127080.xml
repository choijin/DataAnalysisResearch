<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the development of a precision three-dimensional (3D) optical metrology tool for in-process quality control. The proposed tool uses a high-resolution, computer-defined 3D light field to perform rapid multipoint non-contact measurements on parts during the fabrication process. The tool uses an adaptive process to enable 3D metrology with sub-10-micron resolution, at a fraction of the price of competing technologies. Low-volume, high-precision manufacturing plays a critical role in the global economy and is currently a limiting factor in the creation of new assembly lines, larger volume manufacturing, research timelines, and tool creation. The tool itself will benefit small businesses in hardware development by improving part quality through feedback during the manufacturing process. Already, surface inspection systems account for a global $3.7 billion market which is projected to grow to $5.3 billion over the next five years. This strategically impactful innovation is aimed at assisting small businesses, students, trainees, and professional specialty machinists in achieving complex, precision tolerances on low-volume parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project advances core technology for precise optical projections, based on a novel component that generates a computer-defined high-resolution projected light field to enable both versatility and high-performance metrology. A programmable light field creates the opportunity for direct user feedback by projecting real-time measurement information onto the part under inspection. The objective of this study is to measure and optimize the design of this programmable device by experimentally evaluating the device stability, field of view, spatial resolution, and efficiency for several design permutations. Additional goals include evaluating the device for its manufacturability, repeatability, and commercial viability. Simulations suggest capabilities including a 60-degree angular field of view and sub-10-micron projection spot size at a nominal working distance of 40 centimeters. Further development of this core technology, when combined with commercially available components, will enable the creation of a compact, high-precision, economically viable tool that provides exceptional reliability for metrology applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
