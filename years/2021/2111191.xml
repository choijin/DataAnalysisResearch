<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: ECCS-2111191&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kang L. Wang (PI) &amp; Subramanian Iyer (co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California, Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: NSF Workshop on Future of Semiconductor and Beyond: Devices and Technologies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. created the semiconductor microelectronics industry through transformative innovations in science and engineering over the past century. However, our leadership advantage has severely eroded over the past two decades amid the stiffest global competition never been experienced before. The goal of the proposed “NSF Workshop on Future of Semiconductors and Beyond: Devices &amp; Technologies” is to research and identify the challenges in semiconductor innovation and manufacturing ecosystems, infrastructure, and workforce, which need to be overcome for fostering innovation to create a “new Silicon Valley”, which will ensure the U.S. economic prosperity and national security.  Several follow-up workshops on these identified directions will be formulated to detail the strategies. The results will produce a set of recommendations to NSF for supporting the new ecosystems of innovation in research, infrastructures, manufacturing, and education and training in semiconductors; and incubate the entire chain of comprehensive talent necessary from research and development to manufacturing and commercialization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will recommend research strategy to identify and formulate the scientific and technical directions to assure the US leadership in semiconductors.  The workshop approach is to include the top leaders of all stakeholders to discuss ideas and formulate strategic directions for innovation in broader areas of semiconductors, including devices, materials, semiconductor technologies and manufacturing, integrated circuits, and systems and architectures, design methodologies and platform, heterogeneous integration, and semiconductor fabrication, metrology and characterization equipment research and development comprising the full chain of innovation in microelectronics.  Intellectual merits will include the knowledge learned, vertically, in computing, communications, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IOT), future manufacturing, and others, as well as, horizontally, in health care, transportations, energy, security, and the industries of future.  The knowledge learned will also help the development of the entire future semiconductor sector and will have broader impacts on science and engineering that affect the daily life.  This workshop aims to identify the critical strategies to help the U.S. to regain the leadership position in semiconductors, which is vital to the socio-economic prosperity and national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past century, the U.S. has created and led the semiconductor microelectronics industry through paradigm-changing innovations in science and engineering. However, the U.S. leadership advantage has severely eroded over the past two decades. We are now facing a historically unprecedented global competition and there are significant challenges ahead in order to reassert the U.S. semiconductor leadership in the twenty-first century.     In order to assure the US semiconductor microelectronics leadership, NSF had charged the planning committee to examine key critical topic areas for discussions and debates.   After several months of preparation and discussions, four major broader areas were identified relating to the U.S. semiconductor competitiveness: (1) Device &amp; Technology Innovation: High Performance, Mobile and Cognitive/Autonomous Systems, (2) Microelectronics Ecosystem from discoveries to manufacturing, (3) Innovative Microsystem Integration of different devices and technologies, and (4) Human factors.  The goal of this workshop was to identify the challenges and strategies as well as research gaps in these topic areas for innovation in microelectronics as of how to accelerate research and development into manufacturing to create a new wave of innovation in a "new Silicon Valley," that will ensure the U.S. economic prosperity and national security.      The workshop was held on February 7, 8, 18, and 19, 2021 for four sessions, each of which had a plenary session followed by a panel discussion (website: https://semiconductorsworkshop.wordpress.com). The workshop assembled the leaders of all the stakeholders from leading semiconductor companies, academic institutions, and government agencies to discuss challenges in these four topic areas and addressed the investment needs for resolving the challenges in the face of intense competition worldwide and for realizing the next wave of innovation for the benefits of the society and mankind.
