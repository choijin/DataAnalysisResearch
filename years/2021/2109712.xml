<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Temperature affects all biological processes, yet the current understanding of how thermal environment impacts populations, organisms, and genetic responses is largely dominated by land and freshwater species. While studies in marine systems are growing in number, there are few studies investigating how marine systems adapt to temperatures in what are called holopelagic animals (animals that live their entire life in the water column). Studying organisms with biological traits distinct from classically studied organisms has great potential to broaden our understanding not only of these organisms, but of fundamental and broad evolutionary processes in general. This knowledge gap will be addressed by studying populations of the holopelagic ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidyi from distinct thermal environments along its native range of the Atlantic coast of the United States. Investigating the mechanisms species employ to respond to contemporary thermal gradients will provide insights into their capacity to survive the rising temperatures associated with climate change. This project will increase participation in the sciences through mentoring and outreach to groups under-represented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use an integrative approach to expand our understanding of how thermal environment drives differentiation in M. leidyi. First, whole-genome sequencing of M. leidyi populations along the Atlantic coast will be performed in order to characterize how thermal environment affects population dynamics in holopelagic animals. Second, experimental thermal assays from populations along this large latitudinal gradient will provide insights into geographic patterns of resilience to thermal stress and shed light on the interaction between temperature, development, and holopelagic dispersal. Finally, outlier analysis on the whole-genome sequencing data will elucidate how genotypic differentiation arises in the face of ongoing gene flow and how species with life history traits that necessitate exposure to a wide range of temperatures adapt. Importantly, the fellow will receive training in bioinformatics, embryo culturing techniques, developing inclusive research programs, and becoming a more effective science communicator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
