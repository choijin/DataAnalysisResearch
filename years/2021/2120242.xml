<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for the participation of graduate students and young postdocs in the 2021 Low Energy Electrodynamics in Solids (LEES) international conference, June 27th to July 2nd, at the Westin in Portland, Maine. The objective of the conference is to provide a forum for exchange of ideas, novel concepts, and unpublished results in the interdisciplinary research on low-energy electrodynamics in solids and in exotic condensed phases. Experts in a wide range of theoretical and experimental techniques focused on the electrodynamics of quantum materials will join with up and coming junior researchers. The program is organized to allow for a range of interactions and discussions, as well as opportunities for junior participants to share their work. Fifteen invited speakers are graduate students, postdocs or new faculty. The organizers are making significant efforts to have participation from members of underrepresented groups including providing support for child care, diversifying the organizing committees and speakers (ten invited speakers are women, three are LatinX).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Scientifically, there will be an emphasis on the electronic and magnetic properties of quantum materials and their applications for future technologies. Discussion will encompass both theoretical and experimental methods including: broadband, time-resolved and near-field optical and photoemission spectroscopies, nuclear magnetic resonance, inelastic neutron/X-ray scattering, and scanning tunneling microscopy. It is highly timely to hold such a conference with a focus on coordinating the unprecedented ability to create, probe and control topological and correlated states of matter. Indeed, many of the unique states of quantum materials result from the entanglement of magnetic, lattice, and electronic properties. As such no single technique can unravel their origins, let alone control them for future incorporation into cutting edge devices. This conference will bring together a wide range of disciplines and focus on both theoretical and experimental methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
