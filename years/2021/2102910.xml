<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities – Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) is committed to enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education and research at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in order to broaden participation in the nation's STEM workforce.  Accordingly, HBCU-UP supports the project from the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) that undergirds a virtual community of practice for broadening participation knowledge transfer.  The project will (1) deliberately focus on cultivating the innate thought leadership of NSF HBCU-UP principal investigators (PIs), who are at the forefront of broadening participation success, through evidence-based identity development; 2) use a novel knowledge transfer framework that re-imagines and adapts the “bench to bedside” knowledge translation processes of biomedical research to a new context, for undergraduate STEM reform; and 3) design and upgrade the virtual platform, STEM Central, for the stated purposes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this timely project goes beyond developing a knowledge-generating platform for, and by, HBCU-UP PIs.  It also expands their capacity to disseminate research about broadening participation to the entire STEM higher education reform community. In doing so, AAC&amp;U will coordinate, integrate, and showcase the entire NSF HBCU-UP investment as a means of generating the kind of culturally informed research ideas, perspectives, and collaborations that can create a deeper understanding of broadening participation, and what is needed to achieve and sustain it.  As such, the project will, (i) design, develop, and grow a robust knowledge-transfer platform, for and by HBCU STEM faculty; (ii) use a knowledge-transfer platform to facilitate the transfer of HBCU knowledge and unique ways of knowing about broadening participation to the entire STEM higher education reform community; (iii) test the capacity of the knowledge-transfer platform for effectiveness through social network analysis.  The project addresses the need for virtual professional development opportunities that are specifically tailored for HBCU-UP PIs, while providing a unique platform for them to narrow the broadening participation knowledge gap, thereby enriching the STEM education reform community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
