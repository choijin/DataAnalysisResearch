<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national need of preparing high-quality science teachers that are prepared to teach in high-need districts. In turn, this will contribute directly to the continued development of a skilled STEM workforce in the United States.  Building upon ongoing collaborative efforts between the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) and Omaha Public Schools (OPS), a high-need school district, this project will attract, retain, and empower a diverse cohort of future educators in biology, chemistry, geology/environmental sciences, and physics. This project will prepare science teachers by providing multiple supports within a layered learning community. These prospective science teachers will gain direct mentorship by faculty, participate in a near-peer support system, participate in informal and formal teaching opportunities, and explore research experiences. After the prospective teachers complete teacher licensure, the project will continue to provide them with mentorship and professional development aimed at ensuring their early years in the classroom will be a success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) includes partnerships with high-need schools in the Omaha Public School (OPS) District. In addition to enhancing the quality, quantity, and diversity of certified science teachers, the project will further strengthen collaborative relationships between UNO and OPS, thereby establishing a strong foundation for the continued education of culturally responsive science teachers who are prepared to succeed in high-need schools. Beyond providing financial support for at least 10 Interns and at least 27 Scholars, project goals include engaging prospective science teachers in a variety of high-impact practices to prepare them to be effective pedagogical and disciplinary experts. Interns will engage in structured experiences with one of several existing university partners in the local community.  As they complete their licensure program, Scholars will participate in the Culturally Responsive Teaching series each semester, mentor lower-level undergraduates, lead discussions in biweekly discipline-based education research journal club meetings, and complete a mentored senior project related to science education. Additionally, Scholars will have the opportunity to serve as learning assistants in general science courses and will assist with ongoing recruitment efforts of the next generation of teachers from local high schools. Induction support for Scholars moving into their first teaching assignments will include regular meetings for new teachers, opportunities to participate in teacher-researcher partnerships, and an invitation to continue involvement in journal clubs, summer programs and other project activities. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
