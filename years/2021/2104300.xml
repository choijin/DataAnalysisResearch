<AbstractNarration>Symmetry and deformation may be viewed as two opposing forces in understanding topological spaces.  On the one hand, symmetries represent rigid structure of a space-ways in which the space is the same under operations like rotation or reflection. Deformations, on the other hand, purposely elide rigid structures so as to allow us to understand rough features of spaces.  Examples of these features include the number of holes or the number of separate pieces of the space.  These two approaches to understanding spaces combine in equivariant algebraic topology.  Algebraic topology is an area of mathematics that studies complicated and frequently high dimensional spaces via algebraic invariants, and equivariant algebraic topology incorporates the symmetries of the spaces into the invariants in a robust way.  This field has connections to subjects such as mathematical physics and data analysis.  The PI's work advances state-of-the-art knowledge in this area by developing both computational and theoretical tools to analyze the structures of and relationships between the invariants in equivariant algebraic topology.  Particular contexts of interest also include questions related to algebraic and topological K-theory, invariants that are at the heart of modern approaches to topology, algebra and number theory.   Additionally, the funds from this grant will assist the PI in her outreach activities designed to promote women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics, including her work with the newly formed Vanderbilt student chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics and the Vanderbilt Directed Reading Program.  These programs will expand the reach of mathematical thinking and give a wider variety of students the opportunity to be part of the project of mathematics, creating both a broader base for the mathematical community and more mathematically literate members of society.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments in homotopy theory have highlighted the importance of equivariance, as well as the many ways in which equivariance remains poorly understood. Equivariant homotopy theory is key to modern computations in algebraic K-theory and has deep ramifications in p-adic Hodge theory.  Equivariant homotopy theory is also central to results in nonequivariant homotopy theory, such as the recent solution to the Kervaire invariant one problem. The PI's research program will develop new tools for extending these kinds of calculations as well as deepening our overall picture of the surprising ways in which symmetry manifests itself in homotopical considerations.  Her program focuses on the interplay of different groups of symmetries, both at a topological and algebraic level. At the algebraic level, these new developments in this area will allow mathematicians to fully exploit algebraic tools in understanding topological spaces with group actions.  At the topological level, her work will provide a basis for advances relating to duality, chromatic homotopy theory and algebraic K-theory.  While undertaking this research, the PI plans to continue current activities designed to promote women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics.   By providing mathematicians from these groups with the opportunity to disseminate their new results, she will support their careers and additionally increase the visibility of the diverse range of people doing mathematics.  The PI's proposed activities will also broaden participation in mathematics by providing opportunities for students with a wide range of backgrounds to be part of the mathematical research experience.  This program will expand the reach of mathematical thinking and give a wider variety of students the opportunity to be part of the project of mathematics, creating both a broader base for the mathematical community and more mathematically literate members of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
