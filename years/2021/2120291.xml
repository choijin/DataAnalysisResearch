<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a modular drug-delivery platform for the delivery of gene-based therapeutic medicines. The next frontier in biotechnology is focused on gene-based medicines to treat a broad spectrum of diseases, however, their success is dependent on delivery methods to enhance their efficacy and safety. Current technologies used to deliver these medicines raise concerns regarding distribution/transportation due to thermostability or portability, high costs of development in manufacturing, and safety.  The successful translation of this project may enable a new paradigm in non-viral gene delivery as well as broader access to these therapeutics for a wider population through lower costs, improved distribution, and enhanced safety and efficacy. The proposed technology may provide gene therapy companies with a platform to deliver their therapeutics on a global scale to advance 5personalized medicine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a drug delivery platform for DNA and mRNA-based therapeutics utilizing a modified electroporation technology.  Electroporation is a technique for gene delivery that shocks cells with an electric pulse, allowing therapeutics and other molecules to permeate cell walls. The proposed microneedle-electroporation platform enables both gene and pulse delivery showing comparable performance to research use electroporator systems.  The proposed technology delivers coated or injected therapeutics to enhance gene expression &gt;400-fold with improved safety. Preliminary studies in vivo have shown efficacy comparable to commercial benchmarks for safety, including tests with a COVID-19 DNA vaccine. The proposed technology is designed to be handheld and weighs less than 50g, operates without access to electricity, is manufactured with existing infrastructure at a cost of less than $1, and may be operated by minimally trained personnel or self-administered. Further development is required for the identification of specific biomedical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
