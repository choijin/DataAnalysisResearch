<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research, education, and outreach activities focused on understanding excitations created by the absorption of light in materials. Understanding these excitations is of fundamental importance to a wide range of processes that rely on light absorption, including light harvesting by solar cells, photosynthesis in plants, and chemical reactions catalyzed by light. In all these processes, the absorption of light creates excitons, which are excited states composed of a negatively charged electron and a positively charged hole bound together by the Coulomb interaction. It is possible to calculate the energy levels and character of these excitons, and consequently, the energy and amount of light that can be absorbed by a material, but currently, accurate calculations of this nature are limited to systems with only tens of atoms and excitations over a small energy range due to the computational cost of the calculation. This project aims to develop, implement and apply new computational techniques that will allow for the calculation of much larger systems containing up to thousands of atoms and with energies spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from the infrared to x-ray ranges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main idea is to divide the largescale system into smaller subsystems. As long as excitons can be well-approximated as being confined to a single subsystem, then each subsystem can be calculated separately, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. The effect of interactions between the subsystems is approximated by changing the strength of interactions inside each subsystem, which in turn reveals how scattering between subsystems can influence the exciton energies and lifetimes. This method will be applied to study x-ray absorption spectra and molecules adsorbed on the surface of bulk materials. This project will enhance understanding of excitons at higher energy and faster timescales, and pave the way for the development of improved devices for light harvesting and molecular sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the education of a graduate student. Additionally, this project will integrate research, education, and mentoring with a scaffolded outreach program designed to broaden the participation of groups that are historically underrepresented in science and engineering. The PI will give public lectures, develop a summer materials science workshop, and offer a yearly undergraduate summer internship for students from the New Haven public school system. The proposed outreach includes a rigorous data collection component that will allow the impact of the program to be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research, education, and outreach activities focused on understanding exciton dynamics and scattering between subspaces in nanostructured and heterogeneous systems. Currently, ab initio calculations of excitons within many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) are limited by their considerable computational cost to static calculations on small systems with tens of atoms and energy ranges of less than 10 eV, leaving many systems of current physical interest, such as heterostructures, defects, and complex nanostructures, beyond the reach of conventional calculations. This project aims to develop, implement and apply an ab initio formalism within MBPT that describes the dynamical interactions between excitons in different physical subsystems, defined by energy scales or spatial localization. The objective is to extend the current capabilities of these computational techniques to study light-matter interactions in larger, more complex systems and over energy scales of hundreds to thousands of eV. This project concurrently develops new techniques to include dynamical and lifetime effects due to coupling between physical subsystems in calculations of exciton spectra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed methods are based on an extension of the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism. Instead of truncating the Hilbert space, as is done in conventional calculations, the coupling of a physical subsystem to a larger Hilbert space will be accounted for through a matrix downfolding approach that includes the dynamics of the coupling. The developed methods will be applied to the computation of spectra and lifetimes associated with excitons in x-ray absorption spectroscopy of two-dimensional layered van der Waals materials, oxides, and amorphous systems. The developed methods will also be applied to study excitonic energy transfer across heterointerfaces between molecules and two-dimensional materials.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project supports the education of a graduate student. Additionally, this project will integrate research, education, and mentoring with a scaffolded outreach program designed to broaden the participation of groups that are historically underrepresented in science and engineering. The PI will give public lectures, develop a summer materials science workshop, and offer a yearly undergraduate summer internship for students from the New Haven public school system. The proposed outreach includes a rigorous data collection component that will allow the impact of the program to be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
