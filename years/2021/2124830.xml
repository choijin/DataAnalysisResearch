<AbstractNarration>The workshop is designed to identify and share best practices in the implementation of robust educational programming for responsible and ethical conduct of research [RECR]. The workshop will focus on the achievements of peer model institutions and identify best practices for successful implementation at other institutions. By directly addressing common hurdles that institutions face and building on what has been successful, this workshop will produce a roadmap of resources and guidelines which can be widely distributed and adopted, as appropriate, across a diversity of other institutions. The outcomes will directly contribute to enriching RECR programming and program implementation to support the progress of science by fostering responsible and ethical research. Educators, university administrators, industry and scientific communities will be interested the outcomes of this workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will focus on 1) examining the elements that need to be addressed in an institutional RECR plan, 2) identifying the key challenges and barriers to the creation and implementation of such programming, and 3) exploring strategies for how those challenges might be met. This goal of this workshop is to create a framework of best practices for implementing robust RECR programs based on peer models of excellence. Representatives from institutions will share opportunities and challenges in the implementation of RECR programming on their campuses to find common ground for further exploration of best practices. The workshop will collect and disseminate practical advice for RECR implementation that is not otherwise currently addressed/available. The outcomes will directly contribute to knowledge of RECR implementation by providing institutions with key factors and considerations for improving their RECR programs based on peer examples of success, something that has not been previously collected or disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
