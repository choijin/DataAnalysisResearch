<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project studies special materials known as two-dimensional materials such as metal chalcogenides. Recent predictions indicate that these materials have interesting properties. The project aims to develop these properties using externally applied electric and magnetic fields in order to gain knowledge that will promote development of quantum information processing and quantum computing technologies. The project is integrated with educational activities to train graduate students and involve undergraduate and pre-college students in research. The project also enables the PIs to continue their successful mentoring of members from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;A basic building block of quantum circuits is the quantum bit or qubit. Recent recognition that higher-dimensional quantum states known as qudits have many potential advantages towards quantum information processing has generated much focus on this topic. These pertain to areas such as quantum simulation, quantum communications, fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, and improved quantum error correction. This project uses two-dimensional metal chalcogenidesâ€™ unique band structures comprising multiple valleys to realize high-dimensional quantum qudit states based on multiple flavor degrees of freedom. These materials have a predicted flavor SU(3) symmetry, of particular interest because of the analogy to the quark model in particle physics, and this symmetry is extremely rare in condensed matter systems. The project experimentally tests predictions for novel tunable Kondo effects and Coulomb blockade behavior emerging from this symmetry. The project also performs experiments aimed at manipulating these flavor states to develop qudits towards quantum information processing based on flavortronics. These research activities are coupled with a parallel theoretical effort that informs the experimental one, leading to a synergistic effort aimed at the development of high-dimensional quantum states based on beyond-graphene two-dimensional materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
