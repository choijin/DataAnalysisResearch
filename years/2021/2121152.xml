<AbstractNarration>The project aims to serve the national need for STEM students to succeed in calculus by enabling them to develop a deeper understanding of three-dimensional (3D) concepts through hands-on, physical 3D explorations. Although visualizing 3D concepts on a screen can provide students with some insight, students often still find this process challenging. Additional insight can be gained by students through the use of guided hands-on interactions with physical 3D-printed models. The investigators for this collaborative project are faculty at Monroe Community College (Lead), the University of Oklahoma, and the United States Air Force Academy who will build on a previous CalcPlot3D collaborative project (NSF#1524968-Lead) to develop, implement, and study guided learning activities and innovative, pedagogically-designed, two-color 3D-printed models. An additional component of the project will provide instructional resources, including how-to videos, and scaffolded training for faculty to facilitate their incorporation and creation of 3D models for use in the classroom. In conjunction with these activities, project research will provide insights to determine and inform how instructors leverage 3D models to enhance student visualization and understanding of 3D problems and concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have an interwoven dual emphasis, namely student learning and faculty professional development. The underlying vision of the project is to develop resources and determine best practices for (i) implementing activities using 3D-printed surfaces effectively in the classroom to enhance student interest, intuition, visualization, learning, and understanding of 3D calculus problems and concepts and (ii) providing professional development for faculty in this realm. The project has five major goals. First is to expand the 3D printing features in CalcPlot3D and investigate various print techniques and print media to develop innovative, pedagogically useful 3D-printed surfaces and solids. Second is to develop and class-test a series of learning activities - with guided exploration questions, files to generate 3D models, and an instructor's guide - using 3D-printed surfaces and solids. Third is to create a series of how-to videos and online tutorials to teach faculty how to generate their own 3D-printed surfaces using CalcPlot3D. Fourth is to support student learning activities and help studentsâ€™ visualization by explicitly connecting 3D-printed models to CalcPlot3D digital images. Lastly, the investigators will conduct educational research to determine the impact of these new materials and approaches on student learning and how instructors with CalcPlot3D experience make use of 3D-printed models in their multivariable calculus instruction. The project team will disseminate project materials and findings through various venues including conference exhibits and workshops. The determination of best practices will converge through a multi-year, mixed methods research investigation utilizing formative and summative feedback, and will include development and testing classroom activities and materials and faculty professional development resources. This dual investigative approach will include correlation analysis of participant activity and performance data and a study of how classroom instructors reflect on and employ use of the 3D-printed models and learning activities based on those models. Ultimately, the project will provide a free tool for teaching and learning 3D problems and concepts that will extend to other STEM disciplines and courses beyond calculus. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
