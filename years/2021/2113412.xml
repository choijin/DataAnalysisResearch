<AbstractNarration>This collaborative award is aimed at studying the relationship between the variability of thermospheric winds to the variability caused by wave structures generated in the tropical troposphere. This coupling is driven by wave excitation by deep convection in the tropical troposphere that can propagate vertically into the thermosphere. Tropospheric convection associated with the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO), the dominant mode of intra-seasonal variability in tropical convection and circulation, is known to modulate the intensity of upward‐propagating gravity and Kelvin waves.  Previous work demonstrated that a 90-day oscillation in tropospheric convection during 2009-2010 was imprinted on both thermospheric mean winds and the eastward propagating wavenumber 3 diurnal (DE3) tidal amplitudes. This modulation was observed by the GOCE and CHAMP satellites and modeled with the TIME-GCM. The research effort would broaden participation by involving and training two undergraduate student interns through the University of Colorado BOLD internship program that focuses on promoting the recruitment, retention, and development of traditionally underrepresented engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new research will follow up on the results obtained in recent studies that demonstrated that strong coupling between the troposphere and the thermosphere occurs on intra-seasonal timescales. The award will address the following questions: &lt;br/&gt;Q1: How frequent, prevalent, and persistent are correlations between 30 to 100-day variations in the three regions of troposphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere, during the past two decades? &lt;br/&gt;Q2: What plausible roles do large-scale upward propagating waves play in dynamically coupling tropical tropospheric intra-seasonal variability into the thermosphere? &lt;br/&gt;Q3: Is there any observational evidence suggesting a connection between this troposphere-thermosphere intra-seasonal coupling and MJO, Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)? &lt;br/&gt;The combination of available upper atmosphere satellite data with ground-, and model-based datasets would be studied to provide insight into whether the intra-seasonal variations in the waves are caused by variability in the tropospheric sources or by wave-mean flow interactions. In the case of the latter, the study would determine at which heights these interactions are occurring. This study will determine the contribution of global-scale wave coupling between the troposphere and the thermosphere, thus addressing outstanding issues of fundamental importance to the CEDAR community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
