<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a sustainable heated pavement technology to melt ice and snow on paved surfaces during the winter season. Aviation and transportation agencies allocate significant time and resources each year to remove ice and snow from their paved surfaces to achieve a safe, accessible, and operational transportation network. Transportation networks experience a significant reduction in mobilization capacity due to speed reduction, delays, and in some cases complete shutdown of parts of the network due to snow and ice storms each winter.  The current practice for winter maintenance operation includes using snowplows and deicing chemicals, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and environmentally unfriendly. Implementation of the proposed technology may improve public safety, limit the use of salt and deicing chemicals, reduce delays and cancelations in the transportation system (airports, highways, etc.), reduce the slip and fall potential and the associated settlements. In addition, the proposed technology may ease the commute of individuals with disabilities in the winter season and better meet the Americans with Disabilities Act standards.  The technology is designed to be operated remotely via the internet, which further opens opportunities worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of an electrically conductive concrete (ECON) heated pavement system as an alternative to conventional snow and ice removal.  The proposed technology utilizes the inherent electrical resistance of concrete to electricity flow to generate heat, maintain the pavement surface above freezing temperatures, and thus prevent snow and ice accumulation on the surface. The electricity is applied using stainless steel rebars embedded in the ECON. A fully automated control system operates the system.  The testing and performance monitoring of this technology is in progress at two full-scale demonstration projects at Des Moines International Airport and the Iowa Department of Transportation headquarters. The proposed technology may provide a smart, environmentally friendly alternative to plowing and deicing operations and may effectively mitigate snow and ice formation on paved surfaces while enhancing the sustainability and resiliency of the infrastructure network in the winter season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
