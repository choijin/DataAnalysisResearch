<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a corneal wound healing agent for corneal abrasions and refractive eye surgery. Over 800,000 people per year undergo refractive eye surgery procedures.  The majority of these treatments are either Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) or photo refractive keratectomy (PRK). LASIK wound healing times are shorter with less post-operative pain and higher patient satisfaction in the short-term as a result.  However, LASIK has risks of abnormal thinning of the cornea or flap dislocation and has a higher fixed cost than PRK. Refractive keratectomy surgeons are more apt to perform PRK if the post-operative course were more appealing to patients. Additionally, military personnel have a high rate of refractive surgery (35,000/year) because contact lenses are typically not permitted in active duty and glasses may cause vulnerability and logistical issues. PRK accounts for 85% of military refractive procedures. Corneal abrasions are common (more than 1 million per year) and account for 271,750 emergency medical visits per year. Corneal abrasions may lead to complications such as corneal ulcers, vision loss, and chronic wounds. A new therapeutic agent for acute corneal wounds could impact the clinical care of each of these patient populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a new therapeutic to improve the care of patients with acute corneal epithelial wounds from injury or from surgery.  Corneal epithelial wounds are common conditions that affect more than 1 million patients a year. Common acute ocular surface wounds include corneal abrasions and post-surgical refractive surgery or corneal cross-linking related wounds.  The proposed technology is a corneal wound healing agent and is based on the discovery of a novel peptide that may accelerate healing of corneal wounds by up to 50% as shown in standard animal models.  Current treatments are focused on supportive care and prevention of complications such as infection. There is a need for new therapies to accelerate wound healing and support quicker recovery.  The proposed technology may reduce pain, improve vision, and reduce the risk of infection during the healing process of corneal epithelial wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
