<AbstractNarration>This award funds some of the research activities of Professor Ken D. Olum at Tufts University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic strings are microscopically thin or even fundamental objects of cosmological length, which may or may not exist in our universe. Detection of cosmic strings would provide a window into fundamental physics at energies beyond the reach of any accelerator. Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory, which is our current best theory for unifying the physics of gravity with the physics that governs the subatomic world.  The best hope for discovering a cosmic string network is through observation of gravitational waves.  The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) has detected a signal that is likely be the first sign of a gravitational wave background formed by many sources throughout the universe.  These sources could be pairs of giant black holes in the centers of galaxies, but they could also be cosmic string loops.  Professor Olum will study the gravitational waves that would be emitted by cosmic strings and compare them with current and forthcoming NANOGrav observations.  Professor Olum will also involve graduate students in this work and thereby train future generations of research physicists --- an activity which is in the national interest.  The work will further connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Olum will simulate the evolution of cosmic string loops under the effects of gravitational self-interaction to see how their shapes and their gravitational wave spectra change over time.  He will use a realistic population of cosmic string loops taken from his previous cosmic string network simulations.  By combining the spectra from these loops, he will generate a gravitational wave background spectrum to be expected from cosmic strings and compare it with pulsar timing observations from the NANOGrav collaboration, of which he is a member.  He will also study the velocities acquired by loops in reaction to anisotropic gravitational wave emission, the so-called "rocket effect", which is important for determining the degree of clustering of cosmic string loops in galaxies, and thus their potential observability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
