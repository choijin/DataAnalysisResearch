<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to power technology used in the ocean: hurricane hunters, smart buoys, weather stations, ocean internet hubs, and unmanned underwater vehicles  The project aims to create a low-cost, small-scale Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that can generate electrical energy from ocean wave motion and power nearby equipment. Unfortunately, solar panels don’t operate in low light and consume a lot of area, and wind turbines are difficult to install and stabilize on the sea. A study will be conducted to determine how to maximize the energy output of the WEC at varying wave conditions in a controlled wave tank and compared against simulation results. An accurate mathematical model will be constructed and used to guide the development of the product. The WEC product can be used by emergency relief teams to power radios or cell phones. It can power ocean instruments collecting weather data and tracking incoming hurricanes, as well as equipment at sea used to monitor and protect our nation’s coastlines.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to develop an innovative and compact Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that can offer small-scale power for oceanic instruments, emergency equipment or consumer electronics. The innovation uses a custom arrangement of gears to amplify small wave movements into rotational energy used to power an electrical generator. A computer algorithm and actuators will tune point absorbing arms to the frequencies and amplitudes of ocean waves by modifying mechanical properties of the machine. The WEC has symmetrically spaced point absorbing arms positioned circumferentially that allow the machine to capture wave energy from any direction. The size of the WEC fits within the limits of a laboratory wave tank where the performance of the machine can be maximized for power output. The machine will be analyzed with the Design of Experiments (DoE) approach which efficiently resolves factor interactions. The factors are the number of point absorbers, length of the absorbers, the buoyancy of the absorbers, and their masses. A mathematical model of the device will be created, adjusted to match actual performance, and used to further develop the product. The technical challenge is to produce roughly 10 watts of power in a package about the size and weight of an adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
