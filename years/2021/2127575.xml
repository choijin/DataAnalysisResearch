<AbstractNarration>Strings are fundamental objects in many important computer science&lt;br/&gt;applications, such as text/speech processing, bioinformatics, data&lt;br/&gt;storage and access, and communication systems. However, processing&lt;br/&gt;strings presents various challenges in computation and communication.&lt;br/&gt;For example, many of today's applications involving strings are&lt;br/&gt;implemented on large data sets, and the known algorithms are often too&lt;br/&gt;costly in both time and space. Similarly, when strings are transmitted&lt;br/&gt;between systems, errors like insertions and deletions occur frequently,&lt;br/&gt;which can lead to problems from a simple misunderstanding to a severe&lt;br/&gt;system failure. These challenges are usually addressed by high cost&lt;br/&gt;solutions, where one either requires a large amount of resources for the&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, or expensive hardware that keeps systems strictly&lt;br/&gt;synchronized. The overarching goal of this project is to understand the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental question of how to more efficiently compute different&lt;br/&gt;string measures, and transmit strings reliably in the presence of&lt;br/&gt;insertions and deletions. This will lead to a deeper theoretical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the nature of various string measures and errors, as&lt;br/&gt;well as potentially much more efficient solutions in practice. Examples&lt;br/&gt;of benefits include algorithms that use much less resources for handling&lt;br/&gt;large data sets, and more reliable communication systems in adversarial&lt;br/&gt;environments. The project also has plans for mentoring PhD students,&lt;br/&gt;integration of the research topics into courses taught to students from&lt;br/&gt;a variety of different backgrounds, and support of under-represented&lt;br/&gt;groups of students in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contains two sets of specific goals. The first set of goals&lt;br/&gt;seeks to understand how to design efficient error-correcting codes for&lt;br/&gt;insertions and deletions. These include codes and document-exchange&lt;br/&gt;protocols over the binary alphabet with asymptotically optimal&lt;br/&gt;parameters; codes that form a linear subspace or have a low density&lt;br/&gt;parity check matrix, which allow fast encoding and decoding; list&lt;br/&gt;decodable codes that can correct a larger fraction of errors with&lt;br/&gt;outputting a small list of possibly correct messages; and locally&lt;br/&gt;decodable codes that can correctly recover any target message bit with&lt;br/&gt;only a few queries of the codeword. The second set of goals investigates&lt;br/&gt;the space complexity of various string measures, such as edit distance,&lt;br/&gt;longest common subsequence, and longest increasing subsequence.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the goal is to both design algorithms that require much&lt;br/&gt;smaller space to compute or approximate these string measures, and to&lt;br/&gt;prove better space lower bounds in various models. These two sets of&lt;br/&gt;goals are also naturally connected, since the codes in the first part&lt;br/&gt;can often be used to give space lower bounds in the second part. The&lt;br/&gt;study of these topics will be based on techniques from several different&lt;br/&gt;areas such as probability theory, information theory, combinatorics,&lt;br/&gt;algorithm design, communication complexity, and pseudorandomness, and&lt;br/&gt;will further foster the interactions among these areas towards&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
