<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Interactions between particles making up a material can lead to surprising consequences, where the properties of the material as a whole are distinct from the properties of its constituents. The particles in question can be electrons, or electron holes, which are missing electrons in the material's atomic lattice. Interactions between electrons and holes in materials can lead to the emergence of such new properties â€“ a frontier actively explored by condensed matter physics. An example of such interesting material is the excitonic insulator, with excitons being new particle-like entities in the material that appear due to the attractive interaction between electrons and holes. Such excitons are expected to achieve a novel quantum state, called "excitonic condensate" at sufficiently low temperatures. Theoretical predictions of its existence have never been fully confirmed by conclusive experimental evidence. This work aims at providing direct and convincing evidence for the excitonic condensate. This project also provides comprehensive training to postdocs and undergraduate students in low-temperature high-resolution spectroscopies, who will benefit from experiences brought by international collaborative efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The Rutgers-Technion NSF-BSF collaboration explores the conditions leading to the elusive state of excitonic insulator in solids by employing a combination of transport, angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and polarization-resolved light scattering (Raman) spectroscopies to concurrently study the properties and the dynamics of this state. The objective is to to derive the complete phase diagram for excitonic insulators that includes a structural instability intertwined with a semimetal-to-insulator transition and to establish plausible distinct regimes of the exciton condensation, identify the underlying microscopic mechanisms, and test the relevant theories. The lessons learned from this study will further promote broader understanding of self-organization in other strongly interacting quantum systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
