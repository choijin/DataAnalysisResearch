<AbstractNarration>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown superior performance in enhancing driving safety in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve high accuracy at the expense of increased model complexity, which raises the computation burden of onboard processing units of vehicles for ADAS inference tasks. The primary goal of this project is to develop innovative collaborative AI inference strategies with the emerging edge computing paradigm. The strategies can adaptively adjust cooperative inference techniques for best utilizing available computation and communication resources and ultimately enable high-accuracy and real-time inference. The project will inspire greater collaborations between experts in wireless communication, edge computing, computer vision, autonomous driving testbed development, and automotive manufacturing, and facilitate AI applications in a variety of IoT systems. The educational testbed developed from this project can be integrated into courses to provide hands-on experiences. This project will benefit undergraduate, master, and Ph.D. programs and increase under-represented groupsâ€™ engagement by leveraging the existing diversity-related outreach efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise from Rowan University, Temple University, Stony Brook University, and Kettering University is assembled to pursue a coordinated study of collaborative AI inference. The PIs explore integrative research to enable deep learning technologies in resource-constrained ADAS for high-accuracy and real-time inference. Theory-wise, the PIs plan to take advantage of the observation that DNNs can be decomposed into a set of fine-grained components to allow distributed AI inference on both the vehicle and edge server sides for inference acceleration. Application-wise, the PIs plan to design novel DNN models which are optimized for the cooperative AI inference paradigm. Testbed-wise, a vehicle edge computing platform with V2X communication and edge computing capability will be developed at Kettering University GM Mobility Research Center. The cooperative AI inference system will be implemented, and the research findings will be validated on realistic vehicular edge computing environments thoroughly. The data, software, and educational testbeds developed from this project will be widely disseminated. Domain experts in autonomous driving testbed development, intelligent transportation systems, and automotive manufacturing will be engaged in project-related issues to ensure relevant challenges in this project are impactful for real-world applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
