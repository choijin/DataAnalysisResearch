<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. John Serences at the University of California San Diego, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the interaction of working memory and long-term memory. Working memory refers to the ability to hold information temporarily in mind over the short term. Long-term memory refers to the ability to encode and retrieve information over longer periods (from moments to decades). Researchers have taken great pains to separately measure each kind of memory, in part because they naturally tend to cooperate (e.g., compare holding the letters XZK-FGC-KZPW vs. DOG-CAT-BIRD in working memory). To estimate working memory capacity without support from long-term memory, laboratory studies often use contrived stimuli (e.g., arbitrary color-location pairings). This reductionist approach has revealed that working- and long-term memory have unique behavioral signatures and rely on dissociable neural mechanisms. However, this approach skews our understanding of how working memory functions. In everyday life, to-be-remembered items are rarely devoid of meaning and multiple memory systems are used in tandem (e.g., when asked at trivia to write an alphabetical list of Beatles members, you must first retrieve the information from long-term memory and then manipulate it with working memory). Thus, the interaction of working- and long-term memory is critically important to human memory, and the objective of this research program is to better understand when and why these canonically dissociable memory systems interact. Because working- and long-term memory are intertwined in everyday life, cognition can fail due to difficulties with one or both constructs. Accordingly, this basic science work also has implications for understanding co-occurring working- and long-term memory deficits in normal aging and in clinical populations, as well as implications for how working- and long-term memory work in tandem in educational settings (e.g., when students encounter novel information they must hold in working memory and then later recall).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on decades of research on the separable neural mechanisms that support working- and long-term memory, the project will use fMRI to test competing predictions about the interaction of active working memory maintenance signatures in cortex (i.e., decoding the identity of items held in mind) with neural signatures of support from long-term memory (i.e., hippocampal activation). The first two experiments address competing accounts of the capacity limits of active, cortical working memory codes and how hippocampal activity may support WM when this capacity limit is exceeded. The remaining two experiments address competing accounts of activity-silent working memory â€“ a recently popularized idea that rapid synaptic plasticity within cortex can support working memory maintenance in the absence of persistent activity. This project investigates the alternative account that working memory behaviors may rely upon hippocampal-dependent cortical reinstatement of active codes if persistent activity is lost. The proposed research will leverage fMRI and multivariate modeling to inform competing theoretical accounts of working- and long-term memory. Regardless of the outcome, the findings will inform and extend existing theories of human memory, and the methods developed and refined in the proposed work have the potential to inform future questions (e.g., the ability to decode the identity 4 items held in mind would be useful for other open questions in the memory literature).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
