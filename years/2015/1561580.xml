<AbstractNarration>The Phaff Yeast Culture Collection at the University of California Davis is used for basic research on yeast physiology, yeast ecology (especially yeast-insect associations), comparative genomics, and taxonomy, including discovery of new yeast species.  Yeast collections are also used for applied research, including study of food and beverage fermentation, food spoilage, biofuels exploration, and the development of improved methods to identify yeasts that cause human infections.  This award will fund the transfer of two existing collections, the Starmer collection from Syracuse University and the Ganter collection from Tennessee State University.  The Phaff Yeast Culture Collection is the fourth largest public yeast collection in the world, with over 7000 strains.  A total of 4000 yeast strains will be transferred to UC Davis, expanding the size of the Phaff collection by 50 percent.  In addition, the project staff participate in an annual UC Davis Biodiversity Museum Day, which attracts visitors to the yeast exhibits to learn about microbiology and societal benefits derived from yeasts and culture collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the Starmer and Ganter collections will be shipped to UC Davis where they will be cryopreserved, re-identified by ribosomal sequencing, archived off-site, added to the Phaff collection database, and DNA sequences will be deposited in GenBank.  All three collections include numerous undescribed species, and in some cases, the only known representatives of certain species. Geographically and taxonomically diverse yeast collections like this are now virtually impossible to re-collect.  Once the transfer is complete, the combined collection will be available to the global scientific community.  By posting DNA sequences of accessions in GenBank and expanding information available on the Phaff collection online catalog (http://phaffcollection.ucdavis.edu), the collection will be more visible and valuable for all users.</AbstractNarration>

The collection rescue project, plus use of the ribosomal sequence data to circumscribe yeast species in the Sporopachydermia cereanacomplex was presented at the International Specialized Symposium on Yeast in Bariloche, Argentina in 2018.      Broader impacts:   Phaff collection personnel have participated in several public outreach activities to share knowledge about yeast, the Phaff collection, and research using the collection including Starmer and Ganter’s strains.   500 to 800 visitors of all ages visited the yeast displays at the annual UC Davis Biodiversity Museum Day in February 2016 - 2020.

The visitors particularly enjoyed talking with real scientists, learning about cutting edge research at the Phaff collection and 11 other biodiversity collections at UC Davis, and seeing (and smelling) dozens of different species of yeast. In January 2020, Phaff collection curator Kyria Boundy-Mills took over duties writing stories about culture collections for the US Culture Collection Network blog (usccn.blogspot.com).  Boundy-Mills is serving on a committee of about 12 individuals associated with biological collections to write an NSF-funded report about the current status, uses, potential, and needs of U.S. biological collections. In April 2017, a display about yeast and the Phaff collection was visited by over 900 members of the general public at UC Davis Picnic Day.  In June 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, middle school students learned about yeast in a half-day unit on microbiology as part of UC Davis Bio Boot Camp, a 5-day summer day camp.  The collection contributed display and educational materials for events put on by UC Davis STEM for Girls and the California Academy of Sciences. Planned outreach events in spring 2020 at the Exploratorium science center (San Francisco) and UC Davis Museum of Entomology were postponed due to the COVID-19 crisis.  The Phaff collection staff regularly respond to emails and phone calls from home bakers and brewers, commercial wineries and breweries, biotechnology companies, and the general public with questions about yeast.
