<AbstractNarration>Modern group theory is a very fast developing area of mathematics that uses methods from algebra, geometry, combinatorics, topology, probability, logic, and computer science. Applications of group theory are ubiquitous throughout science, from physics and chemistry to cyber security. This award supports collaborative research in the area of asymptotic methods in group theory, an area that has been extremely active since seminal papers by Gromov on hyperbolic groups and asymptotic invariants of groups. This project will significantly advance knowledge of the area by solving several open problems. The investigators will advise graduate students, organize research experiences for undergraduate students, and organize conferences on the subject of asymptotic methods in group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems under study in this research project include&lt;br/&gt;* estimating Dehn functions of metabelian groups;&lt;br/&gt;* constructing actions of hyperbolic groups resembling Tarski monster groups;&lt;br/&gt;* constructing simple groups that admit highly transitive actions;&lt;br/&gt;* describing all possible Tarski numbers of groups; and&lt;br/&gt;* finding an amenable group with all asymptotic cones tree-graded.&lt;br/&gt;The results of the project will advance understanding of asymptotic methods in group theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is a well known point of view after Klein, Hilbert, Einstein and Weil that fundamental laws describe symmetries occurring in the nature. The symmetry of an object can be measured by the group corresponding to the object. Various physical systems, such as crystals or the hydrogen atom, can be analyzed through symmetry groups. Thus, group theory has many applications in physics and chemistry, ranging from the standard model of subatomic particles to cryptography. Groups can be defined either as groups of symmetries or abstractly by an algorithmic description (generators and relations).
