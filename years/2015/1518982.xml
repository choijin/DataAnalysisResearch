<AbstractNarration>There has been a rapid expansion in afterschool programs in the past fifteen years. Although afterschool is not a new idea, the focus on quality enrichment opportunities for all children, not just those who can afford them is relatively new. One challenge in afterschool programs is to find activities that are school-relevant, but not necessarily school-like. It is often reported that there is a shortage of curricular materials that offer mathematics activities designed for informal settings.  Afterschool programs often offer tutoring in math topics, using materials from the regular day. Some purchase "Math Kits" with a collection of manipulatives. Some use hands-on science activities that are typically isolated one-lesson activities. There are some STEM curricula with a theme that is sustained over several sessions, such as robotics. Others report that they do not have material for informal math programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed "CryptoClub" afterschool program, middle-grade students will explore cryptography while applying mathematics to make and break secret codes. The playfulness and mystery of the subject will be engaging to students, and the afterschool environment will allow them to learn at their own pace. Some activities will involve moving around, for example following a trail of encrypted clues to find a hidden treasure, or running back and forth in a relay race, competing to be the first to gather and decrypt the parts of a secret message. Other activities will involve sitting more quietly and thinking deeply about patterns that might help break a code. On the other hand, in the proposed CryptoClub Online approach, the CryptoClub Website will provide additional opportunities for applying and learning cryptography in a playful way. It currently includes cipher tools for encrypting and decrypting, message and joke boards where users decrypt messages or submit their own encrypted messages, historical comics about cryptography, and adventure games that involve secret messages.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This ICorp-L project gave us the opportunity to explore a commercialization strategy for the CryptoClub program. Our team attended the required two NSF training workshops and participated in the weekly webinars in between. After this initial training, we continued customer discovery activities.  To better understand the audience for our materials, we conducted 104 interviews with leaders of afterschool organizations, principals of public and private schools that offer afterschool programs, teachers and students who participate in such programs, and professional developers who train afterschool leaders. To explore and develop a model for broad implementation, we interviewed the leaders of organizations from ten states who will be partnering with us in a broad implementation project. We explored publishing options by meeting with representatives from publishing companies, and by talking with leaders from other nonprofit organizations that have developed and marketed curricular material. The grant supported travel to several conferences that are attended by afterschool practitioners, professional developers, and content developers, and there we learned more about the needs of our potential customers.  The experience of participating in the I-Corps L project led us to seek out and participate in other opportunities to learn about commercialization. For example, the team attended a networking event at a local startup incubator and a series of seminars offered at our university to help innovators get an overview of the path to launching a technology venture/startup.  Materials Design: Through our customer discovery process, we learned that there is high interest in an afterschool curriculum that applies mathematics, such as ours. As for format, there is a demand for both print and digital versions of our materials. Many school districts are moving to all digital textbooks and would not be interested in purchasing print books. On the other hand, many afterschool programs are held at sites outside regular school districts and do not have access to advanced technology. This audience would need printed books. We learned that low cost is important for our audience.  Professional Development: We learned that typical afterschool programs cannot send their staff to the type of professional development workshops that we currently offer. Our current model of 3-day summer workshops works well for schoolteachers who have summers off, but does not work for programs that hire paraprofessionals shortly before their teaching starts.

BROADER IMPACTS:  1) Teaching students about cryptography makes them aware of basic notions of encryption that are important to all citizens, helps prepare them for jobs in STEM fields in which data security is important, and makes them aware of cryptography as a career choice. 2) CryptoClub activities give students an opportunity to have positive experiences with mathematics as they apply it in an informal afterschool setting. 3) The program provides academic enrichment to students attending high-poverty and low-performing schools, since it is implemented in a variety of afterschool settings that serve this population. 4) I-Corps L participation enabled our CryptoClub Project to make decisions about commercialization strategies that will promote a broad dissemination of the materials.
