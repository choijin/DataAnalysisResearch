<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the eighth annual "Graduate Student mini-Conference in Computational Mathematics" which will be held at Clemson University on February 5 and 6, 2016. Topics covered in the conference consist of recent advances in the theory and implementation of numerical methods for partial differential equations, including multiphase flow, porous media, numerical methods for stochastic PDEs, turbulence, fluid dynamics, climate simulation and PDE constrained optimization. Aside from one plenary speaker, all talks will be given by graduate students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Approximately twenty graduate students from Clemson, Virginia Tech, the University of Pittsburgh, Auburn University, the University of South Carolina, Florida State University, the University of Tennessee, and Emory University will present scientific research talks involving mathematical modeling in science and engineering, and rigorous analysis and efficient implementation of numerical methods for the modeling equations. The conference organizers strongly encourage participation of under-represented groups, and it is expected that nearly half of the graduate student speakers will be from an under-represented group. The goals of the conference are to give graduate students an opportunity to give a professional scientific talk, to bring graduate students and researchers (their advisors) together to discuss collaborative research projects, and to exchange new ideas in many challenging research areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project was a graduate student conference in computational mathematics, which was held at Clemson University on 2/5/16-2/6/16. The purpose of the conference was for graduate student researchers to gain experience giving a research talk, but in a smaller venue and a slightly less formal setting than a major conference like SIAM and AMS.  Giving a good research talk is essential for disseminating one's research results, and also for obtaining a research job in academia or government lab or in industry.  Like any other skill, practice is critical, and this conference provided a venue for the students to gain some experience.  A second purpose was the for the students from various schools to meet, as they are all working in a similar field, and this is a good time for networking between them to begin.  The conference consisted of a plenary talk on Friday evening, 2/5/16, followed by a banquet (banquet not funded by the project).  On Saturday 2/6/16, research talks were presented by graduate students and postocs.  The Friday evening plenary talk was given by Professor Suncica Canic  from University of Houston, about all of the mathematics involved in blood flow / cardiovascular simulation, as well as the goals of this line of research.   On Saturday, 22 talks  were given, 21 by graduate students and about their research, and 1 by  postdoc about their latest research results.  Student speakers came from Clemson, Emory, Auburn, Pitt,  University of South Carolina, Florida State, Virginia Tech, Georgia  Tech, Missouri S&amp;T and Tennessee/ORNL, and presented their research on various topic from fluid flow simulation, fluid-structure interaction, turbulence, nonlocal mechnics, magnetohydrodynamics, fundamental computational mathematics, and various applications. A small remaining amount, for which an extension was granted by NSF, made it possible for graduate students Camille Zerfas and Muhammad Mohebujjaman to attend the SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering  in Atlanta in February 2017.  Both students gave research talks in  special sessions at the conference.        Last Modified: 09/02/2017       Submitted by: Leo Rebholz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
