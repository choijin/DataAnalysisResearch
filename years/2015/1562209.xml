<AbstractNarration>This research project will create new, rigorously grounded, methods for computationally efficient model predictive control. Model predictive control is based on computing system control inputs in response to sensor measurements through the use of real-time numerical optimization. It has proved invaluable in many important applications, including in the aerospace and automotive industries. Computational challenges stem from the need to optimize in real-time the response of large systems of constrained nonlinear dynamic equations in the presence of modeling errors and unpredictable disturbances. There are major difficulties in applying model predictive control to complex engineering systems, particularly when on-board computing power is limited. The most effective ways to address these challenges exploit problem-specific structure, in contrast to a "one size fits all" strategy. This project will produce classes of computationally efficient solution methods that can be appropriately tailored to specific problem characteristics. The developed theory and methods will be applied to control problems for automotive engines and aircraft propulsion systems, to address stringent performance requirements, growing system complexity, and numerous constraints. The implications for spacecraft orbital control will also be pursued to enable model predictive control solutions which expand spacecraft autonomy and resiliency. Project personnel will build on illustrations from automobile and aircraft engines and spacecraft missions to amplify STEM outreach efforts to local high school students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this research project is to develop advanced methods for reducing the computational cost of solving nonlinear model predictive control problems, while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Both a theoretical justification of these methods and their efficient algorithmic implementation will be pursued. Inexact sequential quadratic programming-type methods for solving variational inequalities/inclusions associated with appropriate necessary conditions for optimality will be developed. Some of these methods will compute derivatives just at the starting point or at some selected iterations, while others will utilize inexact Newton iterations. The interplay between cost functions, constraints, closed-loop stability and performance will be studied in the context of these kind of implementations. In addition, novel computational and constraint handling strategies will be developed based on the analysis of Lipschitz stability and sensitivity of nonlinear model predictive control problems considered. Theoretically justified approaches to both offline and online constraint transformations will also be developed as another general pathway to obtain computational simplifications based on sensitivity analysis. Homotopy procedures supplied with error analysis will be applied to achieve efficient computation of model predictive control solutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To broaden the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in industrial applications and as enabling technology for autonomous vehicles this project addressed challenges stemming from employing numerical methods for solving underlying optimal control problems.  These methods have to be fast enough and reliable, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.  The outcomes of this project are summarized in what follows:  We have developed perturbed and inexact versions of the Newton-Kantorovich method which achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost. The main idea is to use approximate Jacobians from preceding iterations instead of computing the exact one and inverting them at each iteration.  Applications to spacecraft control problems have demonstrated the benefits of using these methods.  We have developed a sensitivity-based warm-starting strategy for MPC of discrete-time systems with nonlinear dynamics and polyhedral state and control constraints.  In this warm-starting strategy, the changes in the solution of the parameterized optimal control problem are predicted, as the parameter varies, using the semi-derivative of the solution.  The resulting sensitivity-based solution prediction procedure is applicable even when the constraint qualification conditions, required by prior approaches, do not hold.  Simulation results based on the model of rotational and translational dynamics of a UAV were reported.  The MPC can be regarded as an approximation of the optimal feedback control but still, there are only partial results characterizing errors of such an approximation.  By using the theory of strong regularity and based on our recent results regarding the existence of an optimal feedback control, we found such estimates for MPC applied to a finite duration continuous-time optimal control problem with nonlinear dynamics, integral cost, control constraints, and a time-varying parameter which represents perturbations or uncertainty. Finite duration/shrinking horizon MPC is appealing for a variety of applications involving finite duration (rather than asymptotic) maneuvers, e.g., helicopter ship landing, spacecraft docking, etc. This estimate provides an insight into and a quantitative characterization of the effect of state measurement noise and discretization time step on finite duration MPC  We obtained results that broaden the theory of variational analysis as well as its applications to problems in optimization and control. Metric regularity of differential generalized equations was studied, conditions for the existence of solution of generalized equations were found, and, moreover, the case when corresponding solution mappings have continuous selections was analyzed.  We developed a dynamically embedded MPC approach which performs MPC based on primal-dual gradient flow differential equation without the need for an iterative numerical solution of an optimal control problem.  Using input to state stability arguments, we have showed that if the controller dynamics are sufficiently fast with respect to the plant dynamics, the interconnection between the two systems is asymptotically stable.  The behavior of the resulting closed-loop system was studied using spacecraft relative motion circumnavigation example.  Semismooth predictor-corrector (SSPC) for solving parameterized constrained nonlinear optimization problems in MPC was developed and its advantages were illustrated using numerical simulations for spacecraft attitude control. The method is simple easy to implement, has nice theoretical properties and was shown to be competitive with Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) which uses state of the art QP solver.  A proximally stabilized Fischer-Burmeister (FBstab) quadratic programming algorithm, which synergistically combines the proximal point algorithm with a primal dual semismooth Newton type method, has been developed. The FBstab has many aspects that are appealing to MPC: it is numerically robust, easy to warm start, handles degenerate primal-dual solutions, detects infeasibiliy/unboundeness, and requires only that the Hessian matrix be positive semidefinite.  FBstab can exploit structure, sparsity and specialized linear algebra routines to achieve favorable execution time scaling in the receding horizon length.  For the Time Distributed Optimization (TDO) approach to MPC where a finite number of iterations is applied at each sampling instant, we have developed a framework for demonstrating closed-loop stability based on small gain theorem.  Our results extend existing results in the literature as we explicitly consider inequality constraints and establish local input-to-state stability properties. These results support the use of TDO-based MPC for practical problems such as a lane change maneuver for an automated vehicle  Extensions to explicit reference governor schemes were developed to supervise and modify commands to closed-loop linear time delay systems and protect them against constraint violations. To validate theoretical developments, experimental results for the water flow in a pipe through an actuated valve were obtained. Explicit reference governor for spacecraft attitude control with nonconvex constraints has also been developed.  The results were disseminated through conference and journal articles, book chapters and presentations.  The project has provided training opportunities for graduate students and a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan.  Both Matlab and C++ of FBstab code were released to benefit other researchers.  Broader impact also included outreach to industrial and government lab partners, and enhanced teaching of regular and short courses and tutorial sessions.
