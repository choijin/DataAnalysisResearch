<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the National Power Grid's inability to handle reverse power flows brought about by distributed energy resources (DER). With the accelerated and vast proliferation of DER's such as solar photovoltaic (PV), wind mills, and battery systems, predictability, stability and manageability have become tremendously problematic as found in such states as Hawaii and other world economy leading countries such as Germany. This project is the first of its kind to reduce such grid instability, leveraging leading edge research in Optimal Power Flow and Adaptive Networking technology in order to decrease power loss, minimize blackouts, and make energy accessible to anyone, anytime, anywhere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of developing a new control plane comprised of an adaptive network of sensors and gateways sensing energy grid data, analyzing and optimizing power flow parameters in controllable devices participating in energy distribution grids. The research breakthrough is the recent mathematical theory of convex relaxation of optimal power flow, enabling for the first time, the computation of a globally optimal strategy to configure and control load and generation side, including distributed energy resources in real time, at scale.</AbstractNarration>

Consequently, EAN went beyond developing an IoT gateway and proceeded to include it in high load appliances such as electric vehicle (EV) level 2 chargers to be installed and operated by SB customers in local microgrids.  The overall system architecture developed by EAN is summarized in Figure 1. It consists of a three tier architecture: an EAN Cloud where software applications are developed by an ecosystem of commercial and open source software developers, to be deployed at the edge of the network, an EAN IoT Gateway used to host the EAN Cloud hosted applications, and a set of IoT connected devices, such as EV L2 Chargers that can be instrumented to transmit time series data to the EAN Gateway and in turn accept and execute commands that optimize energy consumption, minimizing power loss.  Recent IoT progress showed convincing evidence that customer adoption at the edge of the network (IoT), is 5 times the pace of electricity or telephone adoption.  However, the enablement of the network connectivity necessitates a multitude of wireless protocol standards and implementation already in place: IEEE802.11, IEEE802.15.4, IEEE P1901.2, GPRS, 3G, LTE, and a variety of emerging Low Energy Bluetooth protocols such as Thread, 6loPAN, ZigBee and others. Consequently, we developed the EAN IoT Gateway such that any protocol can be supported by provisioning adapters available for a wide range of connected devices. The EAN IoT Gateway can sense in fast time scale the essential power signals needed to monitor or control. Thus we developed our first prototype and built multiple units installed at various locations in California, Hawaii and Massachusetts.

We discovered that a simpler and more practical problem to solve was the immediate application of a similar approach to EV charges, hence we applied the same methodology to developing an EV charging optimization algorithm now tested in a 40 device mesh on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, California as shown in Figure 4.
