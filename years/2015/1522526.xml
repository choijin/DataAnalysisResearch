<AbstractNarration>This project will develop new computational tools that will allow mathematicians to investigate some major open questions in number theory. The same tools can also be used to help build faster and more secure cryptographic systems, and to construct error-correcting codes that allow data to be reliably transmitted over unreliable networks. Preliminary results indicate that it should be possible to improve the performance and precision of the algorithms involved by several orders of magnitude, which would make it feasible to address a number of questions that are currently out of reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bulk of the project will be aimed at the practical realization of average polynomial-time algorithms for computing zeta functions of arithmetic schemes, with a particular focus on algebraic curves.  These algorithms allow one to efficiently compute the zeta function of the reduction of a fixed arithmetic scheme modulo all primes up to specified bound. This is precisely the computation needed to investigate various questions in arithmetic statistics, and to approximate the associated L-function to high precision. These tools will be used to study Sato-Tate distributions and explicit aspects of the Langlands program. Computational results of the project will be published in open access electronic databases such as the LMFDB (L-functions and Modular Forms Database).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Langlands Program is a set of conjectures that posits fundamental connections between different parts of the mathematical universe; it has been called a "Grand Unified Theory of Mathematics". In particular, the Langlands Program predicts that certain mathematical objects are related by virtue of having the same L-function, a complex analytic function that encodes certain number-theoretic properties of the object as an infinite sequence of numbers.  Most of the conjectures that make up the Langlands Program remain unproved in their most general form, but proofs of some particular cases have led to spectacular results, such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles, which was achieved by showing that certain types of elliptic curves and modular forms have the same L-functions.  The main goal of this project was to develop computational tools to aid in the investigation of the Langlands program by making it more feasible to compute L-functions of higher dimension analogs of the elliptic curves, specifically curves of genus 2 and 3 (elliptic curves are curves of genus 1).  One of the key project outcomes was the implementation of several new algorithms for computing L-functions of curves of genus 2 and 3.  These algorithms have made it possible to study these L-functions at a level of precision many orders of magnitude greater than was previously possible.  They have also made it feasible to perform large scale surveys of L-functions of millions of genus 2 and 3 curves in an effort to better understand the types of L-functions that arise from these curves, and to search for interesting or exceptional cases.  In the attached images you can see a visualization of the distribution of L-function coefficients (a Sato-Tate histogram) for a particular genus 3 curve of interest.  A subset of the data collected by this project has been made available to researchers (and the public) as part of the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), available at https://www.lmfdb.org.  This has made visible several previously unobserved phenomena and provides a rich source of examples for further exploration.  In addition to providing new tools and datasets of interest to researchers who study the Langlands Program, there are two significant broader impacts of this work.  Elliptic curves currently play a central role in the security of the internet: they support the https protocol that is the standard method for securing connections to websites, and they are the primary means of authentication in most cyrpto-currency protocols.  By studying the mathematical properties of elliptic curves and their higher dimensional analogs we can better understand the strengths and weaknesses of both existing protocols and recently proposed quantum-secure protocols that are meant to be secure against future attacks that may exploit quantum-computing.  The second broader impact relates to the application of cloud computing to mathematical research that was pioneered by this project.  The largest L-function survey conducted under this project used more than 1.8 million virtual CPUs to compute arithmetic invariants of more than 1017  genus 3 curves, completing the equivalent of 300 years of computation in just a few hours (see attached image).  This and other computations undertaken by the poject set several new cloud computing records and are believed to represent the single largest research computation to date performed on a public network.  These efforts provide a roadmap for those in academia or industry who may wish to conduct massively parallel computations on a similar scale in the future.
