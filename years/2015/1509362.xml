<AbstractNarration>Title: Nanoscale interfacial heat transfer engineering to increase high power photodiode device performance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: Analog optical links are being deployed in a growing number of applications. Examples include cable television, beam-forming networks for phased array antennas, "antenna remoting" for radar, and local oscillator distribution for radio telescopes such as the Atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array in Chile, one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. These analog links can be viewed as replacements for conventional electrical cables or waveguides, which are often impractical due to their high loss and limited bandwidth.  High-power, high linearity photodiodes are essential components for these optical links since they can enable high link gain, low noise figure, and high spurious free dynamic range.  However, the efficiency and output power of strongly limited by thermal failure.  Thermal failure is commonly addressed by packaging the devices on high thermal conductivity submounts/substrates.  While this approach often leads to gains in device output, there are additional sources of thermal resistance in the photodiode layers and interfaces must be mitigated to further increase the efficiency of devices. This introduces the overarching theme of this proposal: quantifying the thermal resistance at each layer and interface of a high-power photodiode, and using that information to make informed design choices, applicable to a large class of high power devices, that will lead to improved device performance. The far reaching societal implications from improving high power device performance from a "thermal first" material design and processing prospective will lead to novel material solutions and processes for all electronic devices to mitigate thermal transport from the nanoscale level during architecture design, which will lead to reduction of wasted energy via more efficient electronics via better usage of portable power and reduction in plug loads. Furthermore, this proposed work will be integrated into various coordinated outreach activities, which are focused on increasing science learning and hands-on activities in K-12 classrooms through the NanoDays program, high school teacher and student summer research in University Labs and conference organization and attendance, with particular focus on under-represented groups and low-income schools around Virginia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The overarching technical theme of this proposal is to quantify the thermal resistance at each layer and interface of a modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode, and use that information to make informed material design choices, applicable to a large class of high power devices. This work will measure and quantify the process/thermal property relationships using a hypothesis-driven study of material choice and processing during device fabrication to identify feasible routes for thermal mitigation via layer-by-layer thermal analysis.  The research is driven by the following hypothesis: the sources of thermal resistance in high-power devices can be determined and reduced to dramatically increase device performance through careful choice of materials, design of interfaces, and processing conditions.  Therefore, in testing thermal properties of device-grade thin films and film/substrate interfaces, this project will also advance the understanding of electron and phonon transport in bonded films and metal/non-metal interfaces, with particular focus on device-level structures and the role of defects, microstructure and processing conditions.  From the proposed nanoscale thermal transport measurements conducted with time-domain thermoreflectance, a new device will be designed and tested that will redefine the state of the art power output for high frequency photodiodes.  The power gain realized in this specific photodiode will guide the choices for an entire class of high power devices and set the standard for material and processing choices.  The approach will create novel, feasible material solutions to improve device performance based on a better understanding of nanoscale electron and phonon thermal transport in the bonding layers, bonded interface and sub-mount contact layers, which will directly translate to record output powers in modified uni-traveling carrier photodiodes.</AbstractNarration>

Ultimately the end goal of this work was to improve the performance of photodiodes through informed design choices, which will lower the thermal budget in the device, allowing for higher output powers.  This project was been primarily focused on the optimization of heat transfer across interfaces through engineering of these interfaces, with the optimization based on the fundamental heat transfer physics that was studied at the interfaces between the device contacts and their submounts.     The intellectual merits of this program were in the scientific findings that this research produced, and the resulting device designs that led, and will lead to better photodiode performance.  The scientific research findings from this work were disseminated among four referred journal publications and 23 presentations at technical conferences or invited seminars.  This work resulted in advances in understanding of phonon scattering and thermal transport in crystals typically used in high power devices as active regions or submounts (such as GaN, MgO, diamond, silicon, and AlN).  The research determined relative thermal resistances between phonon defect and dislocation scattering and thermal boundary resistances.  The work also led to informed decisions on device geometries for improved performance.  The research directly correlated power density of active regions in photodiodes to thermal boundary resistances and device area, and experimentally demonstrated improved power density at failure of photodiodes using these concepts informed from the thermophysical property measurements and modeling.  These improved deice designs were also extended to quasi-vertical Schottky diodes.     The broader impacts of this program were in improving energy efficiency of devices, community engagement, and integrating research findings into classroom activities.  The United States consumes approximately 100 quadrillion Btu (100 quads) of energy per year.

The students performed independent literature reviews and developed their topic and paper based around several of the results that were generated in this program and outlined in this final report.  Furthermore, concepts of energy efficient electronics and nanomaterials were integrated into a hands-on module for children in elementary school (K-6) and presented at an annual event in the Charlottesville community.
