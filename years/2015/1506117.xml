<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a group with one PI, a senior colleague, a technician and two undergraduate students to work on a new kind of particle detector using a technology similar to that used in flat screen "plasma" television displays.  These displays use small hermetically sealed cells containing a gas that can hold electric charge.  In this application, the charge will be stimulated by the passage of charged particles passing through the gas cells and can be sensed electronically.  The identity of which cells have been charged provides the spatial information on the particles.  Preliminary tests suggest that it will be possible for these devices to detect particles in a billionth of a second and that cells can be made with a size of about one tenth of a millimeter.  Using experience from commercial providers of flat screen televisions, it is hoped that these detectors can be larger and cheaper than the types in use in other particle physics instruments today.  These detectors may find application in the medical or other communities interested in charged particle tracking.  These and other particle physics applications will also be discussed in public dissemination.  Basic skills in electronics and fabrication techniques will be passed along to undergraduates from U. Michigan State who have the opportunity to work on this project.  The proposed R&amp;D plan will allow the development, in three phases, of a prototype device performing at the design resolution of less than 100 micron (spatial) and 1 nanosecond (in time).  This award covers the first part of this effort, the completion of the first two phases, providing a resolution of about a factor two (spatially) larger than this.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The microhexcavity (&mu;CH)&nbsp; detector&nbsp; was initially inspired by flat panel plasma display panels (PDP) that were used for television and other graphical applications. Such panels are operate at high refresh rates and are characterized by very long lifetimes extending over years with a single gas fill. Their diminutive pixels, or discharge cells, offer high spatial resolution,&nbsp; and they are scalable in size and inexpensive. The uHC R&amp;D program objectives were to develop a particle detector&nbsp; that could incorporate, to the extent possible, many of these PDP attributes.&nbsp; Specifically,&nbsp; the effort focused on the development of scalable, flat panel, gas hermetic, pixelated ionizing particle detectors. These detectors, like PDPs, are characterized by high granularity where the pixel dimensions of are order mm and could offer high spatial resolution, especially when combined into a layered tracker and enhanced by exploitation of the signal timing information.&nbsp; The small cells&nbsp; allowed for a fast timing response of order 1 ns, which would enable these detectors to be used as triggers in a high luminosity LHC type environment. The detectors are gas-hermetic&nbsp; and are fabricated with clean, glass-ceramics substrates, and refractory metal electrodes, without any polymers&nbsp; or degradable substances internal to the gas volume. This clean, sealed construction is necessary to achieve long lifetimes and eliminates the need for expensive and awkward gas mixing and gas flow systems required by all other types of gaseous particle detectors. The lack of a gas system renders these detectors effectively light-weight, low mass, compact and portable.&nbsp; Each pixel operates as an independent detector unit, each capable of high rates. The detectors built under this grant were readout in one coordinate axis only. Pairs of orthogonal detectors would provide two readout coordinates, and with appropriate electronics&nbsp; true two dimensional readout&nbsp; would be possible.An image of a detector prototype&nbsp; &mu;CH fabricated under this contract is shown in Figure 1. Important features are&nbsp; 2 mm&nbsp; hexagonal close-packed cavities. These cavities are machined into 1.5 mm thick glass-ceramic Macor substrate.&nbsp; &nbsp;This type of detector was operated successfully using gas mixtures with Ne, Ar and CF4 in discharge mode, or pure&nbsp; CF4 or C2F6 gases in avalanche mode.&nbsp; Figure 2, which shows individual pixels operating as isolated detection units, uncoupled to its neighbor. This is landmark outcome demonstrating operation of micro-gas-cavity detector cells.&nbsp; The single long term stability and hit rate capability were measured using a beta source. Figure 3 shows the results of the measured single pixel hit rate at three source heights. At the most distant position, the single pixel rate was 1.2 kHz and stable to within 0.5% for 5 days. At the closest source position the pixel rate was nearly 17 kHz for over 6 days, and stable over this time to better than 1%.&nbsp; A measured rate&nbsp; corresponds to 346 kHz/cm2, including the&nbsp; cell packing fraction. The &mu;CH remained operational over many months with a single gas fill, consistent with previous plasma panel sealed detectors.&nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp; &mu;HC&nbsp; sensitivity to near&nbsp; minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) was established by triggering signal recording&nbsp; with a cosmic ray scintillator hodoscope.&nbsp; The time response spectrum, in Figure 4, indicates the&nbsp; 960 ps timing resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;A major outcome of this work was that the &mu;CH could yield long term operation with a single gas fill, be capable of high rates and good timing. Importantly it leads towards a scalable, compact and completely portable tracking detector. The demonstrated capability to operate at high rates (&gt; 300 kHz/cm^2) suggests that the &mu;CH can be staged in the a high pseudo-rapidity region of the ATLAS detector to track forward, high transverse muons.&nbsp; Another application would be as the thin, sensitive layers in a sampling calorimeter. Alternating orthogonal coordinate readout, or true two dimensional readout with a dedicated ASIC would allow for full 3D shower profiling.&nbsp; &nbsp;A design of compact tracker is shown in Figure 5. This device has two four layer multilayers, where each layer is a 10 cm x 10 cm &mu;CH with 2 mm pixels. Angular resolution is about 1 mrad. A compact tracker is attractive numerous research,&nbsp; industrial and homeland security arenas. Applications for portable muon detectors in homeland security, archaeology and industry have long been a topic of interest at instrumentation venues. The tracker (detailed in a recent proposal)&nbsp; can be constructed as a compact, portable high angular resolution muon camera that can be staged underground and used to identify embedded structures or chambers. A Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates&nbsp; the capability of a (30 cm ? 30 cm) &mu;CH type detector deployed under an archeological site to identify subterranean voids.&nbsp; Figure 6 shows the cosmic muon skymap of tracks on the top and bottom detector layers.
