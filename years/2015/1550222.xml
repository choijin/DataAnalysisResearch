<AbstractNarration>1550222&lt;br/&gt;Knappe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and (eco)toxicity, long-chain perfluoroalkyl substances such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate are being replaced with short-chain fluorinated alternatives. Almost no information exists about the occurrence of fluorinated alternatives and their behavior during water treatment. The overall goal of the proposed research is to begin to fill this knowledge gap by studying one class of fluorinated alternatives, perfluoro(poly) ethers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific research objectives include to: (1) develop a quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the analysis of 13 perfluoro(poly) ethers in water, (2) apply the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to (a) determine perfluoro(poly) ether fate in a surface water, (b) quantify perfluoro(poly) ether concentrations and mass flows at the intake of a water treatment plant, (3) in collaboration with the water utility, trace parcels of water through the plant to quantify perfluoro(poly) ether removal/transformation in full-scale water treatment processes, and (4) trace parcels of water through the water distribution system to determine perfluoro(poly) ethers fate during drinking water distribution.  This data would be used to estimate human exposure to perfluoro(poly) ethers via consumption of drinking water. Given the data scarcity surrounding fluorinated alternatives, it is anticipated that the results of this research will receive wide interest.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The production of fluoropolymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, trade name Teflon), involves the use of fluoromonomers and processing aids. In the past, a common processing aid was the ammonium salt of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Because PFOA is bioaccumulative, toxic, and persistent, it is no longer manufactured or used in the United States (US). In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency stipulated conditions for the production and commercial use of a PFOA replacement known as GenX. Apart from its production for commercial purposes, GenX and other perfluoroalkyl ether acids (PFEAs) are also generated as by-products during the production of fluoromonomers. The goals of this research were to (1) develop an analytical method for the determination of GenX and other PFEAs, (2) apply the analytical method to study the fate of emerging PFEAs in full&shy;scale water treatment plants, laboratory&shy;scale adsorption processes, and home filtration systems, and (3) develop data that provide the basis for outreach efforts designed to minimize concentrations of PFEAs in the drinking water of affected communities.</p> <p>With respect to the first goal, a sensitive analytical method for the identification and quantification of PFEAs was developed.

The limit of quantitation (LOQ) for the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method is 10 ng/L for each PFEA.

While GenX was not detected upstream of a fluorochemical manufacturing site, its average concentration was 630 ng/L at a downstream drinking water intake location.

When the fluorochemical manufacturer began to capture process wastewater in late June, the sum concentration of targeted PFEAs in the river dropped sharply to an estimated concentration of ~4,200 ng/L by mid-July, 2017 and to ~500 ng/L by the end of September 2017.</p> <p>Water samples were also collected after each step of the water treatment process in a full-scale water treatment plant.
