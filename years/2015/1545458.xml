<AbstractNarration>NRT-IGE: Training STEM Graduates to Communicate in the Digital Age and Measuring Whether it Works. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grand challenges in science and engineering require broad professional training for graduate students so they have the skills to successfully communicate technical concepts to diverse audiences. Scientists need to be able to talk with policymakers if public funding of science is to yield benefits to society, and they need to talk with commercial partners to create opportunities for innovation. They need to talk with journalists to keep the public informed. Accordingly, science communication training is increasingly integrated into graduate science education, but there are few methods for determining whether training actually works or whether some training programs work better than others. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Connecticut will develop and test tools to measure whether training in science communication works and to test which methods work best. The innovative pilot will pair science graduate students with journalism majors and include communication skills training in traditional, digital, and social media. The project will bridge disciplines and create assessment tools that can be used across the graduate education community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and test new teaching materials and new innovative tools to evaluate whether the model succeeds in increasing communication effectiveness and activity among science, math, and engineering students. During the pilot, young scientists will be paired with journalists to engage in an interview-write-assess-repeat model. The project will utilize publicly available social media data and evaluations provided by undergraduate students to assess the participating graduate students' effectiveness as communicators. These data will permit comparisons of students before and after training and comparisons of traditional assessment methods with those provided through social media analytics. Social media metrics may also provide a cost- and labor-effective means to track trainees over the course of their careers.  The assessment tools developed and tested in this project will be transferable across disciplines and universities, for the first time permitting cost-benefit comparisons among programs using different training strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.  The Innovations in Graduate Education Track is dedicated solely to piloting, testing, and evaluating novel, innovative, and potentially transformative approaches to graduate education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual merit: Scientists  need to develop the ability to communicate to non-scientists about the  nature and importance of what they do. Many scientific institutions have  devoted resources to the creation of science communication training  programs, and scientists devote time to participating in them.  However,  there is no rigorous standard method for evaluating whether these  training programs help students become better communicators, or whether  some kinds of training programs work better than others. Our research  showed that graduate students who took an intensive science  communication course only improved a little, and not more than graduate  students who didn't get any training. This suggests that training  doesn't have much effect on short time scales, students need much more  practice before training helps them improve, theory about what audiences  think "good" communication looks like are incorrect, or all of these  are true.  Broader Impacts:  If  we are going to avoid wasting money and time training graduate students  how to be good communicators, we need  to know if a particular kind of  training works best, or if training  works at all. Our research results  will help graduate science communication training programs improve by  improving their methods of assessing whether the way they train their  graduate students works, and how much difference it makes. This will  help make the benefits of scientific results that are crucial to  informed public decision making accessible to everyone.
