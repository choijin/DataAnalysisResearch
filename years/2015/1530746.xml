<AbstractNarration>The proposed studies will explore, in depth, heterogeneity in the vulnerability of black college students to stereotype threat, and the way in which incentives can mitigate the impact of the threat. Stereotype threat occurs when members of a social group, in a given situation, feel themselves to be at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about their group and therefore perform less well, especially on important or difficult tasks. The study will contribute to knowledge about stereotype threat by identifying factors that contribute to or mitigate the threat and the consequences of stereotype threat vulnerability, and by developing a policy designed to combat its effects on black college students. It addresses one of the most important questions in the study of human capital investment today, which is why black students underperform and as a result are more likely to fail to complete a college degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the principal investigators plan a series of lab experimental studies that will explore the interaction between stereotype threat and two types of incentives: piece rates and prizes. The project will explore the relationship among a set of key factors that are likely to be responsible for the differences in vulnerability to stereotype threat, and carefully explore the impact of incentives and their interaction with stereotype threat. The proposal has high policy relevance because it can inform the development of interventions to enhance the performance of black students enrolled at institutions with varying demographic distributions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stereotype threat is a term used to describe the feeling of being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one?s social group. Steele and Aronson (1995) used black students at Stanford University to show that the performance of students on a verbal GRE fell when they were reminded, subtly, of the stereotype that blacks are not as smart as whites. Other research has produced similar findings (e.g., Brown and Day, 2016; Davis et al., 2006). Yet the majority of these studies focus on the effect of stereotype threat on black students attending predominantly white institutions.  In our experiment, we examine the role of stereotype threat on the verbal GRE test scores of black students attending a historically black university. There is evidence in economics and other fields that supports the idea that black students at HBCUs may benefit from this type of environment. For example, HBCUs are known for having a diverse faculty, and studies like Egalite et al. (2015) show that young black students have higher reading and math test scores when they have a black teacher. At an HBCU, black professors could serve as a valuable presence for students who are coping with the effects of negative stereotypes about their intelligence or academic motivation.

Research has shown that stereotype threat is reduced when people read about successful people from their identity group (McIntyre et al., 2003), so that is another way in which HBCUs may make a difference. Altogether, these factors could reduce the negative effects of stereotype threat for black students at HBCUs.  We conducted our experiment to test this idea with students at a historically black university in Texas. Students in the treatment group were primed to think about the negative stereotype about blacks? intelligence before answering questions on a mock verbal GRE. Students in the control group were not primed before taking the exam.   We also varied the level of threat by changing the identity of the lead experimenter. In some sessions, the lead experimenter was a black female (low threat); in others, the lead experimenter was a white male (high threat). According to standard hypotheses about the effects stereotype threat, students in the treatment group should have performed worse than students in the control group. Additionally, we predicted that students with a white male experimenter would answer fewer questions correctly than students with a black female experimenter.  None of these predictions were confirmed in this study. In both the black female experimenter sessions and the white male experimenter sessions, we found little evidence that stereotype threat negatively affects students? test score. Students in the control group correctly answered a similar number of questions as students in the treatment group and had similar accuracy.  We also failed to find strong evidence to support the idea that students? test scores were affected by the identity of the experimenter. Having a black female experimenter had a negative effect on the total questions students answered, but the type of experimenter had no significant effect on the number of questions students answered correctly.  Thus, we find preliminary evidence that stereotype threat may not be a problem for black students at HBCUs. If that is the case, then studying the recruitment strategies, teaching methods, on-site resources, and the general environment of HBCUs could teach us how to prepare black students to deal with negative stereotypes about their intellect.

This may help reduce America?s persistent black-white achievement gap. Therefore, we recommend that future research should investigate differences between HBCUs and PWIs and the students who choose to attend them and study how these differences affect the performance of black college students.
