<AbstractNarration>Cosmic rays are highly energetic sub-atomic particles from space that travel at velocities near the speed of light.  The origin and acceleration mechanism for ultra-high energy cosmic rays, which likely come from extreme astrophysical phenomena outside our galaxy, are currently unknown.  The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest cosmic ray detector ever operated, with an instrumented area of more than 3000 square kilometers.  Built in Malargue, Argentina by an international collaboration, the Pierre Auger Observatory was designed to study the origin and interactions of the highest energy particles in the Universe.  This award supports the astroparticle group at the Colorado School of Mines in their work on Auger to address systematic uncertainties in the measured energy and composition of cosmic rays.  They will utilize a recently completed upgrade to the laser calibration systems at Auger.  They are also installing and will operate Auger detector tanks on the site of another cosmic ray observatory, the Telescope Array in Utah, to cross-calibrate the detectors from both observatories.  The work of the Colorado School of Mines group also has broader applications to atmospheric sciences.  They will use the laser calibration system to validate and then share atmospheric aerosol measurements.  They will use the Auger optical detectors to study light emitted in the ionosphere about 90 km above certain thunderstorms.  They plan to host a conference on interdisciplinary science with astroparticle detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colorado School of Mines group will focus on improved air shower reconstruction methods and detailed measurements of systematic effects to address the unresolved discrepancies in cosmic ray data.  The Raman LIDAR on the Auger Central Laser Facility will be used as independent atmospheric calibration.  The Auger water Cherenkov Surface Detector tanks installed at the Telescope Array site will be used for a detailed cross-calibration between Auger, which views the southern sky, and Telescope Array, which views the northern sky.  Planned analysis of the Auger data includes developing a new method to reconstruct air showers with the Surface Detectors, and developing a method for anisotropy scans that include energy and angular uncertainties.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant supported a research team at the Colorado School of Mines  (CSM) to study the highest energy cosmic rays using the Pierre Auger  cosmic ray observatory (Auger)&nbsp; This international facility features the  largest cosmic ray detector in the world. Spanning some 3000 km<sup>2</sup>,&nbsp; Auger uses the atmosphere as an enormous calorimter.  Located in the Mendoza Province of Argentina, Auger measures the highest  energy subatomic particles known to exist in the universe, reaching 10<sup>20</sup> electron volts and beyond. &nbsp; At the highest  energies, the rates fall below one per square mile per century. The  sources of these mysterious particles are unknown.<br /><br />Under this award, the CSM group focused on three specific main areas of research, making advances in each.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>1. Laser Test Beams and atmospherics</strong><br />&nbsp;The most  precise cosmic ray extensive air shower measurements are made by the the  optical air fluorescence detector (FD).&nbsp; The atmount of light  is proportional to the energy of the primary high energy cosmic particle.</p> <p>The rate of ultra high energy cosmic rays is extremely low. Particle test beams are not  available, the Colorado School of Mines group is responsible for an  alternative method that uses calibrated pulsed UV laser beams. The lasers produced tracks in the optical cosmic ray  detectors.&nbsp; The tracks are as bright as the highest energy cosmic ray  tracks.&nbsp; During this award both systems operated as intended. One had been updated with a RAMAN lidar which is a best-practices instrument in atmospheric montoring.&nbsp; The data was used for critical hourly measurements of the atmospheric clarity during the time the Auger fluorescence detector was operating. No other cosmic ray detector in the world has this level of atmospheric clarity monitoring.</p> <p><strong>2. Study of atmospheric transients, dubbed "Elves"</strong></p> <p>The Pierre Auger Observatory turns out to have extraordinary sensivity to to the emission of UV light from the base of the ionosphere above extreme lighting. The light is produced when the electromagnetic pulse(s) from lighting accelerate free electrons in the ionosphere and cause N2 molecules to fluorescence.&nbsp; The viewing footprint of Auger for observing this phenomena covers 3 million km^2, reaching the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and includes an area near Cordoba Argentina that is famous for having the highest rate of strong lighting in the world. We identified 1600 elves recorded by Auger during a 3 year period and these elves were matched to lightning measurements by a global lightning detector network. We found that the elves provide a new way to study strong lighting (article in press). The storms in the Cordoba region may offer a proxy for storms of the future elsewhere as the climate warms. <strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>3. Improving methods to search for point sources of cosmic rays</strong></p> <p>We find that when measurement uncertainties are not considered properly, a&nbsp; data scan for cosmic ray sources could pass for an acceptable signal, yet yield completely erroneous parameters. The situation is much improved by factoring in the error on the event energies. This limits the number of false positives. This could be important when considering, for example, the fact that Auger finds a signal for nearby starburst galaxies and a relatively large collection of Active Galactic Nuclei type sources, both with large correlation angles.</p> <p><strong>4. Auger@Telescope Array</strong></p> <p>The Telescope Array (TA) is the largest cosmic&nbsp; ray observatory located in the Northern Hemisphere in Utah.&nbsp; Auger primarily views the southern sky and TA primarily views the northern sky.&nbsp; To cross calibrate the experiments, <em>in situ,</em> the CSM group in collaboration with other groups of the TA and Auger experiments has installed two functioning ground detector stations of the sort used in Argentina near the center of the TA experiment in Utah.&nbsp; These stations are being used to compare details of how the two experiments measure high energy cosmic rays.&nbsp; 6 more Auger stations are at the site awaiting deployment for a micro array to measure the cosmic ray energy independently. We expect the combined Auger + TA arrays to be 50% efficient at about log(E/eV)=18.2 and fully efficient at about log(E/eV)=19 corresponding to a coincident trigger rate of 80-120 events per month or about 20-30 fully-reconstructed events per month with 10 to 20 events per month passing all quality cuts. However, the deployment of the Auger micro-array was not supported under this award, but could be realized in future award.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/23/2020<br>      Modified by: Lawrence&nbsp;R&nbsp;Wiencke</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1506486/1506486_10381137_1582506333102_GrowthPlot--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1506486/1506486_10381137_1582506333102_GrowthPlot--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Significance cosmic ray source correlation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1506486/1506486_10381137_1582506333102_GrowthPlot--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Significance cosmic ray source correlation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The statistical significance of a the correlation between Star Burst Galaxies directions and the directions of high energy cosmic rays directions measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory is increasing with time.
