<AbstractNarration>Riemann-Hilbert problems (RHPs) arise in a plethora of applications, varying from equations describing tsunamis to the understanding of nuclear energy. In its most basic form, a RHP determines a function that jumps in a prescribed way along a curve in the plane and has specified behavior far away from where the jump occurs. Such problems were first posed by Riemann and later by Hilbert at the end of the 19th century. Their study has been at the forefront of pure and applied mathematics. Until recently, little effort had been devoted to the actual computation of solutions of such problems. This research project extends recent work in carrying out numerical investigations. It is anticipated that major advances will be made in the solution of RHPs, allowing for the increased understanding of tsunamis, fast optical communication, and other physical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to develop new computational tools for the solution of RHPs and their extensions. Traditionally, RHPs arise in the context of singular integral equations and the Wiener-Hopf technique. More recently, RHPs have been connected to random matrix theory, nonlinear special functions, and nonlinear wave equations. RHPs may be posed on Riemann surfaces, and nonlinear jump conditions may be specified. Recent developments involving the investigators and collaborators have led to the development of accurate and efficient numerical algorithms for the solution of RHPs, for problems posed on Riemann surfaces, and for the computation of special functions such as the Schottky-Klein prime function. However, many open problems remain, particularly concerning new applications. This project aims to develop new computational methods to solve these problems, with an emphasis on the development of fast and efficient algorithms that can deal with complicated geometries, and to deploy them in applications. The investigators, postdoctoral scholar, and collaborators bring together a unique combination of expertise in the different areas needed to successfully carry out the collaborative project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through a fruitful collaboration between researchers at the University of California, San Diego and the University of Washington, new results were obtained on problems that require significant input from complex function theory, as originally pioneered by Cauchy, Riemann, and others, centuries ago. New advances in this area due to Fokas and others allow us to gain understanding on a variety of problems, including diffraction problems (from physics), Stokes flow (from biology), and the sine-Gordon equation (relevant for superconductors).  Our advances are predominantly computational, allowing highly accurate computations of solutions to these problems which have eluded previous researchers.   Intellectual Merit:  At the University of California, San Diego, previous numerical approaches for Riemann-Hilbert problems have been adapted to solve matrix Wiener-Hopf problems that arise in scattering theory. This required designing schemes that incorporate the ncessary physics. The resulting method is very efficient and leads to highly accurate solutions for semi-infinite geometries that are difficult to treat using standard methods. Extensions to more complicated systems will be possible using this approach. Problems of fluid flow in channels with biological motivation have been solved using both the Fokas approach and Wiener-Hopf methods.  At the University of Washington, a new numerical method was devised to solve the sine-Gordon equation, which describes phenomena in semi-conductors, among other applications. Unlike standard methods, the new algorithm guarantees the accuracy of the solution to within an arbitrarily small prescribed error. In addition, the solution of linear problems with boundaries has been examined, combining the advances due to Fokas with new methods that deal efficiently with highly oscillatory inputs.  The efforts in both places centered around the use of complex function theory, especially with regards to Riemann-Hilbert problems (problems where quantities may change discontinuously in specific places) and Riemann surfaces (allowing for more complicated geometries). Our work extends our recent work and the work of others to allow for fast and accurate numerical computations in these settings, beyond what was previously possible.     Broader Impact:  Because of the range of applications where Riemann-Hilbert problems and Riemann surfaces arise (tsunamis, plasma physics, superconductors, fluid mechanics, electromagnetic and acoustic scattering among others), our advances impact different fields affecting the lives of many and providing avenues towards new technologies. In addition, one postdoctoral fellow and two PhD student received training under this award.                Last Modified: 10/29/2019       Submitted by: Stefan G Llewellyn Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
