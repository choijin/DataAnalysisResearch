<AbstractNarration>This project explores balancing performance considerations and power consumption in cyber-physical systems, through algorithms that switch among different modes of operation (e.g., low-power/high-power, on/off, or mobile/static) in response to environmental conditions. The main theoretical contribution is a computational, hybrid optimal control framework that is connected to a number of relevant target applications where physical modeling, control design, and software architectures all constitute important components. The fundamental research in this program advances state-of-the-art along four different dimensions, namely (1) real-time, hybrid optimal control algorithms for power management, (2) power-management in mobile sensor networks, (3) distributed power-aware architectures for infrastructure management, and (4) power-management in embedded multi-core processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome, which is to enable low-power devices to be deployed in a more effective manner, has implications on a number of application domains, including distributed sensor and communication networks, and intelligent and efficient buildings. The team represents both a research university (Georgia Institute of Technology) and an undergraduate teaching university (York College of Pennsylvania) in order to ensure that the educational components are far-reaching and cut across traditional educational boundaries. The project involves novel, inductive-based learning modules, where graduate students team with undergraduate researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF program Hybrid Control Tools for Power Management and Optimization in Cyber-Physical Systems project created new algorithms and tools for power management and optimization across multiple levels of the cyber-physical systems technology stack: from processors to platforms. The key outcomes are as follows:  The development of a computationally effective, hybrid optimal control framework was developed by the Georgia Tech team based on fast, regularization algorithms that allow for non-hybrid methods to be employed on the hybrid problem in a formally correct manner. The framework was generalized to accommodate shared resource and dwell-time constraints among computing agents.  This hybrid optimal control framework was applied in two distinctly different areas: (i) Power-aware mobility for mobile robots, where the robots have to both move and use power to communicate and stay connected during their maneuvers, and (ii) Multi-core processor power, performance and thermal control.  Furthermore a novel theory for cloud-based optimization was developed at Georgia Tech, whereby centralized information (from the cloud) is merged with locally available information. This advancement has allowed for a systematic production of hybrid information-exchange architectures where agents can take fast decisions based on locally available information yet inject intermittent, centralized information into the decision making process in a provably correct manner. This algorithm was implemented on the supporting software architecture - PhysiCloud - developed by York College and Hampden-Sydney College students.  An important educational component of this work was the creation of a cyber-physical mentor program among Georgia Tech and York College of Pennsylvania students.Through this program, Georgia Tech graduate and York College undergraduate students would travel to the other school to perform research. These immersive experiences provided graduate students with mentorship experience and undergraduate students exposure to Georgia Tech research facilities. Additionally, undergraduate students at Hampden-Sydney College (HSC) targeted PhysiCloud for sensor/actuator networks within the HSC Energy Research Lab (ERL).
