<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Development and Implementation (DIP) Projects build on proof-of-concept work that shows the possibilities of the proposed new type of learning technology, and teams build and refine a minimally-viable example of their proposed innovation that allows them to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and that allows them to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning. One important challenge is helping teach people how to use technology and statistics to understand numerical data through analysis and modeling. This project refines and studies technology for 'data science games': essentially, a game is embedded in a data analysis environment, in which the game can only be 'won' by doing data modeling. Research will examine how students learn to analyze and model data in high school biology, chemistry, and physics; how the game can support this learning; and how such games can fit into high school science classrooms (as tested in a large urban school district). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses design-based research methodology to understand how students engage with and learn about data science (specifically, concepts of center, spread, distribution, and inference) and to identify social, technological, and pedagogical supports to allow classroom use, including various types of data representations in the data games (flat, hierarchical, tree, digraph, and relational). Semi-clinical interviews and direct observation of students using the games in controlled settings will lead to broader workshop- and classroom-based observations of individuals and dyads using think-aloud protocols. This data will be analyzed both using grounded theory and using diSessa's knowledge analysis method and analysis of discourse using Hmelo-Silver et al.'s CORTDRA diagrams.  In addition, teacher focus groups and classroom video will be used to help identify affordances related to classroom adoption. The design and development work will be driven by the empirical research, and will utilize Squire's game-based learning design principles, starting with the existing CODAP (Common Online Data Analysis Platform) software. Four design iterations will take place, each culminating in user testing, initially with a summer workshop of students, then with two rounds of classroom testing in six high school classrooms, and finally in an open adoption phase in which 50 teachers will be recruited for data collection (but more teachers may adopt the software and curricula).</AbstractNarration>

Data science courses and programs are springing up in undergraduate and graduate programs, and progress is being made in developing high school courses in data science. However, the most important and difficult educational challenge is to figure out how to integrate meaningful experiences with data across all subject areas starting in elementary school. The Data Science Games project has tackled this problem by creating data-rich online activities, some of which qualify as games, that can be integrated into the teaching of various high school courses including physics, biology, and computer science.</span></p> <p dir="ltr">These activities are available in <a href="learn.concord.org/dynamic-data-science/" target="_blank">Dynamic Data Science collection</a>&nbsp;on the Concord Consortium website.

Researchers were particularly interested in a set of conjectured ?data moves? including filtering, grouping, summarizing, calculating, merging/joining, and making hierarchies. An initial study enacted task-based semi-structured clinical interviews with pairs of adolescent students. Our goal was to catalogue the conditions under which students made data moves within the game and simulation environment. We found that students were most likely to make data moves when they perceived the dataset to be (1) relevant to their investigative goals, but (2) mismatched in some way with students? contextual knowledge. For example, a student might use data moves to filter out data points that they determine to be irrelevant to the questions they are asking, or to calculate a new measure that makes it easier for them to interpret or understand the data (e.g., changing meters to feet). Informed by these findings, we developed a framework for analyzing students? data transformation processes as the coordination of investigative goals, data context, and the execution of data move to better align data with goals (see Wilkerson et al. 2018; Wilkerson et al. In progress).&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Based on findings from our first study, we developed a more sophisticated series of three task-based semi-structured clinical interviews to explore the development of data moves over time. This set of three interviews asked adolescent learners to explore a variety of public social and scientific datasets to answer researcher-posed questions as well as their own. Across interviews, students? engagement in data moves varied dramatically. One finding from this work is that making a data move creates an opportunity for students to reason about variability and noise in data?something that has been shown to be difficult when working with data students did not construct themselves (Wilkerson, Lanouette, &amp; Shareff, Under Review). Another finding is that students spend time developing competence with particular types of data moves (e.g., calculation, filtering, or graphing) before combining them with others. This may be connected to different data types, which lend themselves to different moves. These findings have implications for the design of activities meant to support students? development of competence in transforming and analyzing large, complex datasets such as those available through scientific organizations (Wilkerson, Shareff, &amp; Lanouette, 2019).</span></p> <p dir="ltr">Project researchers and developers became increasingly aware of the importance of data science education as an emerging field with important implications for K12 education.
