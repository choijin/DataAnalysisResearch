<AbstractNarration>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator.  It is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson. One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work proposed here will analyze data from the CMS experiment, looking for signals of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund two aspects of the CMS experiment: 1) further searches for BSM physics and 2) help build the CMS Phase I forward pixel detector (FPix) upgrade, which will enhance the ability of CMS to discover BSM physics. The CMS physics analysis supported by this award will focus on Supersymmetry(SUSY) and Dark Matter, both proposed BSM. A means of identifying b-quarks in the CMS data ( b-tagging) will be further developed and refined by this award. One SUSY candidate is the stop quark, the supersymmetric partner of the SM top quark. Decay products of stop quarks involve top quarks and b-tagging is the tool to find events with top quarks. In addition, events with directly produced top quarks serve as backgrounds to signal events that contain top squarks. The CMS Pixel Detector is the tool to efficiently provide precise tracking and b-tagging needed for SUSY searches.  The award also provides important parts of the FPix upgrade which are being tested at FermiLab. The CMS Forward pixel upgrade will allow the precise vertex location, needed for all physics studies, even in the harsh environment (very high luminosity) expected in near future LHC running. The CMS Forward Pixel Detector uses state-of-the art silicon technology for particle detection combined with equally sophisticated readout electronics. Innovative techniques of radiation hard technology and bump bonding have been used in the current detector to meet the real estate challenges in a high radiation environment. These techniques would greatly enhance the life span of detectors used in outer space research and improve bio-sensing miniature devices for medical applications.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="text-align: justify;">The project investigated the very pertinent questions of electroweak symmetry breaking and hierarchy problem in the field of elementary particle physics using the apparatus of Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). One of the greatest scientific accomplishments of modern era is the Standard Model (SM) of particle Physics. It mathematically interprets the invariance (gauge symmetry) of laws of physics under the rotation of quantum fields. The difference in the masses of force carriers in the SM arises from their varying strength of interactions with what is called as the Higgs field. The localized excitation of Higgs field is referred to as the Higgs boson and its discovery at the LHC in 2012 completed the last missing piece of the SM. A compelling model that can account for the observed Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV without the issue of fine tuning is the extension to the SM called Supersymmetry (SUSY). SUSY extends the symmetries of space and time into the quantum domain, connecting the purely quantum mechanical property of spin to classical macroscopic quantities like space and time. It also provides a framework for the unification of particle physics and gravity at the Planck scale where the gravitational interactions become comparable in magnitude to the gauge interactions. &nbsp;The main assertion of SUSY is the existence of one or more hypothetical particles, called superpartners, for every SM particle and one of these can be an excellent candidate to form the universe's cold dark matter.

The selected events composed of a large imbalance in transverse momentum and solely of hadronic jets in the final state. An improved top quark tagging technique with three different decay topologies was used providing high detection efficiency over a wide range of top quark transverse momentum. We did not find any evidence of superpartners. When top squark pair is produced directly and each decay to a top quark and a neutralino, we inferred that the masses of any hypothetical squarks and neutralinos should be more than about six and three times, respectively, the mass of the SM top quark. When gluinos pairs are produced followed by the decay of each gluino to a top quark-antiquark pair and a neutralino, then gluino and neutralino masses up to about twelve and six times, respectively, the mass of the SM top quark are excluded. These limits extend the previous results. The impact of these findings is significant as it limits the possibilities that SUSY can provide a natural explanation for the light mass of the Higgs Boson.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Another primary accomplishment was building an upgraded pixel detector (Phase 1) for the CMS experiment.
