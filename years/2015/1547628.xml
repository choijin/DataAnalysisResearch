<AbstractNarration>Declining snowpack is a growing environmental, social and economic concern across the western United States. The climate of the Pacific Northwest provides little rainfall during middle of summer and early fall, so that streams rely on the legacies of winter snow to maintain higher discharge during spring and into the summer. In 2015, the snowpack was at record low levels in the Cascade Mountains and with severely diminished snowpack in winter, streams that drain Cascade Mountain catchments across Oregon, Washington and California are expected to experience record low summer discharge this year. This project will measure the variation in stream nitrogen concentrations across a large forested watershed in Oregon and determine how nitrogen and life in streams change under these severe drought conditions. Forecasts for the Pacific Northwest suggest that droughts associated with reduced snowpack will be more common in the future, with associated ecological, social and economic consequences, including effects on fish species that rear in headwater ecosystems. This project will support two undergraduate interns. Because it will be conducted in association with other long-term university and U.S. Forest Service research projects, it will leverage the outreach and broader network infrastructure for extending results and engaging with the public and forest managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme low flow conditions are expected to increase variability in background nutrient concentrations as dilution by surface water declines. In headwater streams, areas with both elevated nutrients and elevated light have higher primary production which in-turn enhances biogeochemical activity. Determining how patterns of nitrogen availability change as flow declines is therefore important in understanding not only where primary production may be elevated but also where biogeochemical hotspots are likely to develop. This work will quantify inorganic nitrogen, light, and in situ chlorophyll a in a synoptic sampling effort that will encompass 12 km of a 4th-order stream network in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Working in a drought year will maximize the potential to identify the influences of spatial heterogeneity in nutrient availability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Declining snowpack in mountains across the western US is a growing environmental, social, and economic concern.  In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, we saw record low snowpack across the Cascade Mountains in winter 2015. Given the Mediterranean climate that dominates much of northwestern North America (with little rainfall during mid-summer and early fall), streams that drain the Cascade Mountains are reliant on the legacies of winter snow to maintain higher discharge during spring and into the summer.  With the extreme reduction in 2015 snowpack we saw severe drought conditions in the streams during summer 2015 across Cascade mountain regions of Oregon, Washington, and California.  This research project focused on exploring how extreme low flow conditions affected stream nutrient concentrations, with a focus on stream inorganic nitrogen &ndash; an important limiting nutrient in these systems. Understanding patterns of stream nutrient availability is important because both primary productivity and organic matter decay can be affected by stream nutrient availability.  Working along a total of 12 km of a mid-sized stream network that encompassed the mainstem and two key tributaries, water samples were collected at 50 m intervals early and late in summer 2015.  In addition to nutrient analysis on these water samples, estimates of stream light availability and benthic algal standing stocks were conducted at the same 50 m intervals throughout the stream network once in mid-summer.  The assessment of spatial patterns of stream nutrient availability focused in particular on identifying of areas with elevated nutrient concentrations late in the summer.  A local hotspot of elevated nutrient input is more likely to be apparent during periods with very low summer flow when dilution by surface water would be minimal.  Similarly, areas where nutrient uptake is elevated may also have greater influence on overall concentrations during low flow relative to high flow conditions.  Understanding how patterns in nutrient availability &ndash; which strongly control fixation and loss of carbon &ndash; change in response to changing flow regimes will help inform how these processes may be altered in the face of natural and anthropogenic changes in discharge patterns.  Quantifying stream nutrients along the network in early July 2015, we found that inorganic nitrogen (as nitrate) availability was could be quite difference at scales of 500 to 1000 m along the stream, but that it was less variable at smaller spatial scales (Figure 1).  However, there were clear areas of transition along the stream where concentrations shifted over a short distance.  During low-flow surveys in late August, the synoptic surveys identified localized areas where nutrient availability increased well above July concentrations (Figure 1). While these areas were present, as hypothesized, there were fewer spots identified than expected. This may be due in part to the low flow conditions that were already present in July.  At the time of our initial 2015 stream surveys (July 1-3), discharge was already lower than the low flow conditions in late August of a "normal" year.  In contrast to our hypothesis, estimated standing stocks of chlorophyll a were not well correlated with nutrients or light along the mainstem of the study stream.  We attribute this in part to the influence of grazing by stream macroinvertebrates.  These insects can consume large amounts of the algal growth in streams.  Alternatively (or in addition), the absence of a strong relationship between nutrients and algal standing stocks or between light and algal standing stocks along the larger mainstem system could be due to different processes driving primary production in smaller sections in the river thereby masking any larger patterns along the full 8 km mainstem.  When evaluating a more limited area of the stream, it was clear that both light and nutrients affected stream primary production at l...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
