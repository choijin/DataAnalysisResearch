<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Daniel Lacker is "Large deviations and concentration inequalities for mean field games." The host institution for the fellowship is Brown University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Kavita Raman.</AbstractNarration>
