<AbstractNarration>Algebraic geometry provides a powerful theory with which to define moduli spaces (spaces of solutions of geometric problems) for interesting mathematical objects. Once they are defined, there are natural compelling questions about their geometry and topology. What do they look like?  Are they irreducible, connected, of what dimension? Are they smooth? if not, what singularities arise? What structure is exhibited by their cohomology rings, and why should it be geometrically expected?  What are their equations?  The investigator intends to address many of these fundamental problems in a number of cases. The investigator has a track record of sustained and serious effort both in outreach to students at all levels (high school, undergraduate, and graduate), and in building institutions in which algebraic geometry can grow. The investigator will continue to attract graduate students into algebraic geometry and continue to nurture the careers of graduate students, post-docs, and young researchers.  The investigator will also continue to work with large numbers of students at the secondary and undergraduate levels, attracting students into the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator works in algebraic geometry, although his interests connect to other areas of mathematics, including topology, combinatorics, physics (string theory), number theory, and symplectic and differential geometry. This proposal, continuing various strands of the investigator's work, deals with moduli spaces and related notions in a variety of settings. In particular, the proposal deals with a number of fundamental questions regarding the foundations of "tropical" geometry, the stabilization of moduli spaces in the Grothendieck ring, the study of K3 surfaces through elliptic fibrations, and the topology of various moduli spaces of curves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    A number of specific research projects were completed, on the study of moduli spaces. In particular, the structure (combinatorial, geometric, topological, arithmetic) of moduli spaces in families, and how such structures "stabilized" was the central theme. Thus the goals were to understand when such structures stabilized, and what to; and also to understand the behavior of sporadic "smaller" cases, before stabilization sets in. The research supported by this award will impact the development of mathematics in a number of ways. The most significant results come from the opening of a new and flourishing area, of understanding how moduli spaces (in a broad sense) stabilize in precise algebro-geometric senses (paralleling topological and arithmetic work) in a number of cases. This has led to work supported by the grant, as well as a great deal of following work by many other researchers in a number of fields. The results have implications and consequences in topology, number theory, and theoretical physics. The results have been disseminated through refereed papers, invited lectures and research talks, and many discussions at conferences. An important "other achievement" is the training of some brilliant PhD students.  The PI's PhD students have been very successful in a number of areas of mathematics (as well as outside of academia). The students arrived with a great deal of talent and experience, so the PI's contribution was to guide students to becoming mature researchers, able to find and choose promising and important problems to work on.   The PhD students working on this project, and supported by this project, as well as the postdoctoral scholars part of this research group (even if not directly financially supported by this grant) include a substantial number of current and future stars in the field. A number of personnel trained under this grant have gone on to careers where they have taken their new expertise to work for private companies.
