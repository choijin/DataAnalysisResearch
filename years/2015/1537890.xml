<AbstractNarration>The ocean is a major player in the storage and transfer of many greenhouse gases.  Understanding the amount of these gases going through the interface between ocean and atmosphere, known as the air-sea flux, is of upmost importance to accurate biogeochemical and climate predictions.  The mechanisms which move the gases through the interface are too small to be resolved by most coupled ocean atmosphere models, and are therefore parameterized to account for the effect of the small scale processes.  Air-sea fluxes are largely dictated by wind speed, but are sensitive to many other environmental factors such as surfaces waves and surfactants.  In situ observations have shown large variability between observed and parameterized air-sea fluxes, especially under high wind speed conditions, suggesting wind speed alone cannot capture all of the factors that influence air-sea gas exchange.  This project will analyze a dataset collected during a NSF-funded research project near the southern tip Greenland.  This dataset is unique and may offer insight into some previously unmeasured mechanisms with control on air-sea gas flux such as breaking waves and bubble formation under high winds.  The findings could help to refine gas transfer parameterizations which, in turn, would help to constrain regional and global estimates of climate sensitive gases.  The project will support the training of a PhD student and the development of stimulating teaching materials about research into gas exchange, storms, breaking waves and climate change, available to K-12 teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global air-sea gas flux estimates are based on parameterizations of the gas transfer velocity k. To first order, k is dictated by wind speed (U) and is typically parameterized as a non-linear function of U. There is, however, a large spread in k predicted by the traditional parameterizations, especially at high wind speed. This is due to a large variety of environmental forcings and processes that actually influence k, suggesting wind speed alone cannot capture the variability of air-water gas exchange. At high wind speed, breaking waves become a key factor to take into account when estimating gas fluxes. Wave breaking results in additional upper ocean turbulence and generation of bubble clouds. Here, we propose to analyze the diverse data set collected during the High Wind Gas exchange Study experiment in 2013 to understand and quantify the control of breaking waves on gas transfer velocities. This will be a first study linking turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates resulting from wave breaking to gas transfer velocities. Insights gained from observation will be incorporated into physical gas transfer models. Whitecap coverage and breaking wave statistics will be determined from visible imagery acquired from the port and starboard side of the flying bridge of the Research Vessel Knorr. Both very soluble (Methanol and Acetone) and less soluble (Carbon Dioxide, Dimethyl Sulfide) gases will be considered, allowing to contrast the degree of wave breaking mediated transfer. Sea state conditions will be computed from laser altimeter and wave rider buoy measurements. Eddy covariance fluxes and sea water concentration of Carbon Dioxide, Dimethyl Sulfide, Methanol and Acetone allow for direct calculation of transfer velocities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  In our challenge to reduce uncertainties in the transfer velocity (k) of climatically important gases at high winds, ocean waves rather than wind speed have always been at the forefront of the driving processes that would remove the scatter in parameterizations and measurements.  During the HiWinGS field experiment [Blomquist et al., 2017], carbon dioxide (CO2), dimethyl-sulfide, momentum and heat fluxes were calculated via the direct eddy covariance method.  Our analysis of the HiWinGS and SO GasEx data sets shows that a wave-wind Reynolds number unifies the gas transfer velocity conundrum of quadratic and cubic relationships over a wind speed range of 0 to 25 ms-1 [Brumer et al., 2017a].  Analysis of concurrent eddy covariance gas transfer and measured wave field statistics supplemented by WaveWatch III wave model hindcasts shows for the first time that wave-related Reynolds numbers collapse four open ocean datasets that have a wind speed dependence of CO2 transfer velocity ranging from lower than quadratic to cubic. Whitecapping parameterizations were also improved using the combined wind speed and wave state Reynolds number [Brumer et al., 2017b]. We also improved our ability to measure wave statistics such as significant wave height, wave direction and wavelength using X-band radar [Lund et al., 2017]. Finally, we showed that WaveWatch III hindcast  reproduces the wave field well by validating the hindcast with in situ measurements. This highlights the value of and encourages the use of hindcasts for previous experiments where no wave data exists.   Broader Impact:   Results from this project show that wave-related Reynolds numbers collapse the gas transfer rates to a universal relationship.  These same datasets showed both cubic and quadratic wind-speed dependencies.  The elimination of this so-called k-conundrum by using wave-related Reynolds number rather than wind speed will provide better accuracy in weather forecasting and climate predictions using regional and global ocean-atmosphere coupled models that include wave parameters.  We made significant advances in quantifying the air-water fluxes of CO2 and DMS [Blomquist et al., 2017].  We improved the COARE physically-based meteorological and gas transfer bulk algorithms [Blomquist et al., 2017].  Reviewing all existing breaking crest length distribution and coinciding upper ocean dissipation rate measurements, we determined a robust wave-age dependence of a scale-independent, effective breaking strength coefficient [Zappa et al., 2016].  The PI?s group expanded their capabilities to run WaveWatch III forecast/hindcast model after attending the NCEP/NOAA Wave Summer Workshop. Zappa developed focused teaching modules on global ocean carbon science problems incorporated into his Air-Sea Interaction course material at Columbia University, Department of Earth and Environmental Science.

Zappa prepared a Teaching Module for the Earth2Class program (https://earth2class.org/site/?p=14454) in collaboration with Michael Passow.  The research has resulted in 7 peer-reviewed publications to date (additionally including Cifuentes-Lorenzen et al. [2018] and Randolph et al. [2016]).
