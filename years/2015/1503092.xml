<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a workshop on methodological challenges across the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, to be held at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, VA in February 2015.  The results of the workshop will contribute to long-run strategic thinking about quantitative work in the social and behavioral sciences and the methodological advances that are needed to move the social, behavioral, and economic sciences forward.  Possible dissemination mechanisms include journal submissions or an edited volume and a supervised online blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together methodologists from across the social, behavioral, economic, and statistical sciences to help identify challenges to and opportunities for furthering methodological developments across these disciplines.  Potential research topics to be discussed include new data definitions, modeling and estimation, null results, and data privacy.  Workshop participants also will explore methods for facilitating continued communication among methodologists across disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To foster greater and more effective communication across disciplines that are routinely submitting to the Methodology,Measurement, and Statistics (MMS) Program, this project brought  together accomplished scholars fromthese areas for two days to identify barriers, consider under-developed areas of research, and propose new themes for the MMSProgram.   The Intellectual Merit lies in fostering better communication across the varied disciplines that constitute the MMS community. The benefits of being reflective here are obvious: efficiencies from better transmission across traditional academic boundaries, understanding trends in methodology, setting an agenda with foresight about future challenges, and reducing inefficiencies from linguistic differences.  The Broader Impact comes from the development of long-run strategic thinking about quantitative social science work by considering the greater impacts of methodological progress in explicitly broad terms with                greater impacts that have potential societal value through policy implications.  Long-term explicit implications for the MMS Program from this workshop include expanding the scope of incoming proposals to the MMS Program, promoting diversity in social science methodology (qualitative vs. quantitative, etc.), and increasing participation in discipline subfields. This discussion was not confined to a narrowly defined community of those who are directly affected by MMS Program funding, but extended to a larger community defined by the national set of researchers that contribute to these constituent disciplines.
