<AbstractNarration>Year 2015 is designated as the "International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies" by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This bilateral workshop brings together leading researchers in the science of light (optics and photonics), from US and Taiwan. Via talks, discussions and planned lab visits, the event provides a platform for scientists from both sides to share latest research results, to have face-to-face discussions and to instigate collaboration. The event is organized by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan. The workshop takes place in Taipei, Taiwan from May 31 to June 1. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optics and photonics is one of the most active and fast developing fields in engineering and science. Technological advances in optics and photonics have significantly advanced a broad range of areas from communication, medicine, aerospace to advanced manufacturing. Both US and Taiwan governments and industry have invested significantly in optics and photonics research. In particular, with the world largest foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), Taiwan is a powerhouse of semiconductor industry, which has long been the engine of optics and photonics research. As technological breakthroughs continues to be achieved and new topics of optics and photonics, such as silicon photonics, plasmonics, new lasers and 2D materials, continue to emerge, multilateral collaborations between nations are becoming more and more important to the development and dissemination of research. This workshop and event will stimulate bilateral collaboration in photonics research between researchers in Taiwan and United States. Through face to face discussion and laboratory tours, information of the latest development in photonics research, research infrastructures and facility will be exchanged. Potential bilateral outreach possibility will also be discussed.</AbstractNarration>

During this bilateral workshop, leading researchers  in the science and engineering of light from US and Taiwan met. Via talks, discussions and planned lab visit, the event provided a platform for scientists and engineers from both sides to share latest research results, to have face-to-face discussions and to instigate collaboration. The event was organized by the National Science Foundation (NSF) of US and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan. The workshop took place in National University of Taiwan in Taipei from May 31 to June 1 and included tour and visit to Industrial Technology Research Institute and Taiwan Photon Source in Hsinchu.  Technical Description  Optics and photonics is one of the most active and fast developing fields in engineering and science. Technological advances in optics and photonics have significantly advanced a broad range of areas from communication, medicine, aerospace to advanced manufacturing. Both US and Taiwan governments and industry have invested significantly in optics and photonics research. In particular, with the world largest foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), Taiwan is a powerhouse of semiconductor industry, which has long been the engine of optics and photonics research. As technological breakthroughs continues to be achieved and new topics of optics and photonics, such as silicon photonics, plasmonics, new lasers and 2D materials, continue to emerge, multilateral collaborations between nations are becoming more and more important to the development and dissemination of research. This workshop and event will stimulate bilateral collaboration in photonics research between researchers in Taiwan and United States. Through face to face discussion and laboratory tours, information of the latest development in photonics research, research infrastructures and facility will be exchanged. Potential bilateral outreach possibility will also be discussed.  Outcome  Dr. Dominique Dangenias of NSF and four US university professors (Dr. Mo Li, University of Minnesota, Dr. Thmas Little, Boston University, Dr. Zhiwen Liu, Penn State University, Dr. Marco Loncar, Havard University) formed the US delegation. They gave four talks during the symposium on May 29th at National Taiwan University. The talk titles are:  "Optomechanical and Flexible Silicon Photonics" by Mo Li  "Challenges in Achieving Dense Networking with Visible Light Communications" by Thomas Little  "2D materials for nonlinear and active photonic devices" by Zhiwen Liu  "Photonic Crystal Nanolasers and Diamond Ring Frequency Combs" by Marco Loncar    On the Taiwan side, faculty from universites includting Nationa Cheng Kung University, National Taiwan University, National Chiao Tung University and officials from Ministry of Science and Technology participated the event and gave presentations. The two sides also held a meeting to discuss mutual interest in research topics that could lead to US-Taiwan collaboration.

During the visit to ITRI and Taiwan Photon Source, the US delegation was introduced to the capability of the facilities and the organzation and research magnagement of the two institutes. Potential collaboration and access to the facilities by US researchers are disccussed.  The overall outcome of the event are exchange of latest research results, establishment of collaboration and access to facilities in Taiwan. The event was also open to students so it has outreached to them with the latest progress of optics and photoics research.       Last Modified: 01/14/2016       Submitted by: Mo Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
