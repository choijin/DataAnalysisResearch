<AbstractNarration>This research will create and analyze mathematical models for predicting and mitigating the spread of Ebola Virus Disease. The investigators propose to combine the strengths of three common modeling approaches by developing a new, integrative model. The result will be a more robust model that can be used to provide valuable and timely information to help control the current epidemic and inform future decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standard modeling approaches such as ordinary differential equation models, network models and individual based models, have common limitations.  Alone, none of these models are sufficient to capture the complexity of the 2014 Ebola epidemic. The investigators will build on existing mathematical analysis, data, and software to combine these approaches on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This agent-based model will be integrated in a city and county-based network model for the migration, health care, response, and migration efforts. Specific aims for the model include forecasting the incidence of Ebola virus disease, quantifying the uncertainty in the early stages of the epidemic, estimating the spread to new regions, quantifying the impact of interventions and behavior changes, utilizing statistical analysis to estimate the degree of underreporting, quantifying the model?s uncertainty, and determining how uncertainty will impact the different mitigation approaches.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We created and analyzed a new mathematical model for predicting and mitigating the spread of the Ebola virus disease and guiding public health workers to improve the effectiveness of intervention strategies for mitigating the impact of the 2014-2015 Western African epidemic.  We also created a statistical approach for defining differential equations that capture situations where an infected person has multiple options for what they do after being infected.  For example, the model can handle situations where some people seek treatment in a medical facility, while others stay home.   Our model analyzed the impact that behavior changes in the population, the decrease in the frequency traditional funerals, and increased access to medical facilities all had on the epidemic.  The simulations predict that reducing the contacts that infectious people have with the general public is the most important mitigation strategy of those considered in the model.   These contacts include both the contacts with an infected person at home, under medical care, and in a traditional funeral.  The simulations predict that medical care intervention alone would have been insufficient to stop this epidemic.  The results have appeared in "Mathematical and Statistical Modeling for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases," (Chowell G, Hyman JM; Springer Press, 2016) and will help improve the quality of models for a wide range of emerging infections.  The new statistical approaches for capturing the impact of behavior changes on the spread diseases is currently being applied to understand why Zika is spreading differently than chikungunya or dengue fever.
