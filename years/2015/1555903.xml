<AbstractNarration>Existing radio-frequency (RF) wireless technology for wireless communication and navigation has encountered technical challenges, e.g., unsuitable for big data streaming due to limited frequency bandwidth and limitation on indoor positioning. Visible light emitted by light-emitting diodes (LED) may be modulated to realize wireless visible light communication (VLC) and positioning (VLP). Building on energy-efficiency LED lighting bulbs, VLC/VLP technology may potentially be a revolutionary alternative to existing RF wireless and navigation. Dr. Albert Wang of University of California-Riverside will bring 15 American undergraduate students to conduct LED VLC/VLP research in China during 2016 to 2018. The American students will spend two summer months in China, first in Beijing, at the Institute of Microelectronics of Tsinghua University (TU), one of the best university-based facilities for advance semiconductor fabrication, then in Wuhan, China's optical valley, at the School of Optics and Electronics Information of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) to perform VLC/VLP research in pair with local Chinese students. TU and HUST offer world-class and complementary research strengths and facilities for nano device fabrication and opto-electronic integration, respectively. The two Chinese co-investigators Prof. Tianling Ren at TU and Prof. Xuecheng Zou at HUST are well known scholars in the field who have been collaborating with Dr. Wang for years, including hosting American REU students before. This US-China IRES program will expose the American students to the global frontiers of opto-electronic wireless communications and ranging research. At least 50% of participants will be expected from the underrepresented minority groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year US-China IRES program will involve American undergraduate students in developing novel LED-based wireless visible light communication (VLC) and positioning (VLP) systems. Building upon the on-going research at the University of California Center for Ubiquitous Communications by Light (UC-Light), the IRES students will be directed to conduct the following research tasks in team with their Chinese counterparts: (1) develop an LED-based VLC testbed systems, (2) design integrated circuit (ICs) for VLC/VLP systems, (3) develop LED-based real-time tracking systems, (4) investigate broadband graphene-based optical modulators for VLC systems, and (5) design electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection for high-reliable LED VLC/VLP systems. The LED VLC/VLP technologies developed is potentially a revolutionary alternative to existing RF-based wireless communication and navigation technologies, addressing its technical limitations. The participating American students will be trained to be technically competitive and globally enabled for their future careers.</AbstractNarration>

Each year, a team of 5-6 American undergraduate students from University of California, Riverside, were selected to participate in two-month summer academic exchanging activities in China to gain overseas research and academic experiences. The participating students were selected from a large application pool of 80-150 applicants each year. The selection criteria were comprehensive and students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups were strongly encouraged for applications. The IRES teams consist of five, six and six undergraduate students in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The student diversity was ensured with the URM representation being 80%~83% for the three annual IRES programs. The IRES teams went through extensive cultural and travel orientations, as well as two-quarter technical training at UCR before traveling to China. The IRES summer programs were carried out in June to August each year in China. The participating host universities in China are Tsinghua University, Peking University and Huazhong University of Science and Technology. While in China, the PI coordinated with the host professors and students in the local universities to direct the IRES activities. The research conducted during the IRES programs in China involved design, fabrication and characterization of LED and transistors for visible light communication systems, as well as related applications such as artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The IRES students were also engaged in extensive Chinese cultural and social activities. The IRES activities were carried out in teams consisting of American and Chinese students in a peer-to-peer mechanism to ensure good exchanging experiences. The IRES students also participated in various academic events, including international conferences, research seminars and summer courses during their stays in China. After the IRES events in China, the IRES students carried out well-planned post-IRES activities, which include giving post-IRES seminars to share their IRES experiences in China with their fellow students at UCR, writing undergraduate research papers and presenting the papers at undergraduate research conferences. The three-year IRES program resulted in six undergraduate research papers accepted by and presented at the Southern California Conference on Undergraduate Research (SCCUR) and Symposium for Undergraduate Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity (UGRS), in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The IRES teams also prepared three team reports submitted to the NSF IRES Programs. Overall, this three-year NSF US-China IRES Program was a success and its positive impacts on our students will last long. All proposed IRES objectives were achieved.</span><strong></strong><em></em></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/10/2019<br>      Modified by: Albert&nbsp;Wang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
