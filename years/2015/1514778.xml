<AbstractNarration>Coral reefs are diverse and valuable ecosystems; however, coral reefs are experiencing degradation due to many stressors, including ocean warming. As a result of ocean warming, corals become stressed and can bleach. Coral bleaching occurs when the symbiotic algae living in the coral tissues are expelled, causing the coral to appear white and lose its major source of food. Previous studies show that bleaching negatively impacts coral reproduction. However, it remains unknown if different timings of bleaching events equally affect coral reproduction. Additionally, the transgenerational impacts of coral bleaching have never been quantified. This project will assess the impact of bleaching at different times of the reproductive cycle on reproduction, larval survival, larval dispersal, and juvenile survival and growth. This research will be conducted at Sesoko Marine Station in Okinawa, Japan in collaboration with Dr. Saki Harii at University of the Ryukyus. Dr. Harii is an expert is coral ecology and will provide field access and facilities for the research. The research outputs will contribute to transform existing predictions of the persistence of coral populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coral populations recover from disturbances through asexual and sexual reproduction; however, as increased temperature affects coral reproduction, larval survival and dispersal potential the transgenerational effects of bleaching will dictate the future rates of recovery. This project will assess the transgenerational impacts of coral bleaching in the brooding coral Pocillopora damicornis. Larval survival and competency dynamics data will be used to calibrate dispersal models and project self-recruitment and dispersal potential. It is hypothesized that bleaching will decrease the energy allocated to eggs, leading to reduced larval survival and potentially alter rates of acquisition of competency. These changes in survival and competency dynamics would have significant impacts on dispersal potential and recruitment success, thus influencing population dynamics and recovery rates. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Healthy corals maintain a symbiotic relationship with algae that provide corals with color and energy from photosynthetic products. However, under thermal stress, the algae leaves the coral which depletes the coral of energy and its color. This process is known as bleaching. During bleaching, since corals depend on algae for energy, corals preferentially allocate energy towards survival and away from reproduction. The objective of this project was to determine the effect of stress from elevated temperature on the reproductive success of corals. Corals of the same species were exposed to two temperature treatments (ambient and elevated) and monitored for signs of stress and reproductive success. After three days of exposure to elevated temperature, the coral-algal relationship began to deteriorate. However, this level of stress could only be detected with instrumentation, there were no visible signs of paling or bleaching. In addition, exposure to elevated temperature significantly decreased reproductive output. The results of this study indicate that coral health assessments based on visible bleaching alone are likely to underestimate the negative effects of thermal stress. Additional outputs of this research were to contribute to existing predictions of the persistence of coral populations within this century and provide information that assists conservation managers in the effort of maximizing reef resilience. Results of this research have been presented at two scientific conferences attended by coral reef managers and will be submitted to the scientific journal Coral Reefs. It has been communicated to reef managers that additional metrics besides visible bleaching should be used since reproduction is critical for coral population persistence and has a very narrow tolerance to stress.
