<AbstractNarration>The study of the long-term evolution of plant species diversity is important to understanding current losses or maintenance of diversity as habitats shift and become fragmented.  This project will examine how diversity has evolved in the western hemisphere using a database of over 100,000 plant species.  Using new approaches in informatics applied to genetic, geographical and environmental data, the project will investigate the possible causes of shifts in species diversity at extensive geographic scales by considering evolutionary diversification, dispersal, adaptation, and coexistence.  Additionally, the project will determine if hard limits on species diversity exist and the extent to which these are determined by environmental history.  This is a "Big Data" project that will simultaneously develop tools in informatics and train students on the use of these statistical tools.  The tools will be made widely available, and training will build on the collaboration among those at a liberal arts college, a comprehensive master's institution, and a research university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will contribute to a predictive science of biodiversity based on underlying ecological and evolutionary processes. The Botanical Information and Ecology Network will be leveraged to test explanations for assembly of diverse biomes over evolutionary time by taking advantage of recent advances in biodiversity informatics, phylogenetic analysis, and the modeling of multivariate niche hypervolumes.  How the evolutionary contingencies of adaptation, diversification, and dispersal interact with possible ecological limits on the niche space of different environments will be investigated.  The taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of whole biomes and clades will be quantified in order to model niche evolution and biome shifts at extensive geographic and temporal scales.  Whether evolutionary biome shifts are systematically associated with changes in functional traits or niche hypervolumes will be examined.  Whether or not the functional niche space of biomes becomes saturated over evolutionary time, and if saturation reflects ecological limits on diversification through physiology, will be tested. The research will contribute novel answers to some of the most persistent questions in ecology, evolution, and biogeography, as well as innovative new tools in ecoinformatics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Expanding global land use and anthropogenic climate change will have increasing impacts on Earth?s biomes and ecosystems. From genes to species, populations, and communities, the linkages between biodiversity and essential resources and ecosystem services are contingent upon natural and human-mediated adaptations at all levels of biological organization. The capacity for these changes is reflected in the local and regional genetic variation, diversity of lineages and functional traits. Thus, the rate and scope of how these multiple dimensions of biodiversity respond to current and future environmental conditions is key to assessing and predicting the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning.    Figure 1. Conceptual framework of the multiple dimensions of biodiversity, their interactions, and responses to environmental change.   Our collaborative research project - Niche evolution, ecological limits, and the macroecology of land plant biodiversity - provided theoretical and empirical understanding of how different aspects of plant biodiversity drive and maintain ecosystem function within and between the differing biomes of the world. The Broader Impacts of the proposed project include undergraduate training and education in informatics approaches to ecology and evolution, enhancement of research infrastructure for the biodiversity science community, integrated graduate and postdoctoral research and mentorship training, and outreach to enhance public understanding of the multiple dimensions of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and climate change.  Our project had both science and an education goals.   Science:  We first  i) quantified several different metrics of biodiversity -  taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity within and across the biomes of the globe. To better predict how biodiversity will respond to changing climate and human land use, we then modeled niche evolution and the ability of biodiversity to transition between biomes. We focused on ii) testing whether evolutionary biome shifts are associated with changes in functional traits and/or niche hypervolumes, and iii) if the functional niche space of biomes becomes saturated over evolutionary time, i.e., whether there are ecological limits to diversification.   Our findings have been published in several high profile publications.   Educational Goals: Educationally, our goals were to accelerate the integration of data-intensive approaches to ecology and evolution into the undergraduate biology curricula. Specifically, we developed course designs and open source curricular materials that gave undergraduate biologists the tools that they need to work with ecoinformatics workflows. We also trained two postdoctoral researchers to be productive undergraduate teachers and mentors in the field.  Our work improved our understanding of how to enhance our ability to mitigate the effects of global change on complex ecosystems and the essential services they provide. The resulting knowledge and models provide a baseline set of data and results that can link to the immediate needs of stakeholders, conservation managers, and policymakers necessary to facilitate more efficient management of our biological resources. Furthermore, the project yielded considerable data, computing, and methodological resources that can be used for future research efforts in plant diversity, ecophysiology, and functional ecology.
