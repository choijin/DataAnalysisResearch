<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Participation in research conferences is a vital part of the development of students who will form the next generation of computer science researchers.  Computer Science is unusual among the sciences in the role that conferences play.  Conference submissions are rigorously peer reviewed, with only a fraction of submissions accepted for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings.  Conference proceedings are archival publications, as widely read and cited as journal articles (and often more so).  Thus presence and presentation at a leading research conference is a much more significant activity in computer science than in other scientific fields.    This project supported several U.S.-based student researchers to participate in the ACM International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis, the premier research conference devoted to software testing and analysis of software.  Some of the supported students presented research results at the conference, and all of them were full participants in discussion of recent results and outstanding problems.  Students who participate in ISSTA and other research conferences gain valuable experience in participating in the research community, as well as increased understanding of the frontiers of their research field.   Student travel support for ISSTA 2015 partially supported graduate students from Columbia University, Rensalier Politecnic, Univerisity of Chicago, Virginia Tech, Portland State University, University of Illiniois and Urbana-Champaign, University of Wisconsin, Madison, University of Maryland, College Park, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Utah, The College of William and Mary, and University of California, Berkeley.
