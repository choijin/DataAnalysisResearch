<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the development of self-deploying aerial robotic systems that will enable new in-situ atmospheric science applications. Fixed-wing aerial robotic technology has advanced to the point where platforms fly persistent sampling missions far from remote operators. Likewise, complex atmospheric phenomena can be simulated in near real-time with increasing levels of fidelity. Furthermore, cloud computing technology enables distributed computation on large, dynamic data sets. Combining autonomous airborne sensors with environmental models dispersed over multiple communication and computation channels enables the collection of information essential for examining the fundamental behavior of atmospheric phenomena. The aerial robotic system proposed here will close significant capability gaps in conventional platform?s abilities to collect the data necessary to answer a wide range of scientific questions. The motivating application for this work is improvement in the accuracy and lead-time of tornado warnings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project draws on techniques in the areas of robotics, unmanned systems, networked control, wireless communication, active sensing, and atmospheric science to realize the vision of bringing cloud robotics to the clouds. The autonomous self-deploying aerial robotic systems is comprised of multiple robotic sensors and distributed computing nodes including: multiple fixed-wing unmanned aircraft, deployable Lagrangian drifters, mobile Doppler radar, mobile command and control stations, distributed computation nodes in the field and in the lab, a net-centric middleware connecting the dispersed elements, and an autonomous decision-making architecture that closes the loop between sensing in the field and new online numerical weather prediction tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Severe thunderstorms pose significant threats to society through threats to human life and damage to property.  A specific type of severe thunderstorm, known as a supercell, is particularly well known in this regard, as it is often associated with damaging hail, straight-line winds and tornadoes.      Though our ability to forecast supercell thunderstorms has improved over recent decades, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of the processes involved in tornado formation within these storms.  Many of these processes are short-lived, exist in narrow regions of space, and often occur above where most of our measurement capabilities exist, at the earth?s surface.  One goal of this project was to assess the ability of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to make these measurements above the ground in order to better inform our understanding of these critical processes related to tornado development.     The work performed for this grant centered on the development and application of tools that statistically analyze an ensemble of numerical simulations ? different realizations of the future atmospheric state - to identify typical locations where UAS could sample to improve forecasts.  Most past, successful studies using this technique have focused on relatively large scales of motion and variability (for example, the intensity of weather systems that traverse the country).  Therefore, before attempting to extrapolate this technique to the scale of individual supercell thunderstorms, it was used for an intermediate scale of motion, the regional flow (over the scale of ~100 miles) preceding the development of thunderstorms in Texas.  Encouraging results, quantifying, for instance, the importance of low-level dewpoint temperature to the development of these thunderstorms, yielded confidence that the technique would be similarly successful at these individual storm scales.     This technique was then applied to idealized simulations of storms as well as simulations of past events where tornadic storms occurred.  Specific regions of these storms, especially along the edge of rain-cooled air, were found to be particularly sensitive for tornado development, though these signals were not always robust, or present at all.  The takeaway from these results is that there is some limitation on predictability at this scale that may limit the ability to effectively target storms with UAS, though plenty of future work is necessary to firmly establish the expectations for success in this regard.     Over the course of the project, using the results from the offline analysis, scientists from multiple institutions collaborated in the field to deploy UAS on actual supercell thunderstorms where coordinated high-frequency mobile Doppler radar observation and UAS measurements were made for the first time.  Though computing capabilities are currently nowhere near sufficient to accurately replicate these storms (and inform UAS observing) in real time, the offline analysis afforded by this grant allowed us a ?first step? of sorts by anticipating the locations where UAS observations were most likely to be impactful.
