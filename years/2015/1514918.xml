<AbstractNarration>It is now clear that there is an abundance of planets in orbit around stars similar to our own Sun. This program seeks to understand how these planets are born and whether key elements needed to foster life, such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, are likely to be present at their birth. The focus will be on the early steps in the formation of an Earth-like planet by studying how molecules comprising these elements are incorporated into small, rocky bodies. This program will combine observations from  world-class astronomical telescopes with state-of-the-art detailed computational models. This program will foster a greater understanding of how planets like our own are born. A central part of this effort is the training of the next generation of scientists with diverse backgrounds that represent the future of research and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborative effort merges the work of the Blake and Bergin groups.  This enables observational explorations of gas emission from  less than a few AU using Keck and beyond with ALMA, which can be interpreted using detailed theoretical models.   They will generate several thousand physical/time-dependent chemical models spanning parameter space, and they will develop/implement prescriptions for planetesimal formation and ice sequestration.  The abundance and emission predictions from this grid will elucidate the fate of key carriers/tracers of the C, H, O, and N elemental pools.  This will enable the determination of observable, mass independent, signatures of planetesimal formation.  The observational efforts  will target sources sampling a range in age.  This will be done in two tracks:  (1) Using the Keck archive, the ALMA archive, new Keck spectro-astrometric data, the team's accepted ALMA Cycle 1 and 2 programs, plus new proposals for ALMA Cycle 3.  They will compare these data to their theoretical grid to characterize the overall spatial distribution of key volatiles and their links to planet formation.  Data sets already in hand are suitable to study disk chemistry in two sources.  (2) The second is based on evidence that nitriles might be key organic tracers of hot gas that has conditions comparable to those expected 1 AU from a young star.  They will use  ALMA Cycle 2 data to characterize the origin of these organics in hot cores and provide to search for evidence of  this evolutionary tracer in nearby disk systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Planets such as the Earth are assembled in what are known as accretion disks that surround very young stars. These disks are responsible for directing inward the material that forms the star itself, but they also provide just the right environment(s) for planets to grow.  Starting from a well mixed reservoir of tiny dust grains and mostly hydrogen gas with whisps of heavier elements, solid bodies many thousands of kilometers in size must eventually be formed and key life-enabling volatiles containing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen (CNO) etc. must delivered to the nascent planetary surface, at the right time and in a form that enables such elements to be retained over geologic time.  In this program, we have combined observations of key CNO-containing  small molecules, or volatiles, in such young, protoplanetary disks with the most capable telescopes on - and off - the Earth. And, we have analyzed the results using the most advanced models of the chemistry that occurs in disks as the dust and gas evolve, models developed largely by our team.  On the one hand, we have found that observations of carbon-containing species, long known to astronomers, with the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array, or ALMA, can robustly detect young Jupiter- or Saturn-sized planets in disks using the fact that they alter the gas around them as they are born.  These species were also thought to be quite stable and to therefore contain much of the carbon available over the lifetime of the disk. But, our work for this project has found that the most important such 'stable' species, carbon monoxide, must in fact be chemically altered over time. And, this carbon chemistry in turn affects the chemistry of nitrogen, which we have studied using observations of young and old disks in molecules that directly trace the predicted major nitrogen reservoirs (that, like molecular hydrogen, are very difficult for astronomers to study directly). Finally, we have also investigated how small dust grains that contain mostly carbon are likely destroyed in the disk, at least in its innermost regions that are most important for Earth formation.  Our findings demonstrate that disks are chemically very active, and that the reservoirs of key CNO-containing molecules or solids change over time in ways that we are only beginning to understand.
