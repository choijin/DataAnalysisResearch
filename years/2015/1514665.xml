<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate how the tensions between Okinawans and the Japanese national government over the expansion of a U.S. military facility in northern Okinawa may affect the way residents articulate and enact their local identities. This study will examine whether the galvanizing effect of the bases protests may signal an emerging trend toward Okinawan identification as a distinct national or indigenous group, as opposed to a Japanese ethnic minority, and what the broader implications of such a shift might be. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Kosuzu Abe, an expert on social movements at the University of the Ryukyus. Through interviews, participant observation, and discourse analysis of news media, this study will seek to identify emerging trends in Okinawan cultural and political identity formation in the context of the military bases controversy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. military bases in Okinawa have been a source of tension since the end of World War II. Yet aside from periodic waves of intense protest against the bases, Okinawans have generally accommodated the bases. However, since the 1995 rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by U.S. marines, and most recently, after the national government commenced land reclamation activities in Henoko, protests against construction have intensified, and anti-base candidates swept the most recent elections. Political geographers are interested in the phenomenon of national identification, how large collectivities of people coalesce into an imagined community around a shared set of cultural ideas and practices, political and economic interests, and territorial claims. The mobilization of national identities into political movements can have profound implications for states as evidenced by independence referendums in Scotland and Catalonia and separatist conflicts in the Ukraine and Iraq/Syria. This EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study of Okinawan opposition to the construction of a controversial U.S. military facility examines how the contentious politics related to U.S. military bases affects the formation of Okinawan cultural and political identities and, conversely, how identity shapes local military base politics. The research utilizes a combination of policy analysis, discourse analysis, interviews, and participant observation, as well as access to various data sources, including archival documents, news media and interviews with key informants from various sectors.   This study concludes that the image of a unified Okinawan identity portrayed by anti-bases activists can be described more accurately as a diverse, complex, and dynamic assemblage of political actors and identities coalescing in opposition to the base construction plan. Further, it finds that the intensifying conflict over the base construction and the widespread perception among Okinawans that the military basing policy is fundamentally unjust are likely to intensify feelings of alienation and anger towards the Japanese national government and the U.S. military. This trend corresponds with a rise in discourses of Okinawan self-determination, although the precise form and process this self-determination might take is not clearly defined and varies across different political groups. There is a small but significant minority of Okinawans who seek complete independence for Okinawa. The level of support for Okinawan independence seems to increase with growing frustration over the military bases problem. Other political actors seek greater autonomy for Okinawa Prefecture within the Japanese state in order to pursue local economic, political, and cultural goals. Some Okinawan groups, taking inspiration from decolonization and indigenous peoples movements around the world, have asserted OkinawansÆ right to self-determination as a colonized indigenous people at the United Nations. Still other groups pursue cultural strategies such as the revitalization of Okinawan languages and indigenous cultural practices in order to produce new decolonized political subjects. While the assertion of Okinawan identity may hint at nascent nationalist tendencies, this study does not find evidence of reactionary political attitudes that typify the more virulent forms of nationalism.  The study also finds that anti-bases politics are profoundly rooted in the traumatic history of the Battle of Okinawa and the continuing legacies of the war, of which issues related to U.S. military bases are a significant part. Finally, this study finds that competing geographic imaginaries of Okinawa reflect differing outlooks about peace and security in the region and the future of U.S. military bases in Okinawa. Whereas the U.S. military has represented Okinawa as the "keystone of the Pacific", a vulnerable yet strategically located archipelago in need of military protection, opponents of the bases tend to portray Okinawa as the "cornerstone of peace", a bridge of peace and prosperity in an East Asian community which draws on the historical precedent of the maritime trading kingdom of Ry?ky?.  The uniqueness of Okinawan identity derives not from its isolation, but rather from its intensive network of transnational relationships with other societies and cultures. This study advances knowledge and understanding about social movements, identity formation, and geopolitics in several ways. First, it contributes insights on identity formation and protest to the literature on foreign military bases and geopolitics from a particularly complex and prominent case. OkinawaÆs historical colonial relationship with Japan, its relative absence of reactionary nationalism, and the intensity of the present anti-base protest movement offer an especially interesting case study in identity formation.  Second, this contributes to the scholarship on identity and social movement formation by considering the multiscalar and trans-local producti...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
