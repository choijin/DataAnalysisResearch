<AbstractNarration>An ongoing collaboration between the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). Specifically, this project will explore how a modeling-based curricular approach advances 4th and 5th grade students' understanding of science as a way of knowing. By interacting with simulation-based games to create and revise models based upon real-world experiences with local ecosystems, students will begin to reason with evidence and to make connections between local and global environmental patterns. To support modeling as an instructional strategy, teachers will participate in extensive professional development to deepen their understanding of ecological content, use of technological tools, and pedagogical shifts that facilitate model-based inquiry. Additional project outcomes will include eight new curriculum modules, new software modeling tools and simulation games, and evidence of student and teacher changes in knowledge and awareness of STEM careers. Taking a systemic approach and engaging all 4th and 5th grade students and their teachers in a demographically diverse school district, this project has potential for broadening participation and interest in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focus of this study will be to investigate the contextual factors found within a model-enhanced elementary science program which are most closely associated with student gains in understanding: 1) science as a way of knowing, 2) use of systems thinking and evidence-based reasoning, 3) conceptual change, and 4) interest in STEM careers. Approximately 1,400 4th and 5th grade students and 50 teachers will participate in the study over two school years. Data from multiple instruments (e.g., surveys, interviews, classroom observations, student projects, pre- and post-tests) and collected over multiple time points will be triangulated for assessing changes in student and teacher knowledge, as well as teacher practice. In addition, a subset of 125 students will be purposively sampled for a more focused exploration of the development of individual learning trajectories. Researchers will control dosage, systematic classroom, and instructional differences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collaborative Research: Building Enhanced Scientific Thinking through Modeling Ecosystems focused on investigating the opportunities and challenges associated with the use of agent-based modeling as an inquiry tool in 4th and 5th grade. This work built on existing research and development work done in middle and high school contexts. Research and development efforts were done in partnership with the Missouri Botanical Garden (MBG) and the Ritenour School District, a demographically diverse, high poverty community in suburban St. Louis, Missouri.  Core work undertaken during the funding period included:   Development of five curriculum modules aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), as well as other supporting materials. Iterative development and release of the StarLogo Nova agent-based modeling platform. Collaboration with MBG in provision of a 72-hour / 13-month professional development sequence for participating teachers.  Technical assistance for in-class implementations.   Major results emerging from the funding include:  Published curriculum modules available on line at no cost, released under Creative Commons licensing to facilitate subsequent modification by the science education community.  An updated, freely-available version of StarLogo Nova (available at www.slnova.org) enables students and teachers to create agent-based models on a wide variety of hardware platforms. Presentation at a variety of practitioner and research conferences.  Affiliation with the long-standing Teachers With GUTS (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) modeling community for middle school teachers. We have secured permanent non-government funding for the project coordinator position which will enable the development and maintenance of an elementary grade strand within the larger project.    General insights emerging from the project cohere in three areas:  Ensuring developmental appropriateness: We found that students were generally able to make productive use of agent-based modeling as an inquiry tool. Having said that, we also found that inquiry into concepts that were more accessible to 4th and 5th graders (i.e. protective coloration favoring survival) fostered deeper engagement than concepts which were more abstract in the students' realm of experience (i.e. non-visible forms of air or water pollution).  Supporting teacher capacity: Working in the elementary context posed a number of challenges related to teachers' capacity to lead productive model-based inquiry. Since effective use of modeling requires a degree of fluency with science, mathematics, statistics, and technology, teachers need a degree of comfort and competence in these areas if they are to be effective instructional leaders. While middle and high school teachers typically have a degree in a specific academic field supplemented by professional certification, most elementary teachers have a very general preparation program and certification without a specific disciplinary focus. This limit is compounded as elementary teachers progress through their careers, as they need to remain current in best practices across a range of subject areas.  Time allocation: Elementary school science has long been deprecated in the overall time balance in elementary school. Math and language arts tend to draw the bulk of attention, with other subjects fitting in where they can. In our partner district, science was typically reserved for short time slots near the end of the day. A 25-minute session every other day was not out of the norm. Modeling has the potential to support deep inquiry, but this depth requires time.       Last Modified: 12/06/2019       Submitted by: Eric Klopfer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
