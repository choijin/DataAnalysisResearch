<AbstractNarration>In November 2014, President Obama announced the "Deferred Action for Parental Accountability" program (now known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program) (DAPA) and a significant expansion of the "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" (DACA) program, which was first announced in June 2012 (together, "Executive Relief").  With these programs, the administration proposed to expand considerably a class of ambiguous legal subjects: Deferred Action recipients who are deemed lawfully present but who are not granted permanent lawful status by the state.  The deferred action programs could affect up to 4.4 million undocumented immigrants.  This study aims to address three sets of questions that are raised by this large-scale program.  First, how do prospective applicants and recipients of deferred action experience the uncertainty, first of litigation-induced delays in implementation of the program, and second, of possessing a form of temporary and contingent status in the United States? Second, which civil society organizations and third parties are working in immigrant communities to interpret legal developments and facilitate applications for deferred action? What constraints and incentives do they face in educating immigrant communities and mediating implementation of these programs?  Finally, how have these unconventional legal benefits changed the meaning and terms of membership?  To what extent does this new category of ambiguous legal status enable individuals to assert rights and hold state actors accountable? Answering these questions will shed light on how the proliferation of types of legal status potentially alters our collective understanding of membership in the American polity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer these questions, we plan to use a mixed methods approach combining interviews, participant observation, and legal analysis of materials produced by both state and non-state actors.  Our research will be carried out over a two-year period beginning in the Fall of 2015 and will build on a small pilot study that we began in June 2014, before expanded Executive Relief was announced, and which continued through the early stages of the litigation over Executive Relief.  With NSF support, we will continue to follow the legal developments surrounding Executive Relief.  We will interview 100 potential DAPA and DACA applicants at two points over a two-year period.  Likewise, we will interview members of, and observe the ways that, immigrant-serving organizations in Orange County and Los Angeles County, California respond to legal roadblocks to Executive Relief and, ultimately, how they interpret and implement Executive Relief in their communities.  In order to understand a range of advocacy models, we have identified a set of organizations located in the two counties that vary as to the communities they serve (Spanish-speaking, Asian and Asian American, immigrant communities more generally), their structure (pro bono work, legal advocacy, grassroots organizing, fee-for-service), and their histories (newly established, long-standing).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report Draft     More than 11 million people live in the United States without U.S. citizenship or legal immigration status.  As Congressional efforts to enact broad immigration law reform have stalled repeatedly since the mid-1990s, the task has fallen to the Executive Branch to determine how to allocate limited enforcement resources to enforce the immigration laws on the books.  This involves not only figuring out how to optimize scarce enforcement resources both by leveraging cooperation with other federal, state and local agencies but also exercising discretion not to enforce the law against individuals who are classified as low priority for enforcement.  Our research set out to study how this policy and enforcement landscape played out in the lives of residents of Southern California in the period from 2014 through 2017.     The focal point of our research was President Obama?s November 2014 announcement of the "Deferred Action for Parental Accountability" (DAPA) program and an expansion of the 2012 "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" (DACA) program ("Executive Relief").  With these announcements, his administration proposed an expansion of a class of ambiguous legal subjects: the Deferred Action recipient who is deemed lawfully present for administrative purposes, but who is not granted either temporary or permanent lawful immigration status by the federal government. While qualifying individuals can receive work permits and conditional relief from deportation, their legal rights (such as the right to travel across borders) remain undefined and they are subject to registration and monitoring requirements.     DAPA recipients would have joined the many other classes of immigrants who are also existing in these liminal legal statuses, including individuals who already had DACA and others who have been paroled into the country on humanitarian grounds.  Our research sought to identify and analyze the effects of these enforcement efforts and executive relief programs, and their attendant legal controversies, with particular attention to DACA and the failed DAPA program.  To do so, we focused on the Southern California region &ndash;particularly Orange County and Los Angeles County.  We identified immigrant-serving organizations in the region to serve as hubs of our research, seeking variation on a number of dimensions.  Ultimately, we identified and observed the work of five organizations, interviewing staff members and examining how these institutions sought to mediate the relationship between people who lack U.S. citizenship and the governmental bodies with whom they interact.  We also interviewed staff members at organizations that worked with or were spun off from these hub organizations during the course of our research.   Through our chosen organizations, we also identified client-constituents to interview, focusing on a racially and ethnically diverse sample of individuals who were not U.S. citizens, but who appeared, at least superficially, to be low enforcement priorities.  Interviews explored how these potential applicants responded to the announcement of and application of various forms of executive relief, the particular challenges that they faced due to their immigration status, the ways that they anticipated that their lives would change if they received deferred action or other relief, how they were impacted by the DAPA injunction, their relationships with immigrant-serving organizations, their sense of belonging and their plans for the future.  Our research also outlined the ways that exercises of discretion in immigration enforcement repositioned the state in relation to legal subjects.  We conducted interviews with a number of legal experts, including the government officials who were responsible for conceptualizing and implementing the 2012 DACA program, and for developing the 2014 expansion of DACA and the DAPA programs.  We also assembled a documentary record, consisting of relevant legal opinions, administrative guidance documents, and enforcement priority memos.   Our findings confirm previous research findings that noncitizens face significant hardships that prevent noncitizens from forming the types of institutional connections that would facilitate their social inclusion and may create long-term barriers to regularizing their immigration status. While programs like DACA have substantial practical benefits, recipients continue to deal with fear and uncertainty.  Immigrant serving organizations play a key role in helping noncitizens navigate the complex application processes and other hardships faced by the noncitizens whom they represent and with whom they work.  Organizations have created or expanded legal services programs for deferred action applicants, interpreted and disseminated information about existing and prospective federal deferred action programs and advocated for and provided information about state law reform initiatives.  Legal uncertainty has reshaped the environment in which organizations work with and serve immigrant clients.     Portions of our research have been published in the Fordham Law Review, the U.C. Davis Law Review and Citizenship Studies.  We have presented our work at conferences around the country and internationally.  The research also contributed to the scientific training of the four graduate students and four law students who worked on the project in various capacities.
