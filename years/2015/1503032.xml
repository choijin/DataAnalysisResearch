<AbstractNarration>This project's goal is to conduct high-resolution synchronously coupled transient simulations of the last interglacial period (LIG) using a coupled ocean-atmosphere-ice sheet model (Community Earth System Model) in order to provide a consistent physical framework to investigate the mechanisms behind the higher sea level and the potential ~2 degrees Celsius atmospheric warming during the LIG.  With both transient and sensitivity simulations of the LIG, the research team aims to systematically investigate the response of climate and the Greenland ice sheet to variations in Earth's orbital configuration, greenhouse gas concentrations, meridional ocean heat transport associated with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and vegetation feedbacks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By comparing these simulations of the LIG with proxy data from published studies and a new data compilation that captures temporal and spatial temperature variability, the researchers plan to address the following fundamental questions about the LIG: 1) What climate feedbacks are responsible for the up to ~2 degree Celsius reconstructed warming during the LIG with respect to the pre-industrial period; 2) How much did the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) contribute to global sea level rise above present day during the LIG; and 3) How well can the coupled ocean atmosphere-ice sheet model simulate abrupt climate change during major climate transitions, such as the last glacial inception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports an early career scientist, developing high-resolution climate model output that could serve the wider science community, and engagement of the broader civil society in science-based education outreach</AbstractNarration>
