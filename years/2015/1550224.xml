<AbstractNarration>The Big Data Innovation Hub for the Western United States will join stakeholders from academia, industry, non-profit institutions and the community who share common challenges and innovative approaches related to the acquisition, storage, analysis and integration of large or "messy" data, commonly referred to as Big Data. The West's Innovation Hub (Hub) will serve 13 states with Montana, Colorado and New Mexico marking the eastern boundary. This project will develop the organizational and governance structures for the Hub, and initiate efforts toward defining spoke activities for subsequent phases of the data innovation hubs program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial themes include Big Data technology, data-enabled scientific discovery and learning, managing natural resources and hazards, metro data science, and precision medicine. Partnerships fostered through the Hub will enable the use of Big Data to assess risks related to regional and long-term decisions. The Hub's structure will enable impact in later phases of the Hubs program that may include data-driven models for managing natural resources to tools for integrating self-collected patient data for more precise care options. Through coordination activities that inspire the action of its members, the Hub has the potential to facilitate the improved flow of commercial technologies in ways that maximize competitiveness for member organizations, such as universities, and vice versa: the Hub has the potential to expand the impact of its members' technologies through greater adoption or via start-ups. The Hub will be impactful by facilitating cross-discipline approaches to Big Data innovation and problem solving, influencing the next generation of thought leaders and data scientists. The partnerships enabled by the Hub will lead to professional certificate programs and student internships, creating a pipeline of graduates from partner institutions to impact corporations, public and governmental agencies, national labs, resource-planning agencies, and regulatory commissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project URL: BDHub.SDSC.edu</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The West Big Data Innovation Hub, launched in 2015, is a uniquely positioned community that has built and strengthened strategic partnerships across academia, industry, nonprofits, and government &ndash; connecting research, education, and practice.  Our diverse portfolio of data science activities, programs, and initiatives developed thus far inspires cross-sector collaboration and exemplifies multi-disciplinary approaches that translate across boundaries, in the service of societal needs. As a regional nexus for the "art &ndash; and science &ndash; of the possible", our major contributions and outcomes from an intellectual merit and broader impacts perspective include:   Increased awareness of data science opportunities By conceptualizing, leading, and extending programs such as the National Transportation Data Challenge, the annual Women in Data Science Datathon, and the Water Data Challenge, the West Hub secured not only new technical contributions and open resources (e.g. focused on public safety, environment, health, financial inclusion, and education), but also novel commitments from partners to amplify public knowledge and participation. For example, the Science of Data-Driven Storytelling workshop series featured tutorials and reflections from local and Federal government Chief Data Officers, the Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Washington Post, and data journalism educators. Community members continue to note that the welcoming environment and the Hub’s focus on building fluency and shared awareness help spark meaningful connections that they would not otherwise be aware of.    Catalyzing and facilitating team formation From Boise to Las Cruces, Salt Lake City to Seattle and more, the West Hub has designed, facilitated, and supported avenues for constituents from our region to work alongside each other and with the broader data ecosystem, nationally and globally.  Each year, dozens of community roundtables, workshops, conference sessions, and events spanned the thirteen Western states, with flagship activities available for online or remote participation. Support for hundreds of early career data enthusiasts and community stakeholders, many who had not previously engaged with NSF, helped lower barriers to engagement. Activities including a COVID-19 Data Challenge and webinar series, publishing data as Hub assets, as well as dedicated team-formation sessions at convenings such as our open-to-everyone All Hands Meetings, have provided numerous examples of how the Hub acts as a home and a bridge -- a network of networks.     Developing and enabling translational data science pilot projects in our thematic areas With opportunities such as the Translational Data Science workshop series, Interagency Agreements with government collaborators, and Data Science for Social Good fellowships, the West Hub has structured opportunities to deepen research and educational efforts in areas of societal impact. Activities and resources developed and shared with the community included a focus on responsible data science, ethics, privacy, policy, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data. Moreover, the West Hub has been recognized regionally and globally for our support of projects in not only thematic areas like Natural Resources and Metro Data Science, but also in cross-cutting themes such as open science, infrastructure, and community engagement. Projects that began as planning efforts or lightweight coordination (e.g., collaborations with NSF Big Data Spoke grants, COVID Info Commons, cyberinfrastructure working groups) have grown with the connective fabric of our institutions, organizations, and network, providing open-access videos, tools, and guides for deeper collaboration.    Supporting data science education, training, and workforce development As we continue to ask how we as individuals, teams, regions, and a broader community can support the harnessing of data and science for positive change, the Hub’s initiatives in education, training, and workforce development are a central motivator and source of meaningful outcomes. From our Train-the-Trainer and workshop activities in collaboration with The Carpentries, HSI STEM Hub, and tribal communities, to our co-hosted National Data Science Education Workshop that has grown to reach 292 institutions including community colleges, to our U.S. Census Bureau Statistics in Schools partnership focused on high schools, the Hub’s portfolio emphasizes a range of onramps to support broad recruitment and access.    By-the-numbers: Our first years as a regional innovation hub have produced various measures of reach and scale, driving insight and community engagement in topics spanning smart and connected communities, environmental justice, disaster resilience, data sharing, and more. Some activities have quadrupled in participation (e.g., from ~200 groups to 951 global teams, 85+ countries, and an audience of 100,000+ diving into intensive care unit data); other programs have steadily grown to become self-sustaining with a pipeline of resource sharing and community volunteers. At our core, the West Hub outcomes draw from our diverse and vibrant community of partners, brought together to strengthen our collective impact -- and to spark surprising and meaningful connections.
