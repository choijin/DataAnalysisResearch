<AbstractNarration>SES-1528703&lt;br/&gt;Matthew Mahutga&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Riverside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The causes of rising income inequality in advanced capitalist countries are not well understood by social scientists despite more than two decades of dedicated research. This project synthesizes literatures on the two most common researched causes of the increase in inequality: globalization and institutions. It advances both of these literatures by providing an explanation for the paradoxical findings on the distributional effects of economic globalization. This explanation identifies specific mechanisms by which globalization and national institutions interact to produce distinct distributional outcomes across time and space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study subjects the arguments to empirical scrutiny, a multilevel analysis of the Luxembourg Income Study's (LIS) individual wage data will be conducted. The bulk of NSF funds will support the harmonization of country-specific occupational categories in order to measure skill and work-place authority more directly than is currently possible, because both of these factors are the key mechanisms by which production globalization should affect inequality. In addition to advancing basic research on the causes of rising income inequality among advanced industrial democracies, this project will provide evidence-based assessments of the future implications of production globalization for income inequality, and of policy options at both the macro and micro levels. In tandem, these can help to ameliorate the impact of production globalization on income inequality, low-skill labor, and labor more generally, in the coming decades.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project has two primary goals. The first is to build a dataset of four individual level covariates capturing the &ldquo;skill,&rdquo; (occa1 and occb1) &ldquo;routine intensity&rdquo; (RTI) and &ldquo;offshorability&rdquo; (OFFS) of jobs for use with the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). To build the dataset, the PI and two graduate assistants recoded occupational schemes for 23 LIS countries and 74 LIS country-years into a common international standard&mdash;the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO-88). When combining our recoded country-schemes with data from countries that already reported in ISCO-88 at a sufficient level of detail, we produced occa/b1, RTI and OFFS scores for 38 LIS countries and 160 LIS country-years. These data cover the period from the late 1960s to 2013. The new dataset provides an unparalleled degree of cross-national/temporal coverage and comparability for these job/occupational covariates. Measuring the skill, RTI and OFFS of jobs is a critical task in the contemporary period, because these occupational characteristics like at the core of three contending explanations for rising inequality&mdash;globalization, skill-biased technological change and financialization.

We then formulate a new argument to explain the mixed empirical support for these mechanisms in previous research.
