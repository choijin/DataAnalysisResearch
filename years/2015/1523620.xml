<AbstractNarration>****Non-technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The Hampton Partnership for Research &amp; Education in Materials (PREM) is a collaboration between Hampton University and the Brandeis University Materials Research Science &amp; Engineering Center (MRSEC) that includes collaborative research, education, training and outreach activities. Hampton is a primarily undergraduate HBCU with a large representation of women and African-American students. There is a persistent disparity in the rate at which HBCU alumni receive doctorates in STEM compared to their African-American counterparts who obtain their undergraduate degrees at research intensive institutions. The Hampton PREM is committed to further enhancing the quality of undergraduate materials science education and research at Hampton and other HBCUs as a means to reduce the PhD-attainment disparity and ultimately broaden African-American and women participation in the nation's STEM workforce. We will develop and implement evidence-based innovative models and approaches to improve the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduates so they pursue materials science-related graduate programs and/or careers. The Hampton PREM will increase the number of Hampton undergraduates who annually pursue doctorates from the 1997-2006 rate of less than 2 doctorates per 100 bachelors to the level of 4.2 doctorates per 100 bachelors over the next 10 years. The proposed research will directly engage trainees from high school students to post-doctoral fellows in cutting-edge materials research and result in these trainees being co-authors on publications and presenters at research conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The research component of the Hampton-Brandeis PREM includes three primary research projects which serve as the central unifying activities for the education, training and outreach components.  The three research projects are: (1) examination of the dynamics of polyelectrolytes at the surface and within nanoscale polymer thin films fabricated using layer-by-layer technique and the create novel hybrid colloidal rod-polyelectrolyte multilayer drug delivery systems, (2) the fabrication of drug-delivery micelle containing light-sensitive amphiphilic block copolymers , and (3) a research project to be added via a PREM Pilot Project Program which will provided an exciting opportunity to nurture and cultivate new materials science research faculty at Hampton University.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the recruitment of underrepresented minority and/or women early career faculty at Hampton University. Each research project requires substantial collaboration between the Hampton PREM research teams and the Brandeis MRSEC, specifically leveraging its strengths in microfluidics and high-resolution single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) microscopy.  The experiments associated with each project will be undertaken by a PREM Research Unit, which is a team of materials science researchers that spans the education and training continuum (High School, undergraduate student, graduate student and Path-to-Professorship post-doctoral fellow and PREM Faculty).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Project Outcomes Report      The vision of the Hampton University (HU)-Brandeis University (BU) PREM is committed to further enhancing the quality of undergraduate materials science education and research at Hampton University and other HBCUs.   The HU-BU PREM aims to reduce the African American PhD-attainment disparity and broaden African-American and woman participation in the nation?s STEM workforce.  The development and implementation of evidence-based models and approaches are used to improve the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduates to encourage their pursuit in material science-related graduate programs and careers.  The HU-BU PREM is a partnership between Hampton University and the Brandeis University Materials Research Science &amp; Engineering Center (MRSEC).    The PREM Path-to-Professorship (PtP) program supported the research of two postdoctoralfellows at Hampton University to conduct research in chemistry, pharmaceutical sciences, and chemical engineering.  An early career PtP fellow (no prior postdoctoral experience) and an advanced PtP fellow was selected.  Prior to the award, the departments of chemistry and chemical engineering had no active postdoctoral researchers.  HU PREM PtP fellows participated in several career development activities that included Future Faculty Workshop (University of Delaware), National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN), HU granting workshop (sponsored by NSF NanoHU award).  PtP fellows mentored HU PREM scholars within their respective research projects and were able to present their work at several conferences and research symposiums.  Both PtP fellows have transitioned to faculty positions.       The Hampton University PREM Undergraduate Summer Research Internship Program (UG-SRIP) cultivated a new generation of undergraduate scholars, particularly from underrepresented populations and/or disadvantage students, from both 2-year (community colleges) and 4- year colleges and universities to pursue STEM-related research careers. The PREM UG-SRIP participants undertook 8-10 week paid, mentored research internships at Brandeis University, University of California &ndash; Irvine and other Hampton PREM affiliated institutions. The 2016 UG-SRIP students are shown in Figure 4.  The program components include professional development seminars, communication skills development, mentorship and networking activities, GRE preparation and technical skills development.  Over 25 students participated in the PREM UG-SRIP, and several students have transitioned to attend graduate school and have won numerous awards.       The intellectual merit of the HU-BU PREM is a strong integration of research and education. During the award period, 11 faculty members, 2 postdoctoral fellows and 23 undergraduates from HU received support.  The research activities centered around the development of a series of new molecular photoswitches with highly efficient photoswitching properties at room temperature.  PREM faculty, postdocs, and students produced data that contributed to one funded NSF proposal, three publications and engaged in over seventeen presentations at scientific meetings.      An extensive portfolio of PREM sponsored and PREM supported outreach activities provided a wide array of opportunities for PREM faculty and students to be engaged in the dissemination of general STEM and material specific knowledge, which included two on-campus outreach events and one off campus event.Partnerships with Hampton Roads Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) track/field clubs, TriO Talent Search, and the Virginia Governor?s School exposed over 1700 participants and spectators to materials education and research.  The Hampton Roads area is home to seven AAU Track and Field teams that maintain a schedule of both indoor and outdoor track and field events that consistently draws between 1000-2000 participants and spectators to each event.  These AAU teams were the primary target audience for the PREM Exploratory Saturday Outreach held on the Hampton University campus.  PREM also collaborated with the TRiO Talent Search Program on a STEM College and Careers Workshop outreach activity. The target audience for this activity was middle and high school students and their parents, focusing on 6th to 12thgrade students from the Hampton and Newport News Public School Districts. Our purpose was to expose them to the exciting world of STEM education and careers.  In total, over the HU-BU PREM has reached over 2600 participants in the Hampton Roads area.
