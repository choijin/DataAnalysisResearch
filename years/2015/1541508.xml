<AbstractNarration>A strong background in mathematics is expected of college graduates so that they can thrive in the workforce as science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) professionals, and professionals in other technical and non-technical fields, as well as citizens able to navigate the variety of information available through the media and other sources. To this end, there have been efforts in the mathematical sciences to improve the learning and teaching of undergraduate mathematics. A body of research on learning and teaching now exists that provides evidence pointing to effective strategies for teaching of mathematics to college students. This project will host a workshop to bring together experts in mathematics and mathematics education research to identify and prioritize the most pressing evidence toward translating that research into teaching practice and develop a guide to research-based pedagogical practices in undergraduate mathematics teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is the largest professional organization focused on undergraduate mathematics and is the leading source for mathematics faculty professional development as well as resources for teaching and learning undergraduate mathematics. Thus, the MAA is the natural and optimal lead organization to produce a resource intended to infuse research-based pedagogies into the teaching of undergraduate mathematics. The proposed workshop will enable the MAA's Committee on Teaching Undergraduate Mathematics to bring together experts from multiple communities into an immersive environment in which they can focus on the work of identifying priority areas for the envisioned guide. Outcomes of the workshop will include: (1) ascertaining optimal pathway(s) for mathematicians and researchers in undergraduate mathematics education to translate the education research into teaching practice; (2) producing a document that describes, clarifies, and guides the pathway(s) determined in the aforementioned outcome (1); and (3) identifying gaps in the education research knowledge base and prioritizing those gaps into future research agendas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided travel support for a two-day workshop held at the University of Denver - Colorado with a diverse group of 36 mathematicians and mathematics educators representing a wide range of institutions - two-year colleges, four-year colleges, regional universities, and R1 universities - as well as a range of expertise from research mathematicians, to SOTL (Scholarship of Teaching and Learning) practitioners to RUME (Research on Undergraduate Mathematics) experts.  The purpose of the workshop was to explore the need and feasibility of developing an evidence-based instructional practices guide for undergraduate mathematics through the Mathematical Association of America.   We used two discussion techniques, World Caf&eacute; and Nominal Group Technique (NGT).  We intentionally grouped participants in a variety of permutations throughout the workshop as a way to facilitate cross-pollination of ideas during discussion sessions. Both techniques are based on a structured format that encourages contributions from everyone and that does not allow one person or a small number of people to dominate the discussion. At times, we used the World Caf&eacute; technique to prompt deep exploration of ideas across all groups by engaging participants in multiple rounds of discussion on the same topic. At other times, we used NGT to promote free-flow, non-censored, non-critiqued brainstorming to generate an abundance of ideas within each group. NGT then provided a framework to guide each group in consolidating their ideas and coming to consensus on a prioritized list of recommendations that represented the group?s preferences.     The workshop proposal sought the following outcomes:  1. To publish a document or paper clarifying both the need and possible methods to develop more synergy between mathematicians and RUME faculty in translating mathematics education research into classroom practice at the undergraduate level  Due to the overwhelming positive support from the workshop attendees, the published document will be an Instructional Practices Guide published by the Mathematical Association of America.  To further this work, an EAGER Math grant: Guide to Evidenced-Based Instructional Practices in Undergraduate Mathematics (1544324) has been secured.   2. To seek outlets and authors to bring this work to the public domain (e.g., the Doceamus column of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society (AMS), Math Horizons, AMS Blog On the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics)  The initial proceedings and findings from the workshop were published as an article in the December 2015/January 2016 issue of the MAA Focus.  A number of topic ideas and formatting suggestions were formulated at the workshop, which led to a series of focus groups at the 2016 Joint Mathematics Meetings comprised of a broad cross-section of mathematicians and mathematics educators in various stages of their profession.  In addition, a panel discussion about the workshop was presented at those same joint meetings with 100+ attendees.  3. To gather information on gaps in research in undergraduate mathematics education. We expect areas of research foci to naturally emerge from this collaborative work.  By the end of the workshop, group opinion largely agreed on broad topics for inclusion, such as course design, classroom instructional practices, institute infrastructure and support, assessment, and knowledge specific to a given course.   4. To identify other STEM disciplines that can benefit from this work and explore how the outcomes of this conference could extend to those disciplines  A wide list of other STEM disciplines were believed to benefit from this work including: statistics, physics, biology, and chemistry, as well as other organizations in the mathematical sciences including the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  This list greatly informed the structure and composition of the Advisory Board, the Steering Committee, and the Writing Teams for the EAGER project.  5. To strengthen connections between mathematicians and the RUME community  We were pleased to have a broad representation of participants from both areas.  This led to a diverse representation of expertise for all the writing teams for the EAGER project.  The workshop was crucial in launching the EAGER project.  The workshop has resulted in several positive outcomes as listed above. Workshop attendees have joined the EAGER project by taking on important roles.  These include serving as writers and leaders of writing teams, serving in advisory roles to provide feedback on the project, and making recommendations to broaden participation on the project to include faculty from a wide range of institutions from across the country.  Without the workshop these important conversations between the numerous mathematics communities would not have begun. The EAGER project has been a smooth and natural extension from the workshop.           Last Modified: 10/20/2016       Submitted by: Lewis D Ludwig]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
