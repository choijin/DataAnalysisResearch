<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to constrain the evolution of the fractional ionization of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) at the end of the epoch of reionization, when the universe transitioned from largely neutral gas to largely ionized gas due to the radiation from newly formed stars and quasars.   Broader impacts of the work include research training of graduate students and a postdoc, and outreach via creation of a new teacher workshop at the McDonald Observatory which will bring about 15 secondary school teachers into a research environment, and will provide them with the skills to bring this research into their classroom. The principle investigator and his group will also share their research with the general public by creating three StarDate radio programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical spectral line observations of bright high redshift galaxies in the redshift range 6 &lt; z &lt; 8 will be conducted using the MOSFIRE and DEIMOS spectrographs on the Keck 10m optical telescopes.  In the millimeter range, ALMA will be used to observe emission lines from ionized carbon.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal was designed to better understand a time in the early universe known as "Reionization", the time when light from the earliest stars and galaxies heated and ionized the gas between galaxies (known as the intergalactic medium, or IGM).  A number of previous observations have probed the end of reionization, showing that it was completed by around 1 billion years after the Big Bang.  Much less is known about how quickly reionization proceeds.  Did it start slowly and finish fast, or was it a smoother process?  Understanding when this process begins and ends, and how quickly it occurs, helps us understand the nature of these earliest light sources in the universe.    To understand the evolution of reionization, we need an observational probe to study even earlier times.  Lyman alpha photons, which light particles created from hydrogen atoms in star-forming galaxies, are one such diagnostic.  These photons have just the right energy that when they encounter neutral hydrogen (e.g., a proton with a bound electron), the electron will absorb the photon, and move up one energy level.  Therefore, if there is any neutral gas between you (the observer) and a galaxy, it will absorb these Lyman alpha photons, and thus they will not be visible.  As expected, these Lyman alpha photons are easily visible from galaxies since reionization ended, both in the relatively nearby universe, and even up to a time ~1-1.5 billion years after the Big Bang.  However, as we push into the epoch of reionization, we should expect these photons to get harder to see.  Just how hard they are to see tells us about how much neutral gas is in between galaxies, which tells us how fast reionization is proceeding.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, as the first studies closer to the Big Bang took place, they found Lyman alpha was harder to see, implying that the fraction of IGM gas which was neutral was very high.   This fraction was so high, that it implied that reionization started very late, and happened very quickly.  While this is plausible, it was not conclusive.  The observations of Lyman alpha used were often of only moderate quality - we desired to use the *best* observations, to see if we recovered the same result.  We used large spectroscopic datasets from both the Keck 10 meter telescope on the ground, and the Hubble Space Telescope, to obtain the deepest observations of Lyman alpha in this epoch.  What we found, in a series of several papers spanning different parts of our dataset, was that if you use the best telescopes and look long enough, you can still detect these Lyman alpha photons!  We still don?t see quite as many as we would if the IGM was fully ionized, so we have concluded that the IGM at a time 700 million years after the Big Bang is partially neutral, but only ~30-50%, not up to 90% as has previously been claimed.  As part of this project, we have organized and executed a teacher workshop at McDonald Observatory, where 15 secondary school teachers learned content related to galaxies, galaxy evolution, and an overview of research related to this project.  They learned a number of activities to bring back to their classrooms.  We also helped produce several StarDate radio programs about reionization and Lyman alpha emission, which have aired on the radio, and are available online.
