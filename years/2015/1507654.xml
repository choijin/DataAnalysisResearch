<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description: Semiconductor heterostructures play an important role in many scientific discoveries and technological advances. While the majority of research has focused on planar heterostructures, non-planar heterostructures, particularly nanowires, have recently gained significant interest. This research project addresses fundamental questions regarding the processing and characterization of non-planar semiconductor heterostructures, particularly silicon-germanium core-shell nanowires. The research activities are designed to advance knowledge in materials synthesis and characterization, and thus assist in the design of future high-speed, low-power electronic devices. The research activities are well integrated with students education and training in cutting-edge research. More specifically, this effort educates graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor growth, fabrication and characterization techniques, and the research results are integrated into course material and outreach lectures to high-school students to encourage careers in science, technology, and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: Semiconductor nanowires provide a versatile platform to realize epitaxial, non-planar heterostructures, with relevance for fundamental science and technological applications. The main objectives of this research project are (1) to advance the growth of group IV nanowire heterostructures by combining band engineering and modulation doping, (2) to characterize their structural and electronic properties and (3) to realize and explore quantum confined electron systems in coherently strained Si-SiGe core-shell nanowires. More specifically, these nanowire heterostructures are grown pseudomorphic using a combination of the vapor-liquid-solid growth for the Si nanowire core, and the ultra-high-vacuum chemical vapor deposition for epitaxial SiGe shell. The strain distribution in Si-Ge core-shell nanowires is experimentally probed using micro Raman spectroscopy coupled with lattice dynamic theory, and compared with calculations. Nanowire heterostructures-based field-effect transistors with low resistance contacts are fabricated and characterized under low temperatures, in order to determine the electron mobility and correlate it with the nanowire heterostructure design. Band engineering and radial modulation doping are combined to enhance the mobility of one-dimensional electrons in Si-SiGe core-shell nanowires. Using self-consistent density simulations and the experimental nanowire conductance dependence on density, the band offset between the core and the shell in Si-SiGe core-shell nanowires is extracted. The magnetotransport properties of high mobility one-dimensional hole system in Ge-SiGe core-shell nanowires are investigated experimentally, with an emphasis on spin splitting and spin-orbit interaction in order to assess if helical states with the aligned spin and momentum can be experimentally observed.</AbstractNarration>

Semiconductor heterostructures have been responsible for many scientific discoveries and technological advances. While the majority of research studies have focused on planar heterostructures, non-planar heterostructures have gained increased scrutiny recently, motivated in part by their technological relevance to high performance electronics, and in particular novel transistor designs.  The research conducted under this award aimed to realize and explore the structural and electronic properties of Si-Ge based nanowire heterostructures, a set of materials widely employed in the semiconductor industry. We have devised state-of-art semiconductor growth techniques which combine epitaxial thin film growth by utra-high-vacuum chemical vapor deposition, with one-dimensional crystal growth through the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism.  A wide array of semiconductor heterostructures have been realized, including SixGe1-x-Si core-shell nanowires, SixGe1-x-Ge core shell nanowires as well as SixGe1-x-Ge-Si.  Thanks to the high quality of the semiconductor growth process, the nanowire heterostructures have a low defect density at the interface between different materials, which in turn leads to an elastic strain in the heterostructure, controlled by the atomic spacing in the different materials of the heterostructure.  The research conducted under this award led to the development of characterization techniques to probe experimentally and understand theoretically the elastic strain in a variety of nanowire heterostructures.  Furthermore, this research led to the development of nanowire transistor technology, and in particular understand the role of elastic strain on transistor performance.  The techniques developed in this effort have significantly impacted the understanding of the elastic strain, electrical and thermal transport properties in one dimensional group IV nanostructures, a class of materials directly relevant to chip manufacturing. The award has supported in part the research of three graduate students, and two undergraduate students.  The students were trained in stat-of-art semiconductor growth techniques, materials characterization, as well as transistors fabrication and electrical characterization.
