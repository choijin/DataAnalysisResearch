<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Nebraska, located in Lincoln, Nebraska, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2016- 2019. The program focuses on bioenergy -- the application of molecular and physiologic principles using microbes, algae and plants to create renewable sources of energy to promote a sustainable society. The School of Biological Sciences and the Center for Plant Science Innovation have 15 participating faculty who will serve as mentors. There are many exciting and interdisciplinary projects available for students that employ biotechnology, molecular biology, and biochemistry and/or genetics to understand energy dynamics in model species. In addition to full time research, students will participate in seminars and various workshops about research ethics, professionalism, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Additional features include tours of energy industries and training in technical writing using a collaborative and student-centered approach. REU students have access to a Carnegie I-ranked research institution with all its infrastructure and diversity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 40 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. The program?s multi-phase recruitment effort consists of traditional "hard copy" formats, digital-based advertising, and networking with faculty at diverse institutions, including community colleges. Students are selected based on their academic record as well as their interest and potential in research Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of their research experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences), along with institutional tools, will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.unl.edu/summerprogram/research#bioenergy, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Paul Blum at pblum1@unl.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Heriberto Cerutti at hcerutti1@unl.edu).</AbstractNarration>
