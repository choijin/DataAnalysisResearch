<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a transformative, sustainable photovoltaic solution that will accelerate cost declines of renewable photovoltaic energy technologies.  Today's commercial solar cell technologies have limited opportunity for significant efficiency improvements. The product of this research project integrated with commercial solar cells will enable breakthrough improvement in conversion efficiency and power output.  Solar cells and modules incorporating this technology will provide high power density and long term performance stability to drive cost-reduction of renewable solar energy and accelerated growth of solar installation projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will expand the knowledge base on a new class of solar absorbers materials for solar cell device integration. From a basic-science perspective, the proposed research enables new opportunities in science and engineering to investigate performance of superabsorbing chalcogenide materials integrated into solar cells. The new class of proposed absorber materials eliminates the need for the traditional n-type sulfide materials to create the p-n junction, enabling the development of unique solar cell configurations.  This research project will focus on establishing absorber deposition processes to control the composition and morphology of the absorber layer and relate it to device performance characteristics of resulting solar cells.  The proposed research objectives are to reproducibly demonstrate high device performance and establish a pathway to achieve continued improvement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Beet Inc. addresses the photovoltaic (PV) market need for low-cost and high conversion efficiency solar cells. Our approach is based on an absorber-materials platform that eliminates efficiency limitations of traditional photovoltaic cells, e.g. Si, CdTe and CIGS, by enabling a long desired but to date unmet goal - inexpensive tandem devices which can provide disruptive up to 40% increase in conversion efficiency.  In this project, Beet Inc. expanded the knowledge base on a new class of solar absorbers materials for solar cell device integration. This research project demonstrated proposed absorber material processing and device integration method to correlate device structure to performance of the resulting solar cells. Devices exhibiting PV conversion were fabricated using standard thin film solar cell architecture in substrate configuration. This demonstatration sets Beet Inc. on the trajectory towards tandem cell integration of the developed device, as the bottom junction in a tandem solar cell. Furthermore, the project led to the discovery of unique solar cell configurations to enhance device performance.  The Beet technology targets to deliver high, over 21% conversion efficiency tandem solar cells to the distributed solar energy generation market. Beet Inc. continues the development of this new class of solar cells of absorber materials that integrate with commercially proven thin film solar cell products.
