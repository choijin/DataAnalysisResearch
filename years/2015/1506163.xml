<AbstractNarration>The International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation promotes the study of general relativity and gravitation and enables the exchange information within this field for example via organizing the triennial GR conference series. This award supports the organization of the next GR Meeting (GR21) to be held in New York City during the summer of 2016. The GR conference series is the principal international meeting for scientists working in all the areas of relativity and gravitation. Reinforcing existing connections and giving opportunity to the exchange of new ideas and form new connections between GR theorists, experimentalists, data analysts, mathematical and numerical relativists and astrophysicists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GR21 will have sessions covering topics such as Mathematical and Numerical Relativity, Relativistic Astrophysics, Quantum Gravity and String Theory, Gravitational Wave Science and Cosmology. The award will support the participation of graduate students.  Temporary child care costs that directly result from travel to the conference will also be considered for support.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The 21st International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation was held at Columbia University on July 10-15, 2016. Over 650 scientists representing a wide range of general relativity and gravitation science topics, including general relativity, mathematical relativity, numerical relativity, relativistic astrophysics, quantum gravity, gravitational waves and cosmology participated in the week-long conference.  The conference program was put together by the Scientific Organizing Committee with help from Local Organizing Committee members. The program included 15 plenary presentations from invited speakers covering frontiers of the General Relativity and Gravitation (GRG) field, 16 parallel sessions and the poster session.  2015 marked the 100th anniversary of Einstein?s General Relativity theory, and the year of the conference, 2016 marked 100 years since Einstein?s first paper on gravitational-waves (GWs) appeared. Nature provided us with the beautiful gift of first direct detection of GWs on September 14, 2015, which was announced by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and NSF on February 11th 2016.  The Local Organizing Committee reacted quickly to this groundbreaking discovery that has tremendous impact to the field of GRG, and proposed adding additional plenary presentations to the conference program as well as a special joint afternoon session covering the highlights of the GW discovery and its implications to our field.  A historical component commemorating 100 years of the GRG field as well the field?s future was also part of the conference program, as a panel discussion.     Broader Impact:  This award supported the participation of US-based young scientists at the 21st International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation and thus enabled the opportunity for  personal interaction of graduate students with top experts from different continents in the field of GRG.  The conference served as an excellent additional learning opportunity in the field for students who were involved with conference logistics. The students, while helping with laptop/projector and sound system setup, were listening and learning during the conference sessions.  Several high school students working with the Columbia Experimental Gravity group also helped with conference logistics and came to listen to talks at the meeting.  The meeting was open to scientists regardless of gender, race, nationality and citizenship. The meeting was indeed diverse, participants were arrived from 6 continents, and with strong women representation (for example 5 of the 15 invited plenary speakers were women). A special lunch session on Thursday was added to the program for a friendly discussion on the status of women in our field. Child/family care grant was available for scientists arriving with young children to the conference, first time for the GR conference series.  The conference invited Kip Thorne and Rai Weiss for giving the conference?s public lecture. There was a tremendous public interest in their presentation on the road to the gravitational wave discovery.           Last Modified: 03/05/2017       Submitted by: Zsuzsanna Marka]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
