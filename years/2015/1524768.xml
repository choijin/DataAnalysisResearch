<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for the career development of a junior investigator in the area of Earth Sciences. The study will foster new collaborations and enhance old partnerships with scientists at the University of Arizona and Rice University. This project will constitute the intellectual basis and support the training for three undergraduate students. A classroom- and field-based outreach program, through University of Arizona Extension and intended for students in grades 6-8, will be integrated with this research. Course materials produced through this program will be shared with the geosciences community through the Science Education Resource Center (SERC). The results from this study will contribute to the fundamental goals of Earthscope and will be published in major peer-reviewed scientific journals and in an article for non-specialists. Data resulting from this study will be made accessible to the public in Integrated Earth Data Applications, EarthChem, and PetDB databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A growing body of geophysical data suggests geologically recent mobility of the continental mantle beneath western North America. Several lines of evidence suggest that mantle lithosphere beneath southern California was tectonically displaced eastward by a Late Cretaceous episode of shallow subduction and "relaminated" to the base of the continental lithosphere beneath the Colorado Plateau transition zone (central Arizona). The principal investigator will test this hypothesis by comparing the petrogenetic and thermal histories of mantle xenoliths derived from both areas. If Arizona and California xenolith suites evolved in a similar manner, then a strong case can be made for major Phanerozoic displacement and subsequent reconstruction of southwest U.S. mantle lithosphere. This study will provide a geodynamic and geologic context to understand mantle displacements beneath western North America. This research will provide key constraints on the origin and evolution of mantle lithosphere beneath the southwest U.S., an enhanced ability to recognize modern and ancient analogous settings worldwide, an improved understanding of the effects of subduction angle on the stability of mantle lithosphere at craton active margin transition zones, and a high probability of recognizing a remnant of the southern California mantle lithosphere that has been "relaminated" beneath central Arizona. This result would imply a &gt;500 km tectonic displacement of the southern California mantle fragment and provide intriguing explanations for the long-term strength of the Colorado Plateau relative to adjacent geologic provinces and for active lithospheric delamination beneath the plateau.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to test the hypothesis that the lower crust and upper mantle (i.e., rocks formed ~50 km beneath the surface) detached from beneath the Mojave Desert and were tectonically bulldozed &gt;500 km inland and reaffixed beneath central Arizona.  With this goal in mind, we recovered hundreds of lower crust and mantle xenoliths (i.e., rocks plucked from depth and transported to the surface by volcanic magma) and constrained the thermal histories of ~20 samples containing the minerals zircon and garnet.  Simply put, a Mojave origin for the studied xenoliths predicts a distinct thermal history involving sharp heating pulses ca. 150 and 75 million years ago (Ma), whereas a thermal history involving heating at ca. 170, 60, and 25 Ma would be more consistent with a central Arizona origin.  Our results indicate that our samples experienced heating at ca. 150, 75, 60, and 25 Ma. We interpret these data to record initial formation of the studied rocks beneath the Mojave Desert (forming ca. 150 and 75 Ma zircon) and relocation of these materials to central Arizona (forming ca. 60 Ma zircon and ca. 30 Ma garnet), most likely during collision of an ancient oceanic plateau (like modern-day Iceland) with the southwestern edge of North America.  Emplacement of strong lower crust and upper mantle materials beneath Arizona may provide an explanation for the long-standing problem of the strength (i.e., the relative lack of faults and earthquake activity) of the Colorado Plateau when compared to adjacent areas (e.g., the Rocky Mountains).  Furthermore, the displacement of lower crust and upper mantle occurred at the same time and place as the formation of economic copper deposits currently exposed in central Arizona, suggesting a possible relationship.  This grant provided an immersive research experience for six undergraduate researchers and permitted, among other outreach activities, a three-day earth science-focused educational camp for a group of 50 students ranging from grade level 5-8 in the Black Hills of Yavapai County, Arizona.
