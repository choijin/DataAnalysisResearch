<AbstractNarration>This award is for a workshop to take place just prior to the Science of Team Science annual meeting in 2015. The workshop, led by a team from the University of Central Florida, is to serve as a high-level review of the state of this interdisciplinary area of study. A synthesis of the field especially important given the advances currently being made. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is both an advantage and a challenge, for work is currently being conducted in a range of different literatures. The workshop will provide a means by which researchers can get a better, more nuanced sense of other literatures, methods, and findings. This is especially important when the attendees are drawn from so many different research traditions and cannot be expect to be familiar with all of the work that is relevant to their questions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is organized around a series of panel discussions, presentations by major figures in the field, and discussions of current and future topics for research of importance to the nation. The workshop should have a broader impact even beyond attendees, for the workshop itself could serve as a template for future interdisciplinary meetings. Finally, as part of the workshop, the organizers will pull together a reading list of seminal findings on the topic as well as sample syllabi for undergraduate and graduate courses on the topic from a range of orientations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[National Science Foundation Award 1535572 Project Outcomes Report  NSF Science of Team Science Workshop - June 2015  Fundamentals of Team Science Stephen M. Fiore, Ph.D. Department of Philosophy and Institute for Simulation &amp; Training University of Central Florida     ABSTRACT  This award is for a workshop to take place just prior to the Science of Team Science annual meeting in 2015. The workshop, led by a team from the University of Central Florida, is to serve as a high-level review of the state of this interdisciplinary area of study. A synthesis of the field especially important given the advances currently being made. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is both an advantage and a challenge, for work is currently being conducted in a range of different literatures. The workshop will provide a means by which researchers can get a better, more nuanced sense of other literatures, methods, and findings. This is especially important when the attendees are drawn from so many different research traditions and cannot be expect to be familiar with all of the work that is relevant to their questions. The workshop is organized around a series of panel discussions, presentations by major figures in the field, and discussions of current and future topics for research of importance to the nation. The workshop should have a broader impact even beyond attendees, for the workshop itself could serve as a template for future interdisciplinary meetings. Finally, as part of the workshop, the organizers will pull together a reading list of seminal findings on the topic as well as sample syllabi for undergraduate and graduate courses on the topic from a range of orientations.  OUTCOMES  As this was a workshop, and not empirical research, the outcomes for this were identification of research themes and notional research areas. In particular, the goal was not only the dissemination of knowledge associated with the Science of Team Science, but a cultivation of research themes and research questions that would further the science of team science. These are provided below and further information can be found in the project report.   * Theme 1. Need for Cross-Level Study of Science Teams. To understand and improve scientific collaboration, SciTS must take a holistic view and consider how a multi-level and cross-level perspective, encompassing individuals, teams, and organizations, can enable a more precise investigation of the factors that influence science team effectiveness within and across levels.  * Theme 2. Need to Cast Wide Net of Factors Studied in SciTS.  To understand and improve scientific collaboration, SciTS must address the structural factors in the academy that affect science teams, clearly delineate the attitudinal, behavioral, and cognitive factors affecting science teams, and develop a program of study on educating and training science teams.   * Theme 3. Need to Broaden Stakeholder Involvement.  To understand and improve scientific collaboration, SciTS must more strategically integrate the ideas and needs of varied stakeholders, as well as encourage their active participation in the SciTS community.   Additionally, based upon a distillation of the discussions from the workshop and the breakouts, a set of recommendations for further research was produced.   * Research Recommendation 1.  The study of science teams should include identification of the varied competencies required for science collaboration and how these can be selected for, and/or trained.  * Research Recommendation 2.1.  The study of science teams should include methods and approaches from fields such as cognitive engineering to better understand the context of work.  * Research Recommendation 2.2.  The study of science teams should include a broader swath of research contexts to include the variety of scientific disciplines and fields in which scientists work.  * Research Recommendation 3.1.  The study of science teams should examine how to optimize task competence, and the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for a given scientific problem.   * Research Recommendation 3.2.  The study of science teams should examine how to optimize technical competence in the varied kinds of technology needed for a given science problem.  *Research Recommendation 3.3.  The study of science teams should examine how to optimize social competence to support those having varied task and technical competencies.   * Research Recommendation 4.1.  The study of science teams needs to be supported by both public and private sector sources in order to fund this research and enable access to scientists for study.  * Research Recommendation 4.2.  The study of science teams should also be conducted in classroom contexts using students who are working on collaborative projects over the course of a semester.
