<AbstractNarration>Plants can perceive tissue damage inflicted by insect feeding, and they rapidly activate several key defense responses. Jasmonate (JA) is the plant hormone that orchestrates these defense responses and dictates an inhibition of growth for plants under stress conditions. JA is also a powerful inducer of many specialized metabolites that have important ecological functions. These metabolites are also a renewable source of many high-value natural products for human use such as nutraceuticals. This project will elucidate how JA levels are precisely regulated to accommodate the various stress adaptive mechanisms of plants. The long term goal of this research is to help reduce or eliminate the need for chemical pesticides and to increase global food production through new approaches to pest control. This research promotes a better understanding of plant defense mechanisms, which can benefit both farmers and horticulturists. This project seeks to improve STEM education by providing multidisciplinary training to college students, graduates and postgraduates. Students from traditionally underrepresented groups in science will be sought through participation in the scientist's institutional outreach programs set up for that purpose. A science literacy program called Sci-LiFT (Science Literacy for Future Teachers) will be developed for students who are in training to become secondary school science teachers. Participating students will engage in real laboratory research on topics relevant to this project and develop a high school teaching module. The Sci-LiFT program is expected to leave an indelible mark on program participants and will positively impact their future teaching in secondary schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the core JA biosynthetic pathway has been delineated, how JA biosynthesis is initiated, maintained, or terminated is unclear. The major scientific goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the termination of JA signal and to investigate its role in plant responses to wounding. Mutants were isolated that are defective in JA catabolism, and as a result, overaccumulate JA. Highly elevated JA concentration in these mutants was expected to constitutively activate JA-mediated defense responses. Contrary to this expectation, the mutants displayed opposite symptoms, becoming desensitized to JA, thus revealing an important link between JA catabolism and the plant?s long-term responses to stress conditions. This project will use a variety of mutants that are altered in endogenous JA profiles to investigate the dynamic relationship between the relative levels of JA derivatives and plant response to wounding in a well-established Arabidopsis genetic system. The specific aims of this project are: i) to determine the roles of JA turnover and oxidized-JA derivatives in plant response to wounding, ii) to delineate the signaling pathways important for wound response in JA catabolic mutants, and iii) to characterize the function of a new gene identified through a mutant screen for JA catabolism. The proposed project has the potential to identify previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms of JA signaling and JA-dependent wound responses. This project is also expected to provide new information about how plants prioritize growth versus defense by studying the mutants that appear to defy the growth-defense-tradeoff rule.</AbstractNarration>

This involves exploitation of plants&rsquo; natural defense mechanism controlled by plant hormone jasmonate (JA) (Fig. 1) (<em>1</em>). By understanding how JA signal is produced upon tissue damage, how it coordinates various defense and growth responses, and how the signal is terminated, we have moved one step closer to engineering resistant plants. In particular, our study focused on catabolic enzymes that control the destruction of active JA signal (Fig. 2) (<em>2</em>). This signal inactivation pathway turned out to be as important as the signal generation pathway in many ways in controlling physiological responses to wounding and insect herbivory (<em>3</em>). An oxidized JA derivative which had been considered as a mere metabolic derivative of bioactive JA with no or weak signaling activity was found to have novel signaling function in this regard (<em>4</em>). Through meticulous and rigorous investigation that involved truly diverse modern biological methodologies we demonstrated that the so-called w-oxidation step (<em>5</em>) has definitive roles on plant adaptive responses ranging from specialized metabolite synthesis to organ formation and growth (Fig. 3) (<em>6</em>). This phenomena was found to be conserved in higher plants including maize where mis-regulation of the described JA oxidation pathway led to defects in sex determination in flowers creating feminized tassels (Fig. 4) (<em>7</em>). This intimate yet antagonistic link between defense response and growth controlled by JA is also operative during plant-plant competition for light. The closing in of neighboring plants can be perceived by measuring light quality changes using one of the several photoreceptors called phytochrome B (phyB) that initiates signaling cascade leading to growth promotion and defense attenuation. This light-regulated growth-defense trade-off response in plants termed shade avoidance syndrome was found to be in part regulated by sulfotransferase 2a enzyme in the JA pathway that gets overproduced under such condition and depletes active JA precursor pool thus providing molecular link between light signaling and growth and defense (Fig. 4) (<em>8</em>). Our investigation of JA metabolism is now pushing our research into a new direction. This is based on our discovery of massive changes in translation efficiency in mutants affected in JA metabolism and is expected to pioneer a new area in JA biology (Fig. 3F). As part of efforts to understand the role of JA in coordinating plant-wide response to tissue damage which involves long distance signaling, we in collaboration with others have unraveled chemical and electrical signals resembling those mediating neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (Fig. 4) (<em>9</em>). These rapid electrophysiological signals trigger JA biosynthesis in remote tissues to trigger systemic defense response.</p> <p>This project provided multidisciplinary research training to undergraduate and graduate students and to postgraduate scientists thereby contributed to raising next generation STEM task force. Furthermore, a science literacy program called Sci-LiFT (Science Literacy for Future Teachers) was developed as an outcome of this project (Fig. 6).
