<AbstractNarration>Radio spectrum is a scarce resource that needs to be managed. Towards this end, this project designs, implements and studies novel protocols for enhancing access to radio spectrum by taking advantage of the fundamentals of human behavior. It produces technologies, theories, and guidelines for protocols that are expected to significantly improve the efficiency of spectrum access. This may lead to substantial societal impact by allowing more work to be done with the same resources. Success will also benefit the environment by limiting the infrastructure needed for the required data traffic; both energy and infrastructure investment can be minimized. Further, the project creates a model of human behavior in a specific technical context that can serve as a basis for similar projects in other technology areas involving resource optimization.  The project creates anonymized datasets, and tools to analyze human and wireless behavior, all of which will be distributed to the general public. This project has important educational and training benefits at high school, undergraduate and graduate levels, including undergraduate research prototyping projects, and new graduate-level courses and seminars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project applies and develops expertise from areas of social computing, machine learning, wireless technology, security engineering, physical analogs, mobile systems, and user-centered design. The project implements and deploys a system that enables efficient bandwidth sharing with machine learning and social protocols that goes beyond what is possible with technology alone. Social protocols are cooperative yet discretionary methods that allow to users distribute access more fairly using inherently natural decision-making processes as opposed to externally imposed ones. The project consists of three major activities: (1) study the main approaches to social protocols, including persuasive computing, clinical behavior change theories, and micro-tasks; (2) develop a system that observes users trying to access the network and facilitates control rules that allow maximum value to users in the most transparent way; and (3) deploy these social protocols and the system in live networks to evaluate the approaches in real-life settings.</AbstractNarration>

Network connectivity has become a scarce resource due to the rise in mobile devices and applications. Prior research has proposed automated solutions to optimizing connectivity issues. However, these solutions are subject to a modern-day tragedy of the commons, wherein users act independently, guided only by their own self-interest, and deplete bandwidth so that all are disadvantaged. We uniquely propose social protocols as a solution to the limitations of network connection allocation in wireless networks.  This project is the first to show that social protocols can serve as an effective solution to prevalent network connectivity issues. Social protocols effectively led to sharing behaviors that would enhance WiFi connectivity for all. Interestingly, prosocial nudges are not necessary to induce WiFi connection sharing, and merely providing people with the option to share was adequate to encourage WiFi connection sharing.   Network packet loss causes video impairments and we observed two types of impairments, freeze and block-artifacts in experiments in this project. Freeze means the video stops playing and pauses at a frame for a period of time and it breaks the smoothness of video playing. Block-artifacts refer to the scenario that video keeps playing with several block-artifacts on frames and they prevent viewers receiving complete and clear video contents. We observed that some high-resolution videos with small impairment ratios have the same or higher average rating than low resolution videos without any impairments. The network packet loss rate determines the network maximum available bandwidth and it shows the bandwidth videos needed to achieve a certain quality. Videos streamed under low bandwidth networks can have the same or higher average quality rating than those streamed under high bandwidth networks. Therefore, informed by the results of this project,  we may be able to assign proper network bandwidth resources to original users according to their services and quality requirements and manage the rest network resources to serve more new users.  Finally, the project trained several undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of human-computer interaction and mobile computing. Importantly, the project also promoted many students underrepresented in STEM disciplines.       Last Modified: 02/09/2020       Submitted by: Janne Lindqvist]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
