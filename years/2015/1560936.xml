<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to identify and explore the grand challenges in experimental soft condensed matter science. The study of soft matter embraces a vast array of topics.  It includes, but is not limited to, liquid crystals, polymers, colloids, foams and other complex fluids, granular matter, fluid mechanics, rheology, pattern formation, meta-materials, self assembly, active matter, jamming and glasses, surfactants, some aspects of biological matter, membranes and nano-materials.  In essence, it includes any area in condensed matter that does not necessarily require for its investigation the use of quantum mechanics.  It has a home in physics, chemistry, chemical and mechanical engineering, materials science and applied mathematics.  It has implications for areas of science as far afield as astrophysics on the largest scales and nuclear physics at the smallest. This workshop, whose results will appear in a formal report, will capture the excitement and promise of this rapidly growing field of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award led to a 2 day workshop held on January 30-31, 2016 that surveyed the current opportunities in soft-matter experiment.  A report of this workshop was written by the PI and is available electronically at: arXiv:1610.10013 .     Issues inherent in soft matter raise problems that are broadly important in diverse areas of science and require multiple modes of attack. For example, far-from-equilibrium behavior is confronted in biology, chemistry, geophysics, astrophysics and nuclear physics. Similarly, issues dealing with disorder appear broadly throughout many branches of inquiry wherever rugged landscapes are invoked.        Soft materials consist of basic units that are significantly larger than an atom but much smaller than the overall dimensions of the sample. The label "soft condensed matter" emphasizes that the large basic building blocks of these materials produce low elastic moduli that govern a material?s ability to withstand deformations. Aside from softness, there are many other properties that are also caused by the large size of the constituent building blocks. Soft matter is dissipative, disordered, far-from-equilibrium, non-linear, thermal and entropic, slow, observable, gravity-affected, patterned, non-local, interfa- cially elastic and active. This is only a partial list of how matter created from large component particles is distinct from "hard matter" composed of constituents at an atomic scale.         Because soft matter is broadly relevant to so many disciplines, to the way scientists can interact with the public, and to the training of a diverse next generation of students, soft-matter experiment occupies a very special position in the current scientific endeavor. The outlook is indeed bright for continued productive and exciting activity.                          Last Modified: 12/02/2016       Submitted by: Sidney R Nagel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
