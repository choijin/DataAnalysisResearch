<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This research will advance understanding of the magnetocaloric effect through the fabrication and characterization of novel nanoscale heterostructures composed of magnetic metals. Geometric confinement and physical proximity will be used to perturb and understand the structure-property relationships governing the entropy at relevant phase transitions. Investigations will include composition gradients, finite size effects, tailored interfaces, and magnetic anisotropies. Physical properties of the artificially structured materials will be characterized by means ranging from standard magnetometry and diffraction techniques to synchrotron and neutron probes available through collaborations with US National Laboratories. These studies will help enable the design of materials with enhanced entropic properties, which will ultimately be relevant for highly efficient magnetic refrigeration.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: By fabricating otherwise standard materials in exotic nanostructures that do not exist in nature, it is possible to make new materials with properties superior to those of the individual materials. This will be accomplished by bringing the materials in contact at the nanoscale. Physical properties will be characterized using synchrotron and neutron scattering techniques at US National Laboratories and/or user facilities. Discoveries will be relevant to the emerging field of magnetocalorics, which has the potential for developing extremely high efficiency refrigeration using environmentally friendly refrigerants. The teaching and training of undergraduate and graduate students will be integrated into cutting edge interdisciplinary nanomagnetism research. Students will develop a network of future mentors, colleagues, and employers by disseminating work at conferences, participating in collaborations, and interacting with US National Laboratories. A scientific literature learning module will be formulated to increase undergraduates? scientific literacy, enable an easy and early transition into active research labs, and increase the quality of the undergraduate experience. USF's interdisciplinary Science, Technology, and Mathematics Education research cluster will help extend this module to other disciplines in order to reach a broad audience with interests ranging from the hard sciences to the health sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Magnetic refrigerators are a future technology that will be much more efficient than any other type of refrigeration.  Unfortunately, that efficiency only occurs with certain "magnetocaloric materials" in very large magnetic fields.   This research effort aimed to study these and other magnetic materials to explore whether or not using the tools of nanoscience could help alter their properties so they work at lower magnetic fields, closer to room temperature, or if other benefits would be realized with careful engineering at the nanoscale.  We showed that when magnetocaloric materials are grown in thin film form, their magnetocaloric properties are reduced significantly because of defects and fundamental limits of magnetism on at the nanoscale.  For the former, we discovered that defects in magnetocaloric materials have such a significant effect on their magnetic properties that a simple technique called universal scaling can be used to determine if a material is likely to have many defects.  Polarized neutron reflectometry in collaboration with collaborators from the National Institute of Standards and Technology?s Center for Neutron Research showed that the surfaces of magnetic materials had reduced the magnetocaloric effect; this led to a new line of research focusing on exploiting those natural distributions of properties.   This work on artificially inhomogeneous thin film materials studies alloy structures whose composition is changed during growth, which leads to a material with smoothly varying, well controlled distribution of properties over nanometers. The results we have from polarized neutron reflectometry indicate that the material contains a phase boundary between weak and strong magnetic regions. This boundary changes with temperature and magnetic field. This could be impactful for inspiring a variety of novel thermal-magnetic devices in which the volume of the magnetic material is a knob that can be controlled by engineers for various applications. This may also lead to related work in a variety of systems, perhaps beyond magnetism, and may inspire novel thermal-magnetic devices and other magnetocaloric applications. For the latter, this is the first demonstration of purposefully engineered thin film "broad band" refrigerant one that is capable of operating over a very wide range of temperatures.  We also explored several additional materials, most notably a class of materials called High Entropy Alloys.  These materials are comprised of 4-6 elements, with no specific element having a specific place in the crystal structure.  Some of these materials are both magnetic and tunable by changing the composition of the material.  Of importance, these results showed that it is we could obtain magnetocaloric effects that are tunable so that the operation temperature could be near room temperature using only transition metals.  Using transition metals will be important for commercial viability of magnetic refrigeration because they are abundant metals whose cost is relatively stable, unlike rare earth elements that can be subject to price fluctuations because of geo-political tensions.  We wrote a review article covering the magnetocaloric effect in thin films and heterostructures, which is still a very new topic. This was done in a tutorial fashion, and will thus provide future researchers with "tricks of the trade" to enable them to readily enter the field without going through all of the headaches we encountered when we started this research. Accompanying this was a freeware/software suite we developed that is designed to perform advanced magnetocaloric analyses on raw data input by the user.  In addition to the research results, his grant provided training, professional development, and research support to a variety of students.  This award was central to two PhD dissertations (one female) and five MS degrees (two female, one Hispanic), and exposed seven undergrads to cutting edge research (four entered physics graduate school after their experiences).  We also developed a literature searching training module for undergraduate STEM students.  This work was published, and adopted by numerous institutions for educating students to efficiently search the scientific literature.
