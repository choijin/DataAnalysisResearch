<AbstractNarration>This project will identify opportunities and strategies to support the integration of citizen science into science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. Public participation in scientific research is growing rapidly. It is resulting in important scientific insights and is engaging the public in authentic scientific experiences. However, citizen science has yet to achieve its full potential for improving STEM learning by enabling learners' full participation in the practices of science in the process of leading to scientific insight. This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from across disciplines to identify citizen science projects that are also exemplary models for learning by the public. Workshop participants will generate ideas and potential solutions to overcome barriers to implementing citizen science to improve learning outcomes in schools, museums, parks, and other learning environments with diverse audiences. Consistent with the aims of the Advancing Informal Science Learning program of the Division of Research on Learning, this workshop will advance new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments and pave the way to broaden access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences for underrepresented audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-day workshop will be held in San Jose, California on February 11th and 12th, 2015, as a component of the Citizen Science 2015 Conference. It will be led by the Citizen Science Association Education Working Group. The goal of the workshop is to facilitate growth, innovation, and improved outcomes in the use of citizen science in STEM education for diverse, informal audiences. The workshop will result in (1) interdisciplinary discussions and sharing of perspectives, best practices, and innovations among leading researchers, educators, and citizen science practitioners; (2) a framework for bridging citizen science and STEM education communities and effectively implementing citizen science in a variety of learning environments; and (3) a draft research, resource development, and action agenda to advance the use of citizen science for STEM learning. The workshop will help to establish a global community of practice invested in improving STEM learning outcomes through citizen science in informal learning environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant supported a Making Education and Lifelong Learning Connections workshop as part of the Citizen Science 2015 Conference. The overarching goal was to expand and improve the use of citizen science in formal and informal STEM education for learning outcomes. The authors and Citizen Science Association (CSA) Education Working Group recognized three opportunities:  1. RAISE AWARENESS AND ASPIRATION  Over 60 people attended the session of the workshop where the Education Working Group shared their draft vision, mission, core values, and core practices. In response to feedback received at and following the workshop, the Working Group revised its draft vision of citizen science for learning:  Through participation in citizen science, people of all ages and backgrounds contribute to science while building passion for and understanding of scientific ways to investigate the natural world.   Most feedback on the values and principles was affirming and included suggested language edits. One reviewer cautioned that the draft might be interpreted as a "normative manifesto" that could discourage rich diversity of thought and practice. We revised our core values and principles into questions designed to prompt reflection on the use of citizen science for STEM learning.   2. Uncover cultural forces, factors, constraints, and assets of stakeholder groups   Both the formal and informal education worlds have complex cultures, values, constraints, best practices, and research bases. The first step we proposed for expanding and improving the use of citizen science in STEM learning was to create discussion to lead to deeper understanding.  Workshop participants were invited to work in groups to fill out a table (Figure 1) for the stakeholders they represent or serve. The following groups formed: K-12 formal education; higher education; informal education for youth; scientists; resource managers and policy; adult lifelong learners; the curious public; high school students.  3. Begin to identify the tools, resources, and research needed   Multiple rounds of community input and synthesis have begun to inform a research, development, and action agenda, but fall short of identifying priorities. We must: understand cultural forces and factors at play for each group of participants; assess and reduce barriers to participation; and develop or enhance resources to overcome these barriers. We created a community-generated framework for further development.  GUIDING QUESTIONS  Do you      articulate your programsÆ learning objectives and make them visible? Do you      articulate your programsÆ science objectives and make them visible?  Do you      support participantsÆ growing identities as "scientists" and      science-capable learners who see science as part of their lives? Do you      help your participants to see where their contributions fit in the      scientific research enterprise?   Do you      welcome your participants into the scientific community? By what means? Do      participants in your program experience the unpredictable, sometimes messy      nature of research and discovery? Do you      provide opportunities for learners with diverse skills and interests to      contribute to the research being done? Do you accommodate learners or      educators with different learning goals? Do you offer opportunities for      differently talented participants to contribute to the research effort? Do      participants in your program use skills and knowledge from other disciplines      or endeavors as part of their activities?  Do you      offer participants role models? Are those role models diverse in      interests, race, careers, age, ethnicity, background, experience in the      project, etc.?  Does      your program facilitate social interaction among diverse novices,      learners, and experts to support their learning? Does your program      leverage divergent perspectives to strengthen the science and learning      outcomes? Do you   ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
