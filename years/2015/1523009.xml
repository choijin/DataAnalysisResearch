<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for travel assistance of US participants to an international bilateral conference entitled "9th US-Japan Workshop on Advances in Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Materials," which will be held in Himeji, Japan on May 18th - 22nd, 2015.  The co-organizers of this workshop are the PI (University of Arizona), Prof. Christine Luscombe (University of Washington), Prof. Ikuyoshi Tomita (Tokyo Institute of Technology), and Prof. Kensuke Naka (Kyoto Institute of Technology).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of this symposium are to showcase new research and application directions in the area of organic/inorganic hybrids, inorganic polymers, and nanocomposite materials.  These materials are important as they exhibit unique and useful properties that enable applications central to sustainability, energy, homeland security, and other uses.  The workshop will provide an interdisciplinary forum for the presentation of new and unpublished results in this area and provide a special opportunity to exchange ideas and information between leading US and Japanese researchers in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will enable an interdisciplinary and international venue to showcase new and previously unpublished results in the field of hybrid materials.  It will highlight the importance and significance of NSF-funded research in this area while helping to promote new international collaborations.  The talks, posters, and abstracts associated with this symposium will be used to educate new researchers in the field.  This workshop will also serve as an in-depth educational and high-visibility forum for beginning investigators, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for Speaker Travel Support to international US-Japan workshop entitled, "9th US-Japan Workshop on Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Materials."     NSF Award#:  1523009     PIs:  Jeffrey Pyun, University of Arizona; Christine Luscombe, University of Washington     Executive Summary  Financial support at the level of $5000 from the NSF Division of Materials Research-Polymers sponsored speaker travel assistance and accommodations for the US-Japan Workshop on Advances in Organic/Inorganic Materials which was held on May 18th-22nd, 2015 in Himeji, Japan.   NSF sponsorship was critical to enable the attendance of Prof. Kevin Noonan, (Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry, Carnegie Mellon University) who is currently active in the area of inorganic polymers and organic/inorganic hybrid materials.  Furthermore, four graduate students from both the University of Arizona (Phil Dirlam, UA-Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry) and the University of Washington (Lauren Kang, Ian Meager, Jason Lee, UW-Materials Science &amp; Engineering) were able to attend and present technical posters on their research.  The key outcome from the project was the successful organization of this US-Japan workshop in May 2015 that has been running for the past twenty yrs.  This forum allows for leading researchers from both countries to present and discuss on the important thrust areas in this research field and establish new collaborative efforts.  Secondly, it was the first time for Prof. Noonan to meet and present to the inorganic polymer community in Japan that has a long history of excellence in this area.  The meeting allowed for established Japanese researchers to meet a junior US academic who will likely be a leader in the field in the very near future.  Prof. Noonan is also currently funded from the NSF through a CAREER award, hence, support from this project enable greater impact of his current NSF-CAREER support.  The graduate students in attendance also benefited tremendously from seeing the differences in the Japanese academic system and general approach to research.  Phil Dirlam was a receipt of Top Student Poster Presentation entitled, "High Sulfur Content Polymers for Electrochemical Energy Storage with Li-Sulfur Batteries."  Thirdly, and perhaps the most significant long term outcome from the meeting was the assembly of an outstanding program of leading US researchers in the field from Academic &amp; Government Laboratories (notable speakers included, Prof. Krzystof Matyjaszeski-CMU, Prof. Uli Wiesner-Cornell, Rick Laine-UM, Frieder Jankle-Rutgers, Ken Wynne-VCU) that favorably represented US research efforts in the field of inorganic polymers and organic/inorganic hybrids.  Hence, future support from Japanese academics and industry to continue this workshop was secured as a consequence of this successful meeting which was strongly enabled by NSF support from this project.
