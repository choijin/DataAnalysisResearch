<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes significant advances in societal goals on energy security, sustainability, low cost energy, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  The convection battery is a systemic approach to improve the way normal (not flow) battery chemistries are used in large systems (&gt;2 kWh).  This technology will make batteries lower cost and lower weight.  Specific examples of how this technology can achieve these goals include:  a) reducing the cost of a battery pack for an electric vehicle from $10,000 to $2,000, b) reducing the cost of using wind power by up to $0.05 per kWh, and c) lowering the cost of remote power system used on farms and regions without an electrical power grid.  From a commercial perspective, the proposed technology will better enable several important industries such as wind power, electric vehicles, solar power, storage of grid electricity, and electrical power systems for remote locations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes significant advances in societal goals on energy security, sustainability, low cost energy, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                 This Phase I SBIR project focused on further development and scale-up of a convection battery. A convection battery is a battery that uses pumped electrolyte to reduce concentration gradients within the electrode leading to improved performances. This is different than a redox flow battery that uses two electrolytes and an ion-exchange membrane separator, but rather the convection battery is capable of utilizing any standard diffusion chemistries such as Zinc-Alkaline and Lithium-Ion as the electrolyte is pumped through flow-permeable electrodes and separators.                  The major results of this project were twofold: the development of a scaled-up and stackable cell in order to make a convection battery large enough for electric vehicles and also further improvements on the capacity fade of sulfur cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries.                  The development of a scaled-up flow-permeable electrode while maximizing active material loadings was a major result of this project. A method was developed to maintain a higher degree of active material loading, while still maintaining permeability to electrolyte flow.
