<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 14-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world?s major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support for research projects that utilize existing Arctic observing systems, datasets and models to evaluate key sustainability challenges and opportunities in the Arctic region, to innovate new sustainability science theory and approaches to these challenges and opportunities, and support decision-making towards a sustainable Arctic environment.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and end users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The efforts of the Bioeconomic Analysis for Arctic Marine Resource Governance and Policy (BAAMRGP) collaborative research team will address the need for integrated, cross-sectoral ecosystem-based ocean management in the Arctic through the valuation and optimization of Arctic marine resources across multiple levels of governance.  The approach will consider not only fisheries and subsistence species, but species with indirect or non-use implications, overall biodiversity and productivity, as well as the relationship between the marine ecosystem and humans, including health, commerce, and management.  The researchers from the US, Iceland, Russia, Greenland, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and New Zealand will leverage existing data sets and expertise in game theory, bioeconomic valuation and modeling, and fisheries assessment to develop game models in cooperation with a variety of stakeholders, including indigenous peoples of the north.  The effort will also consider different scenarios introduced by amendments to existing conventions under the Polar Code.  A PhD student will receive training in interdisciplinary science and gain international research experience during the course of this project.</AbstractNarration>
