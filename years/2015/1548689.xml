<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a bioabsorbable scaffold that not only rapidly closes laparoscopic fascial defects, but also eliminates clinical complications such as trocar site herniation. This device is intended to replace suture repair of all laparoscopic trocar ports, representing over 7 million trocar port openings and an addressable market of over $400 million annually in the U.S. alone. Laparoscopic bariatric surgery is a promising initial market due to the increased risk of herniation and the difficulty of using hand suturing and/or needle based closure methods in obese patients. There are over 0.2 million laparoscopic bariatric surgeries performed in the US each year, with an estimated annual growth rate of 36%. This device represents a superior fascial defect closure technology by validating a new material/mechanical design that facilitates surgical repair and tissue healing of trocar port defects. The development of this novel device holds broad applications for additional abdominal wound closure indications such as umbilical hernia, congenital abdominal wall defects, single port access, and robotic defects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to develop a bioabsorbable scaffold system for closing laparoscopic trocar port fascial defects. Current suture-based trocar port closure technologies are limited in their ease-of-use and support for wound healing. Patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery in particular face increased risk of herniation, increased operating time due to difficulty of using curved needle hand suturing or suture-based port closure devices, and increased wound healing time due to high suture tension at port sites. The scaffold system holds fascial defect edges together without risk of bowel laceration or applying high suture tension. The overall project goal is to validate the bioabsorbable scaffold device concept in Phase I and preclinical chronic evaluation during Phase II. The objectives of this Phase-I project are to: 1) conduct design refinement by iteratively modeling, fabricating, and testing prototypes to rapidly and securely close fascial defects, and 2) demonstrate protected wound healing with tension-free fascial defect edge alignment. Ultimately, this Phase-I design refinement and proof-of-concept project will lead to Phase-II activities focused on developing a select bioabsorbable scaffold device design suitable for pre-manufacturing studies, including statistically-powered in vivo degradation profile studies in chronic animals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has demonstrated the proof of concept results for FAStlink bioabsorbable scaffold to provide safe and rapid closure of laparoscopic port fascial defects.  The objectives of this Phase-I project were to: 1) conduct design refinement by iteratively modeling, fabricating, and testing prototypes to rapidly and securely close fascial defects, and 2) demonstrate protected wound healing with tension-free fascial defect edge alignment.  Towards achieving these objectives, this Phase I project determined the minimum force requirement to prevent fascial tissue slippage from the surface of the bioabsorbable scaffold.  This minimum force was applied to all scaffold closures to provide consistency during bench and in vivo testing.  Tissue strength with FAStlink closure was comparable to suture closure at up to 20% physiologic fascial stretch, but ultimate strength was higher with suture closure than with FAStlink closure.  However, ultimate strength is not expected to play a critical role in determining the outcome of the port fascial defect wound healing response.  In vivo animal histopathology evaluated at 7 and 14 days demonstrated improved outcomes with FAStlink closure by lowering inflammation and tissue necrosis as compared to suture closure.  These findings will serve as the basis for a Small Business Innovation Research Phase II proposal as they constitute a strong foundational research understanding to further reduce the concept of tension free fascial defect closure to practice.   The understanding of the force requirements and biological response to the proposed FAStlink scaffold are critical parameters obtained from the completed Phase I activities.  These parameters will carry into the Phase II proposal for iterating the design and engineering to create the commercial product.  In addition to evaluating effectiveness in chronic animal models, key Phase II proposal activities will include further implant and delivery system refinement for commercial readiness, preclinical GLP safety, product stability, aging, biocompatibility, packaging, and sterilization.  In conclusion, Phase I research activities were successfully completed in support of significant research and development ramp up in preparation for the Phase II proposal activities.
