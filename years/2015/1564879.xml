<AbstractNarration>Recognizing that there is an established need in the United States to increase the number of American scientists in the workforce, this NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project aims to increase retention and graduation rates in biology, chemistry, environmental sciences, and physics and prepare participating STEM majors for post-graduate success.  The objectives of the project are to (a) provide 24 academically talented, low income students at Longwood College with high quality support services and curricula that incorporate evidence-based practices, (b) provide professional development activities that will prepare students for future careers, (c) maintain a high level of faculty participation in curricular and co-curricular activities, and (d) investigate the outcomes of the implementation of a learning community and career-readiness activities.  This S-STEM project will have a significant impact on the region surrounding Longwood College (Southern Virginia), which has a low high-school graduation rates, low college attendance, low family incomes, and a high unemployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing from emerging research on retention of STEM majors, this program will address the scholars' needs as they transition to the university environment and grow personally, academically, and professionally. Scholars will develop as scientists by honing their skills in quantitative reasoning, modeling, and simulation and learning to apply interdisciplinary approaches to complex real-world issues through an early research experience and subsequent course-embedded collaborations.  Additionally, students will be immersed in an ecosystem of support designed to foster strong cohort development, build meaningful relationships with trained faculty mentors, and cultivate mindsets for postgraduate success. Throughout their college experience, students will collect key artifacts and reflect on their development as scientists using e-portfolios.  Faculty mentors will initiate regular conversations about the e-portfolio work and use the information to engage the students in conversation about their progress.  Formative and summative evaluation of each project component will determine the extent to which the curricular and co-curricular activities on promote students' retention to graduation.  Research will address the mentoring relationship as it relates to students' transition to college and professional development.  The PIs will disseminate findings, in journals such as Science Education and Civic Engagement: An International Journal, Primus, Journal of College Science Teaching, Physics Teacher, and Honors in Practice.</AbstractNarration>
