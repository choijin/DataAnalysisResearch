<AbstractNarration>Influenza viruses create emergencies almost every year, and existing surveillance systems are important for addressing uncertainty in the disease detection, monitoring and control. An essential tool for monitoring influenza activity is the trend of cases confirmed with an influenza virus type. Confirmed case trends are useful to estimate when the season starts and which viruses are circulating, as each flu virus targets different age groups and produces symptoms of different types and severity. During influenza emergencies, specimens from infected cases massively arrive at the testing laboratories, which leads to chaos and increased operational costs as the labs increase their capacity in response to the overwhelming testing demand. Moreover, confirmed case data produced under this chaotic environment is being used intently by decision makers and the research community. This award supports fundamental research to understand how conventional and non-conventional methods for specimen sampling minimize the publication delay and uncertainty in the daily number of influenza confirmed cases. The new findings and methods will not only improve sampling and testing practices, but will also guarantee quality of data to its users. The research promotes diversity, as female graduate students will be recruited for the project. In addition, the research promotes knowledge dissemination, as training materials will be prepared and delivered to public health policymakers, and graduate students in engineering and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysts use the reported trend of confirmed influenza cases to identify the epidemiological features of a circulating virus. However, there is uncertainty about the extent to which confirmed cases are representative of the properties of the virus. To address this concern, several methods have been suggested but they present significant limitations. For example, the methods require information that is hard to estimate, they do not consider constrained lab capacity, and they do not account for the uncertainty in the outbreak evolution and the specimen collection process. The research team will develop a Method for Operations during Disease Emergencies in the Lab (MODEL). MODEL is an algorithm for real-time sampling and Bayesian learning of epidemic parameters that accounts for the uncertainties in the course of the disease and in the specimen collection process. It is expected that MODEL features will contribute to the theory of dynamic sampling. Research efforts will also focus on a framework to evaluate any type of specimen sampling criteria during an influenza emergency. The results derived from the framework will contribute to the theory of management and surveillance of viral infectious diseases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research allowed the creation of two computational models contributing to enhanced influenza surveillance. The first model refines the time resolution of the influenza incidence signal, and the second model recommends the conditions of data collection that would improve the accuracy of the influenza incidence signal.  The model refining the time resolution dynamically downscales influenza incidence from weekly to daily using two types of data sources:  1) Daily reported complaints of symptoms during emergency department (ED) visits. These data are already available to the state health departments, and present several advantages: They are retrieved with a one-day delay only and they are based on patients' self-reports and not on lab testing, which makes data independent from the specificity, sensitivity, timeliness, and variability of the testing infrastructure.  2) Weekly influenza confirmed incidence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These data are publicly available and continuously updated from a countrywide network of laboratories.  The dynamic downscaling model provides forecasts that county and state health departments can use for timely detection of transmission chains that grow exponentially on a daily basis.  Most of the existing forecasting models are designed to predict on a weekly basis since official data sources (e.g., influenza incidence Sentinel Network) accumulate case counts by week. In addition, most of the forecast methods are made for seasonal flu, in which the weekly resolution may suffice for planning purposes. However, during a pandemic outbreak, incidence rates may grow exponentially on a daily basis, and daily forecasts can be helpful to timely detect and stop chains of transmission (e.g., by closing gathering spaces) that would be harder to control if observed on a weekly basis.    The dynamic downscaling model is also significant since, to our knowledge, it is the first algorithm that fuses influenza data trends with multiple time resolutions and updates forecasts as new data become available. Therefore, the model uses routinely collected data from disparate data sources to correct for the operational delays in the sampling and collection of influenza data.  Through the model simulating influenza data collection, we studied the operational conditions that would enhance data trends such as those used in the dynamic downscaling algorithm. Our main findings from the simulation are as follows:  -       The shape of trends created from ED symptoms complaints would maximize resemblance with the shape of true ILI trends if, in the event of an emerging flu outbreak, most symptomatic individuals perceive their symptoms as high risk, there is low attendance to primary care services, and there is high attendance to ED services in weekdays and weekends.  -       The shape of lab-confirmed influenza incidence trends would maximize resemblance with the shape of true influenza incidence trends if, in the event of an emerging flu outbreak, most symptomatic individuals perceive their symptoms as high risk, healthcare seeking rates are high, and rates of case reporting from healthcare providers are high.
