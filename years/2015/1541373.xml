<AbstractNarration>This project provides networking infrastructure upgrades to support research and education particularly in STEM disciplines, by implementing a research-level high-speed subnetwork DMZ for the local area network (LAN); adding a data transfer node; deploying the multidomain network measurement/monitoring toolkit known as perfSONAR to improve the ability to identity and isolate network problems and increase productivity; implementing the globus toolkit (software infrastructure for distributed computing, including large file storage and transfer); and installing fiber optic cable to the CSU-Pueblo observatory, providing increased bandwidth for telescope images and video.  The research DMZ connects via a 10 Gbps wide area network (WAN) connection to the Front Range GigaPop (FRGP) network, which provides access to multiple research networks including Intra-FRGP, Western Regional Network, Internet2, and ESnet.  Upgraded equipment is primarily at Colorado State University - Pueblo (CSU-P) in Pueblo, CO; some optical equipment is housed in Colorado Springs, Monument Hill, and Denver, CO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgrade improves networking for CSU-P, allowing high-speed research to be centralized and supported with networking resources (relieving congestion on CSU-P's existing LAN and WAN).  Nine particular research projects benefit from this project.  Broader community impacts include computer science courses incorporating details about this next-generation network, along with transporting, storing, preserving, manipulating, processing and analyzing big data; and the entire community participating remotely in imaging of astronomical events through CSU-P's observatory telescope.  Large datasets generated on campus are preserved regionally on the shared digital repository, and then made accessible and reusable for others.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was to enhance digital connectivity infrastructure, within the campus of Colorado State University - Pueblo, and to enhance transmission to and from campus, so that scientific research activity involving extremely large data sets could be better facilitated, processed and analyzed.  The project successfully enhanced digital communication on campus, particularly from the campus observatory (so that images may be processed and analyzed much more rapidly).  As an example, the best previous data flow rate was 750 megabits/second from the observatory; now the connection is essentially 10 gigabits/second.  The project also enhanced communication from/to other research and analysis sites, by modernizing data flow using more sophisticated Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing optical fiber communications.  Data can now be transmitted rapidly first to the Front Range GigaPop site in Denver.  From GigaPop, data proceeds, unimpeded, to other users, e.g. to research colleagues at other institutions, or to special entities such as the Summit high performance computing site in Boulder Colorado.  The project included equipment such as a border router and a data transfer node, along with supporting switches, and software such as perfSONAR to track performance, and a license for Globus software, which allows for rapid, unimpeded data flow between nodes supported by Globus.  Previously, scientific data could never be transmitted away from campus faster than 3 GB/second (and this was unlikely); now 10 GB/second waves have been deployed over the BiSON (bi state optical network).  As a result of this project, images and genomic data along with other data sets for machine learning applications and other processing can now be transmitted and analyzed much more quickly.
