<AbstractNarration>To survive and persist, an organism must acquire food, be able to reproduce, avoid being eaten, and prevent infection. However, each of these important traits is costly to maintain, which can lead to tradeoffs among the traits. That is, investment into one trait comes at a cost to another. The researchers propose an experimental approach examining simultaneous tradeoffs among three important biological traits (e.g., immunity, reproduction, and body movement) that will provide insight into the role of multi-trait tradeoffs in shaping how animals survive. Given that trait tradeoffs are influenced by the environment, these studies will occur in a range of manipulated environments that simulate the dynamics of environmental change in North America. Under stressful conditions, investment into one trait can take precedence over investment into another trait. However, if individuals encounter favorable environments (e.g., unlimited access to food), two traits, such as reproduction and immunity, may be maintained, suggesting that tradeoffs may be dependent upon food availability. The effects of food availability are often influenced by other environmental factors that may accompany reduced food availability (e.g., heat waves), and interactions between food availability and temperature may profoundly influence tradeoffs. This research will be the first to characterize the interplay between environmental variability and animal life history strategies using a network analysis approach. This approach has proven to be a powerful tool for studying diverse phenomena, such as social interactions, the structure of the Internet, and for optimizing solutions to engineering problems. Much of this research will be performed by students from under-represented minority groups, and it will be complemented by a science outreach program designed to educate community members (particularly K-8 students) on the importance of insect biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will use a manipulative approach in a wing-dimorphic field cricket to examine tradeoffs among investment into three life history traits of widespread importance: reproduction, immune function, and locomotion. Resultant empirical data will be used for a network analysis approach to characterize dynamic relationships among these traits through the determination of several network metrics (e.g., connectivity, betweenness, and modularity). They will also examine linkages between the life history networks and a network of underlying physiological traits (e.g., antioxidant defense and metabolic rate). Further, they will use a network approach to determine the independent and interactive role of two universal environmental constraints (food availability and temperature) in multi-trait tradeoffs and trait-trait interactions. Thus, the proposed study will use an integrative approach to better understand how complex trait systems develop and are maintained. It will have impact on multiple biological disciplines, including ecological immunology, ecological physiology, network analyses, and life history evolution. The researchers will provide extensive research training to students, many of whom come from under-served minority groups representative of both the region and the student body at Georgia Southern University (GSU). To complement their research goals, they will develop an outreach program designed to educate young people about insects, an important taxonomic group. They will create a website and an accompanying outreach exhibition at the GSU Museum that provides information about local insects. They will also construct and disseminate an educational module designed to meet the State of Georgia's Department of Education performance standards; this will contain structured activities, informational handouts, and live crickets that K-8 students can use to develop scientific literacy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Animals must balance a number of important biological traits and processes in dynamic environments.  Prioritizing one trait may come at a cost to other traits, and the magnitude of such tradeoffs may vary across complex environments characterized by multiple co-varying environmental factors.  Yet, the dynamic interplay among multiple traits, environmental conditions, and underlying physiological mechanisms remains a fundamental, though poorly understood, issue in ecological physiology.  To address the role of environmental complexity in trait-trait interactions, we used manipulative experiments and machine-learning modeling in a field cricket (Gryllus firmus) to examine tradeoffs among three important traits (reproduction, flight capacity, and immunity) and the sensitivity of trait tradeoffs to interactive environmental factors (food availability and temperature).  In Gryllus crickets, adults exhibit two life-history strategies that are mediated by wing length&mdash;long-winged crickets are typically flight capable, and short-winged crickets lack flight capability.  This feature of G. firmus allowed us to further examine if investment into flight capability affects the environmental sensitivity of other traits or trait-trait interactions.  Research was performed by students from under-represented minority groups, and was complemented by a citizen-science program facilitating hands-on education about the importance of insects (ants) people encounter in their everyday lives.  We detected several obligate tradeoffs that occurred regardless of environmental conditions: (1) crickets investing heavily into immunity exhibited reduced investment into body stores, reproduction, and flight capability, and (2) crickets investing heavily into flight capability exhibited reduced immune function.

Unsupervised non-linear regression models were trained to automatically predict life-history trait values using network features.  Several traits were plastic to environmental conditions (e.g., unlimited food increased investment into growth and reproduction), but only immunity was affected by wing morphology.  We conducted complementary studies in G. firmus to examine how traits and trait-trait interactions are influenced by a range of complex environmental factors.  We determined that oxidative challenge obligated costs to cricket body stores and immunity regardless of food availability, and costs to body stores were particularly high in flight-capable crickets.
