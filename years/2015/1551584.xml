<AbstractNarration>US Ignite (NSF 15-508) lays a foundation for the rapid deployment of next generation networking to all Americans.   It originated with the recognition that next generation networking is a fundamental tool for addressing both US societal problems and continued US economic growth.   The primary goal of US Ignite is to break a fundamental deadlock: there is insufficient investment in gigabit applications that can take advantage of advanced network infrastructure because such infrastructure is rare and dispersed.  Both well-established research literatures and recent efforts to promote development of gigabit applications suggest that individuals, organizations and groups within local communities are a potentially important source of innovative activity that may be harnessed to address this challenge. A key lesson learned from previous efforts to build effective technology infrastructures is that, while centralized investment in standards and core infrastructure technologies is valuable, much of the innovation with respect to application and use of the infrastructure arises from individuals and groups embedded in the local environments. There is already a long-tradition of studying and encouraging local innovation in a diverse collection of disciplines,including: Technology and innovation management, entrepreneurship, information systems and many other fields of knowledge.   In order to broadly replicate successes, the US Ignite projects need to be studied by experts in relevant fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project funds a workshop to be held at the University of Maryland on understanding, managing, learning from, and evaluating efforts to foster local communities as sources of technology innovation regarding next-generation broadband infrastructure. The workshop's purpose is to: (1) assess the state of current knowledge, (2) articulate a research agenda for critical future work; and (3) begin the process of forming cross-disciplinary, collaboration networks in this multi-disciplinary area. A more systematic understanding of efforts to promote community-based technology innovation will allow us to better design, evaluate, and learn from the ongoing investments. This will ultimately break the deadlock that hinders large-scale development of advanced network infrastructures and allow the potential economic and social benefits for these foundational technologies to be realized at the individual, local, and national levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On August 13, 2018 a workshop entitled "Connecting Technologies &amp; Communities: Understanding and Facilitating Community-Based Technology Innovation" was held in College Park, Maryland (adjacent to the University of Maryland campus). Participants included researchers and thought-leaders from a variety of disciplines including computer and information science, sociology, urban planning/smart cities, information systems, and technology and innovation management. In addition, community leaders from several cities that are actively engaged in programs to faciliate community-level engagement with technology innovation also participated. The workshop activities (a) elicited participants' ideas about the potential and challenges of community-based technology/data innovation, (b) gathered information about existing research, theories, frameworks, and approaches to faciliating community-based technology innovation, and (c) fostered connections and sharing of best-practices and research result among researchers, though-tleaders, and community-leader -- groups who often have similar interests and concerns, but due to practical constraints and disciplinary boundaries, rarely interact.  The intellectual outcomes of this work relate to fostering research and development of new ideas related to community-based technology innovation.  Workshop participants reported that they met potential collaboration partners and learned about new theories and frameworks that could be used to advance their  studies of community-based technology innovation.   The broader impact goal of this line of work is to increase the likelihood that all communities are able to realize the potential benefits of emerging technologies for the well-being of their residents/citizens. The research agenda, literature review, and initial collaboration/network building efforts completed in this project are a next step toward this goal.
