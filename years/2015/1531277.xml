<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Central Michigan University to acquire a Hitachi high-contrast/high-resolution digital transmission electron microscope (TEM). The new microscope will enable the training of the next generation of scientists in modern methods using TEM for analysis of biological and materials science samples. Undergraduate and graduate students will be exposed to the new TEM in courses that are required for the Biology/microscopy majors and that serve the doctoral students in the interdisciplinary Science of Advanced Materials Ph.D. program. The interdisciplinary team of faculty will attract underrepresented students to their research teams, and introduce high school students to cutting edge methods in STEM research, by participating in campus-wide programs that serve underrepresented students. The new TEM will also be incorporated into outreach activities for K-12 students, including "Grandparents University", a program to bring grandparent/grandchild pairs to campus for educational experiences in a university setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of the new Hitachi TEM will enable biology researchers to continue a long history of performing research using TEM, and at the same time, provide a new capability for materials science researchers at CMU. The new TEM has state-of-the-art imaging technology that will allow biology researchers to substantially increase the quality and quantity of images of low-contrast biological samples. The biology research projects that will benefit from the new TEM span a broad range and include the analysis of membrane remodeling that occurs in eggs in response to stress and aging, and the characterization of a novel cell type in corn endosperm. The new TEM will be configured to allow faculty and student researchers working with nanomaterials and polymers to collect data on campus instead of traveling to outside institutions. The materials science research projects include the characterization of the superlattice structure of ferroelectric nanoparticles that can be used in exciting applications such as energy conversion and data storage, and characterization of edge-defined graphene nanoribbons that have applications for lithium-ion battery electrodes. The new TEM will enhance the growing research capabilities at CMU, serve students in many programs, and attract new researchers to CMU.</AbstractNarration>

This state-of-the-art TEM replaced the outdated Philips CM-10 that had been in use for 24 years. The HT7700 TEM has greatly improved the research capabilities of faculty and student researchers in the biology, engineering, chemistry &amp; biochemistry departments, and in the College of Medicine.

One study of the ultrastructure of <em>C. elegans</em> eggs revealed novel remodeling of the endoplasmic reticulum when the CGH-1 RNA binding protein is mutated. This result provides the first link between regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum and regulation of complexes of RNA and RNA binding proteins. A second study of the ultrastructure of the maize endosperm supports prior suggestions that the endosperm conducting cells function in the transport of sugars. In a related collaborative study of maize, it was discovered that drought-stressed maize kernels have normal, but delayed cell differentiation of the basal transfer cells; this was surprising due to the significantly decreased size of many drought-stressed kernels. A third study discovered a new species of cyanobacterium that causes failures at shrimp aquaculture farms, and ongoing ultrastructural studies are characterizing three additional toxic cyanobacteria.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advanced capabilities of the HT7700 have allowed faculty and student researchers working with nanomaterials and polymers to collect data on campus, instead of traveling to distant, outside institutions. Major outcomes of the materials science projects include the following: 1) characterization of the morphology of nanostructures used as anodes for lithium- and sodium- ion battery applications. The TEM revealed a high degree of monodispersity and uniform distribution of iron content of iron-doped titania nanoparticles that were fabricated. 2) Outcomes also include the synthesis and characterization of metal oxide colloidal nanocrystals and nanocrystal-based films. Data have provided insight into the polar ordering in nanoscale perovskites which are an exciting class of multifunctional materials with potential integration in devices for energy storage/conversion, catalysis, and data storage.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having an updated TEM has enhanced the overall research capabilities at CMU and has contributed to attracting two new researchers to the CMU Biology Department.

During the life of the award, an average of 35 students and technicians/year, from 17 different research laboratories, were trained on the TEM.
