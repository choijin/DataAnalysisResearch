<AbstractNarration>This research project investigates how the emergence of shrimp diseases impacts shrimp producers and global shrimp production networks. It examines how environmental conditions interact with socio-political factors and development policy to influence the production of the world's most valuable seafood commodity. Shrimp diseases result in dramatic economic losses in regions reliant on aquaculture and create high market volatility in regions that primarily fish for wild shrimp, such as the United States. A better understanding of the socio-political and environmental conditions that drive the problem of disease will strengthen the food production economies of both types of regions, particularly for small-scale producers who are disproportionately affected by disease outbreaks. The project incorporates environmental and contextual factors into commodities research, which has traditionally focused on the role of firms in explaining how commodities like shrimp are produced. The focus on shrimp disease is expected to help improve disease remediation management for shrimp farmers as well as assist the identification and dissemination of effective responses to market volatility for U.S. producers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrimp are produced in two distinct ways: (a) aquaculture (farming) in land-based ponds and (b) traditional wild-capture methods. Most consumers in the global marketplace do not differentiate shrimp produced by these two methods. As a result, the growth of aquaculture has dramatically increased supply and caused a fall in global prices for producers using both methods. This growth has been accompanied by the emergence of diseases in shrimp farms, which have caused significant economic loss and dramatic price volatility in the global market. Despite decades of research, treatment of most major diseases remains difficult or impossible. The problem is especially severe for many small-scale producers in both the U.S. and Asia, who are impacted by the general fall in prices and lack the knowledge or resources to effectively respond to disease losses or market volatility. This project addresses these issues by asking what structural and socioeconomic drivers lead to the emergence of disease in certain areas, how disease impacts producers at local levels, and how small-scale producers adapt and respond to disease. The research methods combine analysis of contextual historical and economic data with interviews with shrimp producers and local traders in field sites in North Carolina and Aceh, Indonesia. This approach addresses the "black box" problem of commodities research, in which the consumer side of commodity exchanges are well understood, but the social and environmental conditions of production at the local level are not. Interviews draw on the investigator's connections with producer groups in both regions to better understand production relationships, livelihood strategies, and policy impacts, with an emphasis on how they shape and are shaped by the emergence of disease.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project focuses on the complex relationships that exist between different actors involved in the production of shrimp. As the world&rsquo;s second most valuable seafood commodity the shrimp industry sustains an enormous number of people and businesses. Shrimp are now primarily produced through aquaculture, or fish farming, in land-based pond systems. However, they are unique in that consumers generally do not differentiate between farmed and wild caught shrimp, as they do for other seafood like salmon. As a result, land-based shrimp farmers located in places like Southeast Asia are linked economically with wild shrimp fishers in the United States and elsewhere.</p> <p>This link means that trends affecting one production method or country will affect other shrimp producers around the world. This project investigates how diseases of&nbsp; farmed shrimp shape the global production of shrimp through these economic linkages. Shrimp disease operates on a massive scale, and a serious outbreak can wipe out globally significant amounts of shrimp supply causing severe market disruptions. The methods included field based research in Southeast Asia to investigate how disease impacts the economic relationships and production practices of shrimp farmers, and economic analysis of how disease trends impact production globally.

Analysis of US production found that while disease events cause temporary increases in prices for US shrimp fishers by harming competing producers of farmed shrimp; overall the increase in shrimp production from farmed shrimp is driving a downward trend in prices.</p> <p>The intellectual merit of this project lies in exploring how a non-human factor like disease can drive human decisions and adaptation within a global supply chain; in this case reinforcing existing trends toward consolidation. In addition, demonstrating that disease outbreaks create only short term changes for wild capture producers demonstrates that disease drives volatility, rather than reversing downward price trends. A potential result of this volatility is that wild capture producers may adapt their business practices based on short-term increases in price, only to suffer when disease-driven price increases dissipate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader impacts of this project result from the practical utility of these findings for producers. The understanding of how these seemingly separate producers are connected, and how events like disease impact production outcomes allows for better decision making in response to the volatility caused by disease. In addition to the practical impacts of project outcomes, multiple students from both the United States and Indonesia were trained in methods and theoretical approaches in economics, political ecology, and geography.
