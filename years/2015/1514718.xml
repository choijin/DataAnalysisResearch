<AbstractNarration>Many bats hunt prey over bodies of water. During this high-energy hunting activity they hydrate themselves by swooping down to the water surface and dragging their tongue across the surface to splash water into the mouth all while maintaining flight stability. This drinking while flying behavior is unique in nature and could give insight into the design of an air vehicle capable of quickly sampling large bodies of water. To study this behavior bats will be filmed while drinking in a lab with an array of high-speed cameras. Experiments will be conducted at the Shandong University ? Virginia Tech International Laboratory in Jinan, China in collaboration with Dr. Rolf Mueller, an expert in bat physiological form and function and bat biosonar systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kinematics and fluid dynamics of bat drinking are unparalleled in nature and have not been investigated as of yet. Biological experiments in a laboratory setting will be performed to characterize drinking parameters like the angle of attack, velocity, head and body position, and tongue movement of the bats while they drink. From the fluid dynamics perspective, understanding the interplay between the air/water interface and mouth/tongue is essential. The nature of the splash and how much water is transported into the mouth will be characterized using a high-speed camera array. The goal of proposed experiments is to develop a physical framework of the distinctive bat drinking while flying behavior that could give insights into the design of a water-skimming air vehicle. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bats are unique in nature in that they are one of the only animals that ingest fluids during non-hovering flight. This behavior has an advantage in that bats can drink and maintain flight while hunting for food. We find that bats simply extend the tongue and drag it on the water surface while flying. The bats ingest water that coats the inside of the mouth and tongue after removal from a water source. Bats also change their wing-beat pattern to avoid hitting the water.  Multiple cameras were used to capture the kinematics and fluid mechanics of bats drinking water on the wing in a laboratory. Using computer vision techniques, a three-dimensional view of the bat's drinking behavior is created. With these imaging techniques, the velocity and water penetration depth of the tongue along with the head and wing position as the bat drinks were found. Bats are seen using two types of drinking mechanisms, scooping and dipping. During scooping, the bat submerges most of the jaw under the water surface. For dipping, the bat only touches its tongue to the water surface. It is assumed that the bat would want to use the scooping mechanism as it splashes much more water into the mouth, however, due to high drag and concerns about wetting its echolocation apparatus, it only uses the scooping method about 50% of the time. Additionally, the wing motion of a bat during drinking and rising flight were compared to show that drinking flight is less efficient than straight forward flight and comparable to rising flight.  This study integrates biological and physical sciences to explore an uncommon drinking behavior that could potentially lead to novel and counterintuitive engineering systems. The results of this study could influence the design of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) capable of skimming a water surface. Insights gained from this research could also allow for close to real time sampling of large and small bodies of water to assess water quality during a crisis.
