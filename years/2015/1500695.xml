<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in technology have created new methodologies in documenting endangered languages.  This project will provide an overview of these advances in video format and will be presented by experts in field.  The purpose of the project is to support production of the highest quality of documentary linguistic products and stimulate research in these areas.  The primary audience for these outreach videos are linguists or language experts from minority communities who may engage in language documentation but do not have access to state-of-the-art instruction. Over the long term, greater participation in documenting endangered languages will contribute new knowledge of a wider array of under-documented endangered languages each of which provide unique information on human language and cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The videos will be uploaded as YouTube videos and will be freely available online.  They will include information on tools for language analysis (transcription, interlinear gloss creation, and acoustic analysis) and linguistic analysis needed for dictionary, grammar, and corpus creation.  Experts will also review current standards in metadata creation and archiving, and funding mechanisms for documentary linguistic research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The DEL Outreach Video Series project funded the production of a set of instructional videos that explain the basics of a Documenting Endangered Languages (DEL) project.  Primary goals of the project include increasing participation in the DEL program by members of under-represented communities (specifically, members of Indigenous communities whose languages are endangered), and instructing people who have applied for a DEL grant and been unsuccessful on how to edit and resubmit in a way that makes their proposals more competitive.  The series includes 25 individual 4-12 minute segments that describe such varied topics as why a language is of interest, desired outcomes, budgeting, and establishing appropriate timelines.  Segments were scripted and narrated by a total of 15 experts in the field including current and former NSF program officers as well as past and current NSF-DEL awardees.  In addition to being publically available, the series has been used as a part of grant development workshops with members of Indigenous communities interested in documenting their endangered native and heritage languages.    Over the short term, the series will continue to be used to promote and support the development of new DEL projects.  Over the long term, having more members of Indigenous communities funded by the DEL program will contribute to new knowledge by supporting documentation of a wider array of under-documented endangered languages by those most affected by their loss, community members themselves.  By facilitating application to the DEL program by members of Indigenous communities, this project contributes to their independence as curators and documenters of their own endangered heritage languages.  Furthermore, this project has the potential to improve infrastructure among tribal organizations by supporting improved curation, archiving, dissemination, and digital sharing of documentary corpora.  Broad dissemination of results is a primary objective of this project in that the video series is publically available to anyone with access to YouTube via the following url: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6lZ5D0xFdkykMhaUOylKEw          Last Modified: 05/22/2017       Submitted by: Racquel-Maria Yamada]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
