<AbstractNarration>The thematic programme on Random Geometry will be hosted at Cambridge University, United Kingdom, from January 12 to July 3, 2015. The purpose of the programme is to bring together leading researchers from around the world to explore and develop the burgeoning field of Random Geometry, a new discipline of mathematics that lies at the intersection of probability, geometry, and analysis. Random Geometry uses tools from these fields to quantifiably study the rich geometrical structure of random metric spaces and the random processes that live within them. Random Geometry is interdisciplinary in nature, and the intellectual merit of the programme lies in its potential to establish a cross-fertilization of ideas within different areas of mathematics and connect these ideas with theoretical physics and other fields of science. Broader impact will be realized via this exchange of ideas across disciplines and through the training of a new generation of students to carry on the work in this important field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to enabling long-term collaborations between leading researchers, the programme will allow for the dissemination of new results with conferences on Conformally Invariant Scaling Limits (Jan 26-30, 2015), Random Graphs and Trees and their Applications (Mar 16-20, 2015), Random Planar Structures (April 20-24, 2015), and the Geometry of Random Walks and SLE (June 15-19, 2015). The programme will begin with an Instructional Workshop for Younger Researchers (Jan 12-23, 2015). Funds from this proposal will enable the participation of United States based students and junior researchers in these programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: www.newton.ac.uk/event/rgm</AbstractNarration>
