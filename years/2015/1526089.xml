<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines how basic pro-social orientations and victimhood influence the public's support for potential outcomes of the ongoing peace negotiations. Peace negotiators must agree on issues such as jail time, the truth, demobilization, reparations, and socio-political re-integration. Public opinion towards such outcomes is crucial since any eventual peace deal must ultimately be ratified by the electorate. We measure pro-social orientations by observing individuals' levels of (1) altruism, (2) trust, (3) reciprocity, (4) willingness to uphold fairness norms even at some personal cost. We conceive of the nature of victimhood in terms of who the perpetrator was and how recently and directly one has been victimized. Pro-sociality and victimhood (and their interplay) should help understand public opinion formation towards the negotiated peace outcomes. Using negotiations between the Colombian government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) guerrillas as the case of interest, results of the study will hold lessons for political leaders and policymakers who are tasked with both reaching a peace agreement and, subsequently, designing post-conflict institutions to sustain peace and foster social cohesion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study how social preferences and the nature of victimhood influence public opinion formation surrounding aspects of negotiated peace, we embed game-theoretic behavioral measures of social preferences in a large online survey administered by a professional survey firm. Altruism is measured via dictator games. Trust and reciprocity are measured in the context of a trust game. Costly punishment, i.e. strong negative reciprocity, is gauged using a Third-Party Punishment game. Subjects are randomly assigned to one role in each of these games. Afterwards, they respond to question batteries tapping (1) preferences for potential outcomes of the Colombian government-FARC peace talks and (2) nature of victimhood. The order of these two batteries will be randomized to permit a partial test of the exogeneity of social preferences to victimhood. To explore this and other questions related to victimhood and opinion formation towards the peace process more deeply, we will conduct 4 focus groups with victims groups in Bogot√° and in the conflict zone. The project explores how pro-sociality influence the politics of conflict resolution in contemporary polities. At the same time, it will test the proposition that the effect of social preferences on policy preferences towards peace and justice cannot be divorced from the degree and nature victimhood in post-conflict societies.</AbstractNarration>

However, a successful negotiated peace faces a key challenge: finding legitimacy and support among the public generally and victims in particular.   Unlike in many negotiated ends to civil wars in non-democracies, Colombia√Üs longstanding electoral democracy requires the direct consultation of the public through a referendum on any agreement. Likewise the support of the elected congress and future presidents will be central to the successful implementation of any agreement, and the courts will need to approve its provisions as constitutional. It is likely that many segments of the public will take issue with key aspects of any agreement: amnesty for crimes, reintegration of rebels into communities, FARC participation in politics, etc.   Our project investigates the sources of legitimacy of the peace process and its transitional justice components in particular, by examining individual characteristics of interpersonal trust, altruism and vengeance, as well as experience as a victim of the conflict.  Using the data from the public opinion survey experiments and focus groups funded by the National Science Foundation, in conjunction with other Colombian public opinion sources, we find several key factors shape the public√Üs support for the peace process and the transitional justice aspects it  entails to hold accountable human rights abusers. Over the past 12 months we have produced a series of papers and presentations for both academic and policy-maker audiences (including Colombian leaders and the US Department of Defense).

Furthermore, results from our series of focus groups with victims highlight the complexity and challenges individuals have with accepting former combatants into their communities. The desire for peace is deep, but there is substantial debate over the acceptable costs for bringing about an end to the conflict between the FARC and the government of Colombia.   We continue to work with the data generated by the project and to present and publish our findings in academic journals and popular press outlets.
