<AbstractNarration>William Noid of the Pennsylvania State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division to develop theoretical methods and computational tools for simulating the thermodynamic and interfacial properties of liquids and polymers.  Computer simulations provide powerful insight for addressing technological challenges and for guiding the design of novel materials with desired properties.  While simulations with atomically detailed models are often very accurate, they do not provide the necessary efficiency for addressing the long length and time scales that are relevant for materials design.  In contrast, lower resolution coarse-grained models provide superior efficiency, but currently provide limited accuracy and often require extensive parameterization for each new system and environment.  Professor Noid and his coworkers develop theoretical methods for improving the accuracy of coarse-grained models, as well as for extending their range of applicability. Additionally, Professor Noid organizes an intergenerational science club that promotes life-long scientific education within the broader community, while integrating students of all ages into the scientific enterprise.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops and validates a van der Waals (vdW) approach for improving both the transferability and also the thermodynamic properties of bottom-up multiscale methods.  Motivated by an exact decomposition of the many-body potential of mean force, which is the correct potential for a coarse-grained (CG) model.  This model perfectly reproduces both the structural and thermodynamic properties of an underlying atomistic model.  The vdW approach: (1) adopts leading variational methods to determine effective potentials that accurately describe structural properties and (2) develops new variational methods to accurately model thermodynamic properties.  In particular, the work extends a pressure-matching variational principle for modeling density fluctuations in inhomogeneous and interfacial systems.  The comparison of potentials obtained from different variational approaches provides insight into their entropic components and allow for predictive estimates of their transferability. Ultimately, this work may develop predictive CG models for exceedingly accurate and efficient simulation studies of mesoscale self-assembly at aqueous interfaces and conduction in polymer-based batteries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computer simulations play an ever-increasing role in the development of technologies, devices, and medicines for advancing the economy, enhancing quality of life, and improving public health.  In particular, by directly simulating the dynamics of each atom in a system, atomically detailed molecular dynamics simulations provide exquisite insight into molecular motion, structure, and interactions, which guide the development of novel materials with desired properties, as well as new medical treatments for various diseases.  Unfortunately, atomically detailed simulations require significant computational resources, which generally limit their scope to phenomena that involve nanometer length scales and microsecond time scales.    These considerations strongly motivate the development of more efficient `coarse-grained' (CG) simulation models that represent systems in reduced detail, thereby providing much greater computational efficiency and enabling simulation studies on much longer length-and time-scales.  In particular, these CG models (or, more precisely, the potentials describing the interactions in CG models) are often developed to accurately describe molecular structure and interactions for a specific homogeneous system in a specific thermodynamic state point, e.g., at a given temperature and density.  However, CG models often lack transferability, i.e., models that accurately describe one thermodynamic state point may provide a poor description at other state points.  Moreover, CG models often provide a poor description of thermodynamic properties, such as the energy or the pressure.  Furthermore, these CG models tend to provide an inadequate description of interfaces or other inhomogeneous environments.  The present project developed rigorous theory and robust computational methods for addressing these limitations of current CG models.    Intellectual Merit.  The present project focused on two goals: (1) rigorously addressing the state-point dependence and thermodynamic properties of CG models; and (2) accurately modeling interfaces with CG models.    Goal 1: We systematically examined the temperature- and density-dependence of CG models for conventional molecular liquids, such as methanol, as well as CG models for a more complex liquid that demonstrates a glass transition.  We developed a unified theoretical framework that rigorously addressed both the limited transferability of CG models, as well as their poor thermodynamic properties. We derived and validated a new computational methodology that accurately describes atomic energetics, while simultaneously providing predictive estimates for the temperature-dependence of CG models.  Finally, we constructed extremely efficient CG models that accurately modeled complex ionomer systems under a fairly wide range of thermodynamic conditions.    Goal 2:  We developed and distributed the Bottom-up Open-source Coarse-graining Software (BOCS) package for constructing CG models that accurately model both structural and thermodynamic properties.  In particular, the BOCS package determines a `volume potential' of the global density to accurately reproduce pressure-volume thermodynamic properties.  We demonstrated that this volume potential can be directly converted into a potential of the local density around each molecule in order to accurately model inhomogeneous systems.  We implemented necessary extensions of LAMMPS for simulating these CG models with a leading open-source software package.  We systematically examined the theoretical and numerical properties of these local-density potentials.    Broader Impact.  By deriving theory, we determined a rigorous and systematic procedure for improving the thermodynamic properties and transferability of CG models.  By implementing this theory as software in the open-source BOCS package, we provided the scientific community with advanced tools for parameterizing CG models that are accurate, efficient, and transferable.  By incorporating volume potentials into the open-source LAMMPS package, we developed and distributed the first method and software tools for ensuring that CG models accurately reproduce the pressure-volume thermodynamic properties of high resolution models.  In sum, these contributions will enable the development of CG models with the necessary accuracy and efficiency for addressing outstanding questions in materials science and medicine.  This research project provided rigorous training in computational and theoretical chemistry for multiple graduate students.  Finally, this project provided unique opportunities for local senior citizens to participate in scientific education and discovery-based learning.
