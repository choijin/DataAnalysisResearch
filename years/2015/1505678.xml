<AbstractNarration>Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the Universe, they are keys to many astrophysical processes, and they may hold the key to explaining the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. They are known to occur in nature in three types, or "flavors." It has also been observed that neutrinos could switch flavors through a process known as neutrino oscillation. From such oscillation experiments, it is found that neutrinos must have a mass. This is the first known indication that there is physics beyond the very successful Standard Model of Particle Physics. Neutrino mass remains one of the most important open questions in physics and so experiments are searching for ways to determine it since with their abundance they could play an important role in the evolution of our Universe. Direct laboratory determinations based on the precise measurement of the beta spectrum have been expanding over the past 80 years due to increasingly powerful electron spectrometry techniques. In 2009, the PI proposed a new technique by which the energy spectrum of low energy electrons can be extracted. The technique, known as Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), relies on the detection and measurement of coherent radiation created from the cyclotron motion of electrons in a magnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of neutrino masses has broad implications for the scientific community, particularly in the fields of nuclear physics, particle physics, and cosmology. The CRES technique, being a general spectroscopic technique for low energy electrons, has broad applicability. Examples of possible application include detection of rare radioactive isotopes for nuclear non-proliferation, Fiertz interference term measurements, low energy electron-atom scattering, and high voltage metrology. The PI wishes to target undergraduate student participation in such research toward underrepresented minorities, particularly toward members of the Native American community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three years of research and development, the Project 8 experiment has successfully demonstrated the first detection of cyclotron radiation from single electrons. With the proof of principle firmly established, this award provides continued support for the next stage of the R&amp;D program, moving toward a neutrino mass measurement from tritium beta decay. In particular, the next phase is to make a first measurement of a tritium beta spectrum in order to determine the scalability of the technique. Such a direct measurement in the sub-eV neutrino mass range is important for cosmology, the structure of the new Standard Model, and it will illuminate a key unknown in the search for neutrino-less double beta decay.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mass of the neutrino has been an important and open question in the field of physics dating back to Enrico Fermi.  Although we now know that neutrinos do indeed have a finite mass -- a unexpected surprise given our original predictions from the Standard Model-- we still do not know what that mass scale is.  Knowledge of the neutrino mass can have significant impact on our understanding on how *all* particles in the Standard Model acquire mass, and on our understanding of how the universe evolves over time. One technique that is used to determine the neutrino mass directly is to measure the energy spectrum of electrons from radioactive beta decay.  This is the most direct way to measure the mass scale of neutrinos.     We had developed a technique, known as Cyclotron Resonance Emission Spectroscopy or CRES, to measure the energy of electrons very precisely using frequency (radio waves).  The technique had been demonstrated using calibration electrons thanks to a previous NSF grant. However, the technique had not been shown to work on a genuine beta decay spectrum.  This grant allowed our collaborators to effectively demonstrate the CRES technique on a beta-decay isotope (in this case, tritium). As of 2018, we have successfully tested this technique and achieved our milestone.  We have also been designing a future experiment that expands the capabilities of the technique to finally reach unprecedented sensitivity in measuring the neutrino mass directly.  The experimental effort, called Project 8, is now entering its next phase, to begin taking data with larger volumes to achieve the necessary sensitivity for measuring the mass of the neutrino.     We thank the National Science Foundation for support for this effort.       Last Modified: 12/27/2018       Submitted by: Joseph A Formaggio]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
