<AbstractNarration>Natural gas is an important source of energy in the United States.  However, some of the U.S. natural gas reserves are contaminated with nitrogen gas to the extent that it is necessary to remove the contaminant before it is used.  Under the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Gohdes at Pacific University and Dr. Tyler at the University of Oregon combine molecular chemistry synergistically with polymer science to design and synthesize novel metal-templated polymers (MTPs) that will be useful as long-lived absorbents for the purification of natural gas.  The fundamental knowledge gained from this project has broader scientific implications in other important areas such as catalysis and sensor design.  Undergraduate and graduate students working on this project receive training in experimental design and a broad array of synthetic and analytical techniques.  This project is expected to provide training of STEM educators through vehicles such as a summer workshop on Informal Science Education (ISE) where students interested in science education learn techniques for effectively communicating with the public in venues such as science museums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior work in the Tyler lab at the University of Oregon showed that water-soluble trans-Fe(P2)2(X)(Cl)-type complexes (X = Cl, H; P2 = a water-soluble bidentate phosphine) can successfully bind dinitrogen reversibly under conditions suitable for a pressure-swing separation process.  In this project, Dr. Gohdes and Dr. Tyler aim to enhance the stability of the nitrogen binding Fe(II) complexes by encapsulating them in a polymer matrix, forming MTPs around the nitrogen binding motif.  Another approach to enhance stability of the nitrogen binding complexes is by replacing the bidentate phosphines with macrocyclic, tetradentate phosphines.  These groups collaboratively perform research to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of the nitrogen-binding reactions of the iron complexes and MTPs.  A fundamental understanding of how the properties of the polymer affect the intrinsic reactivity of the metal center is important for the design and optimization of the next generation nitrogen-absorbing materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dr. Gohdes at Pacific University and Dr. Tyler at the University of Oregon were supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to collaboratively create and develop new, robust materials that will be useful as long-lived absorbents for the purification of natural gas.  While nearly one-fourth of all primary energy consumed in the United States comes from natural gas, about 20% of the U.S. natural gas reserves are contaminated with nitrogen to the extent that it is necessary to remove the contaminant before it is used. Dr. Gohdes and Dr. Tyler combine molecular chemistry synergistically with polymer science in novel ways and next generation materials are developed based on a fundamental understanding of the basic science governing the properties of these systems.  Lessons learned from this project have broader scientific implications in the important areas of catalysis and sensor design.  Undergraduate students working on this project receive exceptional training in a broad array of experimental techniques, in experimental design and in analysis and are ready to become leaders of innovation in STEM.  A total of seven undergraduate students worked on this project at Pacific University, three of whom were from underrepresented groups.  All of them have presented their work at either regional or national conferences.  Five have gone on to graduate work in STEM.  This project also has extensive impact in the training of STEM educators through exciting vehicles such as a summer workshop on Informal Science Education (ISE) where students interested in science education learn techniques for effectively communicating with the public in venues such as science museums.    Prior work in the Tyler lab at the UO showed that water-soluble trans-Fe(P2)2(X)(Cl)-type complexes (X = Cl, H; P2 = a water-soluble bidentate phosphine) can successfully bind N2 reversibly under conditions suitable for a pressure-swing separation process.  The problem with these complexes, however, was that, over the course of six weeks during a continuous N2-absorb/N2-desorb test in the lab, the iron complexes decomposed via ligand dissociation and rearrangement to form Fe(P2)32+ and the system lost its ability to bind nitrogen. In this work, Dr. Gohdes and Dr. Tyler enhance the stability of the nitrogen binding Fe(II) complexes by encapsulating them in a polymer matrix, forming metal templated polymers (MTPs) around the nitrogen binding motif.  This approach has the advantage that the thermodynamic properties of the nitrogen binding reaction at the metal center can be fine-tuned by altering properties of the polymer such as the polarity (dielectric constant) and rigidity (cross-linking).  A series of these nitrogen binding molecules and the corresponding polymers have been made.  Studies of the molecular compounds have shown that indeed the polarity of the environment can be used to alter the binding constants by a significant amount and that temperature will play a significant role in optimizing the performance of the polymer absorbents.  Studies of the polymers are ongoing.  The phosphine-based MIPs are rare examples in the field and our understanding of how the properties of the polymer affect the intrinsic reactivity of the metal center is applicable to other polymer-supported catalyst and sensor designs.
