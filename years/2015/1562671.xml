<AbstractNarration>Today's economy and society are highly dependent on liquid fuels for transportation. Currently, more than 90 percent of the liquid transportation fuels used in the U.S. are petroleum-based. It is imperative to develop alternative liquid fuels that are domestically produced and environmentally benign. Biofuels, derived from cellulosic biomass such as agricultural and forestry residues and dedicated energy crops, offer one of the best near- to mid-term alternatives. Size reduction of cellulosic biomass is the key step in the manufacturing of biofuels. Size reduction is an energy intensive process, and particle size dictates the energy consumption in this process. This award supports research to understand the relationship between cellulosic biomass particle size and biofuel yield. Successful completion of this research will build a foundation for future biofuel manufacturing technologies. This research will have a significant impact on the overall cost and energy balance of biofuel manufacturing, greatly benefiting the U.S. economy and energy security, as well as the environment and society, in general. This project will have a positive impact on engineering education. A new course accompanied by hands-on lab sessions will be created to strengthen the undergraduate engineering curricula and engage students in participating projects on renewable energy manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to test three hypotheses to explain inconsistency in the relationship between cellulosic biomass particle size and enzymatic hydrolysis sugar yield. In this research, it is hypothesized that the inconsistences are caused by the use of different sugar yield definitions, particle size ranges, and pretreatment methods. The prevailing biofuel manufacturing technology and the three most widely used cellulosic biomass currently in the industry, wheat straw, corn stover, and switchgrass, will be used in the research. Experimental investigations on both lab and pilot scale biofuel conversion facilities will be conducted to test the hypotheses. Additionally, structural features, morphological changes, and chemical compositions of cellulosic biomass will be characterized by using electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, UV spectrophotometry, high performance liquid chromatography, IR spectroscopy, Simon's stain, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Based on the experimental results, a sugar yield model, incorporating all the significant structural, morphological, and chemical features, will be developed and validated. The outcome of this research will provide insights in the dynamic degradation of sugar compounds during hydrolysis. It will advance the knowledge base needed to make both strategic and operational decisions in biofuel manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the project started in July 2016, this research has generated knowledge and understanding of the effects of biomass particle size and many other biomass physical and chemical features on fermentable sugar yield. Research outcomes contribute to manufacturing cellulosic bioethanol in a cost effective and environmental friendly way.  Major research tasks completed and outcomes are: (1) tested three hypotheses to explain the inconsistent relationships between particle size and fermentable sugar yield reported in the literature, (2) gained fundamental knowledge on the effects of biomass physical, structural, and chemical features on fermentable sugar yield through hypothesis testing, (3) investigated the comprehensive impacts of biomass particle size throughout the entire multi-step bioethanol production process, (4) assessed the effects of biomass particle size on fermentable sugar yield when biomass was pretreated by supercritical carbon dioxide, dilute acid, dilute alkaline, and metal oxide pretreatments, (5) boosted the concentration of ethanol made from cellulosic biomass via co-fermentation, 1st and 2nd generation biofuel integration, and direct hydrolysis and fermentation of pretreatment liquor, (6) established novel methods in determining chemical compositions generated during bioethanol production using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and (7) performed an economic viability and environmental impact investigation and revealed that a co-fermentation-based supply chain can effectively address the concern of food versus fuel competition of corn sourced supply chain.  Based on the work supported by this grant, 13 journal papers have been published in various peer-reviewed journals and 5 conferences papers have been published in proceedings.  Under the REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) supplement support, seven undergraduate students from Kansas State University have and one from Georgia Institute of Technology gained hands-on research experiences. This project also provide renewable energy themed hands-on learning experiences tp local middle and high school students.  This project also brought positive impacts on research infrastructure renovation in the PI's labs, including novel biomass pretreatment and chemical detection techniques.This project provided research assistantship support to three Ph.D. students (one full and two partial). One of them graduated with Ph.D. dissertation on closely related topic on bioethnoal production, and the other two are in the third year of the Ph.D. program. This project partially supported a post-doc fellow for one year. This project also provided opportunities to undergraduate, graduate students, and the PIs to attend three professional conferences to present their work. In addition, this project created various collaboration opportunities with two other universities and yielded joint publications.  The findings, results, and techniques of this project provide improved understanding to fill gaps in the literature on bioethanol manufacturing methods. The outcomes of this project have a significant impact on biomass preprocessing, logistics, pretreatment, and the overall cost of bioethanol manufacturing. Beyond these, several novel concepts and pathways of future bio-refinery and biomass-based eco manufacturing that are more environmental friendly and economically viable than the current solutions have been demonstrated with case studies.
