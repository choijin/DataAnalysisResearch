<AbstractNarration>Traffic congestion impedes US competitiveness, needlessly slowing the movement of most persons and goods. The impacts of congestion are diverse, ranging from safety issues to increased costs of goods and services. The total financial cost of congestion in 2011 was $121 billion. To address this challenge we need a deeper understanding of how traffic flows (and at times does not flow). Freeway traffic is inherently difficult to study because there are thousands of vehicles interacting over several miles. While it is clear that lane change maneuvers are an important factor generating turbulence that impedes traffic, the details of how this turbulence forms and grows are beyond the resolution of existing traffic monitoring tools. This research will advance sensor technology to develop the right tools to understand and model the lane change process in detail. With this better understanding, operating agencies will be able to manage the freeways more efficiently and reduce congestion without building more facilities. Thus, using the existing infrastructure more efficiently to reduce the costs of congestion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to greatly advance the understanding and microscopic modeling of where, when, how and why vehicles undertake lane change maneuvers on freeways. A lane change maneuver can take over a mile from start to finish before the traffic stream fully adjusts to the change, with driver behavior dependent upon only a few feet difference in the spacing between vehicles. Given the large number of vehicles interacting over long distances it has been virtually impossible to observe the microscopic details of the lane change maneuver process with conventional tools. This research will use advanced sensing technology to develop a deeper understanding of the microscopic factors that give rise to congestion. The work will use hundreds of hours of instrumented probe vehicle data that include positioning and ranging data for the ambient vehicles around the probe out to 80 m, collected on an urban freeway during peak periods with recurring and non-recurring congestion. Preliminary review indicates that these data include over 10,000 lane change maneuvers. This large quantity of microscopic vehicle interactions will be used to develop a deeper understanding and more accurate models of the lane change maneuver process to help develop the right tools necessary to mitigate traffic congestion. Models of lane changing behavior will be crucial as connected vehicle infrastructures are constructed and autonomous vehicles are introduced into manually operated traffic streams.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Traffic congestion needlessly slows the movement of persons and goods, impeding US competitiveness and costing billions of dollars annually. This research studied traffic dynamics underlying freeway congestion (Figure 1) and the findings will allow operating agencies to manage the freeways more efficiently to reduce the costs of congestion without adding lanes. <br /><br />Freeway traffic is difficult to study because there are thousands of vehicles interacting over many miles, with traffic dynamics that need to be measured with an accuracy of inches. This research developed sensing and data mining techniques to achieve the high resolution needed to advance the understanding of traffic dynamics. <br /><br />This new view is like putting on eyeglasses for the first time. Sensing advancements include more accurate data from video cameras along the freeway (Figure 2), and a probe vehicle equipped with advanced sensors (Figure 3) to study the interactions of the surrounding vehicles as it travels with traffic. These two sources provide vehicle paths called "trajectories." Each trajectory contains the details of what the individual vehicle did, allowing for detailed study of how the vehicles interact and influence each other. This work greatly advanced the quality of available trajectory data. Figure 5 compares this work against the existing video based methods. Each boundary line between different colors shows the path taken by a real vehicle and the yellow stripes highlight the same set of vehicles using the old and new techniques. The new techniques eliminated the jagged corners and now the paths accurately follow the vehicles. To get an even larger sample, data mining techniques were developed to extract more information from vehicle detectors commonly used by state DOTs to monitor traffic flow (Figure 4). Using these old detectors in new ways, the sensors were repurposed in this work to study billions of individual vehicles. <br /><br />These advances in sensing were a significant advancement in their own right, but for this project it was just the first step. The higher resolution from the sensing advances allowed the research to see the details of traffic dynamics and develop a deeper understanding of how traffic flows. The research discovered that adjacent lanes interact in ways that were not previously known. For example, it was found that drivers become conservative by taking a larger spacing when traveling faster than adjacent lanes. This finding will improve traffic models and traffic simulation tools, which currently assume adjacent lanes act independently of one another. This work also developed models showing how congestion can form and spread in newly discovered ways. Incorporating these findings in traffic simulation tools will improve traffic forecasting for trip planning, real-time traffic control, and long term urban planning. <br /><br />Particular care was given to vehicles changing lanes. Drivers naturally change lanes depending on where they are going or how fast they feel comfortable traveling, but during the few seconds it takes to change lanes the driver actually uses twice as much freeway than a vehicle staying in one lane. This research developed a more representative model of lane changes (Figure 6). When the freeway is at its limits the small increase in demand from lane changing can be all it takes to tip the traffic into congestion or keep traffic from recovering once congested.<br /><br />Using the new high resolution traffic data this work also found that the most widely used traffic flow models can perform poorly. To understand how, you first have to realize that traffic flowing on a roadway is similar to water flowing in a riverbed. In both cases waves will form. The easiest way to observe traffic waves is when a stop light turns green- the first vehicle moves, then the next, and so forth. The time and location where each vehicle starts moving is actually a wave that moves upstream through the traffic. The same thing happens on a congested freeway when traffic slows or comes to a stop. The traffic waves are commonly modeled using a technique called "kinematic wave theory." Normally this theory assumes the traffic is a pure liquid, like sucking soda through a straw, but this research shows that the traffic will sometimes flow like there are air bubbles in the straw. That might not seem like much, but it is vitally important when you are trying to keep traffic just below the limits of what a freeway can handle (called "capacity flow"). Too much demand at a critical location and the freeway "breaks down" by falling into congestion. These critical locations are called bottlenecks, and an operating agency has to carefully time when to let vehicles enter the freeway long before they reach the bottlenecks. The presence of the "air bubbles" allows the vehicles to travel faster than conventional theory predicts, and so in spite of careful timing to keep demand below capacity the incorrect models can lead to breakdown.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Benjamin&nbsp;A&nbsp;Coifman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1537423/1537423_10379627_1603827651235_Fig5-trajectoryexample--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1537423/1537423_10379627_1603827651235_Fig5-trajectoryexample--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1537423/1537423_10379627_1603827651235_Fig5-trajectoryexample--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 5: Each boundary line between colors shows the path taken by a real vehicle on a freeway.
