<AbstractNarration>Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical:&lt;br/&gt;Implantable devices have a large potential for use as sensors, drug delivery, and medical devices.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, 100 million patients in the U.S. alone can benefit from implantable tissues and systems.  However, current implantable technologies still face central challenges of biocompatibility and facile communication with external devices.  An improved method for building advanced biocompatible implantable devices could greatly advance the development of implantable sensors, drug-delivery devices, and drug-eluting stents and devices.  Hence, the research objective of this proposal is to establish the key elements of a fundamentally new platform for wireless control of implantable devices.  Specifically, the proposal seeks to develop a method for using focused ultrasound to actuate small components inside microdevices made of biocompatible materials.  Ultrasound is already widely used for diagnostic imaging, and our work will seek to leverage this imaging modality to actuate implanted devices.  In addition to research goals, this project contains elements that seek to address other potential benefits for society in education and diversity:&lt;br/&gt;- Undergraduate students: new research opportunities and lab modules on "implantable devices" for undergraduate students at both      &lt;br/&gt;  Columbia University and George Mason&lt;br/&gt;- High-school students: integration of implantable device research into educational modules for New York City high-school students&lt;br/&gt;- Technology transfer: nurturing of undergraduate students interested in commercializing state-of-the-art microdevice research into real-  world devices for society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;In terms of specific research goals, this proposal aims to construct and demonstrate a new paradigm to efficiency control biocompatible microdevices using ultrasound.  Ultrasound is fundamentally attractive because it is non-invasive, can penetrate through millimeters or even centimeters of dense tissue, and uses hardware which can be made compact.  In our design, ultrasound can actuate selective microcomponents in the devices by precise focusing of ultrasonic energy or by employing agents that selectively respond to pre-specified acoustic parameters.  Importantly, ultrasound can impart energy into implants which themselves contain no embedded biotoxic electronics or power supply, unlike most printed electronics.  Despite these attractive qualities, to our knowledge, ultrasound has not been previously used to control implantable microdevices, let alone ones made from biocompatible materials that avoid biofouling. This research proposal is innovative in a number of specific aspects.&lt;br/&gt;- Fabrication of microdevices with components responsive to ultrasound&lt;br/&gt;- Developing and understanding how acoustic parameters interface with microdevice components in deep tissue&lt;br/&gt;- Developing a method to selectively actuate components inside a microdevice</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Major Activities  Preliminary characterization of the fabrication limitations of the hydrogel-MEMS, most notably in terms of device size and feature resolution Analysis of alternative materials for hydrogel-MEMS device, which are as biocompatible as prior demonstrations, and may also be biodegradable  Modelling and experimentation of alternative geometries, particularly to emphasis different release profiles (i.e. a device geometry that facilitates very slow release) Detailed characterization of acoustic parameters (frequency, intensity, etc.) have been performed to identify the parameters space for reliable (thermal) actuation of hydrogel-based MEMS devices without causing collateral thermal damage to adjacent tissues. We have identified an application for this technology that could have significant societal impact. We have developed strategies for implanting our hydrogel-MEMS in the brain and wirelessly actuating local release of chemotherapeutics using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic-resonance imaging. We have developed and submitted an NIH grant application for developing this approach for treating Glioblastoma, which is a very difficult to treat cancer in the brain.   Specific Objectives  Establish the resolution limits when fabricating the hydrogel-MEMS device with the assistance of photomasks, 3D-printed molds, or a combinatory technique Determine a potential correlation between the molecular weight and concentration of the hydrogel selected for fabricating the hydrogel-MEMS device and drug release profiles of small molecules loaded in the device Elucidate the physics of interactions between ultrasound and hydrogel-MEMS Establish optimal ultrasound parameters for thermally actuating and controlling hydrogel-MEMS Develop ultrasound-based wireless temperature monitoring schemes for closed-loop control of hydrogel-MEMS actuation Examine the feasibility of selectively actuating hydrogel compartments within one MEMS device by seeding them with microbubbles or light-absorbing nanoparticles   Significant Results  Demonstrated scaled-down features of the hydrogel-MEMS device, approaching the micro- level Demonstrated controlled actuation of hydrogel-MEMS using focused ultrasound Established the feasibility of delivering therapeutic dosages of drugs using hydrogel-MEMS Demonstrated a wireless method for monitoring temperature by using ultrasound imaging to track temperature-dependent speed of sound in hydrogels and polymers   Key Outcomes or Other Achievements  Wireless implantable devices is an emerging field, and we have written a review to be published in Applied Physics Review on this topic (acknowledging the NSF grant) Identified an application with significant societal impact (brain cancer) and developed a NIH proposal to pursue this avenue of research Technology also serves as a pending proposal to DARPA that has been selected for negotiation            Last Modified: 10/29/2019       Submitted by: Samuel K Sia]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
