<AbstractNarration>The scientific objective of the study is to estimate the input of meteoric material into Earth's upper atmosphere, which is an important process that affects the ionosphere, thermosphere, mesosphere and atmosphere. Determining the meteoric mass distribution is critical for characterizing the mass input into the mesosphere -- including the metal deposition -- which plays a significant role in the local chemical processes. The meteoric mass is then transported to the middle atmosphere, where coupling with the lower atmosphere occurs. The current models for predicting the speed at which this transport occurs are sensitive to small changes in the total flux of mass from meteors -- which is largely unknown over the observable mass range. The PIs approach of using both optical and radar techniques simultaneously will enable an effective cross-calibration of the two techniques for calculating meteor mass, resulting in a significantly more accurate estimate of the total meteor mass input. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, simultaneous optical and radar observations of meteor head echoes are proposed to set constraints on luminosity and ionization efficiencies, respectively, in order to determine meteoroid mass in the 100 microgram to 100 milligram range. Current data sets of common-volume radar and optical observations of meteors from several different radars are be used to address the science goals. Additional campaigns are proposed at specific radar sites, in order to improve and enhance the meteoroid mass and flux estimates based on lessons learned and the limitations of the current data. The main result expected is the production of mass distribution indexes of meteors from the sporadic meteor complex. The use of multiple radars will allow different regions of the sky -- both Southern and Northern -- to be covered and enable the detection of a large range of masses due to the varying sensitivities of the radars. There is a lack of knowledge in several important areas in this whole process and the proposed research will be a valuable tool in solving several issues, such as the formation of noctilucent and polar stratospheric clouds and the presence of meteoric dust. As a result of the review process and careful consideration, this proposal is funded for a period of three years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project enabled unique comparisons between optical and radar observations of meteors.  Through many different observational campaigns at different radar sites, we have acquired a large data set of coincident radar and optical observations, where meteors were detected by both methods.  These two methods provide complimentary information, therefore studying the meteors that are observed simultaneously by both methods allows us to gain insight into the processes occurring in the atmosphere as they burn up as well as properties of the meteoroids themselves, such as mass, composition and planetary origin. Intellectual Merit:Using these data analyses, we found that many of the meteors that are detected by the radars are actually detected by the side lobes--regions of the antenna pattern that are outside the main beam and hence have much reduced gain-- and not by the main beam itself.  We were able to make mass estimates for many of the meteors that were detected by both methods and using the common-volume radar observations, we were able to estimate the smallest mass meteors that would be detectable by the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) and our estimate was significantly larger than what is currently assumed by the radar observing community.  We were also able to make estimates of where many of these meteors were originating from in the sky.  Using the spectral information from some of these meteor observations, we were able to identify the elements that make up very small meteors, which has not really been done before because of the small signal levels involved with these small mass meteors, some of which would not even be visible to the naked eye. Broader Impacts:The broader impacts of this project are some of the most significant contributions of this research.  I have mentored 9 different students over the course of this project.
