<AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for 29th European Conference on Object Oriented Programming (ECOOP) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to the 29th European Conference on Object Oriented Programming (ECOOP). The conference will be held in Prague, Czech Republic, in July 2015. ECOOP is the premier conference in object-oriented programming languages and software engineering. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The award prioritizes broad student participation, paying special attention to the selection of women and underrepresented minorities. Thus the broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in the area of object oriented programming and software engineering, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. Apart from the conference itself, several satellite workshops feature lectures from an impressive array of experts. Thus students have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies and novel techniques, and to interact with senior researchers who are leading researchers in their areas of expertise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported students from American universities at the graduate level, covering the cost of their participation to the European Conference on Object Oriented Programming.  This is the permier conference in the field and a venue where over four hundred and fifty experts meet every year to report on the latest developments in academic and industrial research.  There were talks by distinguished researchers such as Bjarne Stroustrup who created the C++ programming language and Brendan Eich who designed the JavaScript language widely used in web programming.  The ECOOP 2015 conference was held in Prague July 6-10th together with a new conference intended to bring academia and industry closer called Curry On. Some statistics about ECOOP/CurryOn will help provide context. This year we had a record attendance with 451 participants from 40 different countries (22% came from the USA).  For the first time we had 29% developers and 22% students. These numbers attest to the continuing appeal of ECOOP for early researchers and the attraction of Curry On for practitioners.   Awards were selected by a committee composed of Jan Vitek (Northeastern), Heather Miller (EPFL), and Pavel Kordik (Czech Technical University). We received 15 applications and funded 10. The students were selected on their fit to the conference with preference to students of minority background or from schools or research groups who did not have ample funding. The students were awarded full ECOOP+Curry On registration (six days of attendance, lunches and a banquet for socializing); the studentÃ†s housing costs were covered in the CVUT dormitories; part of the travel costs were covered by the grant (up to $1200).  Some quotes from students are attached:  "I am looking forward to the ECOOP'15 conference because a project that I am working on will be presented at an ECOOP workshop, and I am eager to receive feedback from the ECOOP community. Furthermore, I am excited about meeting old friends and acquaintances and making new ones and getting to know the latest research progress."  "At ECOOP I expect to learn, and grow and talk and meet all the researchers whose publications I have enjoyed reading. And many more yet unknown to me. Thanks NSF for the support."  "From the looks of the diverse tracks and multitude of sessions included in ECOOP, it will be a busy week.
