<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the field of algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics studying the geometric structure of solutions of polynomial equations. Many of the questions under study in this project are motivated by string theory, a branch of theoretical physics connected with the structure of elementary particles. This project aims to significantly enhance the intensive and fruitful interaction between cutting edge research in enumerative algebraic geometry and theoretical physics. The research aims to extend mathematical developments that verify and generalize conjectures originating from physics, and the work is expected to significantly impact development of the physical theory as well. Through conferences, a summer school, seminars, and research involvement, this project provides unique opportunities for a new generation of mathematicians to obtain the interdisciplinary knowledge and skills needed to work in this exciting research area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the project is to study enumerative invariants in the broad sense and their dependence on various stability conditions, as well as dualities relating different enumerative invariants. The investigators plan to further develop the theory of Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSM) and will study the epsilon-wall-crossing conjecture and zeta-wall-crossing conjecture at all genera; Gromov-Witten (GW) and quasimap invariants are related by a sequence of epsilon-wall-crossing, whereas the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence (relating GW invariants and FJRW invariants) and Pfaffian/Grassmannian correspondence are examples of zeta-wall-crossing. The investigators are developing the theory of Mixed-Spin-P (MSP) fields, to interpolate GW theory of quintic threefolds and FJRW theory of Fermat quintic polynomials, and to study algebraic structures of higher genus GW and FJRW invariants. The new theories of GLSM and MSP fields will provide new tools to attack the central and longstanding problem of computing higher genus GW invariants of compact Calabi-Yau threefolds. The investigators have been investigating K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of threefolds, as well as GW and quasimap invariants of Nakajima quiver varieties. Because some of conjectures motivated by theoretical physics can only be properly formulated in terms of K-theoretic enumerative invariants, they plan to study dualities relating K-theoretic enumerative invariants of different geometries, and to lift results on traditional enumerative invariants to the K-theoretic setting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was focused on the subject of enumerative geometry, which involves finding, counting, or describing solutions of systems of equations in many variables.  This subject is closely tied to theoretical physics, which has motivated much of the progress in enumerative geometry over the past several decades.  Almost 30 years ago, E. Witten described a physical construction of something he called the gauged linear sigma model (GLSM), which provided a partial explanation for some surprising connections among various areas of enumerative geometry.  Two of the most prominent of these surprising connections are mirror symmetry and the Landau-Ginsburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence.  Witten's construction had a big impact in physics, but our work provides the first mathematical theory of the GLSM.  This mathematical construction of the GLSM has already enabled others to prove significant results about mirror symmetry and the Landau-Ginsburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence and we expect much more progress arising from the GLSM in the near future.    The broader impacts of the project include the training of graduate students, postdocs, and other resesarchers. As part of this project we held a summer school in 2018 to help graduate students, postdoctoral reserachers and others to learn more about the GLSM, mirror symmetry, and related topics.  Leading researchers in the field gave series of expository lectures at the summer school, and we have collected and published notes from those lectures to make them available to a wider audience.  Finally, as part of this project my students and I have developed new algorithms and methods for computing real solutions of multivariate systems of equations in low dimensions (ten or less).  Solving systems of equations is essential for many problems in mathematics, economics, physics, and engineering, and one of its most important applications is in global optimization.  We have implemented these algorithms in an open-source Python package that outperforms its main competitors on many tests.  We hope and expect that these algorithms and this package will have significant broader impacts by providing useful tools to many people needing multivariate solvers, especially those needing to solve low-dimensional optimization problems.
