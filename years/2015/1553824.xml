<AbstractNarration>There are a number of areas of Antarctic research by scientists from the United States where rebreather technology (which unlike normal SCUBA diving releases few if any air bubbles) would be valuable tools. These include but are not limited to behavioral studies (because noise from bubbles released by standard SCUBA alters the behavior of many marine organisms), studies of communities on the underside of sea ice (because the bubbles disrupt the communities while or before they are sampled), and studies of highly stratified lake communities (because the bubbles cause mixing and because lighter line could be used to tether a diver to the surface which would probably also cause less water column disruption). The latter scientific advantage of less mixing in highly stratified (not naturally mixed) lakes is also a significant environmental advantage of rebreathers. However, for safety reasons, no US science projects will be approved for the use of rebreathers until they are tested by the US Antarctic Program (USAP).  This award provides funds for the USAP Scientific Diving Officer to conduct such tests in conjunction with other diving professionals experienced in polar diving in general and specifically with rebreather technology in non-polar environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of six scientific diving professionals will evaluate seven or more commercial rebreather models that are being most commonly used in non-polar scientific diving. This will be done through holes drilled or melted in sea ice at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. A limited number of test dives of the best performing models will subsequently be made in stratified lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys.</AbstractNarration>

This radically different research approach would facilitate several avenues of Antarctic research, including, but not limited to: 1) behavioral studies, 2) studies of sea ice bottom communities, where bubbles from open circuit scuba can disrupt the platelet ice community, 3) studies of highly stratified lake communities, and 4) studies that require greater depths and/or longer exposures.</p> <p>During October to November 2016 we&nbsp;performed 116 rebreather dives using seven CCR models.

Using small temperature sensors we measured the temperature in various parts of the breathing loop. Major findings include: scrubber canister temperatures remained near ambient temperature throughout the dives, the breathing gas was only slightly higher than ambient temperature, and rebreathers must be kept warm prior to diving. Moisture in the breathing loop promotes freezing of the automatic diluent valve or dive surface valve, and mushroom valves. Only three unit failures occurred which required bailout to the surface.&nbsp; One other unit had significant electronic issues.
