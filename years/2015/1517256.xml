<AbstractNarration>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for Award no. 1517256 (MCB-SSB)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and test predictive mathematical models of the chemical reactions (metabolism) by which maize (corn) transforms the sugars produced during photosynthesis into compounds such as starch that are stored in the seeds. The goal is to understand starch metabolism better and provide the means for enhancing food production. This study will reveal fundamental principles of metabolic function and dynamics, and provide interdisciplinary training (in mathematical modeling, genetic engineering and metabolic biochemistry) to students engaged in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starchy endosperm (SE) is the major site of carbohydrate and protein storage in cereals, but atypical constraints complicate detailed resolution of the system. These include a steady state oxygen level of essentially zero, coincident with energy-expensive breakdown and re-synthesis of building blocks prior to storage polymer formation. A major question in SE metabolism is how ATP is generated to support starch and protein synthesis, and how the photo-assimilate is divided between catabolic and anabolic pathways. This project will expand upon existing flux models to account for bio-energetic parameters, and probe the system by directed genetic modifications that impair specific metabolic nodes. Metabolite levels and flux maps will be compared between SE from unaltered and mutant lines. These data will be applied to refine the mathematical models and test hypotheses of how the system diverts chemical resources for storage compound accumulation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to define the biochemical processes by which maize seeds obtain the chemical energy used for production of the massive amounts of starch and storage proteins that accumulate during the relatively short period of their growth and development.  The question is of interest because the oxygen concentration within the endosperm component of maize seeds is near zero, and how sufficient chemical energy can be obtained without oxidative metabolism is not clear.  Understanding these processes will provide fundamental knowledge required for future efforts in maize breeding and genetic engineering towards improved utility and profitability, including continued yield increase, improved nutritional quality of maize grain, and maintenance of yield in challenging environments including high growth temperatures.  Two specific hypotheses were tested.  One hypothesis posits that fermentative metabolism is able to provide all the required chemical energy for starch and storage protein accumulation, and accordingly that the higher yielding oxidative pathways are not required.  To test this idea, genetic engineering was employed to reduce or eliminate a specific step in the citric acid cycle, which normally is required for utilization of oxygen in the chemical energy production pathways.  If kernels could produce normal amounts of starch and protein even when the citric acid cycle was reduced in activity or entirely blocked, then fermentation would be identified as entirely sufficient to produce the necessary amounts of chemical energy.  Alternatively, if the citric acid cycle block caused reduced kernel mass, then some aspects of oxidative metabolism would be identified as necessary to generate the chemical energy normally used by this tissue.  The project was successful in blocking the citric acid cycle, as shown by coordinated changes in the levels of intermediates within the pathway.  Kernel mass was strongly affected.  This suggests that fermentation cannot be entirely responsible for chemical energy production in developing maize seeds.  Further work is necessary in order to definitively support this conclusion, because the alternative explanation that a secondary effect of the citric acid cycle block, other than chemical energy production, is responsible for the seed development defect has not been ruled out.  The other hypothesis tested in the project posits that modifications from the canonical fermentative process of glycolysis are needed to generate sufficient amounts of chemical energy for normal starch and storage protein accumulation.  This idea is suggested by knowledge that other low oxygen plant and microbial systems exhibit markedly elevated levels of two enzymes that adjust glycolysis so as to increase the yield of chemical energy obtained from each starting molecule of glucose.  One such system is flooded plant roots, which contain high levels of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK).  PPDK is also very abundant in developing maize grain, suggesting that similar modifications of glycolysis are needed for energy production.  To test this hypothesis, classical genetics and genetic engineering methods were applied to eliminate PPDK from developing maize grain.  Kernels modified in this way were normal in total mass and also normal in starch and storage protein content.  This demonstrated that PPDK is not in fact required for sufficient chemical energy production in maize kernels.  Rather, PPDK was identified as a regulatory factor that appears to adjust the relative rates of starch and protein accumulation.  This knowledge has implications in maintenance of grain quality, because the normal balance between starch and storage protein is required for kernels to attain the hard outer layer within endosperm that is needed for optimal grain quality.  Adjusting PPDK function can thus be pursued to improve grain quality when desirable nutritional traits are linked to changes in kernel hardness, which is common.
