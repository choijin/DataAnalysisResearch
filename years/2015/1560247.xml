<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site from the University of Minnesota will support a diverse cohort of undergraduate students to pursue research in the interdisciplinary field of neural systems engineering.  This program will highlight recent developments in neurotechnology for basic science research and healthcare. It is estimated that 100 million U.S. citizens will have a significant brain-related disorder in their lifetime.  There is a need to train scientists and engineers who will research and understand the process for translating neural systems engineering research into human applications. This site will focus on recruiting a diverse group of students with an emphasis on recruiting women, underrepresented minorities, and undergraduates from colleges where opportunities to pursue STEM-based research are opportunities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a three year period, this REU program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive, summer research experience aimed at further developing neurotechnology for brain imaging, decoding and modulation.  Projects will focus on developing technology, running simulations or data analysis.  Many of the projects will integrate multiple modalities of neurotechnology, such as multi-modal imaging, brain-computer interfaces and closed-loop neuromodulation.  Students will have opportunities to investigate neuronal dynamics, plasticity, learning and attention as feedback metrics to optimize neurotechnologies.  Research projects will provide opportunities for REU students to learn about large scale data analysis, computational modeling of the brain, and participate in experiments. The program will have group building projects to develop a cohesion between the students within the program and with their graduate student mentors to create lasting friendships and collaborations. The program will emphasize near-peer mentoring where the REU students will be directly mentored students in their second and third year of graduate school, and in turn will be offered the opportunity to meet and educate high school students about neural engineering.  To broaden their perspective, students will participate in a bi-weekly neuroengineering seminar series hosted in conjunction with a NSF IGERT program and the Center for Neuroengineering.  Multiple mechanisms will help guide students in their professional development and prepare them for graduate school.  To develop communication skills, students will participate in outreach programs and present their research in a small forum at the end of the program.</AbstractNarration>
