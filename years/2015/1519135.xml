<AbstractNarration>Mechanism design aims to make the best decisions when the necessary data is in the hands of selfish players with different motives and incentives.  A mechanism specifies what each player may report and a way to select the outcome from the players' reports.  Although mechanism design was originally developed to study auctions in the field of finance, interest in mechanism design arose from its potential in the design of protocols for large distributed heterogeneous systems where the preferences of people and organizations influenced the outcome of the protocol.  The proper and computationally efficient working of such systems does not solely rely on fast algorithms and cryptographically secure protocols but also on a correct incentive analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates more general models of mechanism design. The players are assumed to be uncertain of their own true valuations, knowing only a set of candidate valuations.  The notion of utility by a player may also be broadened.  A player may maximize their utility while using regret minimization to refine their set of non-dominated strategies if needed.  A player may seek to decrease their uncertainty and sharpen their understanding about their own utility by investing in the means to increase their knowledge about their own valuations before acting in a mechanism.  These extensions will allow more robust and realistic mechanism design of cryptographic protocols.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To analyze mechanisms in a credible way, one needs realistic player models.  One fundamental aspect, neglected so far, is the amount of computational cost that a player incurs in order to figure out what his own type and his preferences really are.  We have developed such models and analyzed several concrete mechanisms in this new light.     Nobody knows perfectly well what he/she wants. One's initial self knowledge is typically coarse, but can be refined. This refinement causes a player to incur an individual cost. The player's behavior is thus influenced by the cost that he/she must incur to continue playing in a rational manner.    In a single good auction this cost aspires to be a single number, but the player at most knows an interval in which his own number lies. Reducing the size of the interval is a meaningful way to model self-knowledge refinement. This is the model we have adopted to analyze some simple mechanisms in more realistic ways.    In light of this set-theoretic uncertainty, a player cannot be expected to be a pure utility maximizer. The most reasonable solution concept to adopt is therefore regret minimization. We have shown that basic mechanisms can indeed be analyzed under this solution concept and indeed return  very high social welfare.
