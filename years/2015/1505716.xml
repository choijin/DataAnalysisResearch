<AbstractNarration>It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is directed at the study of the quark structure of nucleons and nuclei. Research will be carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory as part of a collaboration called STAR. This collaboration is focused on the scattering of high energy polarized protons from nuclei with the goal of understanding the structure of the proton. The proposed research will use the forward electromagnetic calorimeter, called FMS, which is part of the STAR detector system to measure neutral particles that are produced at small scattering angles.  The measured rates of such particle production have been found to depend strongly on the direction of polarization of the proton beam, an effect that has confounded attempts at a theoretical understanding based on the fundamental theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  Further studies of this particles detected using the FMS will guide future theoretical develpments and help us to understand more about the quark and gluon structure of nucleons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal supports the Penn State group to operate the FMS detector in the STAR experiment for polarized proton RHIC runs and to analyze data from those runs. The STAR FMS is an electromagnetic calorimeter that detects collision fragments produced in the forward pseudo-rapidity region. Particles observed in this region are associated with the interactions of the most energetic and most polarized quarks. For transversely polarized protons, the large dependence of the cross section on the sign of polarization is a long-standing mystery.  While the QCD Lagrangian is known, our ability to use it to predict observables is still limited. In contrast to the electromagnetic force, where the role of spin constituents of an atom is fairly well understood, the role of spin among the partons (constituents of a bound state proton) remains near our knowledge frontier. The most useful model for scattering by the QCD force is perturbative QCD, or pQCD, which is applicable when the collisions between protons constituents exchange large momentum. The goal of this research is to determine experimentally where pQCD applies and how to modify models to extend applicability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was part of a continuing support from the NSF to fund Penn State participation in the STAR collaboration at the Brookhaven RHIC collider with emphasis in the polarized proton program. Penn State has been a founding leader of the polarized proton program at RHIC over a 25 year period, playing a pivotal role in the earliest planning stages leading to a RHIC collider with the capability to store and collide high energy polarized protons. The ability to study collisions of high energy polarized protons made the RHIC collider unique in the world.   More specifically, this grant funded Penn State to develop an intense, water cooled,  UV led array to be used in RHIC Run 17, in year 2017. This light source was inserted within the STAR FMS forward calorimeter and was used routinely during RHIC Run 17 to repair radiation damage in the FMS.  The FMS calorimeter is the forward detector of STAR that can detect and measure the momentum of forward photons, electrons and positrons produced in the collisions of polarized protons. In this forward region, these detected particles are sensitive to the higher momentum quarks and gluons in the proton, which are known to carry a large fraction of the proton spin or angular momentum.    In 2017, STAR requested and obtained a special extended polarized proton run with transversely polarized protons to  observe the transverse single spin asymmetry in Drell-Yan processes (production of electron-positron pairs). The essential point is to compare the sign of this asymmetry to the corresponding asymmetry observed in Deep Inelastic electron scattering experiments. A difference in sign of these asymmetries is recognized as an essential prediction of QCD based models. With the successful use of the UV device developed at Penn State, a high quality data set has been obtained from a successful RHIC Run 17.    Analysis of other RHIC polarized proton runs from 2011 to 2015 have continued at Penn State with the support of this award.  Taken as a whole, the measurements that we have made at polarized RHIC over the last 10 years, and that we are continuing to analyze, are the fruits of a long successful program enabled by the unique RHIC collider.  The ultimate result will be an improved understanding of the essential role of quark and gluon spins in the nature and interactions of protons. These experimental results guide the theoretical models that are proposed as implementations of the widely accepted QCD theory of the strong interaction.
