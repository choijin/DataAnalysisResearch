<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help cover the travel expenses of participants from the U.S. in the "Workshop on partial differential equations and several complex variables" that will be held August 3 - 7, 2015, in Serra Negra, Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on recent developments in closely related areas of analysis and geometry, namely, several complex variables, overdetermined systems of partial differential equations, and CR geometry. Two mini-courses designed for graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s will form an important part of the workshop. The first mini-course will be taught by Mei-Chi Shaw who will lecture on Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex manifolds. The second mini-course will be on semi global solvability of complex vector fields and it will be taught by Abdelhamid Meziani. The workshop will provide opportunities for graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s to present and discuss their research results.</AbstractNarration>
