<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the 18th International Conference on Recent Progress in Many-Body Theory. The conference brings together researchers from diverse fields within the discipline of quantum many-body theory, which is a key component of modern theoretical physics. The conference facilitates the exchange of methodological knowledge and ideas between otherwise distant fields by disseminating recent advances that are of common interest; it also highlights the emergence of new fields. NSF support will enable the participation of young investigators and underrepresented minorities who otherwise might not be able to participate, and will also be available for students and young postdocs who wish to participate in lectures and tutorials planned for the intervening day between the two conferences. The conference provides an important educational experience and a networking opportunity for students and young postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the 18th International Conference on Recent Progress in Many-Body Theory. This conference will be held back-to-back with the 2015 Symposium on Quantum Fluids and Solids at Niagara Falls on August 16-21, 2015. The conference brings together researchers from diverse fields within the discipline of quantum many-body theory. The conference facilitates the exchange of methodological knowledge and ideas between otherwise distant fields by disseminating recent advances that are of common interest; it also highlights the emergence of new fields. Topics covered include: many-body problems in quantum fluids, nuclear physics, correlated electron physics, relativistic many-body theory, cold gases, and new techniques. The invited speakers include recognized international experts. The conference's relatively small size offers the benefit of closer and more effective interactions among the participants. NSF support will enable the participation of young investigators and underrepresented minorities who otherwise might not be able to participate, and will also be available for students and young postdocs who wish to participate in lectures and tutorials planned for the intervening day between the two conferences. The conference provides an important educational experience and a networking opportunity for students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 18th International Conference on Recent Progress in Many-Body Theories (MBT 18) was held at the Niagara Falls Convention Center Aug. 16-21, 2015. This conference is held biannually; it is historically interdisciplinary and tries to attract scientists from condensed matter theory, quantum fluids, nuclear physics and -- more recently -- also cold gases.  MBT 18 attracted about 80 registered participants coming from 18 different countries around the world with by far the strongest contingent (25) from the U.S.. The conference was funded, apart from registration fees, by the US National Science Foundation and internal support from the Physics Department, the Vice President for Research, and funds awarded to Prof. Krotscheck.  The combination of these funds allowed support for junior and under-privileged researchers in the amount of approximately 25,000 $.  The scientific program of the conference and all abstracts can be seen at the conference website http://www.physics.buffalo.edu/MBT18/index.html.  There were 50 invited talks, (7 by women) and about 30 posters. The posters were accessible during the whole week.  The international advisory committee consists of 20 members, 3 of which are women; this committee was embedded in a larger program committee of international scientists, 30 of which made useful suggestions.  The conference was held back to back with the International Symposium on Quantum Fluids and Solids 2015 (QFS2015).  The proceedings were published in the Vol 702 of Journal of Physics: Conference Series.  A new and very successful feature were two tutorial days before the conference, during which young scientist, participants from developing countries and under-represented minorities had the chance to be brought to a scientific level where they could profit from the conference.  The tutorial days were attended by 50 and 40 participants, respectively.  The lecture notes have been made accessible at the conference website.
