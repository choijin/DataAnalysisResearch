<AbstractNarration>Ph.D. candidate Alex Elvis Badillo of Indiana University will document long-term changes in the ways humans modify and use land in the mountainous rural region of Quiechapa, Oaxaca, Mexico. The major goal of the research is to determine how political and economic transformations and conflict in neighboring urban areas affected rural land-use in southern Oaxaca and to determine which land-use strategies proved most effective during times of large-scale change. While political unrest in complex urban areas often has visible and measurable effects on local demography, food security, and land-use, one should also expect that rural hinterlands experience change. This is true in both the past and the present. As a result of this research, Badillo will determine the kinds of decisions people made regarding agriculture, settlement, and land-use in rural areas when confronted with large-scale sociopolitical shifts. Quiechapa, which lies equidistant from two important stopping points on routes of Postclassic trade and conquest, is a prime location to study the effects of wider political unrest on rural regions. Rural land-use data collected in Quiechapa will complement over 40 years of regional survey research in Oaxaca in providing a broader context within which to analyze urban/rural land-use dynamics. Archaeology is uniquely qualified to contribute data pertaining to land-use change over the long term, which is vital to understanding the historical trajectories that have led to current global situations. This archaeological study will advance theoretical understandings about rural land-use change and its relationship to demography, economy, technology, politics, and the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand how broader sociopolitical and economic changes in southern Oaxaca affected land-use in Quiechapa, Badillo will address the following questions: (1) Where and when did anthropogenic land modification occur?; (2) In what ways did the people of Quiechapa modify their landscape?; (3) How were the people living in Quiechapa connected to the broader interregional politics and exchange networks? Data will be collected through a regional pedestrian settlement survey in which the survey team will walk the 168 square kilometers study region recording all evidence of land-use and settlement using a high precision global positioning system (GPS).  Observational data and surface artifact sample locations associated with evidence of land-use will be organized into the common platform of a geographic information system (GIS) database for analysis. Surface artifacts and data on land-use modifications such as terracing, water management features, and residential architecture, in combination with other environmental datasets, will allow Badillo to detect changes in land-use and settlement from the Classic (A.D. 200 - 800) to the Postclassic Period (A.D. 800 - 1521).  Badillo will involve citizens of Quiechapa in the research of their own history and heritage, while also teaching scientific principles through the practice of archaeology. Moreover, information about how Quiechapa's local landscape has been modified and used in the past will be collected in collaboration with local land authorities and will be used in current agricultural intensification efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An archaeological survey team led by Alex Elvis Badillo, a Ph.D. candidate at Indiana University, systematically surveyed a 99 km2 area in the municipality of San Pedro M&aacute;rtir Quiechapa, Oaxaca, Mexico.  The survey took place from January to May 2016.  The major goal of the research is to determine how political and economic transformations and conflict in neighboring urban areas affected rural land-use in southern Oaxaca from the Classic (A.D. 200 &ndash; 800) to the Postclassic period (A.D. 800 &ndash; 1521). While political unrest in complex urban areas often has visible and measurable effects on local demography, food security, and land-use, we should also expect that rural hinterlands experience change as well. Quiechapa, which lies equidistant from two important stopping points on routes of Postclassic trade and conquest, is a prime location to study the effects of wider political unrest on rural regions. The primary objective in the field was to document long-term changes in the ways humans modify and use land in the mountainous rural region. The survey team mapped and recorded all evidence of land-use and settlement using a high precision global positioning system (GPS).  The survey team also made systematic samples of surface artifacts associated with evidence of land-use. Geospatial data, observational data, and surface artifact sample locations were organized into a geographic information system (GIS) database for analysis. Surface artifacts and data on land-use modifications such as terracing, water management features, and residential architecture, in combination with other environmental datasets, have allowed Badillo to detect changes in land-use and settlement patterns from the Classic to the Postclassic period.  During the project Badillo worked closely with Quiechapa?s local community to involve them in the archaeological investigation of their own history and heritage, while also teaching scientific principles through the practice of archaeology.  Local presentations were made to periodically to inform the local community of the project?s progress and discoveries.  Successes from this project have help Badillo make contacts in a nearby region who are excited at the possibility of future collaboration and archaeological research in their own town.  Rural land-use data collected in Quiechapa complements over 40 years of regional survey research in Oaxaca by providing a broader context within which to analyze urban/rural land-use dynamics.  At the end of the field season 91 sites were documented and registered.  The geospatial and material evidence together suggest a settlement history dating back to the Late Formative period (100 B.C. &ndash; A.D. 200) in Quiechapa.  Settlement patterns in the region of Quiechapa indicate a shift in settlement from lower to higher elevations through time.  Late Formative and Classic period sites were generally located at lower elevations clustering around arable land and water resources while Postclassic period sites are located at higher elevations.  Overall distribution of sites concentrated around two modest ceremonial centers.  Obsidian surface collections also spatially correlate with this pattern of site distribution.  Between the two large concentrations of prehispanic architecture and archaeological materials, there is a 5 km2 area of land that has no archaeological evidence of land-use.  Lastly, ceramic artifacts demonstrate stylistic similarities with large urban settlements within the Valley of Oaxaca indicating a connection to broader networks of communication and/or commerce, however, the nature of the connection is still under investigation.  The material evidence of land-use change agrees with written accounts of Postclassic period conflict and trade in nearby regions and suggests that decisions about settlement and land-use in Quiechapa were affected by broader sociopolitical shifts.  It is Badillo?s plan to continue to conduct archaeological research in Quiechapa in the years to come in order to more fully understand the motivations behind land-use shifts in this part of southern Mexico.  Archaeology is uniquely qualified to contribute data pertaining to land-use change over the long term, which is vital to understanding the historical trajectories that have led to current global sustainability issues.  While the interpretation of the data is still in its preliminary stages, the results of this research have already begun to advance theoretical understandings about rural land-use change and its relationship to demography, economy, politics, and the environment.
