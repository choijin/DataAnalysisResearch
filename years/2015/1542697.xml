<AbstractNarration>This research-- a collaborative effort between scientists from the University of Michigan, Johns Hopkins University, the University of California San Diego Scripps Institute of Oceanography, and the University of Minnesota Duluth--  will reconstruct annual rainfall in Southern California during targeted climate intervals over the last 750,000 years. Using existing cores from the Santa Barbara Basin-- a system that receives sediment-laden river discharge following rainfall events, with minimal subsequent bioturbation-- the project will employ scanning X-ray fluorescence to detect siliciclastic material as a proxy for river runoff. Pollen in sediments will be analyzed to further verify wet vs. dry climate conditions. The frequency of multi-year droughts and floods will be determined for key climate intervals, capturing interannual (El Ni√±o-Southern Ocean) and decadal (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) climate modes. Results will be used to assess the response of these climate modes to forcings such as changing CO2 concentrations and variations in orbital cycles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will extend the regional climate record well beyond the time period covered by instrumental data, improving our capacity to understand and predict future hydrologic and climate changes. Graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the research, including meeting with collaborators, presenting at national meetings, and publishing papers. The web-based platform Earthguide will host educational materials based on this project for use in primary and secondary school curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview   Extreme weather in southern California comprises drought and heavy rainfall, both of which have adverse impacts on society. The recurrent droughts have associations with inter-annual to decadal coupled-ocean-atmosphere climate modes, such as the El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Prehistoric droughts appear to have been longer and more severe than those documented by instrumental records, which are limited to 1850 AD to present.

This is a report of outcomes involving JHU and GMU.    Pre-instrumental precipitation of southern California was reconstructed for the past 200 years, 2000 years, 9000 years and select intervals from 422 to 430 thousand years ago (Termination V deglaciation) from the laminated sediments of SBB. In southern California, each year has a rainy season, during which terrestrial sediment is delivered to the basin, and a dry season, during which marine organic-rich sediment accumulates in the basin; the outcome is a mm-laminated couplet comprised of these two sediment types. In wet years river sediment delivery to the basin is high, and in dry years, river sediment delivery to the basin is low; this is reflected in lamina thickness and composition. Cored SBB sediment sequences were scanned at sub-mm resolution for the sub-seasonal concentration of specific elements in sediment mineralogy for compilation of a river runoff proxy and hydroclimate (paleoprecipitation) record for southern California.  Key Results   Comparison of the SBB hydroclimate record with the 19th to 20th century instrumental record of precipitation in southern California shows a remarkable correspondence from year to year, including high-rainfall and historical accounts of flooding events reflected in cm-thick layers (indicative of sudden high sediment delivery).  For the past 2000 years, the SBB hydroclimate record is significantly correlated with the tree ring-based Palmer Drought Index record for southern California and shows high coherence and time-variable phasing at a multi-decadal scale with a drought record based on speleothem d18O from Belize, Central America. These joint correlations are interpreted as evidence for changes in the location and strength of the North Pacific Jet (NPJ), and changes in the annual geographic range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. When the Northern Hemisphere warms and the ITCZ shifts northward, the NPJ moves away from Southern California and increasing the probability of drought. When the Northern Hemisphere cools and the ITCZ shifts southward, the NPJ moves closer to the region, steering storms and atmospheric rivers toward Southern California and increasing the probability of flooding.  For the past 9,000 years, the SBB hydroclimate record indicates that more frequent floods coincide with wet intervals identified in southern Californian lake records, 400?800, 3000?5500, 6600?7300 and 8500?9000 years ago. Inter-annual hydroclimate variability was generally low prior to 5000 years ago, except at 6100-6600 and 8500-8900 years ago. Inter-annual variability intensity increased after 4500 years ago, accompanied by a shift to 5-7 year (ENSO-band) variablility, while 2-3 year, low-amplitude (ENSO-band) variability characterized SBB hydroclimate prior to 5000 years ago.  For the Termination V (422-430 thousand years ago) SBB hydroclimate record, these same features occur with some notable differences, e.g., extended intervals with low to no ENSO-band inter-annual variability during times of prolonged drought.  Significance   The project has provided unprecedented empirical information on the frequency and magnitude of droughts and floods and year-to-year hydroclimate variability in southern California for the past 9000 years continuously, and for briefer (400 to 1600 year-long) intervals during a pronounced glacial-to-interglacial transition 430 to 422 thousand years ago. Unique annually resolved records constructed from SBB sedimentary sequences provide knowledge of inter-annual climate variability that extends many thousands of years before the earliest instrumental records, tree rings and corals. These data benefit society by providing a detailed validation database for climate modelers, and for drought and flood prediction for policy and planning.
