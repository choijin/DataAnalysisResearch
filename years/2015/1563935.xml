<AbstractNarration>Computer systems increasingly perform operations on critical and confidential data. Despite best efforts to protect this information, the side effects of computations using this data, e.g., the computation time, the power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, thermal emanations, and acoustics, can be used to decipher secret information even when it is encrypted.  Power analysis attacks are particularly powerful and have been shown time and again to be able to quickly and reliably extract the most critical information from otherwise secure devices including smart cards, RFIDs, microcontrollers, microprocessors, and other computing hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing inspiration from the human body, the proposed research will develop new techniques to mitigate power analysis attacks through a technique called computational blinking. An average person blinks 15-20 times per minute; in fact our eyes are closed around 10% of our waking hours due to blinking. With each and every blink, sections of our brain are momentarily "powered off," yet we are rarely even aware of these near continuous interruptions. Our techniques replicate this same, seemingly imperceivable interleaving of "connected" and "disconnected" states in a computer system through the dynamic reconfiguration of the electrical network powering a device. During a computational blink, a portion of the processor is momentarily electrically disconnected from the rest of the system making it more difficult to modify or examine the side effects (e.g., power consumption) of that computation.  Our innovative circuits, architectures, run-time systems, programming frameworks, design tools, and measurement methodologies make these intermittent disconnections just as imperceivable in computing systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Hackers are incredibly clever and have figured out ways to use the amount of energy a computer uses over time to break into them.  These types of attacks are an important threat to consider when trying to build a secure system (e.g. for a smart card or embedded system) but are very difficult to thwart.  Information from deep inside the computer processor shows up as minute variations in the power the processor draw allowing attackers to essentially "see" individual bits of computation as it flows through the machine.   This project developed fundamentally new techniques for addressing this threat with the goal of enabling more secure computer systems to be created and maintained.  The concept developed is that of "computational blinking" - an isolation technique for safe and secure computation. The concept is motivated by the fact that an average person spends about 7% of their waking hours with their eyes closed due to blinking. Yet, we are rarely even aware of these near continuous interruptions. Computational blinking is a set of techniques that allows for the computer processing elements to be electrically disconnected and reconnected for microseconds at a time for safety or security. While it seems like an extraordinarily brief amount of time to be disconnected, the investigators show that critical computations can be performed free from the prying eyes of attackers and yet are short enough to not interfere with normal operation. During a "computational blink", a portion of the processor is momentarily isolated from the rest of the system making it more difficult to modify. In humans, the illusion of the lack of interruption while one blinks actually takes subconscious planning; for example, humans have been shown to blink at natural breakpoints to help retain the most useful information. Realizing the same smooth operation in the machine without significant overhead required innovation in the circuits, architecture, run-time systems, programming framework, design tools, and measurement methodologies.  The resulting computational blink methodology establishes, for the first time, the possibilities of new circuit structures to co-store energy and memory presenting a novel architectural trade-off, new architectures built to complete operations under exceedingly tight time constraints, interconnect designs to manage the burstiness inherent in disconnected operation, scheduling techniques to manage the dynamic and well-formed trade-offs between performance and information leakage, and novel design and analysis tools.  The investigators have demonstrated this new approach both in theory and in practice and their collaborative efforts have been highlighted in some of the most important scientific conferences and journals.  Even better, the work has inspired other related approaches to processor security protection including quantitative efforts to measure security properties of designs directly.
