<AbstractNarration>While data analytics for business and entertainment have become well established, the application of data analytics to education needs research and development. Educational innovation does not have the driving force of economics generating evolutionary responses to societal and technological change, yet data-informed instructional methods offer tremendous promise for transforming American teaching, learning, and schooling. Beyond the potential to enhance student outcomes through just-in-time, diagnostic data that is formative for learning and instruction, educational improvements could be substantially accelerated through data-intensive research fostering rapid cycles of innovation. This award is for a workshop bringing together education researchers from industry, non-profits, academe, and government to address issues in data intensive research ranging from learning analytics to ethics and privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop, the second in a series of two, will focus on applying heuristics from the sciences and engineering to articulate in education the conditions for success and models for effective partnerships in data intensive research. Following the workshop, the results will be published in a formal volume based on the workshop outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The application of data analytics to education needs additional research and development. Educational innovation does not have the driving force of economics generating evolutionary responses to societal and technological change, yet data-informed instructional methods offer tremendous promise for transforming American teaching, learning, and schooling. Beyond the potential to enhance student outcomes through just-in-time, diagnostic data that is formative for learning and instruction, educational improvements could be substantially accelerated through data-intensive research fostering rapid cycles of innovation through processes such as "learning engineering."     Yet, in contrast to the sciences and engineering, educators lack a sophisticated understanding of how best to generate and use big data and data analytics. As one example, educators need more insight into how data can be used and, therefore, what data to collect; the problem space is too large to simply gather all available data and attempt to mine it for generalizable insights. Further, in collecting and analyzing data, issues of privacy, safety, and security pose challenges not found in the scientific disciplines.     This workshop, the second in a series of two, focused on applying heuristics from the sciences and engineering to articulate in education the conditions for success and models for effective partnerships in data-intensive research. Following the workshop, the Computing Research Association has published a detailed report on data-intensive research in education, based on this and the prior workshop.    Some of additional outcomes from this workshop include the article Big Data Analysis in Higher Education: Promise and Pitfalls by Chris Dede, Andrew Ho, and Piotr Mitros, as well as the article Next steps for "Big Data" in education: Utilizing data-intensive research by Chris Dede.
