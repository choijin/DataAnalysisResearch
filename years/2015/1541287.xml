<AbstractNarration>Increasingly, a robust cyberinfrastructure (CI) is the foundation for advanced research opportunities. Investment in personnel resources is no less important, and the role of cyberinfrastructure engineer (CIE) is a critical component in ensuring a comprehensive approach to providing research support services and advancing the research agenda. The addition of the CIE role at the Colorado School of Mines is a key element in efforts  to provide comprehensive support services through an integrative approach to the Mines research community. The CIE serves as partner, architect, integrator, and catalyst to advance efforts in scientific inquiry. Positioning the CIE within the central IT organization provides opportunities for strong collaboration and partnership between operational units that implement and support the various components of CI and faculty researchers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Direct engagement by the CIE in specific activities with researchers, the library, and students through multiple approaches (such as providing resources to manage data as an institutional asset) will have a positive impact on scientific inquiry at Mines.  This approach will facilitate increased utilization of existing cyberinfrastructure as well as ensure a strong focus on researcher needs when designing the next generation of CI.  Impacts include increased partnership between researchers and cyberinfrastructure architects and implementers that advances scientific inquiry within the institution and across the scientific community, as well as learning opportunities for the next generation of STEM researchers. Additionally, by sharing the experiences and successes of the inaugural CIE, Mines will contribute at the regional and national level to the growing professional community of cyberinfrastructure engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "CC*DNI Engineer: Enabling Research Support Services" provided funding for an inaugural cyberinfrastructure engineer (CIE) as part of the Research Support Services Team within the central IT organization at the Colorado School of Mines.  This project resulted in numerous positive outcomes that demonstrate the benefits of the CIE role as liaison, architect, educator, and evangelist positioned within an IT organization and working with researchers on the Mines campus and beyond.  The creation of the position and role of cyberinfrastructure engineer at Mines has been the catalyst for transformational change in research support efforts within the institution. Through the addition of a CIE, researchers now have a full time resource that engages with them to facilitate the identification, implementation, and utilization of cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources - both existing and needed - that support research efforts across Mines.  By increasing awareness of existing CI resources, researchers have been able to immediately take advantage of previously underutilized investments in resources such as high speed WAN connectivity.  Additionally, the CIE has collaborated with researchers in identifying unmet cyberinfrastructure needs and then subsequently procuring and implementing them. Examples of such resources (to date) include a system to support the development of data management plans, storage solutions, and high-speed data-transfer solutions.  Additionally, the addition of the CIE role has allowed researchers, students and the library to focus on their scientific endeavors and interact/collaborate with their respective communities, constituents and collaborators in better and innovative ways. By strengthening the research cyberinfrastructure and engaging with individual researchers, researcher end goals of meeting federal funding requirements, publishing, sharing data, documents and results has been significantly enhanced.    In addition to the positive impacts on research and scientific discovery at Mines, the CIE continues to be actively engaged with the research, cyberinfrastructure, and research support community both regionally and nationally. Outcomes of these interactions, particularly with peers in the CIE role, are contributing to a better understanding of the wide variety of tasks that are currently being generalized under the label of "cyberinfrastructure engineer", and how the CIE can positively contribute to the research community.  These discussions have occurred in both formal settings such as professional conference sessions at the Practice Experience in Advanced Research Computing (PEARC) conference and EDUCAUSE Annual Conference  as well as other meetings such as the Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC)  and the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC).  Finally, the successful outcomes of this project have resulted in additional investment on the part of the institution to enhance research support and services (both funding and personnel) and the transformation of the previous Research Support Services team into the CyberInfrastructure and Advanced Research Computing (CIARC) team within the division of Information &amp; Technology Solutions.
