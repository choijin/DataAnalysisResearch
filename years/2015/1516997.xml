<AbstractNarration>This program will address constraints on cosmological dark energy and alternative gravity models using probes of the growth of cosmic structures.  Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, and the use of cosmologically inspired sculptures as a basis for public outreach aimed at both science- and art-oriented audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will combine galaxy-galaxy lensing with galaxy clustering to determine the evolution of dark matter clustering. Using a novel method developed by the PI, the proposal also aims at measuring the geometry and dark matter distribution at intermediate redshifts via observations of the Lyman-alpha forest. Finally, the PI proposes to test modified gravity by measuring the extended mass profile of galaxy clusters.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A central goal of cosmology is to understand the matter and energy contents of the universe.  The most surprising cosmological discovery of recent decades is that the expansion of the universe is speeding up instead of slowing down, which implies that gravity over cosmic scales is repulsive rather than attractive.  The objective of this grant was to develop new methods for measuring the clustering of dark matter in the universe, to help test theories for the origin of this cosmic acceleration.  Because dark matter does not emit light, we need to measure it indirectly.  The approach taken in our work is to measure the association between dark matter and visible galaxies through "weak gravitational lensing," a distortion of background galaxy images by the light-bending gravity of intervening dark matter.  This phenomenon has been measured in large cosmological surveys.  We developed new methods to combine these measurements of galaxy-dark matter associations with measurements of the clustering  of the galaxies themselves, so that we can infer the clustering of the dark matter.  Much of this work is based on supercomputer simulations, but we interpret the results with paper-and-pencil equations to the extent that we can.  The most exciting applications of our techniques will come over the next couple of years, with data sets that are now in hand but have not yet been fully analyzed.  The preliminary application of one of our methods to existing data already yields a tantalizing result.  The dark matter clustering that we infer from astronomical observations is lower than the clustering predicted by the currently leading theory of cosmology, a discrepancy of about 10 percent.  If this result holds up with future data, it implies that there is some critical missing ingredient in our current understanding, and it might eventually guide us to a fundamental  change in our reigning theory of gravity, known as General Relativity, which was proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915.  Some of the broader impacts of this work have come through the PI's many public lectures on different aspects of cosmology and astrophysics. The most unusual of these lectures have been based on cosmologically inspired sculptures by the artist Josiah McElheny, which McElheny and the PI designed over the course of a decade-long collaboration. These sculptures give our theoretical and empirical understanding of the cosmos a stunning visual form, one that is informed by science and by philosophical, artistic, and political developments of the past three centuries.
