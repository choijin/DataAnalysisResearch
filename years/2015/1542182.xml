<AbstractNarration>The Nebraska Nanoscale Facility (NNF) at the University of Nebraska will provide a regional center of excellence for instrumentation and service in nanoscience and nanotechnology to the NNCI. It will contribute to the United States research and educational infrastructure for transformative advances in the fabrication, understanding and utilization of novel nanostructures, materials and devices. These structures and devices play an increasingly critical role in contemporary technologies including ultraminiaturization in information processing, digital communications, energy processing, sensors for threat detection, and biomedicine. Special attention will be given to serving the nanotechnology needs of educational institutions and industry in the western region of the United States Midwest. NNF will significantly enhance economic development through industrial collaborations, spin-offs, materials analyses, and tech-transfer to companies. National impact will result from interactions and collaborations with the newly developing Nebraska Innovation Campus and the National Security Research Institute at the University of Nebraska. A strong education-outreach program at NNF is focused on increasing diversity through summer research experiences for students and professor-student pairs, after school middle-school programs, community-college programs, minicourses, and others. In addition, education and outreach efforts will be pursued with Native Americans and tribal colleges in Nebraska associated with the Winnebago, Santee Dakota, and Omaha tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NNF will build upon the established Central Facilities of the Nebraska Center for Materials and Nanoscience to strongly galvanize research and education in nanotechnology in Nebraska and the region. The Central and Shared Laboratory Facilities include: Nanofabrication Cleanroom, Nanomaterials and Thin-Film Preparation, Nanoengineered Materials and Structures, Electron Microscopy, X-ray Structural Characterization, Scanning Probe and Materials Characterization, Low-Dimensional Nanostructure Synthesis, and Laser Nanofabrication and Characterization. Most of these facilities are housed in the 32,000 sq. ft. Voelte-Keegan Nanoscience Research Center that was completed in 2012 and funded by major grants from the National Institute for Standards and Technology and the University of Nebraska Foundation. The research in NNF is bolstered by strong research groups in nanoscale electronics, magnetism, and materials and structures for energy. NNF in turn will reinforce several centers and focused research programs including the Nebraska NSF-MRSEC: Polarization and Spin Phenomena in Nanoferroic Structures, DOE-EERE Consortium on Magnetic Materials, SRC-NIST Center for Ferroic Devices, NSF-Center for Nanohybrid Materials, and others. These programs have many national and international collaborators that will add vitality to and provide a broad base of users for the NNF. Hundreds of graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral research associates, and visiting scientists and engineers from companies will benefit each year from the state-of-the-art facilities in NNF.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;NNF Project Outcome Report (2015-2020)</strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>As part of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI), the Nebraska Nanoscale Facility (NNF) helped to provide the US with research and educational infrastructure for transformative advances in the fabrication, understanding, and utilization of novel nanostructures, nanomaterials and nanotechnology devices. NNF served the nanotechnology needs of the educational institutions and industry in the western region of the US Midwest, and helped to position the region as a recognized player in the fields of materials science, nanoscience and nanotechnology. NNF central facilities and shared laboratories in the University of Nebraska - Lincoln served about 1412 internal users and 324 external users over the last five years. During the first four years, NNF as outgrowth of the Nebraska Center for Materials and Nanoscience (NCMN) grew external users by 741% and the external usage hours by 1100%, vastly exceeding the milestone set in the 2015 proposal. The NNF is the only facility in the western region of the US Midwest with an array of state-of-the-art research instrumentation with support from local experts and the facility provided access to advanced fabrication and characterization tools of nanomaterials, quantum materials, nano and quantum technological devices (see Image 1 for an example). A large number of users in the region relied on the NNF for fabrication and characterization tasks. The external university/industry user ratio has been close to 50/50 over the years. &nbsp;Small companies constitute around 23% of our external users. With the NNCI grant, the NNF was able to provide services to users from more than 115 external institutions in the US. These external institutions include community colleges, small 4-year colleges, small and large universities, government labs, start-up companies, small and large companies, and foreign universities. The NNF reached out to more than 225 companies in NE, IA, MO, KS, OK, CO, WY, and SD during the last five years. Close to 75 companies visited the NNF for facility tours and discussion. The NNF also reached out to more than 400 faculty members in various institutions in the region. NNF enabled researchers to perform high quality research and industry users to stay competitive or start new endeavors. NNF provided free equipment training for 105 external users from neighboring states and about 145 engineers from companies participated in the industry workshops. NNF's strong education-outreach (E/O) programs helped attract students to engineering and science careers. We targeted underrepresented groups (Image 2) and created greater awareness about the importance of nanoscience and nanotechnology in modern society. Our established E/O activities made the fascinating phenomena of the nano world accessible. E/O with emphasis on diversity was one of the major strengths of NNF. Signature programs included the Traveling Nanoscience Exhibit at museums in our region, NanoDays demonstrations in community venues, After-School and Summer Classes for minority-serving middle schools and programs, and support of women in science via the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physical Sciences. The NNF 400 sq.-ft. Travelling Nanoscience Exhibit (Image 3) has been viewed by over 80,000 people throughout Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa in the past 5 years. NNF established strong relationships with Tribal and other Community Colleges including the Southeast Community College and the Central Community College in NE. Our workforce development programs targeted school teachers, high school students, community college students and undergraduate students. The participants of these programs were able to engage in nanotechnology research work, received hands-on operational training on state-of-the-art instruments, and presented research work during conferences and events, etc. (Image 4). Around 500 school teachers benefitted from the NNF workforce development programs for middle and high school teachers. More than 3000 school students in the region participated in various E/O programs organized by NNF over the last 5 years. The NNF also maintained a high level of engagement, collaboration, and participation with other NNCI sites across the nation. Examples include joint proposal development, symposium participation, E/O programs, REU programs, workforce development, seminars, annual meetings, and NNCI committee discussions. The NSF:NNCI support enabled NNF to function as a nanotechnology service center, a center of excellence in nanoscience and nanotechnology, a hub for nanotechnology researchers and a promoter of nanoscience and nanotechnology for the larger diverse communities in the western region of the US Midwest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/10/2020<br>      Modified by: Christian&nbsp;Binek</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1542182/1542182_10399198_1599754183708_Fig.1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1542182/1542182_10399198_1599754183708_Fig.1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1542182/1542182_10399198_1599754183708_Fig.1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image 1: Users and specialists of the NNF working together in the cleanroom to fabricate a multilayer sensor device.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jacob John</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christian&nbsp;Binek</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1542182/1542182_10399198_1599757830844_Fig.2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1542182/1542182_10399198_1599757830844_Fig.2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1542182/1542182_10399198_1599757830844_Fig.2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image 2: E/O targeting underrepresented groups during the 2019 4H Engineering with Nano Power camp at an Omaha, NE school.
