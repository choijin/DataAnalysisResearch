<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project supports materials science research of rare-earth related materials at an undergraduate institution.  The primary focus is on the synthesis and characterization of superconducting materials and magnetic nanoparticles, with the goal of understanding their underlying mechanisms.  Many versatile technical applications result utilization of the rare-earth compounds under study such as energy conservation and energy storage by applying superconducting materials and digital information storage and medical imaging by utilizing the magnetic nanomaterials.  The research in the principal investigator's laboratory allows direct participation of undergraduate and master-degree-program students in the experimental condensed matter physics, giving them hands-on experience at the early stage of their academic life.  The research experience and practical placement provided by this project encourage students to pursue higher education and careers in the fields of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project supports experimental research in the strongly correlated electron phenomena in rare-earth related materials.  These phenomena arise from a subtle interplay between competing interactions, either electronic or magnetic.  They can be controlled through tuning the experimental parameters such as temperature, magnetic field, chemical composition, and reduced dimensionality.  The rare-earth materials under study can be used as model systems to probe the localized and itinerant nature of the electron states and test the existing theories for strongly correlated electron physics.  These can be achieved through the synthesis of high-quality specimens and the establishment of transport and thermodynamic properties.  In the rare-earth filled skutterudite systems Pr1-xNdxOs4Sb12, the principal investigator is aiming to understand the unconventional nature of the superconductivity in PrOs4Sb12 by the effect of neodymium substitution.  Furthermore, via the investigation of the electronic structures of related compounds CeOs4Sb12, NdOs4Sb12, and SmOs4Sb12, it can give insight on the quantum critical behavior in the Pr1-xNdxOs4Sb12 system and the role of the quadruple moment fluctuation.  The study of nanoparticles of gadolinium and neodymium can enhance the knowledge on the effect of reduced size on magnetic ordering, domain wall movement, and surface electron states.</AbstractNarration>

Of particular interest are physical properties and phenomena associated with strongly correlated electron behaviors such as superconductivity, magnetism, and valence transition.  These materials have great potentials for technical applications such as energy conservation, energy storage, digital information storage, and medical imaging.         A big issue in our society today is the huge consumption of energy.  Because superconductivity can allow the electricity flowing perfectly without energy loss, it has been an active research field.  However, conventional superconductivity can easily be diminished by magnetism.  Nevertheless, many rare-earth superconductors display the unconventional nature and have much more tolerance for magnetism.  Therefore, understanding the mechanism responsible for unconventional superconductivity can help future development in novel materials and green technologies. One of the features signifies superconductivity in PrOs4Sb12 unconventional is the broken time reversal symmetry (i.e., the appearance of an internal magnetic field).  The PI?s group is using Pr1-xNdxOs4Sb12 as a model system to systematically investigate the influence of ferromagnetism due to the presence of the Nd magnetic moment on the unconventional superconductivity in PrOs4Sb12.  In the past funding period, we surprisingly found that the spontaneous internal field in the superconducting state of PrOs4Sb12 is rapidly suppressed by Nd doping, and time reversal symmetry is recovered in the rather dilute region (0.05 &le; x &le; 0.25).        For the nearby Kondo insulating compound CeOS4Sb12, which has been predicted by theorists as a candidate for a topological insulator, when high magnetic fields applied, a nearly spherical Fermi surface of hole carriers is detected.  Furthermore, we have established an intriguing phase diagram of temperature vs magnetic field of CeOS4Sb12, which is associated with a valence transition separating the semimetallic, low-magnetic-field, low-temperature, L phase from the metallic high-magnetic-field, high-temperature H phase.  It exhibits a very unusual, wedge-shaped phase boundary, with a non-monotonic gradient alternating between positive and negative, which is quite different from the textbook ?elliptical" phase boundary usually followed by valence transitions. Analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations within the H phase reveals an effective mass that increases as magnetic field decreases toward the H-L phase boundary, suggesting proximity to a quantum-critical point; the associated magnetic fluctuations may be responsible for the anomalous field and temperature dependence of the valence transition at high magnetic field.  Whereas the sample dependence of the low-field,-high temperature portion of the phase boundary may rather be associated with the proximity of CeOs4Sb12 to a topological semimetal phase induced by uniaxial stress on the surface state.   Broader Impacts        Research in strongly correlated electron physics in the rare earth related materials has a great potential for various technical applications.  For instance, superconductors can be applied to energy conservation to reduce the rate of depletion of natural resources, to decrease the production of carbon dioxide, and to cut down the usage of environmentally hazardous hydrofluorocarbons, which can preserve the Earth?s ecology.  Quantum magnets and topological insulators can be used in high performance electronics and quantum computers.  Therefore, developing novel materials and understanding their underlying mechanisms is crucial.
