<AbstractNarration>A hydrogel is a network of molecular chains into which water is absorbed and trapped, forming a material that is typically 90 percent or more water.  Hydrogels have a wide range of current and potential applications such as scaffolds for laboratory grown tissue, drug delivery systems, biosensors, and consumer products.  Hydrogels typically break at low levels of stretching, limiting their use in load bearing applications.  Newly developed hydrogels consisting of stiff and soft interpenetrating networks can stretch like rubber. However, once they start to tear the damage is irreversible.  By replacing the stiff network's covalent bonds with bonds that can reform, the material can become self-healing.  This project seeks to understand the physics and mechanics of such gels and to develop mathematical models that will explain the self-healing behavior. Such models will establish connections between molecular scale features and mechanical response and enable researchers to build simulation models of engineered hydrogel systems.  The model will be embedded in the context of an analysis code widely used in mechanics. We envision that such models would aid in the engineering of potential load-bearing applications of self-healing gels such as artificial cartilage and actuators for soft machines.  The project will also provide opportunities for us to reach out to prospective students through hands-on discovery of the unexpected properties of self-healing hydrogels. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In recent years polymer chemists have made tremendous strides in the synthesis of biocompatible, tough, low friction, self-healing hydrogels.   Currently, models are lacking that link fatigue resistance, fracture, and time dependent, self-healing behavior to the underlying, rate dependent bond breaking and reformation processes. This research bridges this gap by: (a) designing and executing experiments to measure these mechanical behaviors using a model material system, (b) defining quantitative models relating these behaviors to bond breaking and reformation kinetics.   Experiments will include tension testing, measurements crack growth rate tests and crack healing under monotonic and cyclic loading. The research will provide understanding of how the observed macroscale properties (strength, time dependence, fracture, fatigue and self-healing) are related to underlying deformation and separation mechanisms at the molecular level.  The constitutive and failure models will also provide a quantitative link between these observable mechanical properties and relevant microscale parameters such as the different types of physical bonds, their strengths, and breaking/healing kinetics.  The project will advance the field of mechanics by building a framework for constitutive and fracture models that are linked directly to the microstructure and that can be used in structural finite element simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydrogels are networks of long chain molecules swollen in water.   A common example is Jell-O.  Hydrogels are very soft due to the large fraction of water in the gel.   This high-water content means that forces imposed on the gel are carried entirely by the network; as a result, they break easily, so most hydrogels have almost no resistance to fracture.   This deficiency severely limits their use in engineering applications.  In the past decade, several novel synthesis methods have been discovered to make hydrogels that are highly resistant to fracture.   In addition, these gels are self-healing: broken networks can reform over time.  As a result, these gels are highly resistant to fatigue, a common cause of structural failure.   These fracture resistant self-healing gels have many potential applications, ranging from artificial cartilage to actuators in soft robotics.   Successful manufacturing of engineering products requires good understanding of mechanical properties.   For self-healing gels, these are: (1) time dependent multi-axial stress-strain behavior under complex loading conditions; (2) effects of temperature and (3) fracture and fatigue resistance.  Our work uses a specially designed, self-healing gel to isolate, identify and study the key underlying physics and mechanics controlling each of these properties.  The key outcomes are:  1.      We have developed a finite strain, time dependent constitutive model for our material system based on the micromechanics of bond breaking and healing kinetics.  Our experiments have demonstrated that our theoretical model accurately captures stress strain behavior under complex loading conditions.   2.      We have designed and built a test system with temperature control and demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that our gel satisfies time temperature superposition.  3.      We developed a novel numerical scheme to accurately compute the time dependent stress and strain in self-healing gels under any loading conditions.     4.      We have developed nonlinear asymptotic methods to study the time dependent stress and strains field near the tip of a crack in the gel under tensile loading.  5.      We carried out systematic study of crack propagation in our hydrogel system, including constant stretching, creep and fatigue failure.  Our experiments are found to be consistent with theory developed in (3) and (4).   6.      We have built a digital image correlation (DIC) setup to study the complex stress and strain field near crack tips in specimens. These DIC measurements compare well with our theoretical model and are used to validate the model     These key findings are disseminated to the Engineering and Soft Matter Physics and Chemistry community through the publication of 11 papers in international journals.  Our research provides the most comprehensive study of the mechanical properties of self-healing hydrogel as of today and will serve as a framework for future studies in this emerging area.   This grant also provided training and professional development for three undergraduate and two graduate students.   One of these students has just graduated with a Ph.D. degree.  The other student is expected to graduate with her Ph.D. at the end of this year.  The students and faculty have hosted several groups of prospective undergraduates visiting Cornell as they make their decisions on which admissions offers to accept.  During these sessions student experiment hands-on with the hydrogel probing its self-healing abilities, stretchability and fracture resistance.
