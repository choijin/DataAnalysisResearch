<AbstractNarration>How do stable political, economic and social patterns (social order) form? Mr. Christopher Hernandez (Northwestern University), under the guidance of Dr. Cynthia Robin (Northwestern University), will direct an investigation into this central question in the social sciences by analyzing the material remains of the ancient Maya site of Tzunun, Chiapas, Mexico. He will test if warfare or at least the threat of war influences the development and transformation of social orders, particularly with respect to the growth of socioeconomic inequality and hierarchy. Archaeologists are particularly suited for the study of social order because the archaeological record is primarily composed of trends in human activity that span decades, centuries and even millennia. Bringing this long-term archaeological perspective, Hernandez and an international group of colleagues will investigate if and how warfare plays a role in the development and transformation of social orders with clear socioeconomic inequality and ample hierarchy. This project also provides economic support and training in the sciences for the local Maya community that is attempting to develop a sustainable tourist economy built around the preservation of the jungle ecosystem and Maya ancestral remains of the Selva Lacandona UNESCO biosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archaeologists and other social scientists have long debated the relationship between warfare and socioeconomic order. Some argue that material gain is the primary cause of war. Others argue war is a destructive act that is detrimental to trade and other forms of economic activity. To establish if warfare promotes the development and institution of socioeconomic inequalities, Mr. Hernandez and colleagues will examine fortifications and refuse from residential mounds at Tzunun. Tzunun is a fortified site built on a peninsula with rugged terrain that contains 65 residential mounds. Initial investigations revealed evidence for two separate periods of occupation, the Preclassic (2000 BC-AD 200) and Postclassic/Colonial periods (AD 900/1000-1821). This chronology is important because during the Preclassic the Maya and other Mesoamerican peoples developed complex societies with ample socioeconomic inequality. Hernandez?s survey of Tzunun suggests the site's high-status inhabitants lived in higher, more defensible locations because residential mound size increases as one ascends the site. Because Tzunun was inhabited both when complex societies with institutions of socioeconomic inequality first developed in the Americas (Preclassic period), and in the bellicose Postclassic and Colonial periods, this research can examine the extent to which warfare initially affected the development of social order or grew in importance later in time. The excavation of refuse pits from residences of varying sizes will be used to establish the material wealth of Tzunun?s residents. Analyzing the distribution of material wealth according to residence size will establish if topographic elevation was an important factor in the design of Tzunun and its inhabitant?s social order. If a hierarchy of residential location was coeval with the construction of the site's fortifications, it would mean status differentiation among the Maya was strongly tied to warfare, with war likely being a catalyst for the growth of socioeconomic inequality and hierarchy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project resulted in the successful completion of Christopher Hernandez&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation. His research contributed a greater understanding of warfare, colonial history, and the origins of urbanism. Through his investigations, Hernandez promoted diversity in scientific research.</p> <p>Scholars have debated the frequency of warfare in the past, and the impact of social conflict on the human experience. Yet, researchers are often constrained by the limits of written history. If scholars want to understand the long-term impact of war on the human experience, then archaeologists must contribute to the discussion. In his dissertation, Hernandez argues that to examine past warfare, a greater focus on martial practice in particular cultural contexts is necessary. By understanding how people prepare for, engage in, and administer the outcomes of war (i.e., martial practice), researchers can better understand the war-related functions of buildings, artifacts, and sites. For example, ancient Spartans relied on their army and surrounding mountains to defend their community, and only built city walls when their power in the Greek world was fading. The culture and history of war matter when interpreting architecture and the human experience.</p> <p>With an international team of archaeologists, Hernandez conducted investigations on the history and culture of Maya peoples who lived at Tzunun, Chiapas, Mexico. Excavations, survey, and mapping documented a settlement inhabited during the Postclassic/Early Spanish Colonial period (AD 900-1600) and Late Preclassic (200 BC-AD 200). Because the history of colonization matters for understanding the development of contemporary nation-states and the construction of racial identities, Tzunun provides a unique opportunity to examine an indigenous community outside of direct control by the Spanish. Tzunun along with other sites along the shores of Lake Mensabak persisted as vibrant Maya communities many decades after the Spanish conquered the Aztec, Inca, and Maya groups in the Yucatan Peninsula.</p> <p>During the Late Postclassic to Early Spanish Colonial period (AD 1200-1600), social life for Tzunun&rsquo;s inhabitants was profoundly structured by warfare because the site was designed to be a fortress. Tzunun&rsquo;s inhabitants lived on a peninsula with multiple fortifications along the spit of land that connects the site with the mainland. Within the local, rugged topography, houses and other structures were built on peaks in the terrain. Elevated terrain created a series of high points within the community that locals could defend if enemies breached the site&rsquo;s perimeter fortifications.</p> <p>Small traces of Late Preclassic settlement cluster around the site&rsquo;s highest peak. Based on investigations by fellow researchers on the Mensabak Archaeological Project (MAP), Tzunun&rsquo;s highest peak was an important point within a sacred landscape. The sacred landscape created a sense of community in a period when urbanism first developed in Mesoamerica.</p> <p>A broader impact of this research is the engagement of underrepresented and disenfranchised communities in the scientific archaeological process. Hernandez is a first generation citizen of the United States and Latino scholar. Through funds provided by the National Science Foundation, he was able to complete his PhD and is now an NSF SBE postdoctoral fellow at the University of Illinois-Chicago (UIC). The successful completion of Hernandez&rsquo;s PhD entailed collaborative fieldwork with US Latino, Mexican, and Maya groups. He worked with academic colleagues to assist in the training of underrepresented student researchers from UIC. During the project&rsquo;s excavation phase, Hernandez also collaborated with Mexican archaeologists from Yucatan and Mexico City to provide fieldwork experience for Mexican students who often struggle to find such opportunities. Hernandez worked closely with Josu&eacute;? ?G&oacute;mez? ?Vazquez, a Tzeltal Maya Archaeologist, who was born and raised in Chiapas, Mexico. Hernandez will now advise Josue as he conducts his master&rsquo;s thesis on the ritual, political, and economic functions of Tzunun&rsquo;s caves.</p> <p>Hernandez was also able to integrate Maya peoples from the contemporary community of Puerto Bello Metzabok in scientific archaeological practice. Metzabok is a historically disenfranchised community where many have not completed a grade school education. However, thanks to the extensive involvement of locals in Hernandez&rsquo;s fieldwork, the people of Metzabok learned the systematic approach of scientific archaeology, and can speak to the principles of stratigraphy and artifact identification. Through the training of Hernandez, UIC student researchers, Mexican archaeologists, and Maya peoples, this project met the fundamental NSF goal of advancing and broadening participation in science.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hernandez</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546972/1546972_10402958_1511212104241_Tzunun2017_contour--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546972/1546972_10402958_1511212104241_Tzunun2017_contour--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tzunun, Chiapas, Mexico"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546972/1546972_10402958_1511212104241_Tzunun2017_contour--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tzunun, Chiapas, Mexico"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map of Tzunun, Chiapas, Mexico.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Christopher Hernandez</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hernandez</div> <div class="imageTitle">Tzunun, Chiapas, Mexico</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546972/1546972_10402958_1511212413882_wallgap--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546972/1546972_10402958_1511212413882_wallgap--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fortifications at Tzunun"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546972/1546972_10402958_1511212413882_wallgap--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fortifications at Tzunun"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map and picture of a series of walls with gaps.
