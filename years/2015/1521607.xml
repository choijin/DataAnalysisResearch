<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary project examines solitary wave and wavetrain solutions of certain nonlinear, dispersive partial differential equations utilizing a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental approaches.  The aim is to provide an accurate, practical, detailed description of these coherent wave structures that is useful for applications in nanomagnetism and the fluid dynamics of dissipationless, dispersive media.  Motivated by recent experiments, time-periodic, localized solutions of a modified Landau-Lifshitz equation that incorporates a spin transfer torque forcing term to compensate damping will be computed and studied analytically using asymptotic methods.  These magnetic droplet solitons and their generalizations have potential for technological applications. Another research front will be developed involving modulated nonlinear wavetrains or dispersive shock waves (DSWs).  The generation of DSWs represents a universal mechanism to resolve hydrodynamic singularities in dispersive media such as water waves, plasma, optics, interfacial fluids, Bose-Einstein condensates, and two-phase, viscously deformable fluids.  Theoretical studies will focus upon central questions of modern DSW theory including loss of genuine nonlinearity/strict hyperbolicity in the modulation equations, multi-dimensional DSWs, and stability.  In collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students, the principal investigator will undertake experiments involving a viscous fluid conduit system in order to make quantitative measurements of DSW properties for comparison with theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When wave properties intrinsically depend upon the wave amplitude, novel physical behavior can arise.  With a view toward applications, this project encompasses two classes of these nonlinear waves: solitary waves in nanomagnetism and shock waves in dispersive media.  Spintronics encompasses the effort to develop information transport, processing, and storage using the electron's spin in addition to its charge, for example, to continue Moore's Law (the doubling of the number of transistors per unit area every eighteen months) beyond present technological limitations.  The spatially localized spin excitations in a nanomagnet to be studied in this project possess features that hold great promise for future spintronic applications.  Viscous shock waves that form when a projectile exceeds the speed of sound in air are commonly understood. The dispersive shock waves studied in this project are of a very different type, lacking dissipation and realized as expanding, oscillatory wavetrains.  A fluid experiment will be developed to carefully measure these shock properties while also being used as an educational, outreach, and demonstration tool, providing young mathematicians direct experience with nonlinear waves.  Presentations at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will provide the general public with exposure to this fascinating field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research produced by this award includes a mathematical analysis of wave solutions to nonlinear, dispersive partial differential equations with applications to a variety of physical environments.  The physical waves modeled by these equations include solitary waves (or solitons), periodic waves, and dispersive shock waves, all of which are strongly influenced by the countervailing effects of wave amplitude/intensity and wavelength.  This research's intellectual merit is primarily comprised of the mathematical description and modeling of nonlinear waves in two areas:  Dispersive hydrodynamic phenomena and applications Magnetic solitons and spin hydrodynamics   Additionally, this award supported the development of a new fluid dynamics laboratory, the Dispersive Hydrodynamics Lab in the Department of Applied Mathematics at CU Boulder, where a number of experiments on dispersive hydrodynamics were successfully designed, run, and analyzed.  Although spin waves in solid-state magnetic materials appear to have nothing to do with fluid dynamics, this research has highlighted connections and commonalities between the two areas by virtue of their common mathematical structure resulting in new insights into spin transport.  Physical experiments and their interpretation by other researchers in fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, nonlinear optics, and magnetic materials draw upon the research supported here.  The research supported by this award has resulted in 36 peer-reviewed publications: 20 on dispersive hydrodynamics, 9 on magnetic solitons, and 7 on spin hydrodynamics.  According to Web of Science (accessed on 9/29/19), these publications from 2014-2019 have been cited 294 times by researchers other than the PI.  The broader impacts of this research include training of students, outreach activities and public lectures, a research monograph, and a 6-month research program on the subject of dispersive hydrodynamics at the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK.  Seventeen undergraduate students, nine PhD students, and two postdoctoral fellows participated in this research.  The experimental lab supported by this award, rare amongst applied mathematics departments, inspires new applied mathematicians with accessible opportunities to contribute to nonlinear wave research through a concrete, visual application area.  The lab also supported a number of outreach events, demos, and lab tours involving new undergraduate/graduate students as well as senior researchers.  The visibility of this research helped the PI become a CU Wizard.  For over three decades, the CU Wizards have entertained and informed children and their parents about the wonders of science. Once each month, from September through June, CU Wizards present a Saturday morning interactive show to the public.  Many of the students and all postdocs involved in this research participated in these outreach activities and two CU Wizards shows.  Looking to the future, much of the research supported by this award forms the basis of a book on dispersive hydrodynamics that is being co-authored by the PI.  This book will provide both an entry point and reference for new and established researchers in the field of dispersive hydrodynamics.  A direct outgrowth of the research supported by this award is a 6-month research program on dispersive hydrodynamics to be held in 2020 at the Isaac Newton Institute, which is housed in Cambridge University.  This program will consist of five week-long conferences on various research themes as well as in-residence participants who will contribute seminars, lectures, and mentoring of new researchers.  The book and research program indicate the growing appeal and interest in the research supported by this award.       Last Modified: 09/29/2019       Submitted by: Mark A Hoefer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
