<AbstractNarration>Parking can take up a significant amount of the trip costs (time and money) in urban travel. As such, it can considerably influence travelers' choices of modes, locations, and time of travel. The advent of smart sensors, wireless communications, social media and big data analytics offers a unique opportunity to tap parking's influence on travel to make the transportation system more efficient, cleaner, and more resilient. A cyber-physical social system for parking is proposed to realize parking's potential in achieving the above goals.  This cyber-physical system consists of smart parking sensors, a parking and traffic data repository, parking management systems, and dynamic traffic flow control. If successful, the results of the investigation will create a new paradigm for managing parking to reduce traffic congestion, emissions and fuel consumption and to enhance system resilience. These results will be disseminated broadly through publications, workshops and seminars. The research will provide interdisciplinary training to both graduate and undergraduate students. The results of this research also fills a void in our graduate transportation curriculum in which parking management gets little coverage. The investigators will organize an online short training course in Coursera and National Highway Institute to bring results to a broader audience. The investigators will also collaborate with Carnegie Museum of Natural History to develop an online digital map and related educational programs, which will be presented in the museum galleries during public events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically, new theories, algorithms and systems for efficient management of transportation infrastructure through parking will be developed in this research, leveraging cutting-edge sensing technology, communication technology, big data analytics and feedback control. The research probes massive individualized and infrastructure based traffic and parking data to gain a deeper understanding of travel and parking behavior, and develops a novel reservoir-based network flow model that lays the foundation for modeling the complex interactions between parking and traffic flow in large-scale transportation networks. The theory will be investigated at different levels of granularity to reveal how parking information and pricing mechanisms affect network flow in a competitive market of private and public parking. In addition, this research proposes closed-loop control mechanisms to enhance mobility and sustainability of urban networks. Prices, access and information of publicly owned on-street and off-street parking are dynamically controlled to: a) change day-to-day behavior of all commuters through day-to-day travel experience and/or online information systems; b) change travel behavior of a fraction of adaptive travelers on the fly who are aware of time-of-day parking information and comply to the recommendations; and c) influence the market prices of privately owned parking areas through a competitive parking market.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding how parking affects travels in cities and how to leverage new methods and technologies such as cyber-physical systems (CPS) to manage parking more effectively are critical to the daily operation of our urban transportation system. They are also the main focuses of our NSF funded research.  The linkage between parking and traffic congestion is most prominent in crowded downtowns.  Due to limited parking supply, drivers who cannot find a parking spot often cruise around to search for parking, adding to more congestion. Our research developed a CPS-enabled system to guide drivers to available parking lots via the most efficient route. It has been demonstrated through traffic simulation that this system can reduce traffic congestion considerably in downtowns and make more balanced use of downtown parking lots with only a fraction of drivers equipped with such a system (between 30-60%).

We extended our work from a single corridor to multiple corridors connecting suburban towns to downtown, where commuters have to compete for parking space.  Because of the competition for parking, we found that having balanced demands from the suburbs is more beneficial in terms of lowering commuting times than having unbalanced demands (for example, one suburb dominates the others), which has important implications for urban planning in metropolitan areas.  Finally, our research also developed a predictor of downtown traffic congestion by using the occupancy of downtown parking lots. Utilizing machine learning and time-series parking occupancy data, our prediction model can predict the average travel speed in downtown with remarkable accuracy: within plus-minus 1.2mph with 95% confidence.    Our research findings can help public agencies manage parking more effectively, and use parking as an effective tool to combat downtown traffic congestion, which in turn can reduce emissions and fuel consumption in cities that benefits the society as a whole.  This research also provided interdisciplinary training to graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.          Last Modified: 12/19/2019       Submitted by: Michael H Zhang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
