<AbstractNarration>This project will develop fundamental understanding of how integrated social science and agent-based modeling approaches can improve life safety under threat of near-field tsunami hazards. The targeted hazard scenario is a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami from the Cascadia Subduction Zone, threatening communities along 1,000 miles of the US Pacific Northwest coastline. This project develops close collaboration with a number of organizations responsible for public safety during the response extreme natural hazards, including the Oregon Department of Transportation, Oregon Office of Emergency Management, Oregon Parks and Recreation, and Oregon Sea Grant. Social science data from diverse groups will contribute to a growing body of knowledge on evacuation decision-making. A collaboration with the Oregon Museum of Science of Industry (OMSI) will leverage the museum's ongoing activities, including those which reach underrepresented groups. Modeling source code will be shared and distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates the disciplines of sociology with engineering to investigate multiple forms of tsunami information and its potential impact on evacuation decision-making by the general public and the unique professional community responsible for coastal visitor safety. The project objectives are (1) to identify the cognitive and social factors that influence multimodal evacuation decision-making behavior; (2) to utilize an Agent-Based Modeling framework to provide realistic/credible hypothetical scenarios for near-field tsunamis hazards; and (3) to determine the usability/acceptability of social science-informed agent-based modeling for understanding evacuation decision-making. This work will therefore improve understand of how decision-making affects life safety, with broad outreach to diverse audiences both to assess the feasibility of this approach and for purposes of outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this project are:  (1) An interdisciplinary integration of social science and civil engineering to establish community-specific agent-based multimodal tsunami evacuation model for city of Seaside, OR and the South Beach State Park, Newport, OR. Four journal papers have been published as a result of this integrative evacuation scenario modeling.   (2) A survey of household tsunami evacuation intension behavior (i.e., evacuation decision-making and logistics) was conducted in the city of Seaside and a valuable sample of 220 households' data was collected, two journal papers have been published.   (3) A cross-sector collaboration partnership with the Oregon Office of Emergency Management and the Oregon State Parks and Recreational Department was established, 8 tsunami evacuation drills were conducted at the South Beach State Park in 2017 and 2018 inovlving STEM students, k12 students, OSU Hatfield Marine Science Center (OMSC) staff members, and park visitors.  A wayfinding app was instrumented in those drills and collected a valuable evacuation trajectory dataset to validate the agent-based tsunami evacuation models.  (4) A multi-touch tsunami evacuation exhibit was created by integration of the agent-based tsunami evacuation models for South Beach State Park, Newport, OR in collaboration with OSU OMSC.  The exhibit was displayed at the HMSC visitor center for two weeks.  There were a total of more than 500 visitors who interacted with the exhibit.    (5) Three Ph.D students, two master students, a dozen of undergraduate students were trained throughout this project from civil engineering and social science.
