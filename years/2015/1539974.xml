<AbstractNarration>This award supports US participation in the Third Muenster conference on inner model theory, the core model induction, and hod mice that will be held July 20-21, 2015 at the Institut fur Mathematische Logik, WWU Muenster, Germany. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be devoted to recent work on the construction of canonical inner models via the core model induction method, and to the theory of hod mice upon which this work rests.  Large cardinal hypotheses play a central role in the set-theoretic foundations of mathematics. The inner model program attempts to  associate to each large cardinal hypothesis a canonical minimal universe of sets in which that hypothesis is true.  Some of our deepest understanding of large cardinal hypotheses come from this program. The core model induction method is our most powerful method for constructing such canonical inner models. This conference will be devoted to recent work that strengthens the method in important ways. The website for the conference is http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/logik/Personen/rds/muenster_meeting_2015.html.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The grant supported work in inner model theory, a central area in pure set theory and the foundations of mathematics. The goal of the inner model program is to associate to our strongest foundational axioms canonical minimal universes (inner models) in which those hypotheses hold true. The axioms in question are strengthenings of the Axiom of Infinity of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory. The construction and analysis of canonical inner models is important for understanding and using strong axioms of infinity.    The grant supported work in inner model theory by supporting travel by postdocs and advanced graduate students to the Third Muenster Conference (July 20-31,2015, in Muenster), to the Irvine Conference on Descriptive Inner Model Theory (July 18-29, 2016, in Irvine), and to the Fourth Muenster Conference (July 17--Aug. 1, 2017, in Muenster). In all, the grant supported 3 trips by postdocs and 5 trips by graduate students. These conferences belong to a series of annual summer workshops that began in 2010.   About 25 people attended each conference, including both seniorresearchers and many young people. Of the 27 people attendingthe last conference, 6 were postdocs and 11 were students. There were 7 students at the Irvine conference, and of these 4 attended the last conference as well.
