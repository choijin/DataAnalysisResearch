<AbstractNarration>1541866 (Assaf- Anid). The workshop "Food, Energy, and Water (FEW) Nexus in Sustainable Cities," to be held in Beijing on October 20 and 21, 2015, will convene participants from both the United States and China.  Both nations are principal actors in global sustainability. The FEW workshop will provide participants from both nations opportunities to explore scientific challenges of mutual interest in sustainability and stressors on the built environment in relation to the FEW nexus. The workshop's programming team is led by New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) in collaboration with Peking University (PKU). Several academic, government, and private entities will be actively engaged in planning the workshop, including from the United States: NYIT (Dr. Nada Assaf-Anid), and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and its Institute for Sustainability (AIChE-IfS, Dr. Darlene Schuster), and from China: Peking University (Dr. Chunmiao Zheng) and Wuhan University (Dr. Xiaohui Cui), along with representatives from the various agencies in the U.S. and China. The overarching goal of the workshop is to stimulate basic research on the interdependence of systems involving agriculture, water, and energy, as well as to identify barriers to sustainability in food production, transport, distribution, use, and access in urban environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will cover several research areas, including sustainability and life-cycle assessment challenges in addressing complex systems-based indicators and responses to stressors and coupling those responses to the FEW system, as well as technology breakthroughs and approaches for more efficient FEW resource utilization and reuse in cities. The workshop will enhance scientific cooperation between U.S. and Chinese scholars, educators, industry practitioners, government agency representatives, urban planners and policymakers. The workshop is to result in a white paper on scientific, engineering and information systems and data challenges in understanding FEW systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is co-funded by the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program and the Global Venture Fund (GVF) of the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[FEW Workshop: "Food, Energy, and Water Nexusin Sustainable Cities" Major Activities:   In October 2015, the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) organized an NSF-sponsored FEW workshop entitled, "Food, Energy and Water Nexus in Sustainable Cities". This "FEW Workshop" was co-sponsored by several entities, including the New York Institute of Technology, Peking University, the Institute for Sustainability (IfS) of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), and Wuhan University?s International School of Software.  The workshop was held in Beijing, China, on October 20-21, 2015 in conjunction with the NYIT-Peking University U.S. &ndash; China EcoPartnership conference, "Sustainable Megacities: Food, Energy, Water and the Built Environment" which focused on "Megacities" (urban areas of more than 10 million inhabitants), and other urban conglomerates which, as they continue to grow, use more than their share of resources and shift the distributions of FEW supply and demand. The workshop initiated opportunities for U.S.-China partnerships related to FEW research and education.  The conference drew a large crowd of participants from government, industry, academia and professional organizations.  Main Goal of the Project:  The overarching goal of the FEW Workshop: "Food, Energy, and Water Nexus in Sustainable Cities" was to stimulate basic research on the interdependence of systems involving food, energy and water. It also aimed at identifying barriers to sustainability in food production, transport, distribution, use and access in urban environments. Participants discussed how best to study FEW couplings and stressors, with attention to systems-based approaches that help identify fundamental principles underlying various socio-economic, physical, and natural processes operating in built environments. Specific Objectives:  One objective was to engage a multi-disciplinary group of experts working on food, energy and water management and security, and to provide a platform for informed exchange about the best approach to research and manage the global resource base.  Another objective was to support a community of research scientists from academia and NGOs, as well as industry, to advance the FEW research agenda over the next decade, and to provide research and educational opportunities for the next generation of researchers. Intellectual Merit: The FEW workshop was structured around four topical areas which were developed during four sessions: 1) FEW Nexus &ndash; Sustainability Challenges; 2) Impacts of Urbanization and Anthropogenic Disruptions on Vital FEW Resources; 3) Research Advances on Systems-Based Analysis for Complex FEW Systems, and 4) Sensors and Information Systems for Real-time Monitoring and Analysis and Modeling of FEW Systems.  It also included a synthesis session. A summary of these five sessions and recommendations is provided by the Synthesis Report.  The FEW workshop's agenda; presentations and Synthesis Report are all available at:: http://www.nyit.edu/events/few_workshop  Broader Impacts:  The collaboration enhanced scientific cooperation between U.S. and Chinese scholars,educators, industry practitioners, government agency representatives, urban planners and policymakers.The workshop?s Synthesis Report, defining the scientific, engineering and information systems and data challenges in understanding FEW systems has been widely disseminated, therefore broadeningthe impact of workshop findings.
