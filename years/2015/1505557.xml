<AbstractNarration>Ultracold molecules offer unprecedented opportunities for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, quantum information processing, and controlled interrogation of molecular events, including chemical reactivity in the ultimate quantum regime.  A quantitative description of their collisions and interactions requires a quantum mechanical approach, but it is computationally challenging for many molecules of interest to current cooling and trapping experiments. The primary difficulty is the proliferation in the number of quantum states and degrees of freedom to be included in the calculations and the sensitivity of results to both short-range and long-range intermolecular forces. This work will develop new theoretical and computational tools that go beyond existing models for the treatment of chemical reactions at temperatures below 1 degree Kelvin. It will significantly enhance theoretical capabilities for the description of chemical reactions at cold and ultracold temperatures and provide an efficient tool for quantized studies of chemical reactions at low temperatures. The proposed research transcends disciplinary boundaries, and the computational algorithms developed will also be equally applicable to molecular processes in diverse environments ranging from atmospheric chemistry to astrophysics.  Funding of this project will also contribute to future workforce development in Science and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with the development of accurate and efficient methods to study chemical reactions and energy transfer in cold molecular collisions. The full Close-Coupling (CC) method will continue to be developed and optimized. A hybrid method that uses full CC at short range and Multi-Channel Quantum Defect Theory (MQDT) at long range will also be developed and benchmarked. These methods will be applied to a number of reactions including F + H2 and OH + H. In addition, the PI will explore the importance of the geometric phase in chemical reaction dynamics using the O + OH reaction at the ultracold limit as a illustrative case.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Controlling the outcome of a chemical reaction has long been a cherished goal of chemists. However, such control is very difficult achieve at thermal energies because molecules occupy a plethora of internal states as given by the Boltzmann distribution. To control the outcome of a chemical reaction at the molecular level, it is imperative that the molecule is prepared in a specific quantum state and in an orientation that is most desirable for the reaction to occur. Such control over the initial state and orientation requires very low temperatures, well below a kelvin. At such low temperatures, perturbations introduced by an external electric or magnetic field can have a significant effect on the collisional outcome and can often be used to control the reaction process. Over the past 10-15 years several methods have been developed to cool and trap atoms and molecules to temperatures close to absolute zero. Indeed, molecular gases in specific quantum states at translational temperatures on the order of a few hundred nano-kelvin have been prepared in the laboratory. Chemistry experiments involving two KRb molecules at a temperature of about 300 nK in a magneto-optical trap have been reported by scientists at University of Colorado, Boulder in 2010. At these low temperatures, quantum behavior is amplified due to the large de Broglie wave lengths requiring an explicit quantum mechanical treatment to describe their properties. Similar controlled experiments have also been performed for the reaction between an ultracold KRb molecule and a K atom leading to K<sub>2</sub>+Rb products but the experimental set up could not resolve the specific quantum states of the K<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>molecule produced.</p> <p>This award led to the first explicit quantum mechanical study of the K+KRb chemical reaction with quantum state resolution of the K<sub>2 &nbsp;</sub>product. Our computations yielded results in close agreement with the experiment but they further revealed that the reaction exhibits chaotic dynamics leading to a Poisson distribution of rotational levels of the K<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>molecules. Further, our computations demonstrated the usefulness of simple universal models for describing the overall rate of the reaction. Such universal models are very useful for describing properties of ultracold gases as explicit quantum calculations, while desirable, are not often practical. Another important outcome of our investigations is the role of "geometric phase" in chemical reactions. This is an elusive effect, arising from the sign change of the electronic wave function when the nuclear motion encircles a conical intersection between two electronic states - e.g., a ground electronic state and an excited electronic state. Our study revealed that the effects become magnified in the ultracold limit due to interference between wave functions encircling the conical intersection. Such quantum effects become important in discussing properties of ultracold molecules as they are increasingly being considered as candidates for quantum computing, quantum information processing and exploration of quantum many-body effects.
