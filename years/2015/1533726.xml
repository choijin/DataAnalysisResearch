<AbstractNarration>This award is intended to provide travel support to the essential representatives of the US scientific community who serve as the US members of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) working groups or standing committees and to the US delegate to IASC to participate in activities associated with Arctic Science Summit Week (ASSW) 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US representatives will participate in the Arctic Science Summit Week and associated meetings in Toyama, Japan on April 23 - 30, 2015. This award includes support for: a) PI Hinzman, the US delegate to IASC, to participate on behalf of the US Arctic science community on the IASC Council; b) travel support for US representatives to each of the five working groups appointed through the US National Academies process; and c) travel support for US representatives of the IASC?s Data Standing Committee. The US representative to the SAON Observations and Networks Committee should also participate in this meeting with funds provided through this award. IASC facilitates international science development through workshop, networks, planning meetings, and early-career science support. It promotes and facilitates international research activities with an emphasis on issues that not only cross national boundaries, but also cross disciplines and even timescales. National support is essential to ensure the US maintains a leadership role in planning and coordinating these research efforts in the international sphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an important part of the US contribution to this international effort and the Arctic Section finds the plan fits well with section goals. Staff recommends an award at the requested amount.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The magnitude of environmental and socio-economical changes witnessed in the Arctic calls for a drastic shift of focus towards understanding the consequences of these changes and to advance our ability rapidly to provide knowledge for decision-makers. How can we anticipate changes accurately and develop adaptation actions rather than just responding to them? How can we integrate scientific disciplines more successfully and bring local and regional rights and stakeholders into a knowledge-based dialogue? How do we obtain better science that delivers products that address major global and Arctic sustainability challenges?  The International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) recently concluded a 2-year open process where the Arctic community at large was called upon to identify gaps in scientific knowledge and to point to the most urgent research priorities for the coming years. This process involved more than 20 Arctic and global scientific organizations, Arctic Council Working Groups and Arctic Indigenous Peoples and encompassed symposia, outreach activities, workshops and other events between 2014-2016, including a major conference in Toyama, Japan. The International Conference on Arctic Research Planning (ICARP-III) built on the science planning efforts from ICARP-I and ICARP-II and provides a roadmap of priorities for forward-looking, collaborative, interdisciplinary Arctic research and observing, while also establishing an inventory of recent and current synthesis documents and major developments in Arctic research. Importantly, ICARP-III had a broader, more encompassing reach and has involved local and indigenous people in an integrated manner.  Three overarching key research priorities emerged from the ICARP-III process:  (1) Defining the Role of the Arctic in the Global System  The Arctic climate system is undergoing the most rapid changes we see today. These changes cascade throughout the entire global climate system, impacting weather and ecosystems as well as commerce and geopolitics at an unprecedented rate. Arctic mid-latitude linkages are poorly understood, yet resulting weather extremes impact millions. How do Arctic change and Arctic Amplification affect atmosphere and ocean circulation and connections to the global climate system? What are the consequences of the dramatically shrinking sea ice cover? Linking across all spheres (biosphere, social and physical), what are the worldwide implications of the changing Arctic within the Anthropocene?  (2) Observing and Predicting Future Climate Dynamics and Ecosystem Responses  Contamination, biodiversity loss and changes to the physical environment have serious impacts on local populations. Coastal erosion and methane leakages from permafrost are increasing. The rates of change today are making the combination of traditional knowledge and predictive research a necessary step to sustainable development in the Arctic. Our predictive skill of local, regional and global processes must be improved by the establishment of a sustained and participatory observing network, which includes community-based monitoring.  Such an observing system of systems would facilitate more effective integration of data into climate models. This could, for example, allow more accurate prediction of times of deep freeze in the Central US owing to the Polar Vortex, or better prepared emergency services when more extreme storms hit areas with large population centres. Better ecosystem models could also help to predict where new diseases may arise to help prepare local doctors in remote villages or help to predict changes in fish stock migrations so local fisherman can be ready to switch equipment for harvest.  (3) Understanding the Vulnerability and Resilience of Arctic Environments and Societies and Supporting Sustainable Development  Obtaining such an understanding in a globalized Arctic must include contributions from non-Arctic states and organizations. New markets for Arctic resources and associated activities, including trade, tourism and transportation, are emerging faster than the necessary land and sea infrastructures. ICARP-III concluded that it is essential to build long-term human capacity among scientists, decision makers, cold region workforces and Arctic residents through training, education, effective public engagement, and by adopting shared guiding principles. The ICARP-III process provided a platform for education and outreach activities, training opportunities for early career researchers and others, and an opportunity to analyse the effectiveness of existing science capacity building activities.     The ICARP process points the way for scientists to take action, in cooperation with rights holders and stakeholders, to produce results that will have global impact. The role of the Arctic in the global system, the prediction of future climate dynamics and ecosystem responses, and improved understanding of the vulnerability and resilience of Arctic environments and societies must be prioritized. Such research will provide improved environmental risk assessment for millions of people, will develop mitigation strategies for the serious global pollution put upon the fragile Arctic environment, and will formulate scientifically-based guidelines for sustainable utilization of Arctic environments and resources.
