<AbstractNarration>Abstract - Hedengren, 1547110&lt;br/&gt;Current process control and optimization strategies are typically divided into three major sections: base layer controls, advanced controls, and planning and scheduling. Each of these levels works at a different time scale, ranging from milliseconds to seconds for base controls, up to months or years at the planning and scheduling level. To simplify models and decrease computation time, each of these layers receives a minimal amount of information to fulfill its objective. This lack of information creates lost opportunities. For example, the scheduling program may pass a set of unreachable set points to the advanced controls, or the base controls could reach a set point through a suboptimal path due to its lack of knowledge regarding process nonlinearities that the advanced controls had incorporated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this EAGER project is to develop a unified architecture for control and planning/scheduling applications. This is now possible because of large cloud computing infrastructure, mobile devices with wireless communication, smart sensors that build an internet of interacting devices, and recent break-through algorithms in solver and algorithmic performance. The project is about consolidation of disparate algorithms and research areas into a unifying architecture for scheduling and control through the development of a computational and visualization tool or APP. Although tested on local and limited multi-core resources, the project framework is proposed for a new paradigm of computing including cloud-based resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will participate on the project for course credit. Students from underrepresented groups will be recruited directly and by connecting to an existing college program that targets such students (WE @ BYU). From an educational standpoint, students will (i) gain experience in the design and implementation process for utilization of renewable resources (ii) demonstrate an appreciation for working within engineering constraints to develop a sustainable process, (iii) demonstrate effective teamwork and leadership skills as they work together on teams, and (iv) recognize the extent to which renewable resources can be applied to multiple process platforms.</AbstractNarration>
