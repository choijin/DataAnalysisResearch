<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR* Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) award to the University of Mississippi includes Mississippi State University, Tulane University, and the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa as partners in a collaborative project.  The project?s research focus is at the nexus of water-energy-food.  It aims to develop low-cost, high-efficient methods and devices that integrate water splitting by sunlight to produce hydrogen and to reduce carbon dioxide and ammonia to generate fuels and fertilizers.  The research is highly desirable for developing sustainable fuel and synthetic fertilizer technologies.  This collaborative project will directly engage and train seven faculty, five postdocs, nine graduate and 14 undergraduate students, eight faculty and 16 students from community colleges, as well as 60 secondary school teachers and 10 high school students from Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama.  The fundamental science focus of this project is anticipated to advance knowledge and technology in the water- energy-food nexus in the US gulf coast region and potentially connect with the private sector for future technology transfer and commercialization possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project among four institutions in Mississippi (MS), Louisiana (LA), and Alabama (AL) has three closely integrated sub-projects in solar photo-catalysis: (1) Production of hydrogen by splitting water ? establish low-cost and high-efficiency approaches that use sunlight and integrate plasmonic metals with semiconductors or use nanoscale carbon-oxygen-titanium catalysts and organometallic pincer complexes; (2) Reduction of carbon dioxide to methane or ethanol fuels - explore photo-electro-chemical methods that employ rhenium complexes to modify semiconductor catalysts for use in high-voltage dye sensitized solar cells; and (3) Fixation of nitrogen to produce agricultural fertilizers ? prepare catalysts with sufficient reduction potential to convert nitrogen to ammonia. The ultimate goal is to integrate catalysis technologies into a low-cost, high-efficiency solar cell that is devoid of toxic materials.  The device is expected to have sufficient voltage to split water for hydrogen production and reduce carbon dioxide and nitrogen to usable fuels and fertilizers. The research is integrated with education at K-12 to collegiate levels and provides training and mentoring to junior faculty, postdocs, and students at the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, Tulane University, and the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa as well as those from Community Colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities in MS, LA, and AL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The conversion of sunlight to a chemical fuel is critically important to help address the global challenges for sustainable energy and clean environmental and public health. An artificial photosynthetic process is needed for both storing fuels to use after sunset and for use in transportation where high energy densities are needed from a storable, on-demand energy source. The chemical fuel generated must be from an exceptionally abundant source such as sunlight, water, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide to be able to provide a significant quantity for human needs. The goal of this award was to make significant advances in artificial photosynthetic systems in a practical way and to educate the public on the need for sustainable and renewable solar fuels.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> Water oxidation catalysts were discovered using non-precious metal materials that operate with little energetic waste at exceptionally quick rates for the conversion of water to O<sub>2</sub>, protons, and electrons. The protons and electrons formed can then be used to either generate H<sub>2</sub> as a fuel or to be combined with CO<sub>2</sub> to make chemical fuels such as CO. Importantly, both H<sub>2</sub> and CO have important industrial needs for the Haber-Bosch process where nearly all of humanity&rsquo;s fertilizer is derived from or for the Fisher-Tropsch process to make synthetic gasoline. During this award, some of the best catalysts known for proton conversion to H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> conversion to CO were designed and studied. The fastest direct conversion molecular catalyst was found during these studies for generating CO. Additionally, a very low energy cost proton reduction catalyst was also discovered which has a similar rate of H<sub>2</sub> generation as platinum.</p> <p>To power the conversion of water and CO<sub>2</sub> to useful fuels, sunlight is ideal since it is the largest energy source accessible to humanity. During this project, 117 publications resulted. In one case, a solar cell producing &gt; 3 volts was assembled to power electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen under un-assistant conditions. &nbsp;This is the largest voltage known for a three active layer system and has allowed the powering of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO conversion without any additional bias for the first time from an affordable, stable solar cell. Importantly, the first solar cell-catalyst system known to not involve any precious metals was made through this project which allowed for the conversion of water to H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> at a practical efficiency (~4% solar-to-fuel) with practical, scalable materials. The device was shown to operate for extended durations without significant loss of performance. &nbsp;This technology holds significant promise for use as a solar fuel generator with only water and sunlight added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> In addition to publications and advancements in energy harvesting and catalytic technology, a total of 24 graduate students, 24 undergraduate students, 27 REU/RET participants, and ten postdoctoral scholars were supported by this award.&nbsp; The four faculty seed grant recipients supported by the award contributed to over 30 publications and all of these received independent external funding, including two NSF Career Awards. Four annual conferences were held and featured 165 student presentations to large peer audiences and annual workshops were held for high school and middle school teachers in the region.&nbsp; These annual workshops increased instructors&rsquo; teaching efficacy and knowledge of content related to material science and the water-energy-nexus theme. They lasted two weeks each summer and each included 15 teachers. Eight Women in Stem (WIS) seminars and eleven Science Cafes were held across the three jurisdictions of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. The WIS seminars raised student awareness of STEM careers and women who are successful in those fields. Women who are positive role models in STEM careers spoke at various institutions including PUIs, HBCUs, community colleges and secondary schools. Each speaker discussed the path to her STEM career, what females today can do to be successful in STEM fields, and opportunities available for students interested in getting involved in STEM. The Science Cafes had researchers discuss current research directly related to the water-energy-food nexus and the roles that chemistry plays in solving important energy-related problems in casual settings open to and geared towards the general public.&nbsp; Six science outreach videos were developed to educate the general public on solar-based renewable energy.</p><br> <p>            Last
