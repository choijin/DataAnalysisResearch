<AbstractNarration>With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Paul Rupar of the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa is conducting research to synthesize and characterize novel conjugated polymers with unique electronic properties. Polymers are ubiquitous in modern life.  Common uses of polymers include plastics, surface coatings, and cosmetic products.  Conjugated polymers are a sub-class of polymers that can be conductive and have numerous emerging applications, including use in display technologies, solar cells, and electronic devices.    In addition to advancing fundamental chemistry knowledge, this research aims to yield new polymers with potential applications in selective gas sensors, organic solar cells, and organic transistors.  As a part of the broader impacts of this project, the Rupar Group collaborates with Alabama Science in Motion (ASIM), a statewide program that provides engaging laboratory experiments to high school students and teachers.  A novel ASIM educational experiment module is being developed to help to enhance STEM education in west Alabama, a region with a high proportion of under-represented minorities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the design, synthesis and characterization of novel boron-containing conjugated polymers.  The empty p-orbital on 3-coordinate boron is a strong pi-acceptor that increases the electron affinity of a polymer when conjugated with the pi-system.  Using computational modeling, the Rupar group has identified polymers containing fused boron rings (e.g. borafluorenes) as promising electron-deficient conjugated polymers, potentially useful as n-type conducting materials.  The inclusion of the boron also provides the potential for polymers with inherent sensing capabilities.  The main thrusts of this research are: 1) to synthesize boron-containing conjugated homopolymers and study the n-type conducting properties; 2) to explore the potential application of boron-containing conjugated polymers in detecting electron-rich gas; and 3) to develop novel synthetic approaches to boron-containing donor/acceptor copolymers (which contain alternating electron-accepting and electron-donating moieties) as narrow band-gap conjugated polymers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research was to synthesize conjugated polymers containing borafluorenes and related borole-containing moieties.  These polymers are designed to be electron deficient and potentially capable of performing as n-type conjugated polymers and electron acceptors in organic solar voltaics.   A series of boron containing conjugated polymers, borafluorene small molecules, and related molecules were synthesized and studied.  Extensive knowledge of the fundamental properties of boron containing conjugated systems was generated.  However, attempts at using these borafluorene conjugated polymers in conjugated materials were not as successful as hoped, in part due to their air sensitivity.    In a serendipitous discovery, a group of borafluorene containing molecules with the highest reported Stokes shifts were characterized.  Future research will explore the fundamental properties of these molecules and their potential sensing applications.  In addition to published papers, the funding provided support for the training of 4 PhD students (three have graduated, one is still in progress) and many undergraduate students.   These students gained experience in handling air sensitive materials, polymer design, polymer synthesis and characterization.   The three PhD students who have graduated are currently employed in the chemical industry and in research laboratories.    With Alabama Science in Motion, regional high school teachers were introduced to polymer laboratories for potential use in the high school curriculum.
