<AbstractNarration>The Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) and the University of Rhode Island (URI) together reach 1500+ students annually through general education and introductory geoscience courses. These institutions train a subset of those students as geoscience majors (~70 URI majors presently) for societally important positions in education, industry, federal agencies, conservation organizations, and more. The American Geosciences Institute 2014 Workforce Report predicts a workforce shortage of 135,000 geoscientists by 2022. This imminent need for well-prepared geoscientists must be answered by the engagement of academic geoscience departments. The intellectual merit of this project is multi-layered. A tractable set of changes is being implemented in Rhode Island public institutions of higher education to yield measurable outcomes, in terms of increases in the number and diversity of geoscience majors. A variety of experiences are being integrated into and scaffolded with the undergradute curriculum that are based on research-identified recommendations and strategies to reduce barriers for becoming and remaining a geoscience major. The relative importance of each factor for increasing student involvement and greater diversity in the geosciences is being evaluated, with specific attention to the case of 2YC-4YC geoscience transfer students. In this way, future activities (in Rhode Island and elsewhere) can focus policies and resources on what will make the largest difference in student decisions to become and remain geoscientists. Overall, this project seeks to promote science and advance national prosperity by strengthening the geoscience workforce, both through direct engagement with students and sharing of successful strategies with other organizations and institutions of higher learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing the growing importance of two-year colleges (2YCs) as the starting point for students who earn bachelor's degrees at 4-year institutions (4YCs), CCRI and URI are implementing a number of modifications and new programs that are aimed at increasing the number and diversity of geoscientists in each institution's programs. The goals of this program are to: (1) improve the 2YC/4YC transfer rate in the geosciences in Rhode Island; (2) increase the number and diversity of geoscience graduates; (3) enhance student training in geoscience and STEM-related fields; and, (4) contribute to the evidence base of successful practices in geoscience education. In this collaboration, CCRI and URI are putting in place both on- and off-campus components, including: targeted improvements to the gateway course to the major; systematic enhancements of the undergraduate curriculum in terms of data-rich activities, collaborative learning, and field experiences; streamlining of the transfer path into geosciences; a new research-focused course that is team-taught by CCRI and URI faculty; a workshop engaging students in the process of applying for internships and research opportunities; a series of information-sharing and mentoring events for prospective geoscience majors. A developmental evaluation strategy with formative and summative assessments is being applied to monitor progress in achieving project goals. This project is expected to increase the number and diversity of the pool of geosciences majors and new, practicing geoscientists. For all students, this project will have bettered the undergraduate experience and provided new mentorship and paths to professional success. Changes made to the URI and CCRI curricular programs will endure, and new community building events will foster a more engaged community, with untold positive impacts. In addition, this project will cement fledgling collaborations between 2YC and 4YC Rhode Island faculty in the geosciences, paving the way for multiple future projects. Presentations at regional and national meetings and publications resulting from this work have the potential to transfer findings and enhance experiences in the larger geoscience community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Within this project our primary goals were to (1) improve the rate of transfer from a 2 year college (Community College) to a 4 year college (University) in the field of geosciences, (2) increase the number and diversity of geoscience  graduates, (3) enhance student training so gradautes will be more employable  in geoscience and STEM-related fields, and (4) contribute to the  evidence base of successful practices in enhanced geoscience student  numbers and diversity.  Within the Geosciences, field and research experiences have been shown to help retain  students in the geosciences, less known about how and why this  is the case.  Results indicate  that students in a field research experience were influenced by  five main factors: increasing self-efficacy, discovering people as  resources, developing a geoscience identity, making connections with  Earth, and maintaining interest. The first three factors have important  social aspects that were impacted by the design of the field  experience. The field experience contributed  to the students developing the self-efficacy to succeed as a  geoscientist and the geoscience identity needed to pursue a geoscience  career. Therefore, these affective reactions of the students to the  field experience, rather than cognitive reactions, played a key role  with regard to impacting their intention to major in the geosciences.  Developing personal / professional connections between instructors and students is a primary and affective method for retaining students within the Geosciences.  This was a consistent theme across all of the activities conducted under the project, including any field based activities, a problem based research course, and academic and professional advising at the Community College and University.  This result has strong implications across all fields and for STEM specifcally.       Last Modified: 09/04/2020       Submitted by: Brian K Savage]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
