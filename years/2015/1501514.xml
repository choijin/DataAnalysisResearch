<AbstractNarration>Deforestation is one of the leading threats to biodiversity around the world. When large areas of forests are cut down, often to accommodate humans, the chance of extinction increases for plants and animals that remain in isolated fragments. For plants, the movement of pollen and seeds has the potential to connect these pieces of forest and increase long-term population health. This project will examine how pollen and seed movement among forest fragments influences genetic connectivity and diversity, thereby minimizing risk of extinction. This study is located in a rapidly developing region in northwest Ecuador where the local communities live alongside a high diversity of plants and animals. The results of this study will be shared directly with local owners of forest fragments, local schools and communities, as well as regional government agencies in charge of managing forests in the area. As part of this project, workshops will be given to local communities describing the biology and importance of forest fragments. US undergraduate volunteers will be recruited to participate in the proposed research and will receive training in field and laboratory techniques. This project will support the research and training of a doctoral student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Neotropical palm Oenocarpus bataua is unusual in that seeds stay attached to established seedlings for several years. This characteristic affords the investigators the ability to separate the genetic contributions of pollen and seed dispersal within the same individuals by genotyping both seeds and leaves. Established seedlings throughout 5 additional forest fragments will be sampled for seed and leaf tissue. These samples will be combined with tissue samples already collected from 12 fragments. Microsatellite markers will be used to genotype these tissues and results will be used to estimate whether pollen or seed dispersal is contributing more to effective genetic diversity and genetic structure.  The same data will be used to identify pollen and seed sources within and across fragments, as well as to compare genetic structure between fragments and continuous forest. The research will improve upon current approaches for studying gene flow of fragmented plant populations by unambiguously determining the separate and joint contributions of pollen and seed dispersal to realized patterns of genetic variation. This research is complemented by a simulation model that generates predictions of how restricting either or both pollen and seed dispersal will affect levels of genetic diversity and structure among forest fragments.</AbstractNarration>

One type of global change that is threatening many species of plants and animals across the world is the loss of habitat and the fragmentation of existing habitat, where formerly large areas of habitat are reduced to isolated patches. Habitat loss and fragmentation potentially reduces the movement of genes among populations, which is predicted to lead to a decrease in levels of genetic diversity, threaten the viability of fragmented populations, and lead to increased probabilities of extinction. In the case of plants, however, genes are moved through both pollen and seed, and it remains unclear whether both pollen or seed movement are negatively affected by habitat loss or fragmentation, or whether only one or both processes will be able to maintain levels of genetic diversity among fragmented plant populations. Determining this is importantly for understanding how to best manage plant populations in fragmented landscape to ensure their continued survival.</p> <p>In this project, we assessed the levels of genetic diversity contributed by pollen and seed movement among fragmented seedling populations of the palm tree <em>Oenocarpus bataua</em> in northwest Ecuador, a global biodiversity hotspot. We found that pollen movement contributes significantly higher levels of genetic diversity than seed movement, indicating that seed movement may be particularly susceptible to the negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. This provides insights into how to best manage these fragmented populations to ensure levels of genetic diversity are maintained over time. By highlighting the role of seed movement in restricting levels of genetic diversity, it is likely that promoting higher levels of seed movement in the landscape will lead to increased levels of genetic diversity. Using satellite imagery, we found that the amount of forest surrounding each forest fragment was associated with levels of genetic diversity provided by seed movement, which suggests that reforestation efforts that increase the overall level of forest cover in the landscape will likely lead to increased seed movement, and thus higher levels of genetic diversity. Also importantly, the study revealed the ability of pollen movement to contribute high levels of genetic diversity even in degraded landscapes, which likely buffers fragmented populations again the negative genetic consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation. Finally, we found that the rarity of an individual seedling's genotype was a strong predictor of its probability of survival and recruitment, suggesting that a loss of genetic diversity and subsequent loss of rare genotypes would negatively impact overall population growth.</p> <p>In addition, this project provided training in field and laboratory techniques for 3 undergraduates, 2 graduate students, and 4 Ecuadorian residents of the study area. Students and local residents shared the results of the research at national and international scientific conferences in Ecuador and the United States of America, as well as with the broader public through informational booklets, and audio visual material (DVDs and videos) posted on YouTube and distributed in local communities in Ecuador, and through presentations at local environmental fairs attended by local residents of the study area.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/25/2017<br>      Modified by: Luke&nbsp;Browne</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501514/1501514_10355423_1497977456395_P7123668--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501514/1501514_10355423_1497977456395_P7123668--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Oenocarpus bataua seedling"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501514/1501514_10355423_1497977456395_P7123668--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Oenocarpus bataua seedling"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Seedling of the palm tree Oenocarpus bataua</div> <div class="imageCredit">Luke Browne</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Luke&nbsp;Browne</div> <div class="imageTitle">Oenocarpus bataua seedling</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501514/1501514_10355423_1497977728980_REMACH-LANDSCAPE-5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501514/1501514_10355423_1497977728980_REMACH-LANDSCAPE-5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Deforestation in northwest Ecuador"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501514/1501514_10355423_1497977728980_REMACH-LANDSCAPE-5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Deforestation in northwest Ecuador"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Levels of deforestation in northwest Ecuador are high, leaving many patches of forest that are isolated from one another and surrounded by farmland</div> <div class="imageCredit">Max Aliaga</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Luke&nbsp;Browne</div> <div class="imageTitle">Deforestation in northwest Ecuador</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501514/1501514_10355423_1497977896925_REMACH-LANDSCAPE-8--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501514/1501514_10355423_1497977896925_REMACH-LANDSCAPE-8--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Forest fragment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501514/1501514_10355423_1497977896925_REMACH-LANDSCAPE-8--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Forest fragment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Isolated patch of forest where genetic diversity of the palm species Oenocarpus bataua was sampled</div> <div class="imageCredit">Max Aliaga</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Luke&nbsp;Browne</div> <div class="imageTitle">Forest fragment</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
