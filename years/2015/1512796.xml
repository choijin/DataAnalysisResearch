<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator proposes to solve an issue that arises from a critical need in the success of the next-generation hard drive.  The issue involves a technique for measuring temperature at nano-scales on the hard drive, where failure occurs, that has so far not been done.  The research partnership involves researchers from industry (Seagate Corporation), University of California - Berkeley's Mechanical Engineering Department and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Engagement with the Students for Environmental Energy Development (SEED) group at UC-Berkeley and local high schools will be conducted using the existing program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GOALI project proposes to use photoluminescence nanoparticles to measure temperature at around 10 nm spatial resolutions.  Such a high spatial resolution is inspired by the industry's (Seagate) need in a new generation hard drive technology called HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) where the device failure has to do with temperature at nanoscale regions.  Preliminary results have demonstrated the potential of the photoluminescence technique for temperature measurement.  The spectral shape and lifetime of photoluminescence emission will be correlated as a function of local temperature.  Experiments along with modeling will be used to understand HAMR being developed by Seagate, the industrial partner.  Although targeting Seagate's HAMR application, these capabilities would be broadly applicable to all sorts of thermal measurement challenges at the nanoscale, including thermal characterization inside a single cell, and of other commercial nanoscale devices such as transistors, memory, or optoelectronics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Modern technologies and global energy demand are driving a need for increasingly sophisticated thermal characterization and control.  Poor heat dissipation limits the performance of nanotechnologies like data storage, optoelectronics, and integrated circuit devices.  Thus the ability to measure temperature at the nanoscale (~10s of nm) is important for identifying failure modes in these technologies and ensuring their full functionality, yet conventional techniques are unsuitable because they lack the spatial resolution necessary to probe nanoscale components, possess poor high-temperature stability or sensitivity, or require physical contact with the sample which perturbs its operation or even alters the temperature itself.  Other examples of applications with challenging environments that could benefit from improved nanoscale thermometry include measuring temperature locally within living cells or during chemical reactions at a catalyst.  In many ways far-field optical methods are a natural response to the quandary of challenging environments, because the light originates, and is detected, far away from the sample.  However, conventional far-field optical methods are fundamentally diffraction limited to a spatial resolution of several hundred nanometers at best, which is too coarse for the cutting edge applications mentioned above.  In this project we work to overcome these challenges by developing a far-field optical technique for temperature measurements with spatial resolution that breaks the diffraction limit.  By placing a single luminescent nanoparticle at the site of interest, the resolution is determined by the particle size rather than the wavelength of light, thereby enabling far-field imaging free from the conventional optical diffraction limits.  Our experiments demonstrated such single-point temperature measurements with individual nanoparticles of diameter 20 nm, and there is no fundamental reason why the technique could not be extended to even smaller nanoparticles.  The luminescence thermometer response followed the theoretically expected Arrhenius behavior with excellent repeatability among different nanoparticles from the same batch, which is important for practical deployment of this technique because it means the response can simply be calibrated once for the batch, rather than individually for every nanoparticle.  Because the temperature signal originates from such a small region (a single nanoparticle), the intensity of the exciting laser source is orders of magnitude higher than in traditional luminescence thermometry.  Although conservative estimates suggested that self-heating effects should be insignificant, surprisingly our initial experiments indicated that the apparent self-heating was substantial, even as measured using two different signatures (luminescence color and lifetime).  Hence, we undertook extensive additional experimentation, varying the substrate thermal conductivity, laser spot diameter, and contact resistance between nanoparticle and substrate.  These experiments, along with new rate equation modeling by our collaborators, clearly demonstrate and confirm for the first time that the apparent self heating is indeed an artifact.  Thus, the findings of this study have important implications for single-particle luminescence thermometry, with applications ranging from reliability engineering of nanoscale data storage and electronic devices to fundamental studies of temperature in tissues down to the cellular level.  To demonstrate this capability, we applied the nanoparticle thermometer technique to two representative device configurations, by measuring the nanoscale hotspots that result from (i) optical heating via a tightly focused laser beam and (ii) nonuniform Joule heating caused by a geometric effect known as current crowding.
