<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to develop a new measure of the value of time, effort, money, and other resources devoted to the financial sector. Firms in this sector of the economy develop expertise that allows them to participate in markets with limited (asymmetric) information.  For example, a mortgage company must assess the credit-worthiness of potential borrowers. Property insurers evaluate the chance of damage from natural disasters. Venture capitalists decide whether or not to invest in a start-up business.  Developing expertise is expensive; it takes time and effort. Expertise is valuable to the individual firm, since more expertise means better decisions and eventually higher returns. Expertise is also valuable to the wider society as a whole.  Society is better off when credit-worthy people can get mortgages (but very risky loans are not made), when insurers require that builders and owners mitigate natural disaster risks, and when the best new firms can get capital to expand. In the language of economics, this kind of expertise is socially valuable because it reduces the effects of asymmetric information and allows us to realize gains from trade that are a net benefit.  The principal investigator plans to develop a method for measuring how the social value of additional expertise compares to the private value.  The results could help us understand how financial markets contribute to US prosperity, and whether the US economy would be better off if more talented individuals went into medicine, technology, or research rather than into financial sector jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to derive an expression for the ratio of marginal social value to marginal private value of expertise. If firms are optimizing, the marginal private value is equal to the marginal cost of expertise, so it is possible to understand how social value compares to costs. By focusing on the ratio of marginal social value to marginal private value, he is able to avoid making any assumptions about the technology that leads to expertise acquisition.  He will use a sufficient statistic approach to measure the ratio, decomposing the ration into parts that correspond to measurable quantities for different branches of the financial sector. The results will provide empirical evidence on whether or not talent and effort that is now employed in the US financial sector might be more valuable in other pursuits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project proposes and implements a method for estimating the marginal social value of investing in financial expertise. The quantity to be measured is defined as:  r = (Marginal social value of expertise) / (Marginal private value of expertise)  r is an object of interest because, under the assumption that marginal cost is equated to marginal private value, it also measures the ratio of marginal social  value to marginal cost. A value greater than one indicates that the marginal social value exceeds the marginal cost, so a policy to encourage increased investment in expertise would be desirable, and vice versa.  The first step is to propose a theory of what financial expertise is and how it?s used.  The premise is that financial markets are characterized by asymmetric information and "expertise" is a technology for overcoming informational disadvantages. Expertise allows traders to select better trades for themselves, which provides private benefits. As a side effect, it makes asset markets more liquid, which improves the allocation of resources and provides social benefits. At the margin, private and social benefits are not necessarily aligned, and which one is greater is an empirical question.  The second and most important step is to show that the ratio of these two benefits can be decomposed into measurable sufficient statistics: profits, asset prices, default rates and their elasticities with respect to a capital inflow.  The final step is to implement the measurement empirically for the junk bond underwriting market. The main finding is that r = 0.16.
