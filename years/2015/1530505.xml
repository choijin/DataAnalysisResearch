<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1530505 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Bonner, James C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the U.S. component of a joint US-European proposal submitted concurrently to the European Research Area for Safe Implementation of Innovative Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ERA-NET SIINN) in coordination with NSF. The International Collaboration on Nanotube Safety (ICONS) proposal entitled - An integrated testing strategy for mechanistically assessing the respiratory toxicity of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes- creates a complementary and interdisciplinary collaboration between North Carolina State University (NCSU) in the U.S. with three European laboratories in Romania, Belgium, and Germany to integrate transnational expertise in the toxicology of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), which is likely to find increasing practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Collaboration on Nanotube Safety (ICONS) project will be a coordinated effort to understand the mechanistic basis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) toxicity and the physico-chemical parameters that result in toxic effects. Experimental strategy includes - detailed characterization of physico-chemical properties of pristine and functionalized MWCNT, testing them in several in vitro assays, in vivo studies using oropharyngeal aspiration in rats and mice for identifying relevant and meaningful MWCNT candidates, and a 28-day in vivo inhalation study in rats for validation of in vivo relevance, hazard and dose-response characterization. A single and consistent source of MWCNT will be used with various surface functionalizations. NCSU will coordinate and perform in vitro cell testing of MWCNT samples with the Belgium partner to determine the reliability of cultured human lung cells for predicting in vivo outcomes in rats or mice exposed to MWCNT by oropharyngeal aspiration (NCSU and Belgium) or inhalation exposure (Germany). Detailed characterization of functionalized MWCNT in media and tissues (Romania) will complement the bioassays. NCSU will coordinate dissemination of the findings of the ICONS project via a publicly accessible website. The expected outcome of the proposed project is the broad impact through promoting the safe development of nanotechnology through dissemination of the interdisciplinary research findings and NCSU will coordinate findings to the public through a newly created ICONS website that will be linked to other accessible nanotechnology websites. In addition, data will be deposited in the JRC NANOhub database, part of the European Commission Joint Research Center, Institute for Health and Consumer Protection (IHCP). Further, an important expected outcome is that ICONS will serve as a model for U.S.-European interdisciplinary testing of nanomaterials that will promote the safe development of nanotechnology and prevent potential future lung diseases caused by occupational or environmental exposure to nanomaterials. It is anticipated that the ICONS will increase partnerships between academia, industry, and government, thus enhancing economic and safe development of nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
