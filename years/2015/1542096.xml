<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to participate in the Fourteenth Summer School on Exotic Beam Physics at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, August 2 - 8, 2015.  The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate students who are actively involved in research and postdocs (within 2 years of their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to nurture future scientists so that the community will have sufficient manpower to effectively use the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online. In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the elements to the enhancement of national security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    One of current frontiers in nuclear physics is the study of exotic nuclei that have very unusual ratios of protons to neutrons compared to stable nuclei. The investigation of such nuclei lying away from the stability line is critical for understanding the synthesis of nuclei in stellar explosions as well as the nature of the nuclear forces that bind atomic nuclei together. The science progress is driven by the development of exotic beams in present and next-generation rare isotope beam facilities including Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) which is currently under construction on the campus of Michigan State University.  Nuclear physics is a very broad and diverse subject, influencing our knowledge on subjects as diverse as weakly-bound nuclei, many-body quantum theory, the super heavy elements, and the inner structure of neutron stars. There are also a number of applications based on nuclear science and technologies, such as medical diagnostics, material science, and national security. The Exotic Beam Summer School 2015 (EBSS2015), which was the fourteenth installment of EBSS series, was held during August 2-8, 2015 to educate and train a next-generation of scientists that drive researches with rare isotope beams. The school EBSS2015 was held at Florida State University and this was the first event hosted by the institution from the Association for Research at University Nuclear Accelerators (ARUNA) which joined as one of organizing boards in 2014.  The fourteenth Exotic Beam Summer School (EBSS2015) was jointly organized by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University, and ARUNA. Currently, ARUNA consists of nuclear accelerator laboratories at Florida State University, Ohio University, Texas A&amp;M University, Kentucky University, University of Notre Dame, University of Washington, Hope College, Union College, University of Massachusetts-Lowell, and Triangle University Nuclear Laboratory. The school is funded by these institutions, as well as the US National Science Foundation and Department of Energy. In EBSS2015, 40 participants (graduate and undergraduate students) attended the school and received two types of training:  1. During the morning, they received lectures given by experts in the fields of exotic beam physics. These lectures focused on experimental and theoretical aspects of nuclear physics as well as interdisciplinary subjects such as nuclear astrophysics and data management.  2. During the afternoon, students participated in a variety of hands-on activities, which dealt with specific techniques and tools used in the field of exotic beam physics and various applications.  As a unique feature of this summer school series, the combination of lectures and hands-on activities allows students to apply introduced materials immediately in practice.   Besides, the participants in the school also presented their own research to their peers and the lecturers in the poster session and students seminar. The interaction between the students and the experts is an important component of the program.  In 2008, the United States Department of Energy approved the design and construction of the new National User Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University. FRIB will provide beams of exotic nuclei with unmatched intensities, exceeding what is available today by orders of magnitude.  Intense beams available at FRIB facilitate a wide variety of studies in nuclear structure, astrophysics, fundamental symmetries and societal applications. There is a large community of scientists interested in working with rare isotope beams; for example, the FRIB User Organization currently has over 1,300 members and is growing. The FRIB project has passed the 50-percent completion mark and the development of new devices and equipment is in full progress. In order for FRIB to be successful when it starts operation, there must be a workforce trained in both the physics of exotic beams and in the practical techniques of carrying out an experiment. This summer school series is designed to specifically address this need - to ensure that a new generation of scientists from a broad range of institutions and background, is trained, motivated, and equipped to push the field forward to new and important breakthroughs.  The school web site is available online at http://fribusers.org/gatherings/ebss2015.html with a link to lecture slides used during the summer school.
