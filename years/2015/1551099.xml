<AbstractNarration>Despite recent gains, women still remain underrepresented in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields. This is of national concern because of the U.S. STEM workforce is vital to maintaining our status as a global leader and competitor. This research examines the role of gender and ethnic intergroup ideologies in creating an unwelcoming social climate in male-dominated STEM domains. These ideologies are prescriptive sociopolitical beliefs, such as the belief that men and women are naturally suited to do different jobs and they should stick to those areas alone. These beliefs influence attitudes and behaviors, and can result in a negative environment for learning and working.  These negative environments can reduce women's interest and persistence in STEM domains. This research crosses dimensions of intergroup perceptions, and examines novel hypotheses in several experiments and a longitudinal study. The proposed studies examine both the effect of experimentally manipulating the ideologies, as well as the effect of naturally occurring variation in ideology endorsement on the experiences of women and ethnic minorities in STEM fields. The goal is to understand factors that affect persistence in STEM fields, and ways to enhance persistence. Ultimately, this research could increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, and U.S. competitiveness in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across four studies, gender ideology is manipulated experimentally to test whether (1) assimilation (women adapting their behaviors to a male-dominated environment) and segregation (men and women should stick to their areas of expertise) perspectives increase agreement with gendered math and science stereotypes, (2) these perspectives are particularly prevalent where they have the potential to do the most harm - among men in male-dominated STEM fields, and (3) the presence of such perspectives cause women to feel excluded and unwelcome. Two additional studies explore points of overlap and divergence in reactions to gender versus ethnic diversity messages. While women are predicted to respond most favorably to a gender blind perspective, past research shows that ethnic group members respond more positively to a multicultural perspective. Finally, a large-scale longitudinal study examines how naturally occurring variation in gender ideology endorsement relates in a prospective fashion to selecting an academic major. These studies will provide the basis for developing interventions aimed at gender and ethnic ideology beliefs in STEM environments, to promote a culture of inclusion and belonging. They will speak to how beliefs about group differences versus similarities contribute to students' decisions to pursue or avoid STEM majors and careers, and address points of overlap versus divergence in reactions by women versus ethnic students. These findings ultimately could increase participation and innovativeness in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project explored "Gender Ideologies," which are prescriptive sociopolitical beliefs about how gender -- as a social category -- should be treated. The Gender Blind ideology advocates avoiding category distinctions altogether, treating people as individuals without regard to their membership in a gender category. The Assimilationist ideology argues, "We are all the same," but that sameness is defined by dominant group (aka male) norms. Subordinate members will be treated fairly and without reference to their gender category membership so long as they assimilate to the dominant group's culture. The Gender Aware viewpoint is defined by positive regard towards women, coupled with the recognition of category distinctions and a desire to preserve them to build a strong society that makes room for group differences. Finally, the Segregationist ideology argues that gender group differences are so large, society is better off if men and women simply stick to their separate spheres of expertise.  Using a correlational design with 2622 undergraduate students we found that men in increasingly male dominated academic majors were more likely to endorse the two negative gender ideologies: Assimilationism -- that women should adapt and conform to masculine work norms in order to succeed, and Segregationism -- that men and women should pursue traditional social roles and careers. Moreover, these men were less likely to endorse Gender Blindness -- that attention to gender should be minimized.

Finally, in work comparing Gender to Ethnic Ideologies, we observed parallel patterns such that in examining factors that might predict support for compensatory policies designed to bridge the gender and race gaps, respectively, ideological perspectives that minimize group differences (Blind and Assimilation) were associated with lower support whereas recognition of group demarcations (the Aware ideologies) was associated with greater support for such policies. These patterns of relationships with the ideologies held even when accounting for other related personal beliefs such as political conservatism and broad ideologies such as system justification. The research indicates the importance of ideological perspectives social perceivers adopt regarding gender and ethnic group differences for both the social perceiver (e.g., our perceptions and reactions to others) as well as for the targets of these intergroup perceptions (e.g., how comfortable and welcome we feel in a given work or academic environment).
