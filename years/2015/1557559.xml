<AbstractNarration>This project designs a novel approach for adaptive radiotherapy treatment of head and neck cancer. Statistical and computational methods are applied to Big Data, collected from cohorts of patients, to tailor precise treatment for a new patient who has similar characteristics to a specific cohort.  This award supports initiation of a collaborative research project between four complementary domains: clinical, image analysis and visualization, high-dimensional data management, and statistical learning.  The empirically-derived treatment rules developed in this project have the potential to improve the standard of care.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project defines novel reinforcement learning techniques which account for multidimensional outcomes and patient preferences.  The project extends the state of the art by taking into account both spatial data (such as medical images) and nonspatial data (such as demographics and toxicity) in the development of the treatment rules. The approach further takes into account the patient's preference with regard to side effects.  The methods developed may be used to derive optimal treatment strategies across not only a variety of cancer diagnoses, but other chronic conditions that require making multiple decisions that must weigh the tradeoffs between efficacy and toxicity, including mental health disorders, substance abuse diseases, and diabetes.  This award is supported by the National Institutes of Health Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative in partnership with the National Science Foundation Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to develop proof-of-concept computational methodology that will support the construction of a sophisticated precision model of patient-specific outcomes for head and neck cancer therapy. The project helps plan a collaboration across experts from four domains of complementary expertise: radiation oncology, medical imaging, dimensionality reduction, and statistical learning.   We have created methodology and a prototype precision-driven model that is able to handle multi-dimensional, sparse patient cohort data, and can integrate spatial and nonspatial features, as well as expert knowledge, in the decision process. The project defined novel learning techniques which account for multidimensional outcomes. We created novel techniques for extracting informative and relevant features from spatial (e.g, medical imaging) and nonspatial data. Additionally, we introduced novel clustering and domain knowledge integration techniques to generate more meaningful features which may be used in the reinforcement learning algorithm.   The prototype methods developed in the project may be used to derive optimal treatment strategies across not only a variety of cancer diagnoses, but also across other chronic conditions which require making multiple decisions and which must weigh the tradeoffs between efficacy and toxicity, including mental health disorders, substance abuse diseases, and diabetes. This project further helped establish an ongoing collaboration among the quantitative sciences and biomedicine.
