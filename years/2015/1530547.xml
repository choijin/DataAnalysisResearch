<AbstractNarration>Currently the color of aluminum surfaces is achieved via dye- and pigment-based coating methods that have limited functionality, are vulnerable to scratching, and subject to color degradation when exposed to ultra-violet, heat, and the elements. This award supports fundamental research to investigate a novel method based on physical rather than chemical processes that will expand the range of color, function, and therefore, application of surface treatment. Chemical coloration methods rely on mostly absorption of light by dyes and pigments deposited on the surface, whereas physical coloration creates color by controlling the interaction of light with nano-engineered surfaces, coatings, and materials. The researched "color-by-design" method draws inspiration from brilliant examples of bio-physical color found in nature, such as peacock tail feathers, butterfly wings, and the iridescent scales of a jewel beetle. Anodized aluminum is a commonly used material in many industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer products. The reseached physical coloration method, which will enhance the appearance, durability, scalability, and functionality of anodized aluminum, has the potential to be broadly applied across many areas of manufacturing. Efforts will be made to involve under-represented groups in the research, train students at various levels and include the research results in curricula and outreach. The impact on device technology is expected to be significant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research project is to develop an industry-scalable method for the physical, rather than chemical coloration of aluminum surfaces. The resultant colors will have higher hue, saturation, and brightness values, as well as improved functionality, ease of maintenance, and resistance to the elements. The method will control optical properties, interference and diffraction in materials at the nano- and micro-scales. Key physical phenomena to be investigated and utilized include local electronic processes and quantized plasmonic resonances in metal nanoparticles, long-range optical diffraction in periodic, or random and quasi-periodic nano-patterned dielectrics, as well as wave-phase modulations in ultra-thin (less than 10 nm) absorbing layers. These processes will be implemented via inherently scalable manufacturing techniques, including sputtering thin-film deposition, spray and dip coating, electrochemical baths, electroless deposition, and nano-stamping. The combination of these approaches is expected to expand the colors and finishes currently available in industry catalogs, enable the control of opacity, luster, brightness, and iridescence via purely physical means, and yield actionable and test-backed approaches for transitioning physical coloration techniques to a manufacturing setting.</AbstractNarration>

Explore pathways to field and industrial adoption of the physical coloration technologies and methods we have developed and are continuously developing. Train the students in all aspects of experimental skills, theoretical simulation, and scientific writings (e.g., conference presentation and paper preparation).   To these ends, we have:  Developed a suite of physical coloration technologies and methods into a scalable and manufacturable state, that are being adopted for scalable and manufacturable coloration and real-time and/or static spectral shaping with already proven uses in biophilic lighting and distributed colorimetric sensing.  Advanced it into an early phase of maturity that is ready to undergo field-test of its use in long-range and remote colorimetric sensing, in collaborations with DoD and DHS users, for early warning and real-time detection, monitoring and reporting of toxic industrial compounds and CWA (chemical warfare agents). Analyzed and identified the underlying cause and the pros and cons of iridescent coloration, or the  angular dependence of physical coloration based on industrial aluminum, and the effect of its impurity. Explored the use of the plasmonic resonance photonic modes in a polymer coating layer deposited on top of patterned metallic films and optical fibers, for enhancing and spectrum-shaping the structural color.  Extended the research of spectral-shaping and spectral-engineering approaches, via a startup co-founded by co-PI Gustavo Fernandes, to biophilic lighting for improving mental and physical health (e.g. depression, PTSD, and undersea and nightshift workers). Extended local small-area spectral-shaping by polymer coating to active colorimetric sensing and coating over large area and long-range (meters to kilometers), via collaborative efforts with the DoD and DHS users and researchers, and to transitions to two start-ups: FOCS LL and Gradie Inc.   In conclusion, we have met the objective of this project ? developing scalable and manufacturable physical coloration methods and their transitioning to industrial and field uses.   While the latter normally would be a long term endeavor, we are happy to report on tangible successes in transitioning our physical coloration methods, processes, and recipes, developed in this project into scalable manufacturable technologies for colorimetric sensing and biophilic lighting.

A perhaps more cherished outcome is that we met the challenge for producing ?tomato red? by physical coloration from the industry that initiated this research program in the first place.  The student prime for that effort completed her PhD degree, and moved on to take a professorial position.
