<AbstractNarration>Many modern data analysis techniques and applications in machine&lt;br/&gt;learning try to learn what input data has the largest effects on the&lt;br/&gt;outputs. Rayleigh Quotients (RQ), or, more generally, RQ-type&lt;br/&gt;objective functions, are the basis of a mathematical technique that&lt;br/&gt;captures this information. This project conducts in-depth theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and algorithmic studies of three RQ-type optimizations: robust RQ&lt;br/&gt;optimizations that can handle data uncertainty, constrained RQ-type&lt;br/&gt;optimizations that can incorporate prior information from image&lt;br/&gt;segmentation or data clustering, and trace ratio optimizations that&lt;br/&gt;can perform multi-view spectral clustering.  This project improves&lt;br/&gt;understanding of this practically important and user-oriented&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory, creating computational methods that are embodied&lt;br/&gt;in open-source software.  It not only advances mathematical theory&lt;br/&gt;and optimization algorithms in data science, but trains computer&lt;br/&gt;science and computational mathematics graduate students in&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary knowledge and tools necessary to undertake the&lt;br/&gt;project successfully. The PIs also involve undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;in all aspects of this research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs expect to produce a unified view of RQ-type optimizations,&lt;br/&gt;reformulating them into linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems for&lt;br/&gt;which new variational principles can characterize the optimal&lt;br/&gt;solutions.  These new principles should expose the numerical linear&lt;br/&gt;algebra characteristics of the underlying problems, supporting the&lt;br/&gt;development of fast algorithms that exploit the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;properties and sparse data structure.</AbstractNarration>
