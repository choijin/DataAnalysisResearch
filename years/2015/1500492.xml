<AbstractNarration>This award supports an innovative Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) collaboration between Yup'ik communities and investigators with the goal of scientifically documenting Yup'ik knowledge and creating accessible repositories of this knowledge for future generations.  The PI/collaborative team will work with elder experts from six regional groups in southwest Alaska, to understand human-animal relations generally, as well as shifting attitudes toward keystone species, including; seals, moose, salmon, and whitefish.  This study is highly significant, addressing directly the research needs identified by Alaska Native, Yup'ik communities.  The previous NSF funded projects led by the same core team have been very successful with more than 10 major, well reviewed and well received, volumes published, including the critically acclaimed books: "Stories for Future Generations / Qulirat Qanemcit-llu Kinguvarcimalriit;"  "Yuungnaqpiallerput / The Way We Genuinely Live Masterworks of Yup'ik Science and Survival;" and "Ellavut / Our Yup'ik World and Weather: Continuity and Change on the Bering Sea Coast."  In addition, this methodology has created strong community/science collaborations and the co-production of valuable knowledge to both scientists and community member.  The research teams have been very interdisciplinary, including anthropologists and Yup'ik scholars, as well as other scientists e.g., geologists, archaeologists, biologist, and physicists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration, as the PI states, is the hallmark of this project, which builds on past partnerships between the scientific community and the Yup?ik community.  The project will engage institutional partners and Yup?ik collaborators from 23 communities in southwest Alaska.   The primary information-gathering tool will be a series of gatherings held both in local communities and the regional center of Bethel.   The research team and CEC staff pioneered this format working with elders a decade ago and have found that meetings with small groups of elder experts, younger community members and non-Native scientists for two-three-day gatherings devoted to a specific topic is a very effective means of both documenting traditional knowledge and addressing scientific questions.  Unlike interviews, during which elders answer questions posed by those who often do not hold the knowledge they seek, gatherings encourage elders to speak among their peers at the highest, most complex level.  The CEC method of elder gatherings in which scientists participate has been a very successful way of supporting the co-production of knowledge important not only for deeper understanding of key social and environmental issues of great interest in the region, and also for informing the public, resource managers, policy makers, and other stakeholders of the importance of these issues the region and beyond.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcomes Animal-human-environmental relations form a critical nexus among Inuit throughout the Arctic. This is no less true among Yup'ik people in southwest Alaska where subsistence hunting and fishing are everyday activities during which animals--seals, moose, bears, salmon--are not viewed as resources but as co-inhabitants of a sentient world and as nonhuman persons who, like the environment, are responsive to human thoughts, words, and deeds. Plants are equally responsive, as are the myriad other-than-human persons that animate the Yup'ik homeland.  Through a combination of elder gatherings and regional meetings, our project team worked to document the many qanruyutet (oral instructions) surrounding the treatment of animals. These include admonitions against speaking without reserve to animals, all of whom hear what we say and, conversely, speaking to animals exhorting their compassion. The availability of animals depends on the care they are given; careless treatment causes animals to disappear.   Just as qanruyutet guide relations among humans and between humans and animals, they guide human relations with the world around them. Yup'ik elders speak at length about these qanruyutet to teach their youth not merely the physical features of land and sea but ways in which one's actions elicit reactions in a responsive world. Elders encourage young people to pay attention to qanruyutet, believing that if their values improve, correct actions will follow.  Our project presented these views in two books published by the University of Alaska Press--Nunakun-gguq Ciutengqertut/They Say They Have Ears Through the Ground: Animal Essays from Southwest Alaska (Fienup-Riordan et al. 2020) and Yungcautnguuq Nunam Qainga Tamarmi/All the Land's Surface is Medicine: Edible and Medicinal Plants of Southwest Alaska (Fienup-Riordan, Rearden, Meade, and Jernigan 2020)--and one bilingual book published by the Alaska Native Language Center, Ircenrraat/Extraordinary Persons in Southwest Alaska (Rearden et al. 2021).   Intellectual merit From the beginning, the men and women guiding our work have maintained that the Yup'ik view of the world is important for everyone to know. Knowing the oral instructions for appropriate interaction between humans, nonhuman persons (animals), and other-than-human persons empowers Yup'ik men and women and keeps them safe on the land and sea. These views are also important for non-Natives to understand, as they come to appreciate the breadth and depth of Yup'ik knowledge.   Broader impacts The three books published as part of our project are as much about the future as about the past, providing a model for how an Indigenous community can use the written word to both document and share their history and oral traditions. Yup'ik elders and translators who worked together on this project seek a future in which the Yup'ik view of the world will be both recognized and valued.
