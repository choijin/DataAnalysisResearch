<AbstractNarration>Scientists established more than 30 years ago that the climate-related variability of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere over Earth's ice-age cycles was regulated by the ocean.  Hypotheses to explain how the ocean regulates atmospheric carbon dioxide have long been debated, but they have proven to be difficult to test.  Work proposed here will test one leading hypothesis, specifically that the ocean experienced greater density stratification during the ice ages.  That is, with greater stratification during the ice ages and slower replacement of deep water by cold dense water formed near the poles, the deep ocean would have held more carbon dioxide, which is produced by biological respiration of the organic carbon that constantly rains to the abyss in the form of dead organisms and organic debris that sink from the sunlit surface ocean.  To test this hypothesis, the degree of ocean stratification during the last ice age and the rate of deep-water replacement will be constrained by comparing the radiocarbon ages of organisms that grew in the surface ocean and at the sea floor within a critical region around Antarctica, where most of the replacement of deep waters occurs.  Completing this work will contribute toward improved models of future climate change.  Climate scientists rely on models to estimate the amount of fossil fuel carbon dioxide that will be absorbed by the ocean in the future.  Currently the ocean absorbs about 25% of the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels.  Most of this carbon is absorbed in the Southern Ocean (the region around Antarctica).  How this will change in the future is poorly known.  Models have difficulty representing physical conditions in the Southern Ocean accurately, thereby adding substantial uncertainty to projections of future ocean uptake of carbon dioxide.  Results of the proposed study will provide a benchmark to test the ability of models to simulate ocean processes under climate conditions distinctly different from those that occur today, ultimately leading to improvement of the models and to more reliable projections of future absorption of carbon dioxide by the ocean.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will add a research component to an existing scientific expedition to the Southern Ocean, in the region between the Ross Sea and New Zealand, that will collect sediment cores at three to five locations down the northern flank of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge at approximately 170Â°W.  The goal is to collect sediments at each location deposited since early in the peak of the last ice age.  This region is unusual in the Southern Ocean in that sediments deposited during the last ice age contain foraminifera, tiny organisms with calcium carbonate shells, in much greater abundance than in other regions of the Southern Ocean.  Foraminifera are widely used as an archive of several geochemical tracers of past ocean conditions.  In the proposed work the radiocarbon age of foraminifera that inhabited the surface ocean will be compared with the age of contemporary specimens that grew on the seabed.  The difference in age between surface and deep-swelling organisms will be used to discriminate between two proposed mechanisms of deep water renewal during the ice age:  formation in coastal polynyas around the edge of Antarctica, much as occurs today, versus formation by open-ocean convection in deep-water regions far from the continent.  If the latter mechanism prevails, then it is expected that surface and deep-dwelling foraminifera will exhibit similar radiocarbon ages.  In the case of dominance of deep-water formation in coastal polynyas, one expects to find very different radiocarbon ages in the two populations of foraminifera.  In the extreme case of greater ocean stratification during the last ice age, one even expects the surface dwellers to appear to be older than contemporary bottom dwellers because the targeted core sites lie directly under the region where the oldest deep waters return to the surface following their long circuitous transit through the deep ocean.  The primary objective of the proposed work is to reconstruct the water mass age structure of the Southern Ocean during the last ice age, which, in turn, is a primary factor that controls the amount of carbon dioxide stored in the deep sea.  In addition, the presence of foraminifera in the cores to be recovered provides a valuable resource for many other paleoceanographic applications, such as: 1) the application of nitrogen isotopes to constrain the level of nutrient utilization in the Southern Ocean and, thus, the efficiency of the ocean?s biological pump, 2) the application of neodymium isotopes to constrain the transport history of deep water masses, 3) the application of boron isotopes and boron/calcium ratios to constrain the pH and inorganic carbon system parameters of ice-age seawater, and 4) the exploitation of metal/calcium ratios in foraminifera to reconstruct the temperature (Mg/Ca) and nutrient content (Cd/Ca) of deep waters during the last ice age at a location near their source near Antarcitca.</AbstractNarration>

In the cores with the highest accumulation rate we found clear evidence for a change in redox status of the sediments at the end of the last ice age approximately 20,000 years ago.

In addition, Columbia undergraduate Kelly-Marie Powell used our cores to test the hypothesis that iron supplied to the iron-starved waters of the Southern Ocean by debris released from melting ice bergs (ice-rafted debris, IRD) would stimulate the growth of phytoplankton and thereby increase the amount of carbon sequestered in the deep sea.  She unambiguously falsified this hypothesis by showing that there is no correlation between the abundance of IRD and indicators of biological productivity.  From the analysis of seawater samples we found that lateral transport by isopycnal mixing is a large term in the mass budgets of 230Th and 231Pa in the Southern Ocean.  This discovery will require that certain conclusions about climate-related changes in ocean circulation based on sedimentary 231Pa/230Th ratios, relying on the assumption that net lateral redistribution of 231Pa occurs primarily or even entirely by advection, be reinterpreted. Under circumstances where is the mass budget of 230Th is affected by the lateral transport, as was found for the Southern Ocean (see above), the use of 230Th as a constant flux proxy for determining sediment accumulation rate has been thought to be compromised.   However, PhD student Frankie Pavia found a way to correct for the lateral transport of 230Th and thereby calculate thorium normalized fluxes of dust to this region of the Southern Ocean where dust supply is extremely low and, consequently, iron limitation is thought to regulate the efficiency of the biological carbon pump.      Results of this study support the growing body of evidence that the tight correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide and earthâs climate was caused by greater storage of carbon the deep ocean during the Pleistocene ice ages. This increased storage of carbon must be related in some way to a greater stratification of the deep water masses of the ocean under ice-age environmental conditions. Results from cores collected during this project further demonstrate that fertilization of marine plankton by iron released from melting ice bergs cannot be called on to explain the correlation between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and Earthâs climate.  From the study of seawater samples we have found that lateral mixing supplies a large amount of particle-reactive elements, that is, elements prone to absorption to particles, to the Southern Ocean.   This finding will require that certain interpretations of changes in ocean circulation over glacial to interglacial cycles be re-examined.  Application of a new approach that accounts for the lateral transport of 230Th allows the well-established thorium normalization approach for determining sediment accumulation rate to be applied in the Southern Ocean despite this lateral transport that we discovered.
