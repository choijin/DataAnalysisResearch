<AbstractNarration>This theoretical project will support current searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.  Although the Standard Model has been successful in describing the elementary particles that make up most of known matter in the Universe, many questions still remain unanswered.  The theoretical calculations by the investigator and his collaborators will support and suggest new avenues for low-energy experiments sensitive for signatures of new physics.  A prominent such example is the proton radius puzzle, where measuring the proton radius using electrons gives different results than using muons.  The PI will calculate corrections needed for the interpretation of the data and will study beyond the Standard Model hypotheses to explain the proton radius puzzle, along with suggesting new experiments for future testing of these ideas.  Another example is the case of precision electron-proton scattering experiments with polarized electrons, where the PI will do calculations relevant to extensions of the initial experiments that may allow measuring properties of short-lived excited states of the proton and the possibility of comparing them to predictions based on the current theoretical understanding of the physics involved.  Postdoctoral fellows and undergraduates will be trained and supported by this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thrust of the project is to find corrections to the energy levels of muonic helium and deuterium due to the polarization of the nuclear cores by the near-by orbiting muons.  Precise results are needed to evaluate the measured energy level data and interpret it in terms of radius discrepancies relative to corresponding measurements using electrons.  Another thrust is to calculate two photon corrections to polarized electron scattering in the region where the Delta resonance, one of the short-lived proton excitations, exists.  To study the Delta as an entity in itself, one produces it using one photon and then measures it almost immediately by a further scattering with a second photon.  In this project, the PI will calculate the precision requirements needed to obtain reliably the size and magnetic parameters of the Delta meson.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main topics the PI has studied and contributed to are the resolution of the proton radius puzzle; perturbative calculations to help measure fundamental particle physics parameters or to help find signals for beyond the standard model (BSM) phenomena; and synergistic atomic physics calculations motivated from a hadronic viewpoint by possible applications to electron-nucleon/nucleus scattering (e.g., at JLab) where one may be able to study higher spins states by shaping the incoming beam so that it does not produce lower spin states.  The PI is one of the leading workers on two photon exchange contributions, including polarizability corrections, to the Lamb shift in light muonic atoms including muonic hydrogen (working with Mikhail Gorchtein and Marc Vanderhaeghen, both of Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany).   The proton radius and other light nuclei radii are inferred from measurements of the Lamb energy shift, and the stated corrections are crucial to accurately relating the measurements to the radii.  Work has been completed and published for the proton, deuteron, and He-3, and results for He-4 have been reported by us in conferences. Further on the proton radius problem, the PI (now in collaboration with Keith Griffioen and undergraduate Sarah Maddox) has been reanalyzing the proton charge radius from published Mainz low momentum transfer electron-proton scattering data, finding that expansions with enough terms to fit the data but few enough not to overfit yield a proton radius in accord with the muonic atom results.  We speculate that fitting with complicated many-parameter functions has led elsewhere to inaccurate extrapolations and too large a reported radius. With Vladislav Pauk and Marc Vanderhaeghen, the PI has done calculations that provide groundwork to measure experimentally properties of excited states of the proton, for example the charge radius and magnetic moment of the Delta(1232).  In a separate work, we study leptoproduction (i.e., producing muon pairs) in electron-deuteron scattering, which has perhaps the surprising possibility of measuring the deuteron charge radius more accurately that current measurements from electron-deuteron elastic scattering. The PI has recently worked sucessfully (with Andrei Afansev and Maria Solyanik-Gorgone of George Washington University and experimenters Christian Schmiegelow of the FCEyN, UBA and IFIBA in Buenos Aires and Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler and Jonas Schulz of Mainz) testing the efficiency of shaped or twisted photons to selectively cause transitions to high angular momentum states in an atomic context, and violating familiar quantum selection rules known for plane wave photons.  The theoretical fits and the experimental data were in excellent accord, with detailed reports in two publications. In terms of intellectual merit, the activity connects to forefront modern hadronic physics, and also to phenomenology in interesting directions in particle physics and atomic physics. The project has led to many publications in the leading refereed journals.   In terms of broader impacts, the project will help bridge the gap between hadronic theory and observed phenomena, and lead to greater understanding of the mechanisms of hadronic reactions.  Some portions of the project connect to other fields, namely atomic physics and high energy physics.  The project has also trained new students, including undergraduates.  The PI has had  two successful women Ph. D. students in his career.  The PI is regularly at the Jefferson Laboratory and bridging the gap between university and national lab as well as between data and theory.
