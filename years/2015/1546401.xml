<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Thirteenth East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium" that will be held on October 3 and 4, 2015, on the campus of the University of Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the thirteenth installment of the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator algebras. The main foci of the 2015 event are the following: the Elliott classification program for C*-algebras; Popa's deformation/rigidity program; subfactor theory; C*-algebras and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 13th EAST COAST OPERATOR ALGEBRAS SYMPOSIUM     Location: The University of Iowa, October 1-2, 2015.     Organizer: Ionut Chifan     Scientific Committee: Dietmar Bisch (Vanderbilt), Marius Dadarlat (Purdue), Nigel Higson (Penn State)        The first meeting in the series of East Coast Operator Algebras Symposia (ECOAS) was held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville in 2003, and since then regular meetings have been organized each fall. The most recent five meetings were held at the University of Cincinnati, the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, Purdue University, Dartmouth College, and the Fields Institute (Canada). The 13th annual meeting in the ECOAS series was hosted at University of Iowa in the weekend of October 1-2, 2015. The focus of the meetings is on operator algebras and non-commutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas from logic and number theory, to quantum physics and cell phone network design.     In addition to facilitating interaction between researchers in the field,  ECOAS are forums in which young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the Eastern region of the United States and Canada can acquaint themselves with current issues at the forefront of research, present their own work, and interact with senior mathematicians in the field.     Following this general philosophy the two-day program featured both junior researchers and well-established experts. More precisely, 66 percent of the speakers were very talented young mathematicians (six postdocs, one graduate student, and one early-career faculty). One speaker was from an under-represented category (Anna Skripka). This selection of young speakers was complemented by four world-class superstar mathematicians (Adrian Ioana, David Kerr, Sorin Popa, and Wilhelm Winter). One of them (S. Popa) is two-times ICM speaker.     The program of this meeting illustrates both the unity and versatility of  the subject. All twelve talks were rooted in core subareas of operator algebra (e.g. classification of von Neumann algebras via Popa's deformation/rigidity theory, classification of nuclear C*-algebras, subfactors, free probability, non-commutative geometry) and their connections and applications to other related fields (e.g. equivalence relations, ergodic theory, model theory, K-theory, and Lie group theory). Some of the results presented at the meeting are top notch, advancing significantly the current boundaries of knowledge in their areas, and were published subsequently in prominent mathematical journals. They also illustrate a very encouraging new trend in the subject---an increasingly "rich" interplay between the operator algebra subfields.     Saturday talk were delivered by Adrian Ioana (Local Spectral Gap in Simple Lie Groups), Sorin Popa (Approximate Equivalence of Group Actions), Remi Boutonnet (Uncountably Many Non-isomorphic Ultrapowers of II1 factors), Daniel Hoff (Unique Prime Factorization for Von Neumann Algebras of Equivalence Relations), Wilhelm Winter (QDQ vs. UCT), Joseph Migler (Determinants in K-theory and Operator Algebras), Rudy Rodsphon (Zeta Functions and Local Index Theory), and Zhengwei Liu (Skein Theory for Subfactors).     Sunday talks were delivered by Anna Skripka (Approximation of Operator Functions), David Kerr (Tower Decompositions for Actions of Amenable Groups), Ben Hayes (Independence Tuples and Deninger's Problem), and Bogdan Udrea (Generalized Q-gaussian von Neumann Algebras with Coefficients and Their Structural Properties).     This edition of ECOAS was well attended, totaling 62 participants. Among the non-speaker participants 80 percent (forty persons) were graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. These included some students just starting their research and many already very advanced in various aforementioned subareas of operator algebras.
