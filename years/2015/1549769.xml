<AbstractNarration>High penetration of wind and photovoltaic (PV) generation in transmission and distribution systems poses a threat to maintaining security and dependability of the protection system using existing approaches. Historically, several major cascading outages have involved mis-operation or mis-coordination of protective relays. Such outages demonstrate that relay mis-coordination during stressed system conditions---concurrent high load demand, changes in circuit topology, equipment outages, and short-circuit fault conditions---can result in a fragile distribution network. In the past, variable generation was at a significantly lower level than at present and thus did not contribute to relay mis-coordination. With levels of wind and PV projected only to increase in the future, large-scale variable generation can present an additional point of vulnerability to the existing protection system. The objective of this project is to pursue the development of new tools for the fundamental understanding of how protection and control systems should operate in the presence of highly variable renewable energy sources. The project aims to develop a radically different framework and potential solutions built upon on model-based distributed relay intelligence, real-time dynamic relay settings, and stochastic optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the envisioned framework, the calculation of relay operating settings is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with real-time inputs from local relay intelligence, i.e., the predictive circuit model. The data collected by a relay is input to circuit simulations in order to accurately predict real-time fault currents at the relay location. Settings can then be adapted in real time based on updated generation profiles. Methods proposed in the literature for optimal relay settings have been limited and did not account for the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources. This project will develop a probabilistic formulation of optimal relay settings that naturally adapts to the randomness introduced by the high penetration of renewable generation. Input is provided from the predictive circuit models in the form of estimated remote system parameters for each individual relay. The optimization allows each relay to make the best possible decision based on known information (system structure and local measurements) and estimated values (non-local conditions) to update the optimal relay response in real time. The work will provide insight for protection methodologies that incorporate randomness introduced by renewable energy sources. The work will contribute to allowing increased penetration of renewable generation sources to the grid, which contributes to reduction of carbon emissions.  The developed methods will be implemented in hardware, facilitating discussions with and technology transfer to industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The share of electric power generation from wind and photovoltaic energy sources has been steadily increasing in the past decades.  Although they are desirable from an environmental perspective, they present operational challenges in how the power grid responds to a short-circuit fault condition.   Existing power system protection practices rely on known system conditions such as the available short-circuit currents, load levels, and generation characteristics.  With the levels of wind and photovoltaic generation projected only to increase in the future, misoperation or miscoordination of protective relaying equipment become more plausible.    The project sought to develop new approaches to robust system protection in the presence of highly variable renewable energy sources. In particular, the project developed a novel system protection framework that is built upon on model-based distributed relay intelligence, real-time dynamic relay settings, and stochastic optimization.  We showed that optimal relay settings that naturally adapt to the randomness introduced by the high penetration of renewable generation could be determined through a stochastic optimization-based approach.  The formulation takes into account the probabilistic nature of the fault current observed at each relay, which can be impacted by fault location, fault resistance, device failure, and distributed generation output at the time of the fault.  Although the formulation is complex and data-intensive, it overcomes misoperation and inefficiency.  In comparison to the existing approach (using analytic functions that map fault current to time delay),  it performs very well in a system having a significant distributed generation.        The project also developed a new method to improve the reliability performance by determining the optimal location of protective devices and switches in a distribution system with distributed generation.  The proposed method can efficiently compute optimal device allocations for multiple scenarios, revealing key insights, e.g., the location and capacity of distributed generation providing the greatest reliability benefit for a fixed protection budget.  The project also proposed and developed a model-based dynamic protection framework.  While existing protection approaches do not take into account circuit models, the proposed method focuses on embedding circuit estimation and simulation capabilities in protective relays. The data collected by the relay is input to circuit simulations to predict real-time fault currents at the relay location accurately. The project demonstrated this approach in supervising and securing the operation of remote backup protection elements.  Several case studies showed that dependability is not degraded for true fault conditions, and similarly, security is enhanced for stressed system conditions.    he work provides insight into protection methodologies that incorporate randomness introduced by renewable energy sources. The proposed methodologies, unlike existing practices, embeds circuit estimation and simulation capabilities.  They have the potential to transform existing system protection practices. With these new approaches, the project contributes to allowing increased penetration of renewable generation sources to the grid, which in turn contributes to the reduction of carbon emissions.
