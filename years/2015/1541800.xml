<AbstractNarration>This award will develop a mobile app, Flyover Country (FC), that will bring information about relevant points of interest (POI) and map data to the user mid-flight, without the need for in-flight Wi-Fi, by downloading a strip of data based on the flightpath before the user boards the plane.  GPS (Global Positioning System), which functions in airplane mode, allows precise flight tracking, making prompts for POI viewing timely and relevant.  With around 4.5 million people flying every day, the potential audience for FC is huge, as is its potential for geoscience outreach. The app will directly feed high-quality geoscience information to the user at the very point when curiosity is stimulated, and could thus improve public science literacy as well as inspiring and supporting the development of a generation of geoscientists. FC could also readily be adapted for use in STEM education, and will be structured so as to provide a platform for the exposure of all types of geospatial geoscience data, forming new infrastructure for education and research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visualization of geoscience through combining map views, articles, audio, visual aids, and the bird's eye view from a plane window will allow for new questions, ideas, relationships, and inspiration to be cultivated by scientists and the public alike. In addition, FC may improve the current state of data accessibility and the potential for dataset integration while simultaneously increasing the incentives for improving data discovery in the geosciences and beyond.  Development of the app will be split into two main tasks: (1) the geospatial acquisition of maps and POI, which may be accomplished off the device (server-side), and (2) an on-device user interface that requests, downloads, and displays the gathered data. FC will be available for both iOS and Android devices.  In addition to supporting informal learning from the airplane window, this system has great potential to be adapted for ground level use. Similar in content and scope to the popular Roadside Geology book series, a mobile app could present relevant geoscience information on road trips or hikes, and do so even where connectivity is absent.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have created a free mobile application that brings scientific information about the formation and history of the landscape to users, no matter where they are.  The app, called Flyover Country, works both from 30,000 feet up, augmenting the spectacular views from the airplane window seat, or from the ground, providing information about landscapes along a user's commute or simply in their backyard.  Interacting with the app is simple - tap the map interface along the route or region that you?re interested in, and then press the ?load path? button.  Flyover Country will then display geologic maps, including the ages and types of rocks; fossil locations of dinosaurs and extinct large (read: giant) mammals; core sample locations from lakes and oceans; and articles about major features of the landscape.  All of these data sources can be saved to the internal storage of the phone or tablet so that no internet connection is required while using the app in locations that don?t have internet connections (like 30,000 feet in the air!).  All of this information is displayed on a map alongside the user?s GPS determined location, speed, and altitude.    In addition to the information on the map, Flyover Country contains general information for identifying and understanding landscape features in general - from the shapes of different types of rivers, to the many different ways that humans change the landscapes they live in, to the science behind the clouds blocking your window seat?s view of the landscape below.  Recently, we?ve added over 50 geologic field trip guides to the app totaling well over 400 individual field trip stops, with many more planned.  These guides can be searched for using the app?s map interface, and their stops are displayed alongside other data and the user?s location.  This is a great improvement in usability over paper or PDF versions of the guides.    Much of the information displayed in Flyover Country is sourced from National Science Foundation funded databases.  These databases have been curated over decades, and are powerful tools for scientists and educators alike.         Last Modified: 01/30/2017       Submitted by: Shane Loeffler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
