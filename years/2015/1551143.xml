<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing Integrated Elementary Science, Engineering, and Language Arts Curricula Aligned with Next Generation Science Standards is an exploratory project to conduct a study to develop and field-test curricula integrating science, engineering, and language arts at the elementary level. Research and Curriculum Development team consisting of master elementary science teachers, university professors including science, engineering, and science teacher education faculty, and a science education post doc or graduate student will engage in developing  the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) aligned curricula integrating science, engineering, and language arts, and publishing STEM education research. The importance of this project will be the development of curricula integrating science, engineering, and language arts at the elementary level. Lesson plans or teaching activities in the integrated curricula will be written in practitioner article format.  In the NGSS the engineering design is raised to the same level as scientific inquiry and included as a vital element of science education.  This integrated approach  aims to provide three-dimensional learning experience as specified in the NGSS to elementary students while meaningfully integrating engineering, science, reading, and writing through real life engineering design problems. The NGSS aligned curricula that will be developed in this project can also be used in other states that adopted the NGSS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Integrated curriculum for grades 1-2 will be developed in year 1.  In year 2, the project will develop a curriculum for grades 3-5. Each year, the project will develop and field-test a new curriculum, and provide professional development organized around the integrated curriculum to 20 elementary teachers at the Clark County School District in Las Vegas, Nevada.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project allowed us to develop curriculum integrating engineering, science, and reading. Each curriculum unit designed around an engineering design challenge naturally integrating science content and reading along with epistemological aspects of engineering design process (nature of engineering). We tested our curriculum units with grades 3-5 students and conducted summer workshops to help elementary teachers to implement our curriculum in their own classrooms. Selected engineering design activities from our curriculum units were published in Science &amp; Children journal sponsored by National Science Teachers Association. Our scholarship about nature of engineering made both theoretical and empirical contributions to the fledgling research about nature of engineering. We created a conceptual framework for nature of engineering that can be incorporated to teaching engineering design in K-12 settings based on the literature and Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012). Our nature of engineering conceptual framework includes the views that creativity and imagination is used throughout the engineering design process; engineering design solutions are open to revision; engineering design solutions are optimized based on evidence from the test data; there is no single best design solution to a given engineering design problem; engineering is not a solitary pursuit; and engineering is a human endeavor. Our research demonstrated how to validly and reliably assess elementary students&rsquo; and elementary teachers&rsquo; nature of engineering views based our nature of engineering conceptual framework. Our research explored whether our curriculum units improved both elementary students&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; nature of engineering views. We found that both elementary students and elementary teachers improved their nature of engineering views after completing the integrated curriculum units. We also measured elementary teachers engineering teaching efficacy beliefs by using a modified version of Science Teaching Efficacy Beliefs Instrument (Enochs &amp; Riggs, 1990). We adopted this instrument and validated it for engineering teaching efficacy. We called this instrument Engineering Teaching Efficacy Beliefs Instrument (ETEBI). Our research indicated that elementary teachers improved their engineering teaching efficacy beliefs after participating the summer workshops.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/16/2019<br>      Modified by: Hasan&nbsp;Deniz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
