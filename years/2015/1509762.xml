<AbstractNarration>The Internet of Things (IoT), also referred to as the Industrial Internet, is projected to be modern society's third great revolution following the Industrial Revolution and the Communications Revolution.  A great proportion of the communications performed in the IoT will be between devices, in so-called machine-to-machine (M2M) systems, and in an increasingly automated manner.  The environments in which IoT devices will operate will often be more complex, cluttered and challenging for wireless communications than either today's ubiquitous mobile communications or wireless data networks.   This research addresses a critical component of the IoT wireless communications link, namely the antenna systems for these small, inexpensive devices. New antenna designs are needed, along with new methods for low-cost digital manufacturing and for testing the devices under realistic operating conditions. The research findings of this project have potential to positively impact the robustness of not only M2M systems but also systems utilized in dynamic environments such vehicle-to-vehicle, first-responder and military field operations. Furthermore, the underlying knowledge could influence the future designs of medical devices, on-body sensor systems, robotic systems, un-manned ground and air vehicles and similar applications where customization, form factor, production volume or other considerations make direct digital manufacturing (DDM) an attractive option. Graduate students from the University of Vermont and the University of South Florida will collaborate with the industry participants from Harris Corporation. The investigators will also work closely with STEM programs targeting high school students, in particular those students from underrepresented and disadvantaged populations, to develop activities that provide insights on the foundations that make wireless communications possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will lead to techniques and technology that enable wireless devices for Internet of Things (IoT) applications operating at 2.45, 5 and 60 GHz to determine and adapt to the channel impairments using new antenna system designs.  Advanced manufacturing and integration approaches will be studied with the goal of reducing the size and cost of these devices and systems.  The intellectual merit lies in the fusion of ideas from propagation modeling, antenna design and direct digital manufacturing (DDM).  Previous work by the investigators, who have a long and productive history of collaboration, has contributed new understanding of channel conditions for highly cluttered environments, 3D antenna designs, and the use of DDM for microwave circuit and antenna fabrication. The work will leverage this expertise in the investigation of new channel models and the resulting theory that will inform the study of next generation, adaptive antenna systems. A new approach to quantifying antenna system performance based on collecting and analyzing antenna responses to a wide range of channel conditions is the basis for the proposed propagation studies. The orientation, spacing and reconfiguration of antenna elements in a multi-polarization system will be studied using a statistical characterization method. Advanced DDM processes will be investigated using a unique 3D printer that combines plastic extrusion, paste micro-dispensing and laser processing in a single tool.  The new processes will provide the ability to realize 3D structural electronics that comprise package-integrated antenna systems that include ferroelectric tuning networks. The realization of electronically-tunable DDM devices requires a new process to merge a technology with length scales on the order of 10's of microns (DDM) with one having length scales on the order of microns (integrated circuits). The eventual goal of demonstrating, in collaboration with GOALI partner Harris Corp., high performance mm-wave (60 GHz) antenna systems of this nature necessitates tight control over feature sizes and the quality and surface features of printed conductors; the use of pulsed laser processing will be studied as a means to address these challenges.</AbstractNarration>
