<AbstractNarration>Indiana University's regional campuses enroll over 30,000 students each year, addressing the need to  provide higher education opportunities to citizens of Indiana who for various reasons are unable to enroll at IU's core campuses in Bloomington and Indianapolis. These students are often non-traditional and/or first generation college students. The resources needed to provide high-quality scientific research and educational opportunities are concentrated at IUís Bloomington and Indianapolis core campuses. High-performance and high-speed data networks are required to support transfer of large data sets and access to national scientific resource for each of IU's regional campuses. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project improves the campus cyberinfrastructure at Indiana Universityís five regional campuses and one center in three areas to support unmet research needs: 1) it increases IU regional campusesí connection to Internet2 and other national research networks from 1Gbps to 10Gbps via Indiana's regional network provider, I-Light; 2) it increases the connection speed from IUís network core to the IU regional campuses to 10Gbps; and 3) the installed Data Transfer Nodes at the five larger regional campuses ensures unimpeded 10Gbps-capable high-performance data transfer for researchers across the regional and national research networks. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These infrastructure improvements significantly benefit all researchers and students in STEM disciplines at Indiana University regional campuses. They address immediate research needs for projects in physics, geology, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology, including work at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). &lt;br/&gt;Further, they enable future regional research projects heretofore impossible due to slow data transfer rates, thereby forwarding the advancement of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In January, 2016 the five regional campuses of Indiana University began working on the project funded from the NSF grant, CC*DNI Network Infrastructure: IU Regional Campus Network Infrastructure to Support Scientific Research and Education.   The regional campuses of Indiana University consists of 5 small campuses, located across the state of Indiana in Gary (NW campus), South Bend (SB campus), Kokomo (KO campus), Richmond (East campus) and New Albany (SE campus) (the IU Regional Campuses).  The IU regional campuses play a key role in addressing the need for close to home, flexible educational opportunities for a wide range of students who are often non-traditional, minority or first generation college students. The opportunity to participate in a quality undergraduate education at a major state university is important as an economic driver both for the individual graduate and for the State of Indiana. The STEM programs are particularly important to our career oriented students. The opportunity to take classes and participate in the various STEM related research opportunities on these IU Regional Campuses is a key element to the undergraduate?s education. Extensive resources for scientific research at Indiana University is provided at the core campuses located in Indianapolis and Bloomington, Indiana. In order to effectively access these resources it was essential to develop a high-speed network infrastructure to explicitly support access and transfer of large data sets.
