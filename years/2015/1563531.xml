<AbstractNarration>This research project aims to create improved mathematical models for predicting the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. These models can be used to help guide public health workers in improving the effectiveness of intervention strategies for mitigating the impact of these diseases. The project focuses on analyzing approaches that have the potential for optimizing mitigation strategies for controlling chikungunya, dengue fever, and Zika virus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partial differential equation mosquito-borne disease transmission models under development in this project will account for spatial heterogeneity in the population density of the mosquito and host populations. The research aims to create a new two-sex model that can account for both vertical and horizontal transmission of bacterial control measures, such as using Wolbachia to mitigate the disease spread. The mathematical analysis of these models will include quantifying the uncertainty in the model forecasts for multiple species of mosquitoes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mosquitoes are among the deadliest creatures in the world due to the many diseases they can transmit &ndash; including the Zika virus, dengue, malaria, West Nile virus, chikungunya, yellow fever, and more. According to a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, diseases transmitted through the bites of ticks, mosquitoes, and fleas are a "growing public health problem" in the country.  Current approaches to stop mosquitoes from spreading diseases involve infecting mosquitoes with Wolbachia, a bacteria that block viral replication. The idea is to infect them with Wolbachia in the lab and then introduce the mosquitoes into the wild to infect entire mosquito populations. Once infected, mosquitoes are no longer capable of transmitting disease.  However, using these methods to prevent mosquito-borne diseases is not as simple as introducing the virus. There's a tipping point where the Wolbachia infection must exceed a threshold for the infestation to be sustained in the wild, and that's where mathematical models come into play.  If you release a small number of infected mosquitoes, it works for a little while, but by Darwinian principles, the infected insects quickly disappear.  One of the first things we discovered using the mathematical model is that, under ideal conditions, if more than about 30 percent of the mosquitoes are infected with a particular strain of Wolbachia, then the bacteria infection will be sustained.  Only models build on a solid epidemiological and the mathematical foundation is effective in increasing our scientific understanding of the mechanisms for the spread and control of diseases.  To determine the best disease mitigation strategy, we developed a rigorous mathematical model that simulates what happens in the real world when Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are released.   We used sensitivity analysis to help quantify the uncertainty in our model created by our lack of knowledge on some model parameters and the neglected terms in the equations.  We then used the model to predict the most effective method of introducing an autonomous Wolbachia infection.  The model compared different protocols for releasing infected-mosquitos and sustaining an infection in wild mosquitoes.  We found is that the likelihood of maintaining the bacteria in the wild increases if males and pregnant females are released together and that the area is sprayed first with both insecticide and larvicide to kill adults and eggs.  Our main goal was to help public health workers identify effective approaches for stopping mosquito-borne diseases.  This type of mathematical modeling can help identify the best ways to utilize Wolbachia technology to control the transmission of Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and similar viruses, and eventually suppressing the transmission of these devastating diseases. Wolbachia is a promising, natural strategy to curb life-threatening diseases. Mathematical modeling is helping to make it more effective.  The next step for this project will be to extend the models to include spatial variations in mosquito populations.  Using data collected from successful field trials recently completed in Australia, where Wolbachia-infected mosquito release are significantly lowering the incidence of dengue fever, they will be examining whether it's best to release mosquitoes at the edge of the field or in the center, how wind and/or terrain affects the release and other location parameters.  Our research discovered a new approach to modeling that can be applied to other vector-borne diseases. The mathematical modeling effort was fully integrated with engaging graduate and undergraduate students in modeling infectious diseases.  We collaborated closely with biological, epidemiological, public health scientists, our colleagues at the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and the NIH MIDAS modeling teams.
