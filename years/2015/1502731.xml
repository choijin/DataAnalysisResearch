<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI completed independent research in the areas of stochastic homogenization, stochastic partial differential equations, and machine learning during the period of September 2015 to September 2018 at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany.  Individually, and in collaboration with members of the Max Planck Institute, the PI completed eight published research works over the three year term of the fellowship.  Many of these were published in top mathematical journals.  In addition, the PI independently taught two advanced graduate courses at the institute, and the PI taught courses for incoming doctoral students.  At the conclusion of the fellowship, the PI was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to pursue research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and a Titchmarsh Research Fellowship at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.  The PI accepted the research fellowship at Oxford, where the PI began working in September 2018.  Homogenization theory aims to understand the properties of materials with complicated microstructures, such as those arising from flaws in a manufacturing process or from randomly deposited impurities. The goal is to identify an effective model that provides an accurate approximation of the original material.  Such models greatly decrease the computational costs associated with understanding the properties of such complex materials.  The randomness, or stochasticity, provides a mathematical framework to understand materials whose microstructure is not precisely understood, like those arising from imperfections.  The PI's research contributed, in particular, to the homogenization of diffusion processes, like those that model the conductivity of a metallic composite.  Stochastic partial differential equations describe deterministic phenomena subject to random effects, such as a nonlinear diffusion in disordered media.   The properties of the randomness arise from the statistical behavior of the environment.  The aim is to develop a suitable well-posedness theory for such equations, despite the fact that they are classically ill-posed due to the irregularity of the noise, and to obtain estimates which are stable with respect to the stochastic term.  The PI's research contributed, in particular, to stochastic equations that model fluctuating fluid dynamics, the evolution of thin films, and the theory of mean field games with applications to economics.  Data science and machine learning have revolutionized many aspects of modern technology, such as computer vision and image recognition.  Essential tools in the development of these technologies are so-called stochastic gradient descent algorithms.  The PI's research contributed, in particular, to obtaining rates of convergence for these algorithms.  In practice, this research quantifies the rate at which such algorithms can be used to train a computer to recognize images, such as handwriting.
