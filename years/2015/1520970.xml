<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to continue the development of a fully relativistic computer code for electron and photon interactions with atoms and ions.  The code has already been employed in a number of benchmark calculations to obtain highly accurate atomic data of critical importance for fundamental research and practical applications.  In particular, the code is being used to model the physics and chemistry of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres.  The computer code will be made available to the general public through an open-source license and a designated website.  Undergraduate students will be trained in modern computational methods through developing and testing individual modules of the package.  This includes running the code on massively parallel computing platforms provided through the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) resources supported by the National Science Foundation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The B-spline R-matrix (BSR) approach has significant advantages over the well-known suite of R-matrix (close-coupling) codes that were developed over the past four decades and are currently used worldwide.  Specifically, the numerical properties of a B-spline basis yield high computational accuracy and the ability to employ non-orthogonal sets of term-dependent orbitals allows for compact configuration expansions.  After having completed the parallelization of the semi-relativistic version, this project will support the development of a parallel implementation of the fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb version.  The BSR collision codes will also be interfaced with a new suite of general atomic structure codes, which use B-spline expansions directly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, benchmark theoretical and numerical studies of collisions of photons and electrons with atoms and ions were performed. We continued the development of a highly accurate, general method to treat such collisions using sophisticated numerical methods based on so-called B-splines.  The parallelization of the package was moved along further, and the codes are now well adapted to run on massively parallel supercomputers such as Stampede 2.  As a by-product, accurate atomic structure calculations are also possible with part of the package.  The current version of the code is already publicly available from https://github.com/zatsaroi/BSR3, in addition to several publications over the years in Computer Physics Communications.  The work reported on here became the basis for a follow-up project "Elements: NSCI-Software -- A General and Effective B-Spline R-Matrix Package for Charged-Particle and Photon Collisions with Atoms, Ions, and Molecules", which was recently funded by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC).  This clearly shows that continued development of the package, as well as public availability is judged as very important by the National Science Foundation.  The project resulted in approximately 30 peer-reviewed publications and a number of invitations for the P.I. (Zatsarinny) as well as the Co-P.I. (Bartschat) to speak at international conferences. The Co-P.I. also won the prestigious Will Allis Prize of the America Physical Society in 2016.  This award generally recognizes contributions to applied sciences, in this case plasma physics and astrophysics, where many of the data generated in this project are needed for modelling applications.  We emphasize that the BSR results freely available.  Many of them are stored in the LXCat database (https://nl.lxcat.net/home/) and its mirror sites in several countries.  In addition, we receive many individual requests for our data as well as for advice in general.  Some of our results, which frequently required work over many years, were also made possible through previous grants from the Computational Physics program of the NSF, as well as the Atomic Theory program through the project # PHY-1403245.  In addition to the scientific outcomes of the project, which support basic research in many laboratories in the United States and around the world, the project resulted in the development of human resources. A post-doctoral researcher (Dr. Luis Fernandez-Menchero) was employed on this project for two years before accepting a longer-term position at the Queen's University of Belfast.

Furthermore, we had a number of visitors who were funded by their home institutions in order to gain experience with the BSR package, essentially a pre-cursor to the OAC project mentioned above.
