<AbstractNarration>This research examines victims' assessments of procedural justice at the International Criminal Court (ICC). Created by the Rome Treaty in 1998, the ICC has been hailed as a new type of international court, one that promotes restorative justice for victims as well as accountability for grave international crimes. One of its innovations is to provide expansive procedural rights to victims, including the right for victims to present their concerns at different stages of the proceedings, subject to the discretion of judges. Yet no studies have examined how victims view their participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on in-depth interviews with more than 600 victims in Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and Cote d?Ivoire, we assess whether or not respondents 1) feel they havea voice in ICC proceedings; 2) view the ICC as a neutral arbitrator; 3) feel respected by Court staff; 4) trust the ICC; and 5) feel safe being associated with the Court. The study contributes to a growing literature on the importance of procedural justice for the legitimacy of judicial institutions, and provides important insights into victims' subjective assessments of the effectiveness of international criminal interventions after mass violence. By documenting for the first time the lived experiences of victims participating in ICC trials, the study provides insight into the social-psychological dynamics of victim participation and strengthens the functioning of international criminal justice.</AbstractNarration>
