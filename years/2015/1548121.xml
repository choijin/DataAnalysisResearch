<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Organization Program in the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the Systematics and Biodiversity Science Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology, both in the Biological Sciences Directorate, and by the Biologial Oceanography Program in the Division of Ocean Sciences in the Geosciences Directorate, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Integrative Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why there is such an enormous diversity of neurons in our brains is the least understood and one of the most challenging problems in modern biology. Two factors contribute to this diversity. One is that different neurons have different functions, and the other, is that different neurons have different evolutionary histories. However, neither evolutionary history nor classification of neuronal types is established. The goal of this project is to reconstruct the genealogy of neurons and develop an unbiased classification of neurons in the majority of animal groups. This will provide a way to predict the properties of neurons and their connections. A novel approach to determine the kinds of molecules that are expressed in different neurons will be developed. To gain access to critically important organisms, the Principal Investigator will organize worldwide voyages on research vessels to collect marine animals that represent all major types of neuronal organization. Thousands of distinct neuronal populations across species will be collected and analyzed with novel computational and mathematical tools. The work will create a new field of NeuroSystematics. The team will develop and test a novel approach for distant training of undergraduate and graduate students to perform real-time analyses at any world location.  The project will involve research collaborations with over 150 investigators from universities from many countries and will provide opportunities for international and underrepresented minority students to be involved in biodiversity research in remote oceanic laboratories. The project will also provide priceless resources and reference databases for several disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research strategy is based upon the development of a mobile version of a nano-volume capture technology designed for massive transcriptome analysis of entire nervous systems at single-cell resolution. The focus will be on animal lineages never investigated before, including phoronids, brachiopods, xenoturbellids, and rare and fragile larvae.  The team will integrate phylogenomic tools and statistical geometry to characterize transcriptional divergence in cell type evolution and reconstruct neurogenic gene regulatory circuits. To incorporate the inherent statistical uncertainty in the genome, as well as natural selection within complex systems, stochastic approaches from information theory will be used to evaluate molecular diversities across dozens of classes of neuronal architectures. The genomic nature of species boundaries will be studied to reveal environmental and neurosensory limitations to the rates of speciation. Thus, deciphering the genealogy of neurons will be integrated with the functional and ecological constraints that underlie the formation of new behaviors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Systematics is the alpha and omega of biology. However, these neuroscience approaches are less developed, mostly due to the lack of required comparative information for most animal phyla.  Here, the interdisciplinary team overcame this challenge by integrating biodiversity research with single-cell genomics. This research targets the establishment of a new field - the Evolutionary NeuroSystematics, which incorporated comparative approaches by the marriage of biodiversity and neuroscience.  As a result, this project provided novel genomic insights into the origins of neurons, neurotransmitters, and even the presence of novel 'alternative' integrative systems in nerveless animals. These are summarized below.  Origins of neurons and transmitters have deep roots in the biology of early eukaryotes. Using novel genomic, scRNA-seq, and microchemical data from representatives of more than a dozen animal phyla, we expanded a new paradigm of independent origins of neural systems, focusing on events of parallel recruitments of (neuro)transmitters in neural and other integrative systems of organisms.  The key outcome of our research is the view of neurons and the nervous system as a heterogeneous ensemble of polarized secretory cells, with unique evolutionary conserved genomic barcodes, capable of volume transmission without canonical synapses. The non-synaptic integration of complex behavioral reactions and morphogenesis can be observed in all primarily nerveless animals, including Placozoa and Porifera using alternative conductive and communication systems.  However, many ancestral molecular modules were shared between nerveless and neuron-containing organisms, allowing establishing broad homologies of cell types across major animal clades. These homologous evolutionary cell types trees were illuminated using about more than one million of single-cell sequencing datasets. The deciphering of such trees and signaling led to the following conclusions.  1)      The injury and broad spectrum of regenerative signaling could be prominent neurogenic factors in early evolution, leading the development of diverse integrative systems starting with the regulation of embryogenesis.  2)      The chemical synapses evolved more than once by parallel assemblies, multiple modulatory molecular secretory, and receptive complexes.  3)      Gaseous nitric oxide (NO), ATP, protons, peptides, and glutamate are examples of the earliest and the most widespread transmitters across all domains of life and metazoans in particular.  However, other canonical intercellular signal molecules (e.g., GABA, acetylcholine, and numerous biogenic amines such as catecholamines, serotonin, and histamine) were recruited as true (canonical) neurotransmitters relatively later in metazoan evolution. Both cnidarians and enigmatic xenoacoelomorphs further illuminate unique examples of the parallel evolution of transmitter systems and neural centralization.  Combinatorial organization and mosaic phylogenetic distribution (gain and loss) of both synthetic enzymes and transmitter receptors (three classes of ligand-gated ion channels) further reflect unprecedented diversity of lineage-specific adaptations within textbook-type neural and alternative integrative systems in Metazoa.  The primordial diversification of the chemical (including 'volume transmission') signaling system is the most remarkable chemical preadaptation, which established a molecular foundation, which eventually led to elementary cognition in different animal lineages.  The project outcomes also include making available to the broader research community tools, approaches, and resources for comparative neurogenomics and biodiversity. Finally, this planetary-scale project provided opportunities for multiple science citizens, both undergraduate and graduate students, to combine research training with field-based marine biodiversity research across the nation.
