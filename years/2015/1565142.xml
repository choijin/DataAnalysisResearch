<AbstractNarration>Santa Monica College's (SMC) STEM Scholars program will investigate the impact of scholarship assistance and targeted interventions both in and out of the classroom to improve student success in STEM among community college students.  Many of these students are the first in their family to attend college and represent demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  These interventions will bridge the academic curriculum with comprehensive student support services and will include STEM-focused counseling and career planning sessions, a STEM speaker series, STEM skill building workshops, and applied learning activities, including research opportunities with local university and industry partners.  This project will provide additional support in math, which is often the primary barrier to success in STEM for community college students, many of whom enter underprepared in math.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The STEM Scholars program evaluation plan includes both formative and summative components that will assess the effectiveness of the project in improving student outcomes, as well as measuring the institution's capacity to support student success.  In collaboration with SMC's Office of Institutional Research, the formative component will assess the establishment of a program database to evaluate applications, development of marketing materials, initiation of classroom presentations, distribution of scholarship funding, and facilitation of cohort activities.  The summative component will assess the overall impact of this project on both students and the institution and will focus on the project's four primary objectives and how the project has helped achieve the S-STEM Program Goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The NSF S-STEM Scholars Project at Santa Monica College (SMC) was developed to increase the number of community college students pursuing advanced degrees/careers in STEM, while increasing institutional capacity to support low-income, traditionally underrepresented students enrolled in STEM programs.  Through a multidisciplinary approach that involved the four STEM departments at SMC, including Life, Physical, Earth and Computer Sciences, four goals were created in the S-STEM Scholars Project to address the unique academic and student support needs of community college students:  Improve educational opportunities for students through the availability of scholarship awards. Increase retention of students to degree achievement Improve student support programs at institutions of higher learning Increase the number of well-educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need   To meet these goals, the NSF S-STEM Scholars Project provided scholarships to academically talented, but financially needy, students in the biological, physical, and mathematical sciences, as well as geosciences, engineering, and computer and information sciences.  Additionally, the S-STEM Scholars Project coordinated with the existing STEM program at SMC to provide an array of wrap-around student support services, including academic counseling and advising, educational plan development, peer mentoring, and student success workshops.  By targeting all STEM disciplines, SMC recognized that many community college students are just beginning their academic careers and have not yet decided the specific focus of their studies. At this level, students are still exploring options, and the involvement of all STEM departments is key to ensuring that all students who are interested in STEM careers may benefit.  Intellectual Merit:  The Intellectual Merit of the S-STEM Scholars Project is that it bridged the academic curriculum with comprehensive student services, providing scholarship recipients with support both in and out of the classroom. STEM faculty worked closely with their Counseling peers to develop a program that maintained high academic standards and course rigor while addressing the unique needs and concerns of low-income, first generations students.  Support services included Supplemental Instruction, an academic assistance program that provides free out-of-class sessions to students enrolled in specific STEM courses, a dedicated STEM counselor, educational planning, career assessment, skill-building workshops, summer bridge programming with UCLA, research experiences at UCLA and JPL, peer mentors and faculty advising. The project exposed students to a wide range of STEM disciplines, while facilitating student understanding of where their strengths and interests lie.  Broader Impacts:  SMC is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. The broader impact of this project is that it not only served low-income students but also served students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM yet in demand by national laboratories, private contractors, and universities.  The NSF S-STEM Scholars Project was developed to help low-income URM students recognize their potential and believe that a STEM degree/career are viable options. As these students graduate, transfer, and enter the workforce, SMC is contributing to the diversification of the STEM workforce, providing local/regional employers with a workforce pool that reflects the communities they serve. In addition, this project strengthened SMC's instructional and student services programming through expanded and enhanced partnerships with four-year universities and STEM employers.  The ultimate purpose of the S-STEM Scholars program was diversification in the STEM field. Based on quantitative analyses, the program successfully accomplished this goal.  Student Demographics:  Compared to the collegewide student population:  Latino/Hispanic students were awarded the highest number of awards which mirrors the majority student population at SMC.  The S-STEM program awarded disproportionately more scholarships to Black students (18% STEM Scholars compared to 9% college population).  Disproportionately more male students received the scholarship compared to female students (54% STEM Scholars compared to 46% college population).   Academic Behavior:  STEM Scholars exhibited an overall average of 3.23 cumulative GPA.  The most popular STEM majors among STEM Scholars are Biological Sciences (25%), Computer and Information Sciences (24%), and Engineering (23%)  Across cohorts, it appears that the scholarships helped students achieve their transfer goals. STEM Scholars exhibited a 61% transfer rate and 46% transfer rate for STEM Scholars in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 cohorts, respectively, which can be considered a strong and respectable rate of transfer compared to other published transfer measurements.
