<AbstractNarration>It is well known that nuclei are made from protons and neutrons. In heavy nuclei, there are more neutrons than protons, and this gives rise to the theoretical prediction that heavy nuclei have an outer "skin" of neutrons. Measurements of the neutron excess in heavy nuclei also have applications to astrophysics, where objects called neutron stars are known to exist. The thickness of the neutron skin for heavy nuclei bears directly on the theoretical calculations of neutron matter and hence the composition of neutron stars.  This award will support research on an experiment that will directly measure the neutron skin thickness, which is poorly known today, with high enough precision to test different theoretical models of neutron matter.  A significant fraction of the research will involve undergraduate students from the Temple University community, accompanied by a recruitment effort that seeks to attract students who wish to remain in the city as science teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experiment relies on a large collaboration of physicists from a number of universities, as well as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Each group plays its part for a successful measurement, and this award supports a specific effort to precisely measure the polarization of the electron beam. This is the fraction of electrons, given one beam setting or another, with spins pointed in one direction as opposed to the other. The goal is to determine the polarization to about 1% accuracy, and this requires careful attention to a number of different details. For example, the technique involves precision determinations of magnetization of thin iron foils in high magnetic fields.</AbstractNarration>
