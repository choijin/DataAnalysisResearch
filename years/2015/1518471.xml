<AbstractNarration>More than 35% of mangrove areas worldwide have been degraded or lost entirely in the past 20 years, and this degradation has significant consequences for human wellbeing. Mangroves provide a number of ecosystem services that are particularly beneficial to low-income coastal communities. However, dependence on natural resources can lead to environmental degradation. Despite the importance of this interaction, there is a significant gap in understanding the relationship between mangrove ecosystem services and poverty traps, mechanisms that cause poverty to persist, in low income coastal communities. This interdisciplinary research is a first step toward advancing our understanding of ecosystem services through the lens of poverty traps. It empirically investigates important feedback loops, drivers and other mechanisms that link poverty traps and mangrove ecosystems at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This project will inform stakeholders involved in coastal resource management and poverty alleviation how changes in mangrove ecosystem services are associated with poverty and vice versa, and examine new approaches to break the vicious cycle of resource degradation and poverty. The findings can potentially be extended to efforts to sustain ecosystem services provided by other natural resources in developing economies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in rural coastal Tanzania where degradation of mangrove resources and persistent poverty continue to be significant challenges. An interdisciplinary research team with expertise in economics, ecology, hydrology, climatology, and system modeling will undertake a two-year study to conceptualize and provide empirical evidence for the feedback loops, drivers, and thresholds existing within and across natural and human systems for multiple ecogeomorphological and poverty conditions. The researchers will collect and use a wide range of ecological and socioeconomic data by synchronizing the temporal and spatial scales at four sites. Four ecosystem services of mangrove forests that are likely interlinked with poverty will be examined: (a) goods extracted (fuel wood, building poles, and charcoal), (b) fish and shrimp habitats, (c) coastal protection, and (d) prospects for carbon storage (as a net carbon sink),which will be assessed as a potential source of revenue to break poverty-environment traps. The ecological processes of mangrove ecosystem functions and their services, as well as the decision rules related to natural resource use, management, and livelihood inferred from empirical evidence will then be used to build an agent-based model to scale up to a regional level. This approach will help identify system-wide effects under alternative scenarios and simulate directions in which the coupled systems can evolve to benefit both the environment and coastal communities.</AbstractNarration>

Mangroves provide a number of ecosystem services that are particularly beneficial to coastal poor communities. Their dependence on natural resources, however, can be the source of the resources’ degradation. Despite the importance of this interaction, there is a significant gap in understanding of links between mangrove ecosystem services and poverty traps&mdash;mechanisms that cause poverty to persist.   An interdisciplinary, international research team from University of Rhode Island, Louisiana State University, Florida International University, University of Dar es Salaam and Sea Sense (conservation nonprofit in Tanzania) with expertise in economics, ecology, hydrology, climatology and system modeling collaborated in a study that took the first step towards advancing our understanding of ecosystem services through the lens of poverty. The four ecosystem services of mangrove forests that are likely interlinked with poverty have been examined: goods extracted (fuel wood, building poles, and charcoal); fish and shrimp habitats; coastal protection; and prospects for carbon storage (as a net carbon sink) as a potential source of revenue to break poverty-environment traps.

We used these data to examine mangrove ecosystem services and the mechanisms between those services and poverty traps, and have found the following.  First, we identified three mechanisms that link poverty trap and mangrove ecosystem services in the context of coastal Tanzania: 1) because poor people depend more on mangrove ecosystem services, forest degradation can lead to further poverty; 2) mangrove ecosystem services strengthen coastal communities' resiliency, serving as a safety net; and 3) both mangrove forests and humans are exposed to risks from climate change such as prolonged drought.   Second, we identified four dominant species in the Kipumbwi-Sange estuary. Overall, the observed lower tree density along transects indicated high deforestation. Using cut trunks fromprevious wood extractions we determined that approximately 38% of the forest has been harvested.  Third, we found that mangroves are more important as fish habitat structures than as contributors of energy to fisheries communities. Adjacent mudflat habitats seem to be higher contributors of energy to mangrove communities than mangroves themselves. Mangroves, mudflats, and seagrasses are part of an interconnected seascape that is essential for the production of fisheries resources.   Fourth, while fishing was found to be one of the most important livelihoods in the study sites, each coastal village had unique patterns for vessel-use, gear-use,and taxa landed, and that every village was specialized in some measure, suggesting the need for site-specific fisheries management. We also found that fishery landings and environmental data can be useful to predict characteristics of marine fisheries, potentially supporting communities to develop management plans.  Fifth, although mangrove trees have high potential to store carbon, we found that soil organic carbon values published for the northeastern coastal region in Tanzania is overestimated by more than 50% compared to our field data in areas with high mineral content. This difference needs to be considered when assessing mangrove wetlands as carbon sinks for climate mitigation programs. Relatedly, our economic field experiment found that social nudges and other non-financial incentives may be just as effective as financial carbon payments to incentivize households to restore mangrove forests.  Finally, we found that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), an atmospheric phenomenon, operates at a broad scale in the region, making it likely that the climate variability affects mangrove ecosystems as well as rural coastal households simultaneously.  The project made several contributions to broader impacts.  First, this project initiated a new place-based, coupled system research in Sub-Saharan Africa, where degradation of mangrove resources and persistent poverty remains to be a significant challenge for this century. We hosted three workshopswhich brought together professionals from government agencies and conservation nonprofit groups, Tanzanian scholars, and our research team at different stages of the project to identify knowledge gaps, share preliminary and final findings, and to discuss implications for mangrove and fisheries management. The findings were synthesized in a policy brief and project reports aimed at broader audience including officials, communities and other stakeholders.   Second, this project contributed to training and providing experience for undergraduate, graduate students and junior faculty, including underrepresented groups, in an interdisciplinary, international coupled-system research; and strengthened networks of academic and non-academic professionals and students in the fields of coastal ecological and socioeconomic sciences.  We presented papers at numerous national and international conferences and have several papers published, planned, and in the pipeline, in addition to MS theses and PhD dissertations.
