<AbstractNarration>The Promoting Research and Innovation in Methodologies for Evaluation (PRIME) program seeks to support research on evaluation with special emphasis on: (1) exploring innovative approaches for determining the impacts and usefulness of STEM education projects and programs; (2) building on and expanding the theoretical foundations for evaluating STEM education and workforce development initiatives, including translating and adapting approaches from other fields; and (3) growing the capacity and infrastructure of the evaluation field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study have the potential to contribute to our understanding of the nature and organization of effective teaching, and the mechanisms through which valued instructional practices are organized inside the mathematics and science classroom to impact learning for different students or groups of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using data from the Measures of Effective Teaching project, this study uses an innovative mixed-methods design to examine whether within-classroom variation in student responses to Tripod Student Perception Survey may be used to identify instructional microclimates, and whether these microclimates moderate the relationship between aggregate measures of instructional practice and student achievement in mathematics and science classrooms. To this effect, investigators will combine evidence from quantitative analysis of student survey data, with in-depth qualitative analysis of lesson videos of the same classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Student surveys are increasingly used to monitor and understand classroom and school climate for policy and research purposes. Nearly two-thirds of all states currently allow or require student climate surveys to be included in teacher evaluations.In mathematics and science classrooms, studies have found positive associations between classroom climate and a variety of student outcomes, including student achievement, motivation and self-efficacy. Measures of classroom climate are typically created by aggregating student responses to create classroom level scores, regardless of how much student scores vary within a classroom. This presents a potential issue in that classrooms with different patterns of individual responses can yield the same aggregate climate score, and within-classroom variation in student climate reports could point to important differences in student experiences in that classroom.   In this project, we used data from the Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) study to investigate differences in student perceptions of climate in the same classroom. In particular, we investigated whether such differences are associated with a) student characteristics b) desirable student outcomes and c) ratings of classroom practice and climate based on structured classroom observations. We additionally hypothesized that other aspects of the classroom environment not captured by existing measures may promote or inhibit perceptual agreement among students about classroom climate. To complement these quantitative analyses, we conducted qualitative case studies drawing on lesson videos from a purposively selected set of case study classrooms, to understand how the organization of the classroom environment, instructional format, classroom management and content-based teacher-student interactions may relate to climate consensus. To our knowledge, this is one of the first projects to use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods from organizational psychology to investigate how variation in students' perceptions may offer insight into math and science learning environments, capitalizing on both sources of evidence to develop a richer, more complete picture of climate consensus.    We found that there are large disagreements among students about the quality of classroom climate. Students in the same classroom perceive climate differently, depending on their background. In particular, low achieving math and science students had systematically lower perceptions of classroom climate than their higher achieving peers, and English Language Learners (ELLs) had systematically higher perceptions of climate than their non-ELL peers.  We also found that teaching practices measured by structured classroom observations were related to classroom consensus, even after controlling for mean ratings. We found no evidence that within-classroom consensus in student ratings is associated with academic achievement, though we did find evidence that consensus is positively associated with the development of growth mindset.
