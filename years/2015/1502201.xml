<AbstractNarration>Fundamentally, algebraic geometry is the study of solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  The systems of interest typically involve many equations and many variables, and it is essential to look for ways to simplify them.  One way to do this is by tuning certain parameters to zero; if done carefully, the resulting system retains many properties of the original one, and may be more amenable to analysis.  Another way to simplify is to look for symmetry in the set of solutions, and take advantage of this to reduce the problem and extract information about the original solution set from a smaller set.  These techniques, respectively known as "degeneration" and "equivariant localization", can be used in concert: for example, one may degenerate to a system possessing extra symmetry.  This project will use these methods to study several problems of interest in enumerative geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to study the geometry of algebraic varieties with group actions using equivariant and degeneration techniques.  The PI will study flag varieties, Schubert varieties, and toric varieties using methods from equivariant cohomology, as well as the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies.  Motivating problems are to determine criteria for a variety to admit a flat degeneration to a toric variety, and to produce a wider class of examples where the Newton-Okounkov body can be computed explicitly.  The PI will also continue his study of degeneracy loci, and investigate their finer geometric properties by developing the combinatorics of diagrams for signed permutations.  Finally, the PI will explore applications of the recently-developed operational K-theory, focusing on the relationship between equivariant localization and Riemann-Roch theorems in this context.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aims of this project, in broad terms, were to develop algebraic models for geometric problems, thereby making such problems more amenable to computation.  A classical example is this: how many 5-by-5 symmetric matrices have rank at most 3, if one imposes generic linear conditions on the entries?  (The answer is 20.)   Major outcomes of this project include results about the degrees of degeneracy loci, which generalize the above-mentioned classical problem.  In joint work with W. Fulton, the PI proved new explicit formulas, expressing them compactly as determinants, Pfaffians, or mixtures of these.  The PI also extended these formulas to K-theory, which gives more refined information than the degree: for example, in cases where the locus forms an algebraic curve, a K-theory formula will describe the "genus", or number of holes, in this curve.  In work with L. Chen and N.

Broader impact of the award came from training and community-building activities.  During the term of the award, the PI advised 4 Ph.D. students and 2 undergraduates, and mentored 1 postdoc.  He organized several well-attended conferences and workshops, which featured expository lectures and opportunities for students.  He co-authored papers with researchers from Peru, Brazil, and Japan.
