<AbstractNarration>Increasing rates of socioeconomic change are associated with widespread increases in social distress and related mental illnesses, yet health systems often struggle to develop the capacity and knowledge for responding to mental disorders. Focusing on the biological dimensions of mental illness, scientists predominantly search for biomedical solutions. Recent studies, however, have called into question the effectiveness of biomedical treatment models, noting unexpectedly good mental-illness prognoses among populations with scant historic access to biomedical interventions. These positive prognoses have been attributed to cultural and familial practices. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, seeks to understand the impact of rapid socioeconomic change on the mental health and treatment of marginal populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University graduate student Ting Hui Lau under the supervision of Dr. Magnus Fiskesjo, will examine indigenous mental illness categories and traditional healing practices in rural Southwest China where ethnic and religious minority populations are undergoing rapid socioeconomic change. Her study includes the following two major components: First, she will document and analyze indigenous illness categories, religious cosmologies, and associated healing practices. Second, she will ethnographically evaluate the transformation of these practices in the context of rapid development. Her project advances social scientific understanding of mental illness by (1) evaluating the impact of rapid social and economic change on marginalized minority communities and their mental health; (2) deepening scholar's and policymaker's understandings of how marginalized communities derive resilience from indigenous spiritual practices in the face of social distress; and (3) contributing to scientific knowledge of the nature and origins of mental illness by giving more consideration to the social and cultural dimensions of mental illness.  Methods include participant observation, open-ended interviews, and the collection of life histories, all of which are widely accepted and standard ethnographic approaches for this type of study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focuses on understanding the impact of rapid social change on the mental health and wellbeing of marginalized minority communities. Fieldwork was carried out with ethnic Lisu subsistence farmers in the Nu River Valley of rural Southwest China&mdash;a remote mountainous region on the border of Burma. The findings from this research will form the foundation of the researcher's Anthropology PhD dissertation, several conference papers, articles, and a future book project.   In recent decades, China has undergone rapid development. Without doubt, development has lifted many people out of poverty. However, the benefits and burdens of development are unevenly distributed. For marginalized ethnic communities, development entails rapid social change and loss of traditional ways of life. In particular, an overly economistic, rationalistic approach to development overlooks people?s own definition of "the good life." This project investigates the on-the-ground realities of rapid social change in marginalized rural communities. It uses qualitative research methods (participant observation and interviews) to understand the real impact of development in ways that quantitative surveys cannot capture. This research helps us to appreciate the unintended consequences of development schemes in China. It also contributes to our comparative understanding of similar schemes elsewhere. In this way, this study and those like it help policymakers to make interventions that constitute real improvements in quality of life for marginalized populations.  FINDINGS:  The following are some of the key findings regarding how China's growth and development has impacted the lives of Lisu minority farmers in the margins of China:  1. Perceived rise in adult mortality  In the research site of this project, there is a general perception that people are dying younger and more suddenly than before. Despite overall improvements in primary healthcare services, rates of adult mortality (the chance of a fifteen-year-old person dying before the age of 65) seems to remain high and may even be increasing. Deaths by accident, landslide, street-fighting, suicide, and mysterious illnesses are said to be ever more common.   2. Perceived rise in mental illness, especially anxiety   Mental illness is also perceived to be on the rise. It is common to hear Lisu describe feeling "heart pain," an illness with symptoms similar to those of panic disorder. Severe "heart pain" can lead to hallucinations, phantom pains, and confusion. My research documents how these symptoms can be relieved through culturally appropriate local social support. But as development processes in China intensify and social support breaks down, rates of mental illness are likely to increase.  3. Loss of autonomy  As part of the poverty-alleviation drive, Lisu farmers are being forced to give up traditional farming practices and move into urban settlements. Unaccustomed to this way of life and wary of the modern capitalist economy, many Lisu fear that they will "starve to death" without farming. Such sentiments signal the Lisu?s intense anxiety about loss of autonomy and cultural sovereignty.   4. Loss of heritage  China is developing its hinterlands and border regions in a bid to maintain economic momentum in a period of slowing growth and increasing demographic transition (falling birth and death rates). Development and infrastructure projects, such as the One Belt One Road Initiative, are transforming the geographical, cultural, social, and political landscape of rural Southwest China. Marginalized minority communities like the Lisu are seeing their traditional ways of life destroyed. Many perceive development as breaking down Lisu society. As more and more Lisu people attend Chinese schools or migrate to cities to find work, interest in traditional knowledge and values is disappearing. Lisu elders worry that Lisu people are becoming Sinicized and losing their heritage.   5. Increasing frequency and severity of landslides  Landslides and other disasters remain a major problem in this mountainous region. Recent road projects have worsened the landslide problem, which was historically caused by logging. In the El Nino year of 2016, landslides were particularly serious. Field interlocutors explicitly requested that the researcher write about the effects of landslides on the lives of ordinary farmers in the region.   6. Rising debt economy: Together with China?s physical expansion into the periphery through infrastructure development, the government is also trying to recruit subsistence farmers into the debt economy by encouraging farmers to take out loans to build houses. On the ground, people worry that these policies will simply reinforce already growing income inequalities.     OUTCOME:  Five chapters of the researcher?s dissertation are already drafted and two articles are in preparation. These projects will form the foundation of a future book, which the researcher intends to write for a broad educated audience. Preliminary conclusions have already been shared in a conference paper at the Annual Conference of the Australian Anthropological Society/Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth/Association of Social Anthropologist of Aotearoa/New Zealand Adelaide (AAS/ASA/ASAA).
