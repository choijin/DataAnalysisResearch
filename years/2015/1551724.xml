<AbstractNarration>The steroid estrogen regulates many functions of the brain including behavior and cognition, while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a brain region that controls aspects of cognitive function and emotional behavior. Not surprisingly the PFC is estrogen sensitive, but there is currently little known about how it responds to estrogen. The goal of this research is therefore to determine how estrogen regulates the PFC.   The research tests the prediction that of the two main types of estrogen receptors, alpha and beta, that the PFC is regulated by beta (ERb).  Successful completion of these studies will provide novel information about an important but unexplored neuronal phenotype in the PFC.  Innovative approaches are used to examine ERb neurons and the results of these studies can impact multiple research arenas. This research project will be used for the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, particularly underrepresented minorities, in neuroscience.  Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and by student presentations at local and national meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies explore the function of a select group of cells in the mouse PFC that express ERb.  The PFC controls many behaviors including cognition, attention, and neuroendocrine stress responses. Estrogen can alter the development of this brain region, yet, little is known of the neurons in the PFC that express ERb, partly due to the absence validated reagents allowing the detection of ERb in brain.  The proposed studies will examine this group of neurons in the PFC using a novel transgenic mouse that express a fluorescent protein in ERb neurons.  Preliminary results show that the location of ERb expressing neurons changes across development of the PFC. Studies in this application will address the hypothesis that these changes reflect developmental alterations in estrogen sensitivity in different cortical layers across time. Using anatomical approaches, these studies will determine the identity of the cortical neurons that express ERb. Next, molecular approaches will be used to address the reason why estrogen receptor levels change in amount and location during cortical development and lastly, the function of identified ERb neurons in the PFC will be examined using electrophysiology</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT     This project explored the cellular mechanisms whereby estradiol (E2) affects the development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain area that regulates many behavioral and physiological functions including cognition, executive function, attention, emotion and stress responses.   We hypothesized that there are developmental shifts in the expression of estrogen receptors in this brain area that reflect changing sensitivities of different neuron populations to estrogens.  These shifts may represent the onset and close of critical windows of time whereby estrogens can affect the brain.        Intellectual Merit:    Our studies determined that the different layers of neurons in the cortex express estrogen receptors at different times of development in the mouse brain.  This is represented by a loss of estrogen receptors in the upper layers and a gain of receptor numbers in the deeper layers.   The estrogen receptors are found predominantly in pyramidal neurons which are the large neurons of the cortex that project to other regions.  The loss of neurons is not because neurons are dying, but rather because they stop expressing estrogen receptors, or begin to express estrogen receptors later in development.  The membrane properties of these neurons were explored and we found age-dependent changes in the ability of an estrogen receptor beta agonist to alter the changes in ion concentrations on opposite sides of the cell membrane (membrane potential). This represent the actions of ion channels responsible for membrane depolarization and neuronal activation and supports the possibility that estrogens can modify sensitivity of neurons to incoming signals.     Broader Impact:   Four undergraduate students were trained in laboratory techniques and neuroendocrinology. Research results were presented at international meetings in South America and the PI helped in the origination of the Pan American Neuroendocrine Society, an international scientific society that is devoted to advancing excellence in neuroendocrine research with particular emphasis on promoting the careers of young scientists interested in hormones and the brain.
