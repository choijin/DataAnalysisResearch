<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial participant support for the workshop "Computational Representation Theory in Number Theory" held July 27-31, 2015 at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.  This workshop will promote the generation and dissemination of current research in computational number theory related to representation theory.  In particular, it will foster research collaboration between senior and junior researchers.  The workshop will also address the need for access to recent computational data in these areas by disseminating results through the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), located at http://www.lmfdb.org/.  This website serves the mathematical community by providing data that is the result of rigorous computations of mathematical objects of interest in the modern number theory community, as well as by playing an educational role for students and researchers interested in number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this workshop is the connection between types of representations, particularly Galois representations, and other objects of interest in number theory, including L-functions and elliptic curves, with a focus on computation. The workshop includes lectures on Artin representations, integral representations, mod p Galois representations, and l-adic representations.  The workshop is intended to advance research in computational representation theory, particularly Galois representations and their applications to number theory.  This workshop will also foster collaboration between experts and junior researchers in these areas. The workshop will be a hybrid of typical conference and workshop formats.  The mornings will be dedicated to invited research talks and the afternoons will be dedicated to work in small groups.  During the afternoon sessions groups will work on research questions, generating computational data, or presenting computational work to the public through the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB).

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop "Computational Representation Theory in Number Theory" was held at Oregon State University July 27-31, 2015.  Eleven research talks were held, and afternoons were spent working in small groups on research, computational, and coding projects related to the L-functions and Modular Forms Database Project (LMFDB).  We had a total of 32 participants, 12 of which were women, and 17 of which were junior (untenured) researchers including 4 graduate students and 7 post-docs.   Research talks were given on a variety of topics with a focus on the applicability of representation theory in number theory.  Talks were given by researchers at various levels from full professors to postdoctoral scholars.  Abstracts, slides, and/or notes were posted for each talk on the conference website.  The conference included an hour long introductory talk about the LMFDB project, and ways participants could contribute during the workshop.  Then, during the afternoon breakout sessions the organizers provided mentoring to junior participants, and moderated project update discussions.  Some of the contributions to the LMFDB were through adding data, adding mathematical information, and through making the existing information easier to understand for the broader mathematical community and the public.  This improved the current state of the LMFDB.    It is anticipated that the LMFDB will make a positive continued impact on the mathematical community by providing access to number theoretic data in an easily accessible format.
