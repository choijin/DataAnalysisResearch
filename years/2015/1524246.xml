<AbstractNarration>This project will focus on several problems in computational complexity involving tradeoffs among computational resources. These include an analysis of tradeoffs between the communication load, processors, and rounds of communication required to do data analysis on massively parallel systems, an analysis of tradeoffs between the computation time and memory (space) needed to analyze basic statistical properties of data, and an analysis of the role of nondeterminism versus determinism in tradeoffs between time and space.  The project will also focus on counting problems for functions computed by simple classes of circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large portion of computations today is being done on a massively parallel basis in cloud data centers. Though there are programming constructs that are convenient for using this computing power, there is only a limited understanding of the extent to which these constructs are using this parallel computing architecture efficiently. The project work on communication load for massively parallel systems focuses on developing a broad understanding of this question, ideally developing more efficient algorithms in the process. Efficient algorithms to use these data centers are critical since the energy requirements of data centers are an increasingly significant portion of the total use of the electric grid.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The part of this project on finding tradeoffs between time and space required to solve computational problems involves advancing the fundamental understanding of how to use these resources most efficiently. It also will examine a special case involving time-bounded computation of an open question of much wider general interest in computational complexity: How much easier is it to check a proof of an answer to a problem than to determine whether that answer is yes or no? Finally, the portion of the project on the analysis of counting problems is motivated both by fundamental questions about what simple circuits can compute and by potential application to efficient reasoning about uncertain environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported by this award included the development of new methods to analyze the resource tradeoffs for a variety of problems in massively parallel computation, including nearly optimal algorithms and lower bounds for problems of similarity search for MapReduce architectures, and of evaluation of  database queries for single and multi-round algorithms.  This research also developed an extension of methods to analyze tradeoffs between the number of samples and the space required by on-line learning algorithms to learn finite functions from random evaluations and used these to prove near-optimal bounds on the complexity of learning polynomials over finite fields.  Products of the research supported by this award include a new method for efficiently expressing proofs of properties related to the verification of integer arithmetic, which had been conjectured not to exist, and a new method for expressing propositional logic proofs based on integer linear inequalities  that is more efficient than any previously known.  In addition, researchers supported by this award have derived answers to several natural combinatorial questions with computational complexity consequences, including the resolution of a long-standing conjecture on the densities of random walks of different lengths in graphs.  This award provided research support and training for four graduate students, including two who graduated with PhDs and two who have completed their Masters degrees and are nearing the completion of their PhD studies.
