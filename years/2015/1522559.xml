<AbstractNarration>Earplugs and earmuffs are used widely for hearing protection under noisy environments, and for listening to music and voice. Hearing protection devices with drastic noise reduction are in high demand in high intensity noise environments, such as in machine shops, military shooting range, airport ground personnel, pilots in jet fighters, and personnel on decks of aircraft carriers. However, current acoustic insulation materials, such as acoustic foam, are not adequate for noise reduction.  This I-Corps team intends to introduce compact, high performance earmuffs that can insulate from high pitch noise as well as a broad spectrum of hash noise than what can be provided by hearing protection devices currently available in the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed porous nanostructured materials with drastic air-borne acoustic attenuation, reaching sound attenuation on the order of 20-60 dB/cm, much higher than the acoustic foam (which gives 10 dB/cm under same testing condition) currently used for earplugs, or earmuffs. The porous nanostructured materials (namely aerogels) developed are ductile, and flexible, allowing it to be used as materials for fabrication of earplugs, and earmuffs. In this project the I-Corps team intends to take the first step towards commercialization by developing prototype earplugs and earmuffs, and conducting market research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through prior NSF support we developed mechanically strong, ductile porous nanostructured materials, namely new types of aerogels for mechanical and biomedical applications. Through sound attenuation testing, we found that these aerogels have extremely high acoustic attenuation property, reaching 30-60 dB/cm, in contrast to the traditional sound insulation material, such as black polyurethane foam, which can only reach less than 10 dB/cm under the same testing condition. In this project, we took the first step towards the commercialization of this technology by developing prototypes for super acoustic insulating hearing protection devices. We interviewed over 100 customers, and identified areas where drastic sound attenuation using thin and lightweight materials is much needed. We developed organic aerogel earplug prototypes and conducted noise reduction rating tests. The results indicate that our aerogel earplugs provide high NRR values. The aerogel earplugs have potential for use in high-intensity noise environments for protection for hearing loss. During the project, two NSF REU undergraduate students, and two high school students conducted research on aerogels in the summer 2015. The research experience has stimulated the interest of some of these students. The team plans to continue to work towards commercialization of the technology to help create quiet environments in society.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/31/2016<br>      Modified by: Hongbing&nbsp;Lu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
