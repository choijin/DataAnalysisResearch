<AbstractNarration>This award provides three-years of funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the 2015, 2016, and 2017 events in the "Prairie Analysis Seminar" series. The meeting in the first year of the award will be held on September 25-26, 2015, on the campus of Kansas State University, with the conference moving to the University of Kansas in Fall 2016 and returning to Kansas State in Fall 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fall 2015 event will be the thirteenth edition of the Prairie Analysis Seminar, an annual regional conference serving the Midwest that has over the years showcased a wide range of topics in analysis. The featured speakers at the 2015 meeting will be David Kinderlehrer and Rob McCann. The format for the conference provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Prairie Analysis Seminar is a joint project of the mathematics departments of the University of Kansas (KU) and Kansas State University (KSU). The focus of this project was an annual conference that alternated between the two campuses. This report describes the activities of the 2015, 2018, and 2019 conferences held at KSU, and the 2016 conference held at KU.                                   The goal of these events was to bring to the geographical area leading experts in mathematical analysis and Partial Differential Equations, allowing for interaction with local mathematicians. Each conference featured a main speaker who gave two one-hour talks. This speaker was considered at the forefront of the field and reported on recent important progress. Also featured were invited speakers who were established or highly promising early career mathematicians. They each gave a one-hour talk on related topics. In this way each conference had a theme and presented a thorough introduction to an exciting emerging area.  A core objective of the events was also to encourage the participation of students, postdocs, and junior mathematicians carrying out research in the area of focus of the conference series. The seminar was organized so that junior colleagues could present their work in short talks and have a chance to receive the full attention of the main speakers (no parallel or poster sessions were ever scheduled). The conferences proved to be very beneficial for young researchers.  Presentation slides from most of the speakers are preserved on the conference website for the use of students and researchers.  A further objective was to involve students and faculty from traditionally underrepresented groups. The organizers aggressively advertised the conferences through organizations dedicated to increasing the participation of underserved groups in mathematics, and in all advertising stressed that those from these groups were strongly encouraged to participate and present their work. The conferences had substantial participation from mathematicians from underrepresented groups.  The organizers also reached out to researchers in the geographic area who were working in isolated settings and who do not always have access to research-level mathematics.  In addition to participants from the region, the conferences drew participants from across the U.S. and often included participants from Canada and other countries.  Social events at each conference -- teas, a lunch, and an evening party -- gave an opportunity for informal interaction. These gave all participants the opportunity to make connections, and this was particularly important for junior colleagues who could get to know senior researchers in the field. Each conference also featured an informal problem session.  Before the Prairie Analysis Seminar there was little interaction between the mathematics departments of KSU and KU. The PIs at KSU and KU interacted all year planning the conference, inviting speakers, reaching out to junior mathematicians, preparing reports, and planning for future events.
