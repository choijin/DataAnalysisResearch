<AbstractNarration>The goal of the Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing systems conference series (SASO) is to provide an interdisciplinary research forum, focused on advancing the foundations for engineered networked systems and services based on principles of self-adaptation and self-organization.  Understanding these principles will enable design and development of safer, more secure, more reliable future systems ranging from smart resilient electric power grids to future intelligent transportation systems with driverless cars.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This workshop grant will enable students from many diverse fields to participate in discussions at this workshop with leading international researchers and to advance a shared community vision of the potential of self-adapting and self-organized engineered systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  SASO is one of three affiliated FAS* (Foundations and Applications ofSelf-* systems) conferences.  Self-* refers to the collection of techniques that allow computer systems to be resilient: self-organizing, self-adaptive, self-managing, etc.    FAS* is acoalition of 3 co-located conferences and their associated workshops that were founded to bring together a variety of themes in Self* computing including self-organization, self-adaptation, autonomic computing, while still maintaining the core themes of the three member conferences. The conferences collectively deal with various aspects of highly adaptive and self-organizing systems, emphasizing robustness,autonomy and resilience to cyber attacks.   The three conferences are:     SASO: The 9th International Conference on Self Adaptive and Self Organizing Systems CAC: The 12th International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing   P2P: The 15th IEEE Peer-to-Peer Computing Conference    The core ideas explored in the SASO workshop program are key aspects of computer science that are rarely addressed in a common forum. For example, the community that deals with bottom-up self-organizing systems rarely connects with the community that deals with top-down self-adapting systems. In practice, resilient systems require both types of techniques acting in concert. SASO and the broader FAS*community provides the forum for such interchanges. In particular, the workshop program allows researchers from multiple sub-disciplines to interact across the traditional discplinary boundaries. This type of cross-disciplinary exchange is of particular value to graduate students.  In addition to its technical track, SASO included a series of keynote addresses, a set of workshops and a PhD consortium to allow for morei ntensive exploration of ideas at the cutting edge of the various fields. This year the workshop program included six separate workshops.   Historically, it has been difficult for students to attend this collection of events due to the combined cost of travel, housing and registration.  This proposal's main goal was to ease this burden by greatly reducing the registration cost for students.   The major goal of the NSF grant was to provide access for students to the rich program of SASO and its associated events by greatly reducing the cost for student attendees to the SASO and FAS* events.  This is of particular significance due to the high cost of hotel rooms in the Cambridge area.  To do this we reduced the student registration fees to less than 10% of the normal registration fee.   27 Students were registered (of a total of roughly 200 participants) asignificant increaes over previous meetings.
