<AbstractNarration>Making is fast growing topic area to get students and K-12 teachers engaged in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math), particularly engineering. In this team's research in the Maker Community, the team has witnessed many examples of Adult and Young Makers being entrepreneurial with what they have built. Educators, parents, and makerspaces are all interested in how to train young people for a technologically complex future. Parents often send their children to summer camps or encourage them to participate in after school activities which can provide technical skills. Makerspaces provide a community and tools to their members. This I-Corps team believes that bridging the gap will provide value to the end-users, customers, and market. A broad range of educators could benefit from curricula, projects, support, marketing, and funding materials for running their Making education goals. This includes K-12 teachers, homeschooling families, science centers, makerspaces, and university educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team aims to leverage its understanding of adult and young Maker educational pathways to build chain-reaction STEAM Machines(TM) and Making+Tinkering engineering outreach short-courses for STEAM outreach with middle school and high school students. The team intends to facilitate a broad adaptation of STEAM education principles through hands on project-based learning and provide professional development for teachers and science centers. The team imagines a holistic solution that includes curricula, projects, support, marketing and funding solutions, and optional products such as materials and on-site consulting. The team's interest is in being a catalyst for Making becoming an experience by which students are exposed to invention, innovation and entrepreneurship mindsets. This is an opportunity to grow a future workforce who invents, builds and markets innovative and useful solutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  We have been able to increase the impact and growth of our STEAM and Making engineering education outreach programs by "getting out of the building" and doing customer discovery interviews with over 100 stakeholders through the Innovation Corps for Learning. We were able to better understand the "value propositions" for parents and kids alike, including:  gain creativity missing from rote work setting build practical ingenuity-ness, grow towards being self-directed overcome fear of failure; get creative confidence add teaming mileage found in sports; w/out competition get learning in context be a superhero and solve problems    We built on our understanding of the educational pathways of makers to investigate how to scale and sustain STEAM and Making outreach activities for middle school and high school students. Specifically, through chain-reaction STEAM Machines&trade; and Making+Tinkering engineering outreach short-courses, we have been able to develop these offerings further.   Our team developed a better understanding of our engineering outreach efforts through the NSF Innovation Corps program. We started with an idea to host 4 week summer camp sessions for STEAM and design learning, and developed that more fully into "ready-to-go, pop-out invention studio experiences to build solutions for problems you care about." Specifically, we have developed Rube Goldberg Speed-Build in a bag that contains essential elements for constructing a Rube Goldberg Machine that will Pop A Balloon! These have been exhibited at Maker Faire Bay Area and are sold on the Rube Goldberg Inc. website. We have developed and held "The Art of Invention" summer camp sessions at the ASU Chandler Innovation Center facility for middle school and high school students on the topic of 1) design thinking and creative problem solving, and 2) making and tinkering.   Through participation in the National Science Foundation?s Innovation Corps for Learning program, we adapted lean launch methods to explore and develop a better understanding of what engineering outreach can offer.  We used "customer discovery" practices to interview more than 100 people, focusing on the "pain points" for the "customer segments" of parents and kids.
