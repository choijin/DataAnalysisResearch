<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for three workshops enabling participation by US scientists in the international "Belmont Forum Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Scenarios Network", known as ScenNet. This network currently includes nine countries (Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Norway, South Africa). The core goals of ScenNet are to strengthen ties between researchers working nationally and internationally on future scenarios of biodiversity science, biodiversity health and ecosystem services. A particular focus is to make the best in international biodiversity research count in international biodiversity assessment and policy research needs. Ecosystems and biodiversity worldwide are currently undergoing rapid change. The projected redistribution of species and their associated ecological functions and services crosses national boundaries, and to reliably quantify impacts and help prioritize actions to mitigate them will require international research collaborations. Two important research and science-policy platforms, the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and Future Earth have recently been formed to address the magnitude and potential effects of these ongoing transformations. The ScenNet group and activities supported by this award are being done collaboratively with scientists participating in the IPBES and Future Earth efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supporting workshops involves researchers from a wide range of disciplines covering all aspects of biodiversity scenarios including modeling of impacts of global change on biodiversity and ecosystem services, scenarios of socio-economic development that take into account biodiversity and ecosystem services, and feedbacks of changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services on decision making. This effort includes integration with US NSF Genealogy of Life (GoLife) projects. Workshops will address key opportunities that arise through the combination of global, species level perspectives and data (as advanced by the NSF GoLife projects) and the usually more spatial, assemblage-focused approach of biodiversity scenario assessment as represented by the ScenNet/Belmont community. The workshops will bring together representatives from both communities to discuss the potential for integrative products and visualizations on digital platforms, followed by integrative modeling opportunities and the use of citizen science information.</AbstractNarration>
