<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the meeting "Sensitivity, Error and Uncertainty Quantification for Atomic, Plasma &amp; Material Data" to be held at Stony Brook University, November 7-9, 2015. The meeting will bring together computational physicists, chemists, mathematicians and computational scientists to understand and develop the tools of uncertainty quantification applied to theory and simulation relevant to systems ranging from materials processing to astrophysical plasmas. The modeling in these systems is critically dependent on data validation, verification, uncertainty analysis and quantification. This meeting represents an opportunity to exploit advances in the science of uncertainty quantification to improve our understanding in these systems.</AbstractNarration>
