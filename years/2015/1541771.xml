<AbstractNarration>The Arizona State University will convene a workshop to advance an operational, national-scale definition of food-energy-water (FEW) systems complexity and outline a portfolio of basic research questions and programs needed to improve efficiency and resilience across the components of the FEW systems on the local and national scale. The workshop will create new synthetic knowledge that will contribute to the definition of necessary research programs.  Workshop activities will provide a platform for collaboration and the creation of new teams to pursue research across the food-energy-water challenge area. Participants include faculty from universities in EPSCoR states and from minority serving institutions such that workshop activities will strengthen science and technology opportunities on these campuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Food-Energy-Water (FEW) nexus is a rich area for basic research in sustainability science that would harness and synthesize insights from multiple fields, including complex systems, materials science, hydrology, civil, electrical and environmental engineering, computation and social science. The nexus contains myriad components covering technology, infrastructure or institutions that need to be included in any problem resolution.  The 3-day workshop on the ASU campus will host approximately 60 attendees from multiple universities, national labs, and federal/state agencies. The goal is to invite a balance of participants representing food, water and energy with expertise in a mix of subjects including infrastructure, environmental engineering and institutions. This workshop will advance an operational, national-scale definition of FEW systems and outline research challenges that contribute to improved efficiency and resilience of national and regional FEW systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to organize and deliver a workshop on national food-energy-water research needs and produce a report describing directions the NSF and other research agencies should take in creating FEW grant programs.  We delivered a workshop in October 2015 in Tempe Arizona on the ASU campus to 50 academics and professionals and later co-sponsored a second workshop in Boulder Colorado on FEW and big data.  The resulting project report succinctlhy defines research needs on food-energy-water in data science, engineering, materials science, social science and outreach.  The future of FEW systems lies in understanding governance as underscored by the conspicuous placement of institutions in our FEW system trifecta (Figure 1). Tuning, not restructuring, the existing institutional overlay through policy that promotes collaboration across food-energy-water agency divides will most effectively transform performance and resilience of FEW systems. There are very  7 | P a g e promising bio-inspired technologies for improving the energy efficiency of water, producing renewable energy and reducing the energy intensity and nutrient fluxes of commercial agriculture. But there is no single technology ("silver bullet") without tradeoffs.
