<AbstractNarration>This project is a scientific conference (Phys-Fest) focused on plant physiological ecology at the Konza Prairie Biological Station, in Kansas. Participants will collaborate in data collection as an organized group, each with their own field research equipment to address the question: What is the physiological variability within plant species of the tallgrass prairie? This question has scientific value, as physiological ecologists are aware that statistical variability in physiological processes often exceeds the mean response. Without replicated scientific equipment and trained scientists, measuring the physiological variability within an ecosystem is impossible.  The meeting format will also promote networking and interactions among participants through a series of scientific presentations and meeting with established leaders in the field.  Participants at Phys-Fest will create a plant eco-physiology video teaching library for free distribution online. Participants (and others within the field) will be encouraged to create short video lectures on their research specialty.  As this video library grows over time, the educational outreach potential will be high. The final objective of Phys-Fest includes strategic planning for activities that promote long-term coalescence of the field.  These activities include mentorship of students and postdoctoral associates at the conference, planning for future symposia addressing key questions in ecological physiology, and planning for a second Phys-Fest meeting.  At least half of the invitees to the conference will be students and post-docs, allowing them to be exposed to important training and networking opportunities as they become established in the field.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on plant eco-physiology (Phys-Fest) and deviate from the typical conference format of short presentations and posters.  Here, participants will collaborate in data collection to characterize the spatial and diurnal variability in leaf-level carbon and water traits of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. This question has important scientific value as leaf-level plant physiology data is variable - yet no one quantifies this variability because adequately characterizing such variability in an entire ecosystem is beyond the capacity of an individual investigator and the equipment and instrumentation in an individual's laboratory. Conference participants will characterize the inherent physiological variability in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem (1) spatially across resource gradients on site; (2) diurnally within functional group/species; (3) serve to assess linkages between response variables and environmental variability in both space and time. These data will provide multi-metric, high temporal and spatial coverage for key physiological plant traits in mesic grassland and will provide baseline assessments of variability for future measurements in other ecosystems. The organization of Phys-Fest is specifically designed to promote networking and professional development for student and post-doctoral participants. Nightly sessions with established scientists in this research field will be held to mentor junior scientists and initiate discussion addressing research frontiers within plant eco-physiology. Finally, attendees will develop short video presentations on subject material within their specialty for classroom teaching.  This video library will be hosted on a YouTube channel and will be an invaluable teaching resource.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We convened a plant ecophysiology meeting from June 5-9, 2016 in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem at the ~3,500 ha Konza Prairie Biological Station, outside Manhattan, KS. This meeting (PHYS-Fest) was specifically focused on promoting collaboration, interactions, and networking among plant eco-physiologists. PHYS-Fest included 50 participants interested in plant eco-physiology (32 students, 15 academic faculty, and 3 scientists from industry).  Student participants came from universities across the USA, had a mix of interest and experience, and represented demographically-diverse groups.  PHYS-Fest varied from the traditional scientific meeting format of short research presentations organized by focus areas. Rather, participants collaborated in data collection to address a pre-defined scientific question (i.e., What is the physiological variability within common growth forms of the tallgrass prairie?) and worked towards the development of short video presentations on ecophysiological subjects for contribution to a video library for classroom teaching. Each night, "networking sessions" were conducted to mentor junior scientists and facilitate interactions among faculty / research labs.  PHYS-Fest was organized to accomplish 3 distinct objectives:   1)  characterizing the diurnal physiological variability within tallgrass prairie plant species  2)  compilation/ creation of a plant eco-physiology video teaching library  3)  strategic planning for the field of eco-physiology  By pursuing these three goals, we aimed for the meeting to initiate discussion addressing research frontiers within plant ecophysiology, promote collegiality among participants, and allow for vision development for our field.  Significant positive results of PHYS-Fest can be assessed in terms of the 3 primary goals outlined for this meeting.  In response to Objective 1, we collected gas exchange data on the same individuals from 8 species from 18 locations at 3 times per day.  This resulted in a very large dataset to characterize variability in leaf-level physiology.  Hydraulics data was generated for over 40 herbaceous species, and fluoresce data was collected for the same species/locations used for gas exchange.  Data analysis by the students is in progress and we will allow interested persons to form groups for manuscript preparation in the Spring 2017.   Objective 2 focused on the creation and compilation of a plant eco-physiology video teaching library.  During the meeting, 4 teaching videos were created. This effort was primarily led by 2 students, both of which had previous experience with video creation. These students created a YouTube channel to be focused on plant ecophysiology broadly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClXA-KXkv-lxkjds_QVwr6Q  Future videos will include ecophysiological techniques as well as ecological concepts.  Over time this collection of videos will grow and will serve as valuable tools for classroom instruction and demonstration.   The final objective was focused on ?strategic planning? for our field.  Loosely defined, this objective was exemplified by the opportunities for training and professional development that occurred during this meeting. We had organized discussions on Wednesday evening (with invited keynote speakers) and on Thursday morning related to identifying key research gaps in our field (~ Grand Challenges-type questions).  Our goal is to work towards establishing a regularly-occurring meeting that combines ecophysiology instruction, data collection/science, and scientific collaboration.    At the conclusion of the meeting, student assessment was extremely positive, with regard to techniques and eco-phys skills learned, opportunities for collaboration and networking, and the ability to interact and discuss ideas with faculty participants.  Student self-assessment shows an average increase of 43% in terms of confidence using the scientific techniques taught.  Overall, this meeting was very successful as gauged by the positive, motivated attitude of the student and faculty participants, the enthusiasm for eco-physiology, and the potential to leverage this meeting to cultivate future scientific advances in our field.
