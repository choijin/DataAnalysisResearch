<AbstractNarration>TECH MeD (Transdisciplinary Education for Critical Hacks of Medical Devices) seeks to engage a broad audience about the cybersecurity implications of remotely accessible, implantable medical devices. The project will educate undergraduate and graduate-level students from various disciplines, healthcare professionals, patients, and the general public about the ethical, legal, social, and technical implications of these remotely accessible devices. Growing the population of security-aware end-users of implantable medical technology, the initiative will address one of the most critical links in the cybersecurity chain. TECH MeD will equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary for the appropriate handling of this technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECH MeD will include four educational tools: 1) An online open-access course that features expert interviews on important topics to create an informed public, aware of the host of issues associated with implantable medical devices; 2) An undergraduate and graduate course that will create a pipeline of cognizant and prepared professionals to address the present and future challenges of this proliferating technology; 3) A Continuing Medical Education (CME) course that will provide medical professionals with an overview of the issues they are likely to encounter on the front lines of medicine; and 4) An open-access website document repository for the general public with useful information for educators, students, and patients. The website will ensure the continued success and widespread education of the TECH MeD initiative by offering easily understandable information for patients, their families, and all other laypersons seeking information on implantable medical device security.</AbstractNarration>

This project resulted in 5 major educational "products": a massive open online course (MOOC) developed through Coursera, an online continuing medical education program, an undergraduate course syllabus, a graduate course syllabus, and a public repository of all course materials.
