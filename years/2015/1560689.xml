<AbstractNarration>Lighting is a crucial component in a number of applications, and as such it is the number one source of electricity use in the commercial and industrial markets. The number of installed lamps in these applications is only about half of that used in residences, but the amount of electricity used by these high-power lights is three times as high. These customers are operating high-power lamps for an extended period of time daily - using large amounts of energy for lighting and searching for an energy-efficient alternative. Target applications where there is a high potential for energy savings by implementing energy efficient lighting technology include parking, roadway, and sports lighting; high-mast lighting in seaports, airports, and stadiums; warehouse lighting; indoor agricultural lighting; and hazardous area and underwater illumination. These applications require a far-reaching directional light source, where the present innovation may achieve this with high energy efficiency and low cost. This project aims to advance solid-state white lighting technology through increasing energy efficiency and decreasing cost. The proposed innovation relies on laser-stimulated phosphor technology to create an energy-efficient, high-power light source. Commercialization of this innovation could lead to the next generation of ultra-efficient and smart light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies and drastically increasing the availability and uptake of energy-efficient light sources in the high-power market, in turn, reducing&lt;br/&gt;global energy consumption and helping to preserve our environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to evaluate the commercial feasibility of laser-stimulated phosphor technology for solid-state white lighting. Specifically, the proposed project will perform customer discovery research within the high-power lighting market, resulting in a commercialization plan and market focus; and will develop an optical simulation model based on laser-phosphor interactions to be used as the basis for further design and optimization to inform future prototyping efforts. The fundamental research conducted previously has showed that laser-stimulated phosphor emission is a viable alternative to produce high-quality white light. The next steps in commercializing this innovation involve identifying the market segments with the greatest need, and adapting our technology to fit those needs through innovative optical designs. Exploration and optimization of optical designs will therefore be the focus of this project. By exploring potential design schemes,the capabilities of this technology can be more fully understood and quantified. Optical modeling will be used to create and optimize designs, understand optical interactions, simulate illumination,and quantify potential performance capabilities. This will be done using the LightTools Illumination Design Software, a 3D optical engineering and design software product that supports virtual prototyping, simulation, optimization, and photorealistic renderings of illumination applications. Proper use of the simulation software to produce accurate results requires an understanding of the materials involved and their optical properties. The goal of the current project will be to develop a working simulation model that accurately simulates the optical interactions and resulting photometrics, agreeing with experimental data. This will include single laser models, using a blue or near-ultraviolet laser diode in combination with various phosphor compositions and matrix composites. Once an accurate model is established that agrees with experimental data, further optimization and designs can be explored that will inform future prototyping efforts. The technology demonstration at the end of this project will be an accurate model that will serve as the basis for further research in laser-stimulated phosphor technology, both within the goals of commercializing this current innovation and for future research efforts in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project are to advance laser-based lighting technology towards commercialization, and to train the team and gain experience in entrepreneurial activities. In addition to these goals, broader impacts of this project include increasing the availability and uptake of energy efficient light sources to the public and creating synergistic activities between academia and industry.  The core of laser-based lighting involves the efficient transformation of laser light into usable white light using novel optical designs and materials. Commercialization of laser-based lighting could lead to the next generation of ultra-efficient and smart light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies and drastically increasing the availability and uptake of energy-efficient light sources in the high-power market, in turn, reducing global energy consumption and helping to preserve our environment.  This project focused on exploring the commercial viability of this technology through identifying market segments and interviewing potential customers. It was quickly identified how broad and segmented the lighting industry is, and a decision was made to focus on exploring the entertainment lighting and high mast lighting industries, where LEDs have not yet successfully penetrated.  Interviews were conducted with lighting end users, fixture manufacturers, distributors, lighting designers, architects, contractors, and maintenance personnel, and determined the value propositions that drive each customer. It was found that the value propositions that drive the entertainment lighting industry are different from those that drive the high mast lighting industry, as well as the paths to enter these markets.  In the high-mast lighting industry, end users focus on low upfront cost and the return on investment from electricity and maintenance cost savings and longer product lifetimes. They expect a product to be on the market for several years, with data to back up its performance, before adopting a new technology on a strict budget. However, the entertainment lighting industry is one of the relatively smaller lighting markets.  Lighting designers are the influencers who push for new technologies, and the fixture manufacturers are ready to adopt. Brighter and more compact light sources provide fixture manufacturers with more design flexibility &ndash; the ability to create smaller, lightweight, and less expensive fixtures. Brighter lights and lower energy consumption allow their customers to use more light for added features.  The major value proposition identified for this product, that was common to all customer segments and unachievable using currently available technology, is a light source that produces a narrow beam of light with an angle of 5 degrees or less. There is a strong market pull for narrower light sources, because there arenÆt many available today. The activities of this project and program have taught important entrepreneurial skills to the team through the course curriculum and webinars, and through hands-on customer discovery interviews.
