<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to commission a polarization-sensitive radio receiver and build a digital backend for the CO Mapping Array Pathfinder (COMAP) experiment, as well as observe for two years using this equipment on a 10m-diameter radio telescope. The COMAP program is part of a much larger effort by the astronomical community to understand the origin and evolution of the universe and the formation of stars and galaxies. Broader impacts of the work include mentoring of undergraduates and research training of graduate students in instrumentation development. The COMAP team will communicate their results via public lectures, web pages, and activities at the telescope. Students and early-career researchers will be trained in a variety of cutting edge techniques in radio frequency design, technology development and analysis of large data sets. Personnel funded by this proposal will participate in an education and outreach program at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, bringing the excitement of scientific research to a diverse community that includes a Native American population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMAP aims to measure emission from both the CO J=1-0 transition at redshifts 2.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 and the J=2-1 transition at 5.8 &lt; z &lt; 6.7, probing the 3D power spectrum of CO, which acts as a tracer for star formation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Stanford collaborated with Caltech, the University of Miami, and the University of Maryland to build the COMAP experiment, which is designed to investigate the epoch of galaxy formation between 2 and 3 million years after the Big Bang.  The COMAP experiment comprises a 15 GHz camera with 19 pixels   fielded on a 10m telescope at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) in California. The camera maps the distribution of carbon monoxide (CO) in the gas contained in these forming galaxies by looking at spectral lines produced by CO.  The frequency of the spectral line depends on the distance of the galaxy, allowing a 3-D map of the distribution of the gas to be obtained.  This information can then be used to test star and galaxy-formation models. The COMAP instrument has been completed and is now in its data-taking phase.   The Stanford team had several tasks as part of the building and commissioning of COMAP.  These included testing the calibration system and the feed horns that channel the radio waves onto the detectors, writing part of the software used to monitor the instrument performance, modeling the expected scientific reach of the instrument and modeling the possible effect of unwanted signals that could contaminate or mask the signal of interest.  Some of the results from this modeling include: showing that the presence of hydrogen cyanide in these galaxies, which also produces a signal at this frequency, would not significantly contaminate the CO measurements; showing that a significant increase in the science reach of COMP can be obtained by comparing its CO maps  with optical surveys of the same galaxies; and showing that standing waves -- a type of contaminating signal produced by the 15 GHz radio waves being reflected back and forth within the instrument -- can be removed by using a technique called sky differencing, in which the maps from two separate pieces of sky are compared to remove the common standing wave.   Stanfordâ€™s work on COMAP has contributed to the development of the STEM workforce through training of graduate students and postdocs. One graduate student completed a PhD thesis on the experiment and wrote several papers exploring the science reach of the instrument. That student is now a postdoc at the University of Toronto.
