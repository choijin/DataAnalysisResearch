<AbstractNarration>Rip currents transport biota, pollutants, and sediment from the shoreline to the continental shelf, and are a hazard to swimmers with over 100 fatalities per year. These narrow, transient, offshore-directed jets are difficult to observe, and thus there are few field tests of hypotheses for their generation, evolution, three-dimensional structure, and feedback with evolving seafloor morphology. Rip currents can be driven by alongshore variations in wave breaking, often associated with gaps in sandbars or depressions in the surf zone seafloor. Existing field observations near channels dredged across the surf zone and a numerical model tested with the field observations will be used to investigate the coupling and feedback between waves, currents, and morphology in and near rip channels. Although the main focus of the project is on the fundamental physics of hydrodynamics and morphodynamics near large perturbations to the surfzone seafloor, the project investigators will be collaborating with colleagues from federal agencies with more applied interests in nearshore processes. In particular, the post-doctoral fellow will work closely with the USGS colleagues who developed the model  and other federal agency scientists to perform model simulations designed to provide results in line with their missions. The model will be a useful tool for these agencies to predict waves, flows, and beach changes, including responses to storms and engineering projects. In addition, the project investigators will collaborate with National Weather Service and National Ocean Service scientists to improve forecasts and warnings of rip currents and other hazardous beach conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2012 large shore-perpendicular channels were dredged in the surf zone with the underlying hypothesis that alongshore changes in wave breaking over the channels would drive strong rip current circulation cells (shore-parallel feeder currents converging and turning seaward at an offshore-directed rip jet). The three-dimensional circulation and evolving morphology was measured for a range of wave conditions and channel sizes, and included transitions from rip currents flowing offshore through the channels to alongshore currents flowing across the channels, and channels that migrated and filled. The field observations of waves, currents, and bathymetry in the presence of dredged shore-perpendicular channels will be used to ground truth and calibrate the numerical model. The numerical model will be used to investigate the hydrodynamic and morphologic response for a range of wave forcing and bathymetric perturbations. Although this study will focus on the rip channels we excavated, the results will be applicable to a wide range of nearshore systems, with or without complex bathymetric features.  Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: (i) How does the three-dimensional nearshore circulation respond to different wave conditions and bathymetries, and what forces control transitions between alongshore flows and rip currents? (ii) What are the couplings and feedbacks between waves, currents, sediment transport, and morphological evolution that lead to channel migration, growth, or decay?</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit</p> <p>To investigate the dynamics of flows near non-uniform bathymetry, the evolution of currents and morphology was observed for a range of wave and tidal conditions within and near single channels (on average 30-m wide and 1.5-m deep) dredged across the surf zone at five different times (Figures 1 and 2). In addition, circulation was simulated with the numerical modeling system COAWST, initialized with the observed incident waves and channel bathymetry, and with an extended set of wave conditions and channel geometries. The simulated flows are consistent with alongshore flows and rip current circulation patterns observed in the surf zone (Figure 3). Near the offshore-directed flows that develop in the channel, the dominant terms in modeled momentum balances are wave breaking accelerations, pressure gradients, advection, and the vortex force. The balances vary spatially, and are sensitive to wave conditions and the channel geometry. The observed and modeled maximum offshore-directed flow speeds are correlated with a parameter based on the alongshore gradient in breaking-wave-driven-setup across the non-uniform bathymetry (a function of wave height and angle, water depths in the channel and on the sandbar, and a breaking threshold) and the breaking-wave-driven alongshore flow speed. The offshore-directed flow speed increases with dissipation on the bar and reaches a maximum (when the surf zone is saturated) set by the vertical scale of the bathymetric variability.</p> <p>Broader Impacts:</p> <p>Although rip currents are a major hazard for beachgoers, the relationship between the danger to swimmers and the physical properties of rip-current circulation is not well understood. In this project, the relationship between statistical model estimates of hazardous rip-current likelihood and <em>in situ</em> velocity observations was assessed. The statistical model is part of a forecasting system that is being made operational by the National Weather Service to predict rip-current hazard likelihood as a function of wave conditions and water level. The temporal variability of rip-current speeds (offshore-directed currents) observed on an energetic sandy beach is correlated with the hindcasted hazard likelihood for a wide range of conditions. High likelihoods and rip-current speeds occurred for low water levels, nearly shore-normal wave angles, and moderate or larger wave heights. The relationship between modeled hazard likelihood and the frequency with which rip-current speeds exceeded a threshold was assessed for a range of threshold speeds. The frequency of occurrence of high (threshold-exceeding) rip-current speeds is consistent with the modeled probability of hazard, with a maximum Brier Skill Score of 0.65 for a threshold speed of 0.23 m/s, and skill scores greater than 0.60 for threshold speeds between 0.15 and 0.30 m/s (Figure 4). The results suggest that rip-current speed may be an effective proxy for hazard level, and that speeds greater than ~0.2 m/s may be hazardous to swimmers.</p> <p>In addition, this project provided a post-doctroal research posoition for Melissa Moulton, who now is an assisianr scientist at the University of Washinton's Applied Phjysics Laboratory.
