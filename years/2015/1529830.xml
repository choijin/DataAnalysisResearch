<AbstractNarration>Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient, a potential environmental contaminant, and an indicator of chemical reactions involving oxidation and reduction, in both present and past environmental systems. Chemical and biological processes control the mobility and environmental impact of Se. Although Se oxidation is an important Se-mobilizing process, our understanding of this process is limited. Additionally, although measurements of variations in Se stable isotope abundances (82Se/76Se ratios) provide a powerful new way to study key chemical reactions involving Se in modern and ancient environments, poor understanding of Se stable isotope shifts caused by Se oxidation limits interpretation of Se isotope data. Therefore, this project will investigate stable Se isotope variation caused by oxidation as a means to achieve a robust understanding of Se oxidation in the environment. Investigators will train one postdoctoral fellow, two doctoral students, and 6-8 undergraduate students per year through programs that target underrepresented students. The societal benefits of this project include communications with the concerned governmental agencies to enable better assessments of Se fate linked to human nutritional adequacy, toxic thresholds and the fundamental understanding of Se in the earth system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of the project is to integrate stable isotope geochemistry and microbiology to gain an improved understanding of biotic and abiotic Se oxidation. The specific objectives are to (1) demonstrate that microbial Se oxidation supports chemoautotrophic growth, (2) determine the magnitude of Se isotopic fractionation caused by microbial and abiotic oxidation of reduced Se-species, and (3) examine oxidation of Se in natural soil/sediment matrices to determine how the laboratory-derived fractionation factors will apply in natural environments. Controlled laboratory experiments will be conducted to determine reaction rates and Se isotope fractionation during microbial and abiotic Se oxidation. Slurry experiments with soils and sediments of two different field sites will provide complementary understanding of Se oxidation in natural samples under well-defined conditions. By establishing a link between Se oxidation and Se isotope fractionation, the results will open new avenues for studies of Se cycling and the fate of Se as a micronutrient and contaminant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Selenium is an essential nutrient, yet it is toxic at elevated concentrations and causes problems with wildlife and humans.  It is released into drinking water, streams, and surface water from agricultural, mining, and coal combustion activities.  Selenium in rock and soil is found in solid form, but it may be transformed by oxidation reactions into soluble, mobile forms which have much greater environmental impact.  These forms may, in turn, be transformed back into immobile, less harmful, solid forms by reduction reactions.  Geochemists have worked for decades to develop understanding of such complex transformations of selenium in a range of settings.  This project was part of an ongoing effort to develop measurements of the stable isotopes of selenium as a new method to provide additional information about the sources of contamination and the oxidation and reduction reactions that control environmental impacts.  The intellectual merit of this project I lies in its work to fill an important knowledge gap:  How do selenium stable isotope ratios (82Se/76Se) respond to oxidation reactions that mobilize various forms of selenium, oxidized by manganese oxides, hydrogen peroxide, and microbes?  Controlled laboratory experiments were carried out to address this question.  Conducting the experiments was mostly the responsibility of the University of California at Berkeley collaborators.   The UIUC group (this report) was mainly tasked with making the selenium stable isotope measurements, which are extremely demanding and are made in only a few laboratories in the world, and helping to design the experiments and interpret results.  The UIUC effort was a small part of the overall project; a graduate student was supported for 2 months per year.  This included a training period to learn the difficult methods.  The UIUC graduate student performed experiments to determine if selenium isotope ratios of solid minerals are shifted during oxidation and mobilization of the selenium.  Significant shifts were observed, with the most oxidized and most mobile form of dissolved selenium, selenate, having higher 82Se/76Se ratios than the selenium in the minerals.  A less oxidized and less mobile form of selenium, selenite, was also produced; it was lower in 82Se/76Se ratios.  This suggests a mechanistic understanding of the isotope ratio shifts:  The second step of the process, the oxidation of selenite to selenate, is the driver of the observed shifts, which vary with the conditions but may be as large as 3.5 per mil (0.35%).  The uncertainty of the measurements is 0.2 per mil, so they can readily distinguish these effects.  Experiments with oxidation of selenium-contaminated soils were carried out by the Berkeley collaborators; the Se isotope analyses of the experiments' products were done at UIUC.  The released selenate had a lower 82Se/76Se ratio than the soil, by a relatively small amount (0.6 per mil).  The difference between this result and the one from the mineral oxidation experiments is likely related to the fact that the selenium in the soil is present mostly in organic molecules rather than minerals.  Overall, the oxidation experiment results provide an initial understanding of Se isotope changes induced by weathering of rocks and soils:  We expect minor shifts when most of the selenium in the rock or soil is found in organic molecules, but the potential exists for larger shifts when it is found in minerals.  This is a new discovery and thus the project has obtained fundamental knowledge that fills part of the knowledge gap that inspired the work.   The project has broader impacts beyond the disciplinary contributions described above.  This new knowledge is needed as scientists develop ways to use selenium isotope measurements as practical indicators of the oxidation reactions that release selenium into the environment, or the reduction reactions that may sequester it and decrease its impact.  This approach is beginning to be used by consultants and government scientists charged with understanding and mitigating selenium contamination, but basic science questions like the ones addressed in this project must be addressed to provide a complete foundation for the applied work.  Ultimately, selenium isotope methods should help consultants, and the industries they serve, to increase understanding, and thereby decrease the cost of, addressing selenium contamination in the environment.  The project also contributed to the development of human capital.  The Ph.D. student who carried out most of the work is becoming one of the world's experts in the use of these new stable isotope methods.  The project allowed her to learn selenium isotope measurement methods, adding to her expertise with two other toxic elements, tellurium and antimony.  Her knowledge of selenium methods allowed her to mentor a very talented African-American undergraduate student who worked in the lab for two years and used selenium isotope measurements in a senior thesis.  This student now works in the environmental consulting industry.          Last Modified: 01/25/2020       Submitted by: Thomas M Johnson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
