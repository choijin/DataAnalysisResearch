<AbstractNarration>Astronomical observations have shown that virtually all massive galaxies can be expected to have a supermassive black hole residing at their center. Surrounded by dense star clusters, these black holes will frequently capture stars into highly eccentric orbits.  A fraction of these stars will be compact objects: stellar mass black holes or neutron stars.  As these compact stars orbit, they radiate gravitational waves, causing the orbit to decay and the star to eventually be swallowed by the supermassive black hole. The emitted radiation is potentially observable in future space-based gravitational wave detectors.  The theoretical work funded by this award will provide better understanding of the expected signals from highly-eccentric compact merging binaries.  Detection of gravitational waves from such extreme-mass-ratio binaries will provide a unique strong-field test of gravity and a probe of the nature of black holes.  This award contributes to scientific workforce development through the involvement of graduate students and the training they receive in physical modeling, mathematical analysis, and numerical and computational methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In greater detail, the primary research efforts associated with this award are: (1) refined development of two accurate mathematical and numerical gravitational self-force methods, and the associated computer codes, that are useful for computing gravitational waves from merging compact binaries with small mass ratios and highly eccentric orbits; (2) using one such method to make highly accurate comparisons of calculated gravitational waves with the distinct and complementary post-Newtonian approach; and (3) using the second numerical self-force method to calculate the orbital decay, gravitational wave emission, and merger of eccentric binaries in the late stages of their orbital decay.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research funded by this award delved into several areas of gravitational physics theory, including modeling black hole binaries, investigating particle creation in curved and accelerating-mirror spacetimes, and developing numerical relativity techniques.  The primary intellectual focus was on using black hole perturbation theory and self-force calculations to understand extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), binaries where one black hole is much more massive than its companion.  EMRIs are expected to be a prime gravitational wave source for LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.  This project focused on eccentric orbit self-force calculations, motivated by current astrophysical expectations about EMRIs.  One of the major outcomes of the project was development of an arbitrary precision Mathematica code for making black hole perturbation calculations.  As part of the effort we developed a fast spectral source integration technique for orbit solutions and for perturbation source calculations, which made possible high-precision eccentric-orbit computations up to 200 or more digits of accuracy.  These high-accuracy calculations involved novel use of Mathematica on a supercomputer, calculating hundreds of Fourier-harmonic modes simultaneously.  We used this code to explore the analytic form of gravitational wave flux contributions to high post-Newtonian order (7PN).  Separately, we used another self-force code to make long-term evolutions of highly eccentric EMRIs, without and with a spinning secondary.  In other work, we studied the time dependence of particle creation in curved and accelerating-mirror spacetimes, showing the behavior at the onset of black hole formation.  Finally, another project studied the construction of initial data in numerical relativity for highly boosted black holes with spacelike slices exhibiting trumpet geometry.   This project had broader impacts in several distinct forms.  The theoretical work on black hole binaries contributes itself in an indirect way to experimental efforts by providing waveform expectations while LISA is in the design planning stage.  Secondly, specialized analytic and numerical techniques developed under this award may potentially have broader uses beyond gravitational physics theory.  Thirdly, as part of this dissemination effort, we helped found the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit (BHPTK) website (https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit) for sharing computer codes and numerical and analytic results.  Our group also hosted the international 20th Capra meeting on radiation reaction in general relativity in 2017 (https://wasabi.physics.unc.edu/event/6/).  Additional significant impact came through funding the training and education of three graduate students, who collaborated with the PI on all of the scientific work.  Three PhD theses were part of the project outcome.         Last Modified: 08/21/2018       Submitted by: Charles R Evans]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
