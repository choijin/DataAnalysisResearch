<AbstractNarration>Following the example of the previous three successful Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposia at the University of Georgia, this award will support participation in a cycle of three conferences rotating among major research universities in Georgia: Emory, University of Georgia, and Georgia Tech. The first conference will take place at Emory University on October 16-18, 2015. The second conference will take place at the University of Georgia in October 2016, and the third at Georgia Tech in October 2017.  The aim is to sustain and grow collaborations between mathematicians in the Southeast, and to nurture a new and diverse generation of students and postdocs, by providing a regular series of exciting mathematical activities and a forum to meet peers and attend talks by leading experts in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry are some of the most established and active areas of mathematics and have deep connections with many other subjects. In addition to their central role in mathematics, they have important applications in encryption, physics, engineering, biology, and a host of other sciences. The conferences will aim at presenting the latest advances in these fields to a wide audience of local researchers, students, and postdocs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symposium web site:  http://research.franklin.uga.edu/gags/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was to organize a conference "Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium 2016",  one in a cycle of three conferences over a three year period,  the other two being organized by our friends and collaborators at University of Georgia and Georgia Tech.  Each conference has a particular theme expressing interests of the organizers for that year: more arithmetic, tropical, algebraic, geometric, etc. This cycle of conferences  continues a very successful previous installment of three conferences "Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium" held in 2012, 2013, 2014  at the University of Georgia.   The conference  at Emory University  was held during  October 23 -- 25, 2015. There were about 75 participants, from Georgia, the Southeast, and beyond.  We had 9 invited lectures by established researchers.  The specific goals of this cycle of conferences is to strengthen the research  ties between the major universities in Georgia, and the Southeast region?  to provide opportunities to the students in the Southeast and beyond to attend lectures by leading mathematicians  on new and exciting research.  There were about 85  registered conference participants, the majority of them  students and postdocs. This was an exciting event for everyone who participated. For many young people, this was the first major conference to attend. The main point of dissemination is our web page  https://sites.google.com/site/galgeoms2015/   It contains the schedule,  abstracts of all the talks and the list of registered participants.
