<AbstractNarration>Recent research indicates a nanofiber-based filtration system can potentially provide an effective, efficient, and easy-to-use water purification technology. Fundamentally, nanofiber-based materials make ideal filters due to inherent properties, such as: extremely high surface area to volume ratios, high levels of porosity, and high levels of surface interactions and cohesion. While the societal benefits of nanofibers are clear, the barrier to commercialization lies in the difficulty of shifting manufacturing from the laboratory setting to full-scale mass production. Currently the most popular method of nanofiber production is electrospinning, which is very difficult to scale-up. Recently, this team has developed a polymer processing system capable of producing nonwoven mats of composite polymer fibers. Unique to this process is the ability to strictly control the number and thickness of alternating layers within the fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this NSF I-Corps Team project is to identify a potential market to commercialize a new form of nonwoven polymer nano-composites. These new fiber materials are created using a novel melt-blowing process that offers a scalable and environmental friendly approach. The nature of the process allows for the processing of various types of polymers with multiple functionalities creating a large number of opportunities for the development of new products. With such a wide range of potential applications, and based on initial research, the team's initial focus has been directed to the liquid filtration industry. Initially, the team has identified the potential for these fibers to replace those used in ?plate and frame filters? utilized in the final steps of processing waste water in the micro-brewing industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major activities related to this project consisted on conducting a large scale customer discovery program across the country. Fig. 1 shows schematicly the roadtrips in the seven week process. During this phase we visited multiple customers in the food industry in need of filtration products. In the final stages in this process, we focused mainly on beer filtration resulting in almost a hundred visits to different breweries.  After talking with potential customers, we identified multiple potential product market fits, all of them with a focus on beer clarification and filtration, as shown in Fig. 2. These findings include three potential filtration areas, 1) iincoming water to match water profiles; 2) pre/post fermentation clarification to eliminate haze in "lighter" beer styles; and 3) treatment of process waste or water waste.  In addition, we developed a research partnership with the Food Science Department at Virginia Tech in an effort to optimize our MVP.  In July of 2015, VT commissioned a 2.5 hectoliter pilot scale brewery with all of the necessary equipment to validate our application, image 1.    Further development of methods and equipment associated with the production of advanced filtration media can be directly applied to future projects.  This type of selective filtration could have uses in many areas where specific contaminants are to be removed from a liquid.
