<AbstractNarration>Due to the ubiquity of computers and their critical role in society, modern computer engineering and science curricula incorporate a far wider range of topics than was traditionally taught. As a result, some fundamental concepts may not be sufficiently reinforced across the curriculum to allow students to understand them with full clarity.  This deficiency in the Computer Engineering curriculum, a field with significant technological, scientific and societal ties, could have long-term negative impact.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This project will organize a workshop to convene faculty and experts in the discipline of  Computer Engineering to address ways to improve instruction across the curriculum that (1) ensures that key ideas are sufficiently reinforced and (2) current curricular coverage is maintained. It will emphasize parallel and distributed computing, a key component of modern computer engineering and science education.&lt;br/&gt;         &lt;br/&gt;Direct impacts of this project are on expected improvements in student retention and graduation rates, and overall career success. The systematic and planned exposure of students to advanced computing concepts across the curriculum will better prepare engineers to work on complex systems. More broadly, this project will promote science by helping produce engineers well-grounded in the fundamentals who will become the next generation of scientists, researchers and faculty members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to improve education in parallel and distributed computing (PDC) by introducing key "concept dots" early on in the curriculum that can be "connected" in subsequent advanced courses. This approach is useful for a sustained reinforcement of fundamental ideas through the curriculum. More specifically, this project seeks to introduce PDC concepts through a first course in digital logic. A workshop to bring together instructors and experts in PDC and digital logic will be organized. The goals of this workshop are twofold:        &lt;br/&gt;    (a) Concept Inventory: Learning different approaches to and experiences from teaching core courses in computer engineering and science (including digital logic), identifying important and difficult topics and developing a set of best practices (for which topics to emphasize and how;        &lt;br/&gt;    (b) Concept Application: Encouraging attendees to incorporate some of the ideas from the workshop into their courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project is to address ways to thread the coverage of important topics, a little at a time, through a sequence of courses in a computer engineering or science curriculum. The idea is to introduce key concepts early on, starting from lower-level courses (such as digital logic and first programming), with the purpose of reinforcing the concepts in higher-level courses throughout the curriculum. To address this objective, "The Workshop on Connecting Concepts Across the Curriculum" was held on February 4-5, 2016 at the Cook Hotel and Conference Center, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge.  Three broad questions were addressed during the workshop:  Which topics are both important and difficult for students to understand? Can these topics be captured through broad "concept-threads" that can be woven through a course sequence? Can these threads serve to introduce and strengthen the comprehension and retention of these concepts? Are there course/level-specific ways to introduce these concept-threads in a typical curriculum?   The "target" courses/areas that were considered are Digital Logic, Programming and Algorithms, Embedded Systems, Computer Organization and Architecture and Computer Networks.  The most important computing concepts (that students also find difficult to grasp) that were identified at the workshop include: (a) Abstraction, (b) the idea of "State," (c) Addressing, (d) Trade-Offs and Optimization, (e) the difference between Data and Control, (f) the Design Process (particularly Modularity), and (f) Asymptotic Thinking and Scalability.  For each of these concepts and each of the target courses, a thread of topics was identied that could be used to unfold and reinforce the underlying concept. For example, consider the idea of state. Early on, a state could be a flip-flop output in digital logic, or a variable value in a  programming or algorithmic context. In computer organization or architecture, the contents of registers and flags may be the state. In general, the idea of a state that should be constructed through the different courses is that of information from the past needed to take the next step. This is more directly understandable in the context of checkpointing and state restoration (taught possibly at a higher-level course).  In addition to the development of concept threads, the workshop featured two invited talks on "Connecting Computing Education Threads in a Coherent Active Learning Environment," and "Introducing Computer Systems from a Programmer's Perspective."
