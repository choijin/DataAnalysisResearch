<AbstractNarration>Using scent to communicate is common in primates and even can occur in humans. Yet research on primate olfaction (sense of smell) lags behind studies of other senses such as vision and hearing.  Understanding how scents communicate information, what reactions they produce, and how this information is chemically communicated, can improve our understanding of primate behaviors and motivation. In order to measure and characterize primate scents, researchers have used laboratory methods that require large, high-cost equipment and sample preservation during shipment from a field site. In this high-risk project, the investigators will test a portable field method for characterizing the chemical composition of scents in real time. If the field method is feasible, it will allow new avenues of research that could advance the understanding of olfactory communication in primates and other mammals. This project will promote international collaboration between US and Brazilian researchers, and support student training at a US institution with a high number of first generation college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory-based gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been the standard method for quantifying the chemical composition of primate scents. In this high-risk project, the investigators will explore the potential and feasibility of a portable, in-field GC-MS method to characterize the chemical composition of scent marks for wild common marmoset monkeys in Brazil. Development of a field method would mitigate the expense and challenges associated with long-distance transport of samples, and allow for data collection on how scent cues change over time in their original context and the resulting reaction by recipients of the scent mark.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The use of scent as a mechanism of communication is ubiquitous in primates, including humans. Despite the recognized significance of scents, research on primate olfaction lags far behind other senses such as vision and hearing.  Understanding how scents communicate information, what reactions they produce, and how this information is chemically communicated can improve our understanding of primate behaviors and motivation.  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been the standard method for quantifying the chemical composition of primate scents.  However, until recently this technology has been restricted to the lab due to the bulk and high cost of the equipment, severely limiting field researchers? ability to study how olfactory communication is used by primates under natural conditions.   This NSF funded project leveraged recent advances in portable GC-MS technology to develop methods for characterizing the chemical signatures of wild animals in real-time, under natural conditions.  Despite challenges posed by accessing scents in the forest canopy, we were able to successfully sample scents from an arboreal primate.  Likewise, we utilized control samples to successfully account for compounds introduced into samples from the background environment.  Most importantly, the substances we found overlap with those known to occur in primate scent secretions, demonstrating that we were successful in sampling and characterizing the substances deposited by wild animals.  Furthermore, the scent profiles we obtained through this method corresponded to changes in the behavior of animals observed visiting these scent marks.  This demonstrates that our approach that utilizes portable GC-MS is capable of generating meaningful insight into the sensory ecology of primate signaling.  Adapting GC-MS capabilities to the field will significantly advance studies of primate olfactory communication and provide insight into a wide range of research questions from mating strategies to foraging efficiency, as researchers will for the first time be able to assess communication under ecologically- and evolutionarily-meaningful conditions. We have begun to disseminate our results to ensure they reach the scientific communities that can benefit from this technology.  We have presented these results at international and regional conferences, and plan to submit the results for publication by the end of the year.  Beyond impacts to the scientific field, this project also had broader impacts to society.  In particular, this project fostered international collaboration between an American and a Brazilian University, provided research opportunities for American students at a predominately undergraduate institution, and supported scholarly opportunities for early career professionals in Brazil.
