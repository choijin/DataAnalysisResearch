<AbstractNarration>This project generally aims to investigate climatic signals recorded in wood anatomical features of western U.S. conifer species in relation to two leading climatic modes, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In the arid and semi-arid environment of the Western U.S., water is the main limiting factor for forest ecosystems, plant communities, and human socio-economic systems. Improved understanding of past inter-annual and decadal dynamics of PDO and ENSO variability in the Western U.S. would benefit land managers and policy makers as they prepare for possible sustained drought events projected under different climate scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of the project are: 1) to define the tree anatomical response associated with long- and short-term growth variations driven by decadal and inter-annual climatic oscillations, in particular the hydraulic acclimation exhibited during positive/negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and during El Niño/La Niña events; and 2) to evaluate the potential of intra-annual tree-ring anatomy as a proxy to be integrated into dendroclimatic reconstructions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers expect to generate century-long time-series of anatomical features (i.e., cell size and cell-wall thickness) for five target regions of the western U.S., from the moisture-limited environments of the American Southwest and Great Basin to the temperature-limited Pacific Northwest.  A total of twelve sites will be sampled by targeting climate-sensitive conifers (mostly Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, and Pinus ponderosa).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, wood anatomical features have been used as proxies for dendroclimatic reconstructions at limited spatial and temporal scales yet no studies have focused on the relationships between long-term intra-annual hydraulic adjustments and regional climatic patterns in the western U.S. This research, by developing and utilizing a much larger dataset than previous investigations, could also make it possible to assess the effect of sample size on the variability of climatic signals reconstructed using wood anatomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support graduate and undergraduate students, will contribute to K-12 STEM education by training high school science teachers selected from a pool of applicants to become Summer Research Fellows, and involves an international collaboration with the Helmholtz-Centre Potsdam - GFZ German Research Centre Dendrolab.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Climatic changes in the western US depend, in part, on what happens in the Pacific Ocean, including the El Ni?o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The effects of these multi-annual fluctuations can best be understood when viewed over long periods of time, so that one can separate them from other climatic phenomena, including the North American Monsoon (NAM).</p> <p>During this project we collected almost 600 tree increment cores from 25 forest locations in the states of New Mexico, Arizona, California, and Washington. In the laboratory, these wood cores were analyzed using a combination of traditional dendrochronological tools and innovative cellular-level methods.</p> <p>Short- and long-term variability of tree-ring measures (total width, earlywood width, latewood width) and wood anatomy (cell lumen area, tracheid diameter, cell wall thickness) were investigated in relation to ENSO and PDO. Our results included a 350-year reconstruction of how water-year precipitation in the Southwest depends on cool-season precipitation driven by ENSO variability, and on summer precipitation associated with the NAM.</p> <p>From detailed microscopic analyses, we found that cell lumen is controlled by moisture availability for western conifers such as bristlecone pine, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir. We also tested how stem size, sap flow, and wood formation of five-needle pines (limber and bristlecone) are linked to environmental changes in remote sky-island ecosystems of the Great Basin.
