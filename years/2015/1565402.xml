<AbstractNarration>Steel and other metallic structures may be susceptible to cracking when subjected to repeated loading.  Various types of loads, such as waves, vibrations due to machinery, wind-induced vibrations, traffic or other cyclic loads, can induce gradual formation and growth of cracks at critical locations in these metallic structures.  Structures that are susceptible to be cracking can be found in many sectors including industrial facilities, manufacturing, chemical processing, marine and off-shore structures and vessels, pipelines, transportation infrastructure, and energy-related infrastructure.  Current techniques to repair these cracks typically require welding or bolting.  This requires the use of heavy equipment, which may not be feasible when access to the site is limited.  Further, these operations may require a disruption of service of the structure due to the formation of heat and sparks (which could lead to explosion in some cases) or due to noise, which could adversely affect occupants.  This project will address these shortcomings by introducing a repair technique that can be implemented without the use of heavy equipment and which does not require welding or bolting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite patches can be bonded to the surface of cracked steel structures to bridge the cracks, thereby reducing the stress range near the crack tip and increasing the fatigue life of the cracked element.  The benefit of these patches can be increased by prestressing the patches, such that they induce compressive stresses near the crack tip and ahead of the crack front.  However, current techniques to prestress these composite patches typically require the use of cumbersome and heavy fixtures and a stiff reaction frame, which may be feasible in laboratory applications but impractical in the field.  The proposed study exploits the so-called shape memory effect of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires to achieve this prestressing effect.  By restraining the thermally induced contraction of prestrained SMA wires and using carbon fibers to bridge the crack, the proposed SMA/CFRP patches can substantially increase the fatigue life of cracked steel elements.  This technology has the distinct advantages that it does not require the use of heavy equipment, and therefore can be installed in locations where access is limited.  Further, since the installation does not require welding or otherwise generate sparks, high heat, or open flames, it can be implemented with limited or no disruption of service.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF I-CORPS Teams award provided the I-CORPS team with the opportunity to investigate the commercial potential of a newly developed technology for repairing metallic structures.  Through the process the team investigated several industry sectors, including commercial buildings, wind turbines, bridges, and unweldable aluminum structures as potential markets in which customer segments may be identified.  Through this process, a primary customer segment was identified as "Engineers responsible for the maintenance of steel bridges with stress-induced fatigue sensitive details (those constructed before 1978), and distortion-induced fatigue sensitive details (those constructed for 1986)".  The repair and joining of thick, unweldable aluminum plates was identified as a potential secondary market area.  However, the team decided that further pursuing that sector should be delayed until the primary market is more fully developed and commercialization in that direction is more mature.  On-going technical efforts will be directed towards demonstrating the effectiveness of the system for repair of distortion-induced fatigue damage and in more thoroughly characterizing bond behavior, two areas in which customer discovery interviews indicated a need for additional information.  The team will also investigate more thoroughly the commercial potential of the technology to assess whether or not the technology can lead to the development of a viable and self-sustaining business.  That is, would repairs using this technology be sufficiently repeatable and scaleable to sustain a viable business?  The information gained through this NSF I-CORPS experience is invaluable to the further development of the technology.
