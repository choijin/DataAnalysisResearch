<AbstractNarration>As a part of a White House sponsored "Data to Knowledge to Action" event held in November 2013, dozens of public and private organizations met to announce an array of Big Data related collaborations. To sustain the forward momentum of the Data2Action event, the National Science Foundation has been working to establish a national network of "Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs." These hubs will stimulate, track, and help sustain new regional and grassroots partnerships around Big Data. This series of 5 workshops will support four Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs centered in the Northeast, West, Midwest, and South regions the United States.  These hubs will help Big Data stakeholders from different sectors (e.g. industry, academia, non-profits, local government) partner around collaborative projects that will further Big Data innovation in their geographic region.  The Hubs could take on activities including but not limited to accelerating development of Big Data solutions, forging collaborations across sectors, help share best practices, speed up technology transfer, instigate dialogue between thought leaders on social impacts of Big Data, and supporting the education and training of the Big Data workforce.  The first four events will provide a space for stakeholders to exchange ideas, discuss potential projects, and devise a set of actionable goals within their region. The final summary event will bring together members of each of the four regions together to synthesize their conclusions and develop action items, as well as discuss cross regional-collaboration.  As a part of this workshop series, a virtual community platform will be established so that interested stakeholders that are not able to attend the live events can connect and collaborated with other interested parties in their region; this platform will be made available and open to users for one year.  The primary outcome of this meeting will be a consensus on the design and governance of each regional Hub by major Big Data stakeholders in the region and plan of action for implementing the Hub.  A summary of this information will be made available in written form by workshop organizers; supplemental information will be available on the virtual platform and supplied by workshop participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The USENIX Association planned and implemented the logistics for one-day workshops for each of the four Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs, as well as a fifth summary Big Data Innovation National Hub workshop. Four diverse regional cohorts of approximately 40 invited attendees each spent one focused day targeting challenges and identifying solutions provided by the exploding field of Big Data. The USENIX Association handled all hotel contracts, meeting room rental, room block reservation, audio-visual (AV) requirements, and catering orders. USENIX also managed the events? Web site, and both developed and managed the attendee registration system.  USENIX sub-contracted with Knowinnovation (KI) for meeting facilitation and advance screening and management of white paper submissions by interested potential attendees. KI employs experienced meeting facilitators with expert knowledge on processes to facilitate collaborative idea generation and synthesis. In coordination with USENIX and NSF staff within the CISE Directorate, KI managed reporting and content outcomes from the Big Data Regional Innovation Hub workshops. The NSF organizers for each regional hub workshop worked closely with KI to create a fluid and effective one-day format. After an introduction at each regional meeting by an NSF representative, brainstorming sessions began, supplemented with several smaller breakouts during the day. Workshop participants were selected from those who submitted white papers, and each meeting convened with a set of ideas and concepts in place to set priorities and stimulate discussion. To optimize the planning and coordination of these intensive one-day meetings, KI worked with the NSF to ensure advance communication both within and between the regional hubs.  The tight timeline among the four regional meetings was designed to draw on the momentum created by effective collaboration around a common cause, but it also required constant dialogue among the various players in the regions. Activities included surveys, online group discussions, and other forums to hone concepts and goals prior to each workshop.   The fifth and summary national meeting assembled approximately 10 stakeholders from each of the four regional hubs over the course of two and a half days in Washington, DC. Unlike the rapid succession of the four regional hub workshops, the longer interval between the last of the regional workshops and the final summary meeting gave participants time to agree on the content their region wishes to push forward and to synthesize their conclusions and proposed action items.
