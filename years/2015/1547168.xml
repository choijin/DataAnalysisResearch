<AbstractNarration>Global climate change has accelerated our need to understand disease dynamics. Diseases transmitted among hosts by small invertebrates such as mosquitoes or ticks (vectors) are on the rise across the world but links to climate change are unclear. Climate change can impact vector-borne disease transmission directly by shifting the occurrence of competent hosts and vectors, or a parasite, or more subtly by changing the timing or nature of their interaction. Predicting the response of vector-borne diseases to climate change requires both an understanding of how all the species involved are likely to be affected as well as new ways to identify and predict how they interact and furthermore how they and their interactions may evolve. This research will develop and test functional models of vector-borne diseases that incorporate co-evolutionary change. Specifically, the project will develop models that account for past and predict future evolution of responses to avian malaria, a mosquito borne disease, using a database of disease prevalence in the endangered Hawaiian honeycreepers. This research will answer important questions in epidemiology by measuring and integrating evolutionary changes in hosts, vectors and parasites into predictive models of disease dynamics under future climate scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ideal disease system in which to develop and train such a model is avian malaria in native and introduced Hawaiian birds. The agent of avian malaria in Hawaii is a non-native Haemosporidian parasite, Plasmodium relictum, vectored by mixes of two non-native strains of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. Avian malaria in Hawaii occurs as a series of replicated natural experiments in which vector and parasite prevalence vary along elevational gradients on several islands, and a parallel gradient in tolerance among some bird hosts has been reported. Although P. relictum was previously highly virulent to all Hawaiian honeycreepers, evolution of tolerance (or resistance) has been observed in several species such as the Amakihi (Hemignatus sp). Within- and among-species differences in the degree of tolerance suggest that genomic variation underlie such differences; moreover, there is geographic variation within and across islands in host species composition, host tolerance, climate (temperature and precipitation), vector abundance, vector competence, and pathogen fitness. This system has been studied for several decades; thus, many of the host and vector demographic characteristics are well understood. Specifically this project will (1) use a machine learning approach to develop ways to correlate the genetic data from the relevant species with the ecological, environmental, and epidemiological pressures that might shape their evolution; (2) analyze past and current parasite diversity using Next Generation genomics to be fed into the model. Though constructed with reference specifically to the Hawaiian Plasmodium system, if successfully validated, this model methodology will then be available for broad application into any disease system in which evolution is expected to occur in response to shifting climatological, environmental, or ecological conditions.</AbstractNarration>

Such introductions have had important consequences to the health of humans and their pets and livestock, and also to the health of native species and ecosystems. In Hawaii, an exotic avian malaria protozoal parasite, vectored by an exotic mosquito, causes exceptional mortality in many species of native Hawaiian birds. Due in large part to their susceptibility to the malaria parasite many of these species have become endangered and several have already become extinct.  Yet the same parasite has little or no negative effect on birds introduced to Hawaii from the mainland, which initially were the primary hosts.  Until recently, the mosquitoes that vector bird malaria in Hawaii, which belong to a tropical species, have been largely limited to elevations below 1500 m. Therefore, most native bird species have survived at elevations above this level, where the mosquitoes are rare and the malaria parasites cannot develop in the cooler temperatures.  However, due to yet another inadvertent consequence of human activities, global warming, temperatures at higher elevations have increased over the past decades, allowing the mosquito and the malaria parasite to expand their ranges upslope.  This process is predicted to continue and will place the native birds in formerly mosquito-free habitats in harms way from malaria infection. However, a limited number of native bird species have been able to survive at and recolonize low elevations indicating the capacity for an evolutionary response to malaria infection.  Our objective is to understand and model the Hawaiian avian malaria, bird and mosquito system in order to predict the consequences of continued upslope invasion to the native bird communities that reside there and ultimately devise strategies to safeguard them.  We have developed a unique algorithm that can incorporate genetic and genomic data along with other variables to integrate specific evolutionary change in predictions about infection dynamics and impacts.  We have also developed additional genomic resources that can be used to obtain evolutionary data to incorporate into the model framework.  These include methods to obtain genomic sequences from the malaria parasite and multiple hosts with differing susceptibilities to malaria infection, and efficient gene-targeted DNA capture methods to assess genomic variation in the mosquito vector.  What we learn from this research and our novel approaches will allow us to improve current predictions of the outcomes of infectious disease invasions into na&iuml;ve populations of wildlife, but also can be generalized to any host-vector-pathogen system, including ones relevant to health of humans or our domesticated systems.
