<AbstractNarration>Economists have studied possible economic and structural effects of mega-regional trade agreements. The reduction in trade costs, harmonization of rules and standards, and structural adjustment are estimated to create large welfare gains. However, it is extremely difficult to model the impact of these new types of trade agreements on innovation and the distribution of innovation gains. Much depends on how the new international rules are written and implemented for intellectual property protection, the development and use of technical standards, government procurement, competition policy, and other forms of industrial and innovation policy. These new international benchmark standards for trade could well be far more important for the competitiveness of the US economy and its global partners than the mere reductions of border-trade costs, which economists model with the most confidence.&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be on emerging trends in Asia-Pacific Trade Agreements and their impact on innovation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of international corporate networks that integrate dispersed production, engineering, product development and research across geographic borders is a defining characteristic of globalization. These networks may be hampered, if the new trade rules are incompatible with global standards.  The proposed workshop will address these and other issues related to the mega-regionalism trend. The focus will be on the new international benchmark standards for trade defined by the emerging Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP) and by other trade agreements, including Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and the related TRIPSPlus and Competition provisions; plurilateral trade agreements such as the Information Technology Agreement (ITA); and debates on a possible Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). This agenda-setting workshop will examine</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to enhance multidisciplinary understanding of globalization at the intersection of international trade and innovation. Specifically, it focused on the new "mega-regionalism" in the Asia-Pacific region and brought together high-level experts from academia, the private sector, and government agencies to investigate how this new trend will affect issues related to research and development, innovation, foreign direct investment, trade, and ultimately economic development. It produced a high-level conference with 30 participants at which cutting-edge papers were presented,  discussed, and highlighted important and yet under-researched topics, with the intention of laying out possible agendas for policy-related research in the general area of trade and innovation.  Workshop participants were carefully selected to maximize the impact on:  a) Trade and innovation policies of governments and academics; and  b) Corporate strategies related to trade, foreign direct investment, intellectual propoerty rights and technical standards.  In addition to making new analytical contributions, the conference allowed for extensive cross-disciplinary interaction, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and disseminating new ideas for future work.  It also actively involved several young scholars and editors and, hence, it served as an educational vehicle for future generations of scholars.   Intellectual Merit and Broader Outcomes   Mega-regional trade agreements such as the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) signal the beginning of big changes in international commercial governance, moving beyond tariff reduction toward the harmonization of rules, regulations, and policies.

Participants were able to:  Learn more about the megaregionalism movement, its origins and its effects through various channels on growth and development Receive truly multi-disciplinary training in not only their own fields but also other disciplines (e.g., trade specialists learned about innovation, supply chains and legal aspects of intellectual property rights; innovation and legal experts learned about trade effects, and so on);  2. Young scholars from the University of Hawai?i, the University of California, and elsewhere in the United States and Europe were exposed to cutting-edge research techniques;  3.

Debates in US and other Asia-Pacific government agencies are being shaped through the participation of policymakers in the workshop.
