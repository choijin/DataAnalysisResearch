<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for student participation in the Symposium on Undergraduate Research to be held at the Laser Science XXXI Conference.  This conference is of great importance to the vitality of atomic, molecular, and optical physics in the United States because almost all work in this area involves lasers in some way. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Laser Science XXXI Conference, which this award supports, is a joint meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Laser Science and the Optical Society of America's annual meeting to be held in San Jose, CA in October, 2015. This Conference offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).</AbstractNarration>

Prof. Metcalf had been called the previous day by Emily Conover, a reporter sent by APS to cover the meeting, and his response to her was that she should talk with the students.  She came to the poster session, interviewed quite a few students, and wrote a wonderful front-page article for APS News (copy attached) and posted at https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201511/undergrads.cfm.  The poster session ended at 12:45, we gathered for a group photo (copy attached), and enjoyed a sandwich lunch in the Glen Ellen room of the Fairmont Hotel.

The quality of the talks was uniformly very high, and the two oral sessions were an unqualified success.  Students enjoyed snacks between the sessions, courtesy of one of our corporate sponsors, Thorlabs.  A sign board with logos of all the corporate sponsors was prominently displayed at all Symposium meals and sessions (copy attached).  It was gratifying that these very young scientists could give their first presentations at a professional meeting, and it was clearly a memorable event for them.  Fifteen of this year's presenters were female, an impressive representation and above the national average among undergraduate physics students.                          This year again we also enjoyed significant corporate support that is detailed below.  In addition there was a large donation from AIP through SPS.
