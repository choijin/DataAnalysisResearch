<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Mark Tuckerman at New York University, Professor Chulsung Bae at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Professor Michael Hickner of the Pennsylvania State University, and Professor Stephen Paddison of the University of Tennessee are designing, synthesizing, and testing new materials for use in alkaline fuel cells and discovering a set of rules for best practices in the development of future materials for fuel cell applications.  As the United States seeks to enhance its energy security through identification and development of clean energy sources a range of technologies need to be leveraged in order to secure a sustainable energy supply.  Electrochemical devices are an important part of this mix of technologies, and among these, fuel cells constitute some of the cleanest and most sustainable technologies. Several key hurdles to harnessing the potential of fuel cells (as well as various other electrochemical technologies) remain to be surmounted.  The team of investigators are focusing on anion exchange membrane fuel cells that have advantages over other types of fuel cells in not requiring precious metals and being operable with a variety of fuels at low temperature. The project is employing a cohesive strategy involving mathematical and computer modeling of specific materials components that may, in turn, guide the synthesis of new materials, the characterization and testing of these materials in actual fuel cells, and the determination of optimal design principles to govern future materials engineering in this area. The project is also providing education and training for graduate and post-graduate researchers in both theoretical and experimental aspects of materials science and engineering, thus ensuring the competence and creativity of the next generation of STEM researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The understanding and design of cost-effective and reliable polymer architectures for use as ion-conducting membranes is an important challenge facing emerging electrochemical device technologies. Currently available proton exchange membranes are problematic due to high cost, environmental concerns of fluoroplymers, and often poor performance under nonideal conditions. Additional challenges in proton exchange membranes fuel cell applications include difficult water management due to electro-osmosis, high fuel crossover, and the requirement of expensive platinum catalysts. Fuel cells based on anion exchange membranes have the potential to alleviate most of these problems. However, little systematic knowledge of how best to design these materials exists at present despite the fact that liquid-electrolyte alkaline fuel cells were among the first fuel cells to be developed. The team of researchers is applying an integrated, iterative theoretical-experimental approach towards the targeted syntheses of polymers, the first-principles computer simulations of specific polymer chemistries, the mathematical and experimental characterization of structures/morphologies, and the measurement and computational modeling of long-range hydroxide ion transport.  Through this cohesive effort, the team of investigators is aiming to advance fundamental science and engineering knowledge in the area of fuel cells membranes and to deduce a set of fundamental design principles for anion exchange membranes that accelerate the time between concept and production of practically useful materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fuel cells have been considered a promising technology for clean, efficient, and carbon-free energy conversion and storage for decades.   Like an engine or a battery, a fuel cell is a device that converts chemical energy from fuels into electrical energy using electrochemical reactions.  However, unlike a battery, which stores energy inside the device, a fuel requires a continuous input of fuel and can run as long as the fuel is supplied, just like an internal combustion engine.     While fuel cells can run on a variety of fuels, hydrogen is the cleanest and is the target for most current fuel cell technologies.  Among these, proton exchange membrane or PEM fuel cells have received considerable attention in the last twenty years and are now being used to power cars such as the Toyota, Mirai, Hyundai Nexo, or Honda Clarity.    In a hydrogen PEM fuel cell, hydrogen molecules, which consist of two protons and two electrons, are broken down into these constituents at the anode using a catalyst.  The electrons create the electrical current, and the protons must be shuttled to the cathode through proton-conducting medium usually consisting of a negatively charged polymer and a water-based (aqueous) acid solution called an electrolyte.   The protons are combined with the electrons and oxygen to produce the only waste product, water, which can be recovered and reused.  PEM fuel cells are compact in size and can operate over a range of temperatures.   Furthermore, the acidic medium environment of the PEM requires the use of acid-tolerant platinum-based catalysts to break down the hydrogen fuel.     Recently, another type of fuel cell known as the anion exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cell has gained significant traction in the fuel cell community, as AEM fuel cells have intrinsic advantages over PEM fuel cells. In an AEM fuel cell, water and oxygen are fed to the cell at the cathode and combined with electrons to produce hydroxide (OH&minus;) anions. These hydroxide anions must be shuttled to the anode where they react, with the help of a catalyst, with hydrogen fuel to produce water, as a byproduct, and electrons which produce the electric current.  In contrast to a PEM fuel cell, the medium through which the hydroxide ions travel consists of a positively charged polymer and an aqueous basic solution, making the environment alkaline.  The alkaline environment helps promote the electrochemical reactions occurring in the fuel cell, thus avoiding the need for the expensive platinum-based catalysts required in PEM fuel cells.  The potential benefits of AEM fuel cells, however, are hampered by the lack of membrane materials that show good chemical stability under alkaline conditions, robust mechanical properties, and high ion conductivity.           This project brought together expertise in polymer synthesis (Bae group), membrane characterization (Hickner group), and mathematical modeling and computer simulation (Tuckerman and Paddison groups) with the goal of breaking new ground in the design of hydroxide-conducting polymers that exhibit both high conductivity and sufficient chemical and mechanical stability for hundreds to thousands of hours of device operation and to derive a set of design principles for AEM materials.   These design principles inform on optimal choices of the chemical composition of the AEM materials, their target morphology, water content, and operating temperature.   The project has also initiated the creation of a database, that is available to the scientific and engineering communities, of AEM materials that have appeared previously in the scientific literature and that have been produced in the scope of the present project.  Using artificial intelligence (AI) methods and machine learning (ML), it will be possible for many researchers to ?mine? this database and obtain a model that connects AEM structure and composition to their performance in fuel cells and other key properties.      Consequently, by applying AI and ML techniques to the database, it will be possible to discover AEM designs for other applications beyond fuel cells, including electrolysis, water desalination, and advanced battery concepts.
