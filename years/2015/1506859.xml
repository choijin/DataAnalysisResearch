<AbstractNarration>The medicinal drugs that millions of people take every day contain bioactive molecules that are generally derived from natural products. The efficient construction of natural products and drug-like molecules necessitates high yielding and selective chemical reactions. Such reactions are enabled by the design and experimental development of new catalysts. This project will explore a family of catalysts developed in the host lab in systems that are familiar to the American collaborators. Under the guidance of Professor Xiaoming Feng at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, the EAPSI fellow will utilize the new catalysts to study new types of reactivity and to apply these new methods in the synthesis of important targets. This investigation is expected to facilitate new reaction development that may open the door to new natural products and new medicines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to apply novel organocatalyts and transition metal-catalysts in new dynamic reaction manifolds. The primary activity that this project involves is running new kinds of chemical reactions. Using chiral guanidine systems as organocatalysts and N,N?-dioxide complexes as transition metal catalysts, this project will explore addition reactions into a- and b-keto esters. The resulting a- and b-hydroxy esters have been shown to have useful biological activity that merits their synthesis. Model nucleophiles are likely to include azlactone and pyrazolones, which are proposed for the efficient construction of three contiguous stereocenters. Using these substrates to study the Dynamic Kinetic Resolution (DKR) phenomenon, new building blocks for biologically important molecules will be generated. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The last century of organic chemistry has placed an enormous emphasis on the control of stereochemistry in a molecule. Stereochemistry (Figure 1) refers to the three-dimensional configuration of a molecule, and occurs when a carbon atom is surrounded by four unique entities, which creates a stereocenter. A stereocenter can be inverted by a mirror plane; the mirror images that result are known as enantiomers. While there are only two possible configurations for a molecule with one stereocenter, the number of possible configurations rises exponentially as additional stereocenters are added to the molecule (Figure 2).  The most often cited goal of organic synthesis is to access biologically important molecules, whether they be drug candidates or natural products.  One of the central challenges in the synthesis of these molecules is not only the sheer number of stereocenters, but also the fact that so many are contiguous. Therefore, it stands to reason that reactions which directly set multiple, contiguous stereocenters are highly desirable transformations and deserve immediate attention. In order to develop such transformations, many labs have set to work developing chiral catalysts (catalysts which themselves contain stereocenters and are capable of transmitting their stereochemistry through a chemical reaction).  The stereochemical outcome of an addition reaction is determined by the ability of the catalyst to selectively deliver the nucleophile (source of partial negative charge) to one face of the electrophile (source of partial positive charge).

The nature of this project is to find a catalytic system that can solve these problems using chiral metal ligands from the host lab (Figure 4).  A variety of N,NÆ-dioxide ligands were screened in the hetero-ene reaction (Figure 5). In order to study the effect of the N,NÆ-dioxide backbone, proline-derived ligands, pipecolic acid-derived ligands, and ramipril-derived ligands were studied. Using 10 mol % Mg(OTf)2 with 10 mol % pipecolic acid-derived ligand, L-PiPr2, in CH2Cl2 (0.1M), with 50 mol % 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine at 40 &ordm;C, the reaction was found to produce a 64% isolated yield of product, with 3.3:1 diastereomeric ratio and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess (Figure 6). This was the best result to date, and represents an extraordinarily high enantiomeric excess (ee) and a humble diastereomeric ratio (dr).
