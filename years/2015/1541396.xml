<AbstractNarration>Investment in campus cyberinfrastructure (CI) is essential to answering many of the most fundamental questions in science and engineering. Syracuse University has created a campus CI engineer position to provide the technical expertise and leadership to realize the potential of existing investments in CI and to guide strategy for future investments for research and education. Science drivers for the campus CI engineer come from a diverse range of projects including, gravitational-wave astronomy, biological physics, theoretical condensed matter physics, computational fluid dynamics, high-energy physics, Earth sciences, soft matter physics, and biomedical and chemical engineering. By allowing Syracuse researchers to better use CI, including research computing clouds, identity management services, networking, high-throughput computing, and high-performance computing, both on and off campus, the CI engineer allows Syracuse University researchers to advance scientific discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Syracuse University's campus cyberinfrastructure serves as an important resource for education of undergraduate and graduate students. An essential part of the CI engineer's responsibilities is lowering the barriers to access to CI resources for beginning researchers. The CI engineer's activities extend beyond engagement with the Syracuse campus, leading Syracuse University's engagement with the national cyberinfrastructure community, and collaborating broadly across campuses on shared goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In early 2015, Syracuse University formed a Research Computing Advisory Council (RCAC), an advisory committee comprised of research faculty, associate deans of research, and information technology professionals. The RCAC was formed as a means to ensure the alignment of research community computational needs and available (or required) resources, and to develop strategies for resource deployment over the long-term.  In its earliest meetings, the RCAC quickly determined that one of the most critical needs on campus was a resource that could connect researchers to appropriate computational resources, efficiently and effectively.  Through the support of the National Science Foundation and this award, Syracuse University was able to recruit and hire its first cyberinfrastructure engineer (CIE) to help fill this critical gap. Over the course of the two-year award and beyond (the CIE position is now fully funded by the University), the CIE has assisted dozens of faculty researchers and students in their pursuit of transforming their research through the use of campus-based and publically available computational resources. This work has led to dozens of published articles and conference papers, and that number continues to grow.   Perhaps one of the most important outcomes from this award has been the University's realization that a single CIE is not enough to support and sustain our growing research community. To that end, we are now preparing to recruit and hire a second CIE to further support not only STEM researchers, but the humanities and social sciences, as well.  Syracuse University thanks the National Science Foundation for its committed effort to grow this vital national resource across many campuses.
