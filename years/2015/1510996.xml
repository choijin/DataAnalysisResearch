<AbstractNarration>#1510996&lt;br/&gt;Law, Chung K. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Princeton Summer School is to provide the next generation of combustion researchers and graduate students with a comprehensive knowledge in the technical areas of combustion theory, chemistry, experiment, computation and applications. For the past five years, each summer school session has offered several daily morning and afternoon three-hour lectures taught at an accelerated pace over five days. The program typically consists of the foundational courses of combustion chemistry and combustion theory, as well as enrichment courses such as engine combustion and laser diagnostics. The feedback from past participants has been uniformly enthusiastic for the learning and networking experience. The proposed support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers is to offset part of the cost for travel and lodging (on Princeton's campus) at the 2015 Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion.  The "camp" environment provides ample opportunities for students to interact intimately with established researchers as well as among themselves.  Such a learning opportunity is usually not offerred on a campus and should help to develop the next-generation leader in combustion research and applications fields for the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Objective  The Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion has been a part of the outreach program of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center (CEFRC), which was one of the 46 Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) established by DOE in 2009. The goal of the Center is to develop a validated, predictive, multi-scale, combustion modeling capability to optimize the design and operation of evolving fuels, especially biofuels, in advanced engines for transportation applications.  The Summer School program was conceived by recognizing that while combustion is an interdisciplinary subject, due to limitations at individual institutions the training received by most combustion researchers has not been sufficiently comprehensive to equip them to make breakthrough discoveries. The Summer School therefore aims to offer advanced graduate level courses to remedy this deficiency.  Approach  The 2015 session was held from June 21 through June 26.  Participants comprised of senior graduate students and professionals from academia, industries and government labs.  World-renowned researchers were commissioned to deliver the lectures.  Four 15-hour lectures were offered over 5 days, with 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the afternoon. The four courses and their respective lecturers were:  Dynamics of Combustion Waves: From Flames to Detonations: Paul Clavin from Aix-Marseille Universit&eacute;  Combustion Chemistry: Hai Wang from Stanford University  Quantitative Laser Diagnostics for Combustion Chemistry and Propulsion: Ronald K. Hanson of Stanford University  Computational Turbulent Combustion: Thierry Poinsot of the Institut de M&eacute;canique des Fluides de Toulouse, CNRS   Detailed lecture notes were prepared and distributed to the participants beforehand.  Participants lived in comfortable dormitory setting, and had meals together in the student cafeteria, hence facilitating networking.  Room and board for all US students were covered by the Center.      Relevance to NSF  Many participants were involved in research projects supported by NSF. The enrichment of their knowledge in combustion will benefit the progress of these research projects. Furthermore, it is anticipated that many of the graduate students will become active researchers in combustion and propulsion in the future, some assuming leadership positions. This Summer School experience will undoubtedly prove useful as they carry out their responsibilities.  Accomplishments for Reporting Period  176 participants of the 2015 session came from 11 countries, 28 US states representing 60 universities, two U.S. government labs, and three U.S. corporations. 146 of the participants were graduate students and 30 were professionals. Participants were highly satisfied with the experience, with many laudatory feedback comments. All lectures were professional taped and are freely available to the general public through the Princeton University web-site and YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG0Jl8zn3t4L8CnPp6DrCVw.   Detailed lecture notes are freely available to the general public through Princeton UniversityÆs web-site at http://www.princeton.edu/cefrc/combustion-summer-school/archived-programs/2013-session/lecture-notes/#comp000051b309e00000019c56149d.
