<AbstractNarration>The majority of waste streams, including industrial timber by products and municipal solid waste, are generally environmentally and economically burdensome; yet they have the potential to serve as starting materials from which fuels, medicines and other consumer products can be made.  However, a number of chemical reactions are required to transform these waste materials into something useful.  Among the most challenging chemical changes needed are reactions that remove excess oxygen atoms from the waste material.  Our team designs catalysts, materials that aid in a reaction by improving speed, selectivity and/or energy requirements, but do not themselves become consumed in the reaction.  We are actively developing, characterizing and testing catalysts that use hydrogen gas to remove excess oxygen from oils made from these waste streams.  Our team combines expertise in making catalysts and controlling their structure at the molecular level, identifying the type of reaction products that result, optimizing the reactor process for greater efficiency, and theoretical modeling to understanding the behavior of solid catalysts and the reactions they control. Together, we are able to design and study a wide range of catalysts selected to test specific ideas about how optimal catalysts for this reaction work and also to lead us towards the design of better and more environmentally friendly catalysts that use earth-abundant metals. Broader impacts of the research include environmental benefits of eliminating waste and economic benefits of producing a chemical fuel and feedstock source from waste products. All members of our team are committed to diversifying the scientific workforce and are engaged in activities to recruit and retain in our laboratories members of groups historically underrepresented in scientific fields.  We engage in active curriculum reform, and cases drawn from current scientific efforts to improve the sustainability of energy production form the foundation of the newly redesigned General Chemistry course at Barnard College, an all-women's college in New York City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research program, Drs. Austin, Frederick, Grabow, and Schwartz are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program at NSF to test the hypothesis that catalytic materials suitable for highly selective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions that cleave C-O bonds require: (1) a metal that can adsorb and split H2; and (2) an amphoteric support that can serve as a proton shuttle from the metal to the substrate to weaken the C-O bond.  If confirmed, the results from this work could alter the current paradigm invoking support reducibility rather than its amphoteric character.  A series of supported metal catalysts is being synthesized and characterized using a variety of experimental and computational methods.  These catalysts are used to catalyze HDO reactions of phenol-derived model compounds, including some isotopically-labeled substrates, with hydrogen gas.  The products of the HDO reactions are analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) measurments. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to calculate reaction energy profiles, which are then compared to experimental data to propose detailed catalytic reaction mechanisms.  Broader impacts of the research include environmental benefits of eliminating waste and economic benefits of producing a chemical fuel and feedstock source from waste products. Student exchange between four very different labs: a computational lab at the University of Houston, a chemical engineering lab and a physical chemistry lab both at the University of Maine, and an inorganic catalysis lab at an all women's liberal arts college in New York City, will facilitate the broad development of students working on this project.  Significant curriculum development, using cases from this work and from other research on sustainable energy development, forms the basis of a problem-based general chemistry course that serves approximately 150 female Barnard College students each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biofuel development has been hindered by the high cost of catalysts that are required to remove excess oxygen.  A selective catalyst that uses hydrogen efficiently and utilizes earth abundant metals would make a significant contribution to society?s need to develop more sustainable energy sources.  Manipulating chemical bonds continues to be a primary activity of all chemists, and contributing to our understanding of how to break C-O bonds and form C-H bonds (the opposite of the selective C-H activation reactions that have obsessed chemists for decades) will have a broad impact on chemistry.      We have characterized a highly efficient catalyst for biofuels upgrading and determined some of the key parameters that impact its effectiveness. We have explored the role that water plays in the overall reaction and found it to be complex, and dependent on the precise nature of the catalyst.  We have developed new tools for studying crystalline nanomaterials.  The primary intellectual contributions we have made are (1) experimentally identifying the complex role that water plays in this important family of catalysts and combining that experiment work with theory to develop a microkinetic model for the reaction, (2) combining theory and experiment to assign vibrational stretching frequencies to surface hydroxyls in titania (3) to use atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis to characterize the non-spherical shape of the pyrogenic titania P25 and P90.     The primary broader impact we have has in in training a number of undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral research associates in the course of this project, a majority of whom have been women and/or members of groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.
