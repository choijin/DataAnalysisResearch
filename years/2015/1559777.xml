<AbstractNarration>World-wide, serious inorganic contaminants in drinking water are a growing concern, particularly those resulting from industrial operations, such as mine-impacted rivers and streams, because these may themselves be sources of drinking water. However, current methods for the removal of pollutants such as arsenic, fluoride, strontium, uranium, iron, manganese, hardness and other heavy metals from industrial effluents are both difficult and expensive. Furthermore, these systems are often not used because they involve high capital, operational, and maintenance costs that require toxic chemicals, and produce solid residuals that need specialized handling and disposal. This I-Corps project will explore the commercial feasibility of a sustainable, simple, low-cost technology for water treatment. It is based on the use of zeolite, a natural mineral that is abundant and low cost. Removal by adsorption onto natural zeolites is the most economically feasible technology alternative for treating contaminated water. It is also anticipated that the zeolites and contaminants can be separated after treatment allowing the re-use of the zeolites and marketing of the contaminants for other industrial uses. The proposed technology can be used in a number of settings and for a number of potential end-users, regardless of where treatment is needed. It can be implemented at a central location in large volumes and then distributed through pipelines or bottled. It can be used by individuals in small volumes at a point of use or point of entry. It can be used by industries that require treatment of controlled or uncontrolled discharges of wastes. It can be used by industries that provide water treatment solutions for rivers, streams, or ground water. Everyone is interested in affordable alternatives to providing water suitable for human use or consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to develop an innovative technology with significant commercial potential for removing heavy metals and other inorganic contaminants from water. To achieve this goal, during the life of the project, the I-Corps team will 1) scope and assess the potential for commercialization of the proposed technology; 2) articulate the value propositions; 3) compare the costs of existing systems versus the proposed technology; and 4) determine methods to incorporate and test proposed materials into new or existing manufactured filters/systems. The UTEP team will determine the commercialization potential by conducting 100 interviews and developing a business model canvas that includes building blocks such as key partnerships, channels, key activities, revenue streams, and cost structures. The team will test the proposed technology into selected manufactured filters/systems and test and determine the potential for regeneration of zeolite versus disposal. The project has the potential for both technical and non-technical contributions. The proposed technology will provide individual consumers, public utilities, and industry alike, with a simple and cost-effective way to treat water contaminated with inorganic materials. Studies have the potential to develop a cost-effective arsenic "litmus" test. Additionally, the protocol derived from this project will be reproducible at a minimal cost in developing countries by using regionally available materials, and can be set up with a social entrepreneurial business model. Finally, the project will provide a foundation to develop an integrated curriculum in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E) in a minority Hispanic Serving Institution, such as UTEP, to increase the number of female and Hispanic innovators as well as underrepresented minorities in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
