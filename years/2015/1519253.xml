<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number:  1519253&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Massachusetts Lowell&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  David Willis&lt;br/&gt;Title:  2015 Wind Energy Research Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wind energy is a natural resource for the clean and sustainable production of electricity. The 2015 Wind Energy Research Workshop, hosted by the University of Massachusetts at Lowell (UNL), will be held on the UNL campus in mid-October of 2015.  Approximately 175 workshop participants, consisting of faculty and students, researchers from national laboratories, representatives from industry, and government officials from state and federal agencies, will create a diverse audience with the collective wealth of knowledge to identify relevant research opportunities need to drive the continued commercial development of wind energy in the United States. The two-day workshop will include keynote lectures, invited presentations, posters, exhibits, field trips, and panels.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2015 Wind Energy Research Workshop presenters, discussion leaders, and participants will engage in four activities: 1) Identify research gaps that currently exist in the wind industry, 2) determine future research directions that will provide immediate and long-term benefits to the Nation?s ability to harness wind energy, 3) exchange information via several panel sessions with distinguished and knowledgeable speakers, and 4) educate the wind-energy community about the relevant issues that need to be addressed to reduce the cost of wind energy.  Breakout sessions will include the following topics: wind turbine manufacturing, structural health monitoring &amp; diagnostics, composite materials, wind resource characterization &amp; sensing, computational modeling, and energy storage, smart grid &amp; transmission. The workshop will disseminate material and knowledge by publishing a report containing all publicly released presentations, and will highlight the outcomes in each focus area. A website will be created to post the presentation slides along with videos taken of the panel sessions.</AbstractNarration>
