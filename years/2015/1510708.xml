<AbstractNarration>This EAGER award funds a collaborative study to study the turbulence of gas and dust in the material that will form planets around stars.   The mechanism to be studied could be important in forming the small rocky bodies that are the cores of future planets, and whose process of formation is poorly understood.  This study has potential impact in understanding the formation of our own Solar System and of the planets around other stars. The research will create a team consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars. The collaborative nature of our research will synergistically provide opportunities for students at San Francisco State University, a minority-serving non-PHD institution, to work with students and faculty at University of California at Berkeley. The investigators will also train and mentor a postdoctoral researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish their science goals, the team will compute angular momentum transport in a protoplanetary disk (PPD) dead zone filled with large-amplitude turbulence, compute the rate at which dust and rocks accumulate and agglomerate in a turbulent PPD, and compute mixing in a PPD. In particular, they will determine if the ingredients from which chondrules form become sufficiently mixed that their composition agrees with observations.  They will also develop the capability to carry out the above-listed calculation of momentum transport efficiently by extending their current spectral code, which works with anelastic flows, to one that works with fully-compressible flows with Mach numbers less than 3 (as in dead zones). The team will develop the capability to carry out the above-listed calculations of planetesimal and chondrule formation efficiently by replacing their "particle-tracking" code with one that models the rocks and dust as different phases of the fluid flow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is a remarkable fact that planets start out as microscopic dust grains, growing by a factor of 1040 in mass in a period less than 10 million years. There is no one physical process that can explain growth over this enormous range of sizes: the very smallest grains (sub-millimeter) can grow via collisional agglomeration in which the sticking mechanism is electrostatic in nature; whereas, on the other end of the size spectrum, objects in the kilometer to tens of kilometers regime can grow via gravity-enhanced collisions. The least understood stage, by far, is how mm-size particles grow to kilometer-size; grains in this regime are too large for sticking via electrostatic forces, yet far too small to have any significant self-gravity. Even more problematic is the fact that particles in this intermediate-size regime are strongly affected by aerodynamic drag of the surrounding gas: meter-size objects, for example, have radial drift speeds on the order of &sim;100 m/s  and thus spiral inward onto the protostar on the timescale of a few hundred years. Whatever process is responsible for grain growth through this range of sizes must act on timescales faster than this inspiral time if any raw materials are to be available to build protoplanets.   Though the broad contours of planet formation are generally understood, significant gaps persist despite vigorous theoretical &amp; computational research. The planet-forming regions within protoplanetary disks (thin disks of gas and dust in orbit around newly formed protostars) coincide with the cool, magnetically-inactive "dead" zones, which are believe to be stable to magnetorotational instabilities and are therefore void of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.  Without a mechanism to destabilize the flow, waves, vortices, and turbulence cannot develop, which are needed in order to (1) transport angular momentum radially outward and mass radially inward onto the growing protostar, and (2) accumulate dust so that planetesimals can form.  With support from the NSF, we have demonstrated the existence of a new, purely hydrodynamic instability that fills the dead zones of protoplanetary disks with turbulence and robust vortices. We named the instability the "Zombie Vortex Instability" (ZVI) not only because it occurs in the dead zones, but also because of the way one zombie vortex "infects" its neighboring critical layers, spawning new zombie vortices, which "infect" their neighboring critical layers, and so on, ad infinitum. In numerical simulations, one can see the entire domain rapidly fill with zombie vortices from one initial vortex; ZVI can also be triggered by low amplitude noise with a Kolmogorov spectrum. The instability is not an artifact of the numerical method as we have observed it with spectral codes and finite-volume codes (e.g., Athena), with Boussinesq, anelastic, and fully compressible treatments of the continuity condition, with and without the shearing box, and with hyper-viscosity and real molecular viscosity.

Prior work often lacked one or more of the crucial ingredients: ZVI requires vertical stratification, high resolution to resolve the narrow critical layers, a broad spectrum of perturbations (i.e., Kolmogorov, but not Gaussian-peaked), and enough simulation time to allow the critical layers to amplify perturbations.  Future work will focus on how zombie vortices can trap dust grains and help seed the formation of planetesimals, the basic building-blocks of planets.
