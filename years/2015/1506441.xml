<AbstractNarration>This research studies how electrons of an atom or molecule react to intense laser fields and to each other.  Strong laser fields are used to study electron dynamics at the attosecond (10^-18 s) timescale for applications such as solar energy conversion and photosynthesis. Previous studies have assumed that only one electron is active in these systems. However, experiments have now shown that the interaction of many electrons, both with each other and with the field must be included. This project will attempt to include these effects.  In addition, this project will provide two undergraduate students and one graduate student a broad array of theoretical and computational training. As part of the project, computations that yield useful information on attosecond chemistry will be incorporated into the curriculum for the undergraduate advanced physical chemistry class.  Collaborations with experimentalists and quantum chemists involved in the project will contribute to building the connection between conventional spectroscopy and the emerging attosecond chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this investigation will be the suppressed ionization of transition metal atoms vanadium, nickel, niobium, palladium, and tantalum in intense laser fields, and spectral features of high harmonic generation (HHG) for argon, nitrogen, and the molecule NO. The features include Cooper minima and HHG enhanced by resonances.  There will be extensive benchmarking that consists of comparisons with published results and among different conditions, which will provide insight into the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) approach and methods to improve it as well.  The proposed study will render the most probable ion state, the form of the out-going electron wave function, and the time-dependent exchange and correlation potentials. This knowledge will lead to new understanding and improved modeling of strong field many-electron dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

The subject of attosecond chemistry needs theoretical developments that connect strong field phenomena to many-electron dynamics that usually accompanies a chemical process.

As shown in the figure, only the zero and first order components are significant. The zeroth order component is isotropic and attractive, which keeps the electron closer to the core and the zeroth order component increases the tunneling barrier. Both factors reduce the tunneling ionization of neutral transition metal atoms, i.e., the tunneling probability is lower than the prediction of an SAE model. We also find that when the highest electron is subject to a greater exchange interaction, which is the case for a high spin state, the induced potential is more attractive near the core and repulsive at the peak of the barrier. As such the energy of the high spin state is lowered more in the field and the ionization barrier is raised higher, which leads to "exchange blockade".

Our time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations agree well with the experimental measurements for vanadium and nickel.

They also reproduce the trend that, as the charge increases, the ionization yield of the cation becomes less suppressed and more enhanced relative to the SAE prediction. <br /><br />In addition to the induced potential from the time-dependent calculations, the orbital energies from our static DFT calculations also correlate with the impact of many-electron effects on the tunneling ionization. The highest electron of a neutral transition metal atom occupies an s-orbital. Observing Koopmans' theorem, the calculated orbital energy agrees well with the ionization potential (Ip).
