<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the science of behavioral models of politics through a workshop, training, and research. Theoretical models of political processes are essential tools that help structure our understanding of power, conflict, democracy, and institutions. Models challenge intuitions, clarify the logic of explanations, and guide empirical inquiry regarding diverse topics spanning the traditional subfields of political science: elections, collective action, war and conflict, trade, and identity formation, to name a few. Current approaches to theoretical modeling in political science are dominated by rational choice and game theory, having borrowed heavily from a rigorous mathematical tradition in economics. Advances in psychology and economics, however, show the limits of the standard approach's model of rational human decision-making. By incorporating behavioral insights into theoretical models, the field of behavioral models of politics broadens the theoretical methodologies available to political scientists. The workshop advances this new field by bringing together an interdisciplinary group of scholars with a shared interest in understanding bounded rationality and its implications for political behavior, training junior scholars, promoting vigorous scientific dialogue, identifying new research priorities, and stimulating new research collaborations and synergies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the science of behavioral models of politics through a workshop, training, and research. Theoretical models of political processes are essential tools that help structure the understanding of power, conflict, democracy, and institutions. The workshop advances this new field by bringing together an interdisciplinary group of scholars with a shared interest in understanding bounded rationality and its implications for political behavior, training junior scholars, promoting vigorous scientific dialogue, identifying new research priorities, and stimulating new research collaborations and synergies. The workshop facilitates the promotion of communication and the exchange of ideas across field and disciplinary boundaries. It will result in productive collaboration between and coordination among scientists. Workshop presentations will be structured and organized as part of a series of "modeling dialogues" that pair theoretical and experimental research that addresses the same substantive topics. Additionally, the workshop will include a training workshop and mentoring activities. Participants to the workshop are obtained through a general call. In addition, PIs use established networks to draw in members of underrepresented groups in modeling politics.</AbstractNarration>

This most recent conference was held at the University of Pittsburgh from May 12-14, 2016, and incorporated many innovations suggested by attendees of our previous two conferences.

This field prioritizes the development and empirical testing of theories of politics that take into account the full range of human behavior, not just the standard rational choice, game-theoretic paradigm. It accomplishes this by bringing together scholars who value analytical modeling and are also open to sharing ideas that broaden scholars&rsquo; theoretical toolkits beyond strict rational choice. An important goal of the workshop is to encourage a <em>modeling dialogue</em> &ndash; interactions between experimentalists, theorists, and more traditionally oriented empirical scholars &ndash; to develop, refine, and test tractable models of politics. Subsidiary goals are to: coordinate and enhance communication between scientists; build a community of scientists from diverse disciplinary and methodological backgrounds; identify research priorities and develop new collaborations; foster consensus about the most promising methodologies; and train specialists, graduate students, and junior faculty in tools to engage in cross-specialty discussion and collaboration (so that theorists are more familiar with experimental methods and experimentalists are more familiar with modeling technologies).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that our workshop was quite successful in achieving these goals. NSF funding this year enabled the addition of a half-day graduate training and mentoring session to the workshop. We were able to offset the cost of travel and accommodations for 27 individuals, consisting of graduate students and postdocs. This allowed a total of 36 students and postdocs, from a broad range of schools and from year 1 to year 5+ in graduate school, to take part in the training day&rsquo;s activities. These activities included presentations on behavioral and stochastic modeling and incentivized experiments from co-PIs Dr. Siegel and Dr. Woon, as well as a mentoring dinner that included an additional seven senior scholars to advise graduate student attendees on how to successfully employ these methods.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This session was extremely important in satisfying the workshop&rsquo;s goals. Most universities lack institutionalized training in behavioral methods, and what training they do have typically is spread unclearly across academic disciplines. By not only providing such training but also aiding in the professionalization of graduate students who might use it, we help ensure that our workshop will have a broad impact. We enhanced this impact and added to the intellectual merit of our workshop with the subsequent two days of high-quality presentations of behavioral research from a number of top scholars that spanned methodological focus, subfield, and even discipline.
