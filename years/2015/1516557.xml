<AbstractNarration>Primates are a diverse group of mammals in terms of their anatomy, and it is not well understood how the various anatomical parts (modules) of the primate body evolved into very different forms that still function properly. This question extends to modern humans, whose anatomy has changed dramatically from our ape ancestors, allowing complex functions to include breathing, speaking, chewing, swallowing, walking, running, and using tools. New studies, methods and techniques are thus needed to identify and compare patterns of organization, integration, modularity, evolvability and complexity of the muscles and skeleton of the head and limbs, to have a more comprehensive and integrative view of the evolutionary history of the human body. This pilot project will investigate these anatomical relationships and patterns through sophisticated anatomical network analyses of existing data from a wide range of primate species. Broader impacts of this project include student support and training in the life sciences at universities that serve underrepresented minorities, K-12 and public science outreach efforts, and open-access websites, databases, and repositories for data that will be of interest across a range of disciplines.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of researchers have focused on how the various structures of the primate body evolved into very different forms that still function properly, but there are differing views about how to answer this fundamental question for human evolution. Concepts like anatomical "modules" and "integration" are mentioned, but there is a lack of agreement about what these terms mean in the human body. This project uses anatomical network analysis to identify and compare patterns of organization, integration, modularity, evolvability and complexity of muscles and skeleton of the head and limbs. A unique strength of this network approach is that it enables direct comparisons among different tissues (e.g. bones, muscles) and body parts with vastly different architectures (e.g. heads, limbs). This project will combine large and complex amounts of data collected from numerous primate taxa and different structures and tissues to detect muscle, skeletal and musculoskeletal head and limb modules and morphological patterns that cannot be detected by using other methods, and compare these modules and patterns to infer evolutionary trends in primate and human body morphology in a more comprehensive way. Specific hypotheses about the relative modularity and complexity of the head versus limbs, and about increased and unique network complexity in the human head, will be addressed.</AbstractNarration>
