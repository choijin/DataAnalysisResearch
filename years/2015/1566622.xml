<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Dean M. Roddick of the University of Wyoming is developing new hydrogen transfer catalysts for the conversion of plentiful, but less useful hydrocarbon feedstocks to more useful olefin products. An extension of this research to the synthesis of highly valuable hydrofluorocarbons is pursued. Polymers with high fluorine content possess high thermal and chemical inertness. They are used in high-tech applications such as fuel cell membranes, synthetic lubricants, and microelectronics. In this project, catalysts for the production of these materials are being designed and optimized for several important processes.  Dr. Roddick and coworkers introduce community college students to chemical research on the campus of Wyoming's only 4-year university through annual Structural Chemistry workshops.  Extensive participation and leadership in the new state-mandated Science Initiative brings tangible benefits to scientific research and education across the state of Wyoming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diphosphine platinum systems are generally more active than well-established diimine catalysts.  This work extends the use of platinum catalysis to palladium and nickel systems containing perfluorinated phosphine ligands. These species are being developed as as fluoroalkene oligomerization catalysts. DFT calculations on model palladium compounds predict energetically accessible fluoroethylene insertion barriers for M-R and M-Rf bonds.  The calculations also support a general fluoroalkene oligomerization mechanism.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-supported research is an extension of our longstanding program of catalyst development using fluorine-modified systems. In light of our earlier NSF-supported research, which demonstrated the unusual air and moisture stability of metal catalysts employing fluorine-modified components, we have extended this general idea in several directions which are briefly described below:  1)  Methane Superacid Chemistry- We have shown that platinum(II) ions can be stabilized under the strongest known superacidic conditions; this has allowed us to investigate in detail platinum-methane interactions, which are involved in highly important petrochemical transformations such as the catalytic reforming of petroleum feedstocks. Using well-characterized fluorinated platinum compounds developed in our laboratory we have clearly demonstrated the exchange of hydrogen between methane and methyl-bound platinum and measured the relative rates of these fundamental processes.   2)  Ethylene dimerization Catalysis- We have extended our study of the first reported platinum-based ethylene dimerization catalyst to include a wide variety of modified platinum molecular systems. Through both experimental kinetics measurements and calculations, we have shown that fluorinated platinum(II) catalysts employing phosphine groups are orders of magnitude more active than conventional nitrogen-based systems.  3)  Optimization of Iridium Pincer Catalysts- "Pincer-based" iridium catalysts are of considerable interest in the productive conversion of hydrocarbons to industrially useful olefin products. We previously reported fluorine-modified catalysts which are stable in the presence of air and moisture and have extended this work. New modified catalysts have been reported which exhibit improved activity.  Three Ph.D. students were supported by this grant- two have defended their Ph.D., and the third student plans to defend in late 2020.
