<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the impact of negative campaign ads featuring Latinos on voters' political opinions and vote choice. Recent decades have witnessed an increase in television campaign ads that depict Latinos as "illegal aliens" and employ gritty, menacing images of Latinos. This trend of targeting Latinos is seemingly replacing an earlier period of negative campaign advertising that focused on mobilizing voters by tapping into their fears of African Americans. While much literature that explains the conditions under which these ads are effective, the theories are nearly exclusively built upon campaign ads that target African Americans. As the Latino community continues to grow in the United States it is increasingly important to explore whether these existing theoretical models hold true for negative campaign ads that target Latinos. This research examines the effects of negative campaign ads and racial priming on vote choice using a survey experiment that is conducted using the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Elections Survey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project employs a survey experiment to study the impact that racial appeals targeting Latinos have on voters' political opinions and vote choice. It aims to test the theory of racial priming by assessing whether this theory similarly predicts opinion and vote choice when the target of these political ads are Latinos rather than African Americans. The survey experiment will utilize a dual-wave panel administered through 2016 Cooperative Congressional Elections Survey (CCES) with a nationally representative sample. This dual-wave feature helps overcome contamination effects that may result from asking questions about race before the experimental manipulations. In the survey experiment respondents will be exposed to three campaign mailers for a fictitious congressional candidate. Exposure to one of the randomly assigned treatments is then followed up by a survey battery that asks respondents about their vote choice, candidate favorability, and support for restrictive social policies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>My dissertation, <em>Negative Campaigns, Priming Effects and Vote Choice</em>, examines the impact of negative Latino campaign appeals on white voter mobilization. More specifically, I discern whether the dominant model of racial priming, the Implicit-Explicit (IE) model (Mendelberg 2001) has utility beyond African American campaign appeals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The IE model of racial priming simply states that since the Civil Rights Movement and the ensuing norm of racial equality that developed in its wake, political candidates could no longer curry votes from white voters by using overtly racist, &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; appeals. When confronted with such explicit appeals, white voters understand the racial content, see it as a violation of the norm of racial equality, and try to distance themselves from that candidate by withdrawing their support. However, candidates who use implicit racial appeals are still able to successfully mobilize white voters in their favor. The &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; appeal conceals the racial content (or at least create a degree of ambiguity around the racial content) using visual images of the racial group paired with stereotypical code words such as crime, criminal, and welfare queens (for African Americans, for example). The message works subconsciously and allows the message recipients to circumvent conforming to the norm of racial equality.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I develop a theory of Persistent Foreigner Positionality (PFP) to explain why we should be skeptical of the IE models applicability to Latino appeals. PFP assets that although &ldquo;Latino&rdquo; is an ethnic identifier, Latinos in the United States are racialized in a manner that is distinct from African Americans and in such a way that positions them as a group outside of the American body politic&mdash;outside of the &ldquo;American&rdquo; identity&mdash;regardless of an individual&rsquo;s country of origin or citizenship status. Additionally, given the historical and racial specificity of the Civil Rights Movement which is an African American movement, there is no reason to assume that the norms of racial egalitarianism extend to non-Black minorities. Taken together, these two prongs of my theory of PFP suggest that Latinos&rsquo; racial positionality leaves them vulnerable to rhetorical attacks by political elites.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I test this theory with I survey experiment that I fielded in the fall of 2016 with a nationally representative sample of white adults on the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) hosted by YouGov. I designed the survey experiment to comparatively assess implicit and explicit appeals for Black and Latino targets and their impact of white vote choice and candidate favorability.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I find that the IE model performs as expected for Black appeals&mdash;implicit relative to explicit appeals more effectively mobilize white vote choice and candidate favorability ratings and explicit appeals are rejected, causing the sponsoring candidate to lose favorability among white voters. However, contrary to the IE model, I find that candidates gain favorability with white voters when they are presented with <em>either</em> an implicit <em>or</em> explicit Latino appeal. In fact, white voters respond nearly equally positively to both implicit and explicit Latino appeals, suggesting that white respondents do not detect a distinction between the rhetorical-visual components of the campaign ads and are not offended by the racial content of either format (see Figure 1, attached image).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These findings make several significant contributions to the field of political science and to the broader state of public knowledge. First, the unique and contrary impact that Latino campaign appeals have on white voter opinion demonstrate a need to take seriously the differential ways that racial groups are socially constructed in the U.S. context. As a result, we may not substitute one racial group for another when applying a theoretical lens or model to a particular racial group. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions must be met before translating a group-specific model to another racial or ethnic group.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, my findings move the IE model of racial priming out of the Black-white paradigm in which it was conceived nearly two decades ago and places it within a contemporary, multi-cultural context. This is especially important given the demographic shifts that are occurring in this country. By situating the IE model in a contemporary political landscape we can better understand the changing nature of the racial appeals and identify them in campaign messages.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, by developing the ability to identify racial appeals that target non-Black minorities we begin to undermine their power to subconsciously move the opinions and behaviors of message recipients in an inegalitarian or intolerant direction. Remember that the success of a racial appeal is contingent upon it working subconsciously, or in an undetected manner, so that it evades triggering conformity with the norm of racial equality.
