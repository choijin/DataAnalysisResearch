<AbstractNarration>The early Universe was almost completely made up of hydrogen and helium.  Stars build up the heavier chemical elements needed for planets and eventually for life through a series of processes known as "nucleosynthesis".  The earliest stars were likely quite different than stars today.  These old stars, called "metal-poor" stars because of their low abundance of heavier elements, were formed from the remnants of the earliest stars. Elemental abundances in metal-poor stars serve as a "fossil record" of our Galaxy and can help us understand the beginnings of nucleosynthesis. Testing theories of the early Universe requires very accurate measurements of elemental abundances in metal-poor stars.  An accurate and precise abundance determination for a given element requires, first and foremost, accurate measurements in our laboratories of the atomic transition properties for that element.  The goal of this project is to improve the available atomic data for elements and to use these data to determine highly accurate abundances in metal-poor stars.  This work could also lead to improvements that benefit other fields of applied science, such as lighting and analytical chemistry. Training and mentoring of graduate students and of undergraduates has been, and will continue to be, an important part of this program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Wisconsin (UW) program uses techniques involving lasers, powerful spectrometers, synchrotron radiation, and other modern approaches to measure critically needed atomic data. In recent years, a 3-meter echelle spectrometer was developed at UW to measure very weak lines of Fe-group species in the ultraviolet.  Unlike Fourier transform spectrometers, which are often used for such measurements, the 3m echelle spectrometer is free from an important (multiplex) noise source.  These weak lines are needed for abundance studies in stellar photospheres, because stronger lines of the abundant Fe-group elements are partially to deeply saturated and are therefore not good abundance indicators.  The proposed research will extend the range of the 3m echelle spectrometer into the optical for applications in ground-based astronomy.  The first phase of the project will involve developing and implementing a radiometric calibration for the instrument out to the Si detector limit near 10000 Angstroms.  The instrument will then be used for the measurement of weak optical lines of astrophysical interest in the spectra of ions of Fe, Co, and Ni.  These new transition probabilities will be applied to determine accurate and precise abundances in the Sun and in metal-poor stars.</AbstractNarration>

There is significant evidence that nucleosynthesis was different in earlier epochs than it is today.  The first generation of stars had zero metallicity, were likely very massive and may have had other unusual properties including very rapid rotation.

The methodology employed in our research is to study the abundances of the Fe-group elements in metal-poor stars. Their study provides a means of probing these early nucleosynthesis events.  Our laboratory astrophysics effort is closely coordinated with our astrophysics collaborators who are experts in the study of metal-poor stars.  Better laboratory data for Fe-group atoms and ions are essential to produce accurate stellar abundances. The focus in our current laboratory astrophysics effort is on atomic transition probabilities for weak optical lines of Fe-group ions.  These transitions, which are accessible from ground-based astronomy, are reliable elemental abundance probes.   Transition probabilities are determined from branching fractions measured using emission spectroscopy, which are then put on an absolute scale with radiative lifetimes measured using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).  The development and application of an atom/ion beam source applicable to all or most elements has yielded radiative lifetimes from our LIF experiment for many neutral and singly-ionized species with uncertainties in the 5% range. The LIF experiment is illustrated in Figure 1.  Emission branching fractions are determined from high resolution Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs) and our large, 3-meter echelle grating spectrometer.  FTSs have been the standard for many years for measuring branching fractions due to their wide spectral coverage, high-resolution and absolute wavenumber accuracy.  However they have one shortcoming - as an interferometric device the statistical noise from all lines of the spectrum gets spread evenly throughout the spectrum.  This means that weak lines disappear into the noise and cannot be reliably measured.  Our large 3-meter echelle spectrograph was developed as an answer to this problem.  While it does not have quite the resolution or wavelength accuracy of an FTS, it is much more sensitive and can be used to measure very weak branches.  Figure 2 illustrates the wide range of branching fractions that can be measured from one echelle spectrograph spectrum.  With a combination of all of these tools we have substantially improved the transition probabilities for neutral and singly-ionized Fe-group elements Scandium through Nickel over the last decade.  In addition, we have continued to improve our methodology, particularly in the difficult area of relative radiometric calibration of emission spectra.  We have also included data on hyperfine and isotopic line structure where needed for the interpretation of stellar spectra.  Our astrophysical goals include an understanding of the limits of One Dimensional (1D) Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) models of stellar photospheres. The study of Fe-group abundances in metal-poor stars is critically dependent on a better understanding of the limits of standard 1D/LTE photospheric models. Figure 3 illustrates an example showing clear evidence that the ground state of neutral Mn is seriously out of equilibrium with the remaining neutral levels and the levels of Mn+ in metal-poor stars.  In such a case, using transitions that connect to the ground state of the neutral seriously underestimates the Mn abundance in the stellar photosphere. We have had similar findings in chromium.  Our work has emphasized weak lines connected to the ground and low metastable levels of Fe-group ions, because these lines sample the primary reservoir levels for Fe-group material in a photosphere and therefore cannot be seriously out of equilibrium.
