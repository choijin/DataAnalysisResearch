<AbstractNarration>Conference Grant: Student Travel Awards for IEEE RFID-TA 2015, Tokyo, 16-18 September 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE International Conference on Radio-Frequency Identification Technology and Applications (IEEE RFID-TA) is a premier conference for multidisciplinary research encompassing RFID, wireless sensor networks, energy-harvesting, localization, and low-energy wireless communications.  With the conference site in Tokyo, Japan in 2015, it is expected to draw researchers from Japan, Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other Asian countries, many of whom do not regularly attend the North American IEEE RFID conference.  Approximately 150 attendees with 30 paper presentations are expected.  The NSF funds will provide partial travel support for graduate students or post-doctoral researchers who are US citizens or permanent residents to attend IEEE RFID-TA 2015 and present their work at the conference.  The IEEE Counsel on RFID has already provided some base funding for a travel grants program for student attendees.  The NSF-sponsored travel grants program will be used as a topping grant, to be awarded competitively to US citizens or permanent residents that meet the existing travel grants program requirements.  The NSF grant will provide numerous benefits to early-career US researchers, who may not otherwise be able to attend, by providing them with international networking opportunity and brightening their future prospects.  Moreover, this conference has strong industry attendance, and will allow early-career researchers the opportunity to explore collaborations with industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This student travel grant program for the IEEE RFID-TA 2015 conference allowed three US-citizen student scientists to attend and present their work at this international venue.  Brian Degnan (post-doc at Georgia Tech), Christopher Peterson (graduate student and the University of Illinois), and Christopher Gerdom (undergraduate researcher at California Polytechnic and State University) all presented work at the conference.  As an added bonus, the paper co-authored and co-presented by Christopher Peterson won the Best Student Paper Award for the conference.  Matching funds from industry were used to defray the costs of the participants, including grants from Broadcomm and the Space Solar Power Institute.  Students were further subsidized by the conference's industry partners, which are listed on the front page of the conference website (http://2015.ieee-rfid-ta.org) alongside the National Science Foundation.  Between the industry partners and the NSF funds, nearly all of the student travel costs from the US were covered.  There were even additional funds to cover student participation in a special workshop on RFID at Keio University campus following the conference.  Special curations for each of the student papers are in preparation for the IEEE Virtual Journal on RFID.  All funds have been disbursed, so the project is now considered closed.
